pub.1146543571,Patient Interest in Robotic Total Joint Arthroplasty Is Exponential: A 10-Year Google Trends Analysis,"Background: The use of robotics in arthroplasty continues to increase. Patient demand, patient expectations, and patient-directed marketing by industry and care providers each likely contributes to its increasing popularity. Trends in patient interest have not been well described. We used the online Google Trends tool to analyze trends in national public interest toward robotic and nonrobotic arthroplasty between 2011 and 2021.
Material and methods: Google Trends online was queried for search terms related to nonrobotic hip and knee arthroplasty in addition to robotic hip, robotic knee, and general robotic arthroplasty between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2021.
Results: Google Trends Data demonstrated a significant linear increase in online searches related to nonrobotic total knee and hip arthroplasty. Online search volume for robotic hip arthroplasty was significant and linear, while that of robotic knee arthroplasty was significant and exponential. When combined, robotic joint arthroplasty demonstrated an exponential trend over the 10-year period. This increase was noted to be statistically significant when compared with nonrobotic arthroplasty search volume.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that public interest in robotic total joint arthroplasty has increased significantly from 2011 through 2020. When compared with online search volume for conventional arthroplasty, this increasing growth is statistically significant. Public interest in robotic arthroplasty is anticipated to continue to increase, and care providers should be aware of this trend that impacts patient perceptions and expectations. Despite significant growth in interest for robotic arthroplasty, there is incomplete evidence supporting its use over nonrobotic arthroplasty. Additional high-quality studies are needed to inform provider decision-making and appropriately guide public interest in robot-assisted arthroplasty."

pub.1162834320,Troubleshooting Robotics During Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty,"The introduction of new surgical technology highlights appreciable concerns; robotic arthroplasty is no exception. Acquiring comprehensive understanding of the robotic technology to avoid complications during surgery and devising troubleshooting strategies to overcome potential difficulties is of paramount importance. Troubleshooting algorithms depend on the stage of the procedure and problem encountered, such as loosening of the pins or array, registration or verification problems, or malfunctioning of the device, which is rare. This article aims to outline reproducible workflows and solutions for troubleshooting during robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty."

The papers selected focused on various cost-utility measures. In addition, where appropriate, secondary aims encompassed various clinical outcomes (e.g., readmissions, discharges to subacute care, etc.). Only articles directly comparing CT-based robotic-arm assisted joint arthroplasty with manual joint arthroplasty were included, for a resulting total of 21 reports. <b>Results:</b> Almost all twenty-one studies demonstrated a positive effect of CT scan-guided robotic-assisted joint arthroplasty on health economic outcomes. For studies reporting on 90-day episodes of costs, 10 out of 12 found lower costs in the robotic-arm assisted groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> Robotic-arm assisted joint arthroplasty patients had shorter lengths of stay and cost savings based on their 90-day episodes of care, among other metrics. Payors would likely benefit from encouraging the use of this CT-based robotic technology."
pub.1170730180,Comparative analysis of acute blood loss anemia in robotic assisted vs. manual instrumented total knee arthroplasty,"Introduction: Robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty has become an increasingly popular technique over the past several years. Manual total knee arthroplasty can be associated with acute blood loss anemia. Instrumentation of the femoral canal with the alignment guide may in part contribute to this blood loss. Because the femoral canal is not entered during robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty, the blood loss may be lower compared to that seen in manual total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine if acute blood loss is greater in manually instrumented total knee arthroplasty versus robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty.
Materials and methods: This retrospective cohort study was performed in a large tertiary academic hospital network by two fellowship trained surgeons. Patients underwent either robotic assisted or manually instrumented total knee arthroplasty and were assessed for postoperative acute blood loss anemia, defined as hemoglobin <13 g/dL for males or <12 g/dL for females plus a 2 g/dL drop from preoperative levels, as well as postoperative drop in hemoglobin.
Results: A total of 75 patients were included in each study arm. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in postoperative hemoglobin in robotic assisted (2.1 g/dL) compared to manually instrumented total knee arthroplasty (2.1 g/dL). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative acute blood loss anemia between robotic assisted (45 %) and manually instrumented total knee arthroplasty (39 %). Higher BMI and increased age were protective against postoperative drop in hemoglobin. These protective effects were not significant when controlling for confounding variables. Surgical time was significantly longer for robotic assisted (99 min) versus manually instrumented total knee arthroplasty (86 min) (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: There is no significant difference in acute blood loss when comparing patients undergoing robotic assisted and manually instrumented total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1160031883,Robotic technology in total knee arthroplasty,"Key factors for successful total knee arthroplasty include accurate implant positioning with precise tibial and femoral resection, combined with appropriate soft tissue balancing to achieve the desired alignment. Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty allows surgeons to execute pre-planned strategies with precision, with growing evidence suggesting that robotic-assisted-total knee arthroplasty reduces radiological outliers. This has yet to be proven to translate into long-term improvements in patient-reported outcomes and implant survivorship. Robotic-assisted-total knee arthroplasty systems can be divided into fully autonomous and semi-autonomous systems. While fully autonomous systems showed initial promise, semi-autonomous systems are gaining popularity with encouraging early outcomes suggesting improved radiological and clinical outcomes, although concerns remain regarding a significant learning curve, installation costs, radiation exposure and cost associated with preoperative imaging. The future of total knee arthroplasty seems certain to involve robotic technology, although to what degree and in what capacity will depend on further high-quality studies assessing long-term outcomes, complications, survivorship and cost-benefit analyses."
pub.1165260244,"Adoption of robotics in arthroplasty- a survey of perceptions, utilization and challenges with technology amongst Indian surgeons","Introduction: Total joint replacement surgeries are standard procedures for managing end-stage hip or knee arthritis. Despite advances in technology, some patients experience dissatisfaction after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Robotic technology has evolved significantly and has shown promise in improving component positioning, alignment, and surgical outcomes. However, the widespread adoption of robotics in arthroplasty faces challenges such as high costs, a steep learning curve, and limited evidence on long-term outcomes.
Methods: This cross-sectional observational study used a structured self-administered online survey to assess the perceptions of Indian arthroplasty surgeons regarding robotic technology. The survey included questions about the surgeon's background, experience, perceptions of robotic joint replacement, and limiting factors for robotic usage. A total of 417 responses were collected from practising arthroplasty surgeons.
Results: Most participants(78.1 %) expressed a willingness to adopt robotics in their arthroplasty practice if the cost of installation was reduced. Robotic users were more convinced about the benefits of robotics, including improved alignment, reduced pain, faster rehabilitation, and better outcomes. High-volume robotic surgeons demonstrated a greater belief in the broader potential of robotics beyond implant positioning and alignment. The major barriers to adoption were the high cost of installation and limited insurance coverage for robotic-assisted procedures. Lack of formal robotic training opportunities, resistance from corporate management, patient acceptance issues, and limited published literature supporting robotic advantages were also cited as limiting factors.
Conclusion: Robotic technology is increasingly being adopted in India for TKA. The main obstacle to widespread adoption is the high cost of installation. As technology costs decrease, we can expect a rise in the number of installations across the country. Advocacy from national orthopaedic organizations may be needed to address insurance reimbursement challenges. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the perceptions and challenges associated with the adoption of robotic technology in arthroplasty in India."
pub.1171285324,Can Robotic Arm‐assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Remain Cost‐effective in Volume‐based Procurement System in China? A Markov Model‐based Study,"OBJECTIVE: The volume based procurement (VBP) program in China was initiated in 2022. The cost-effectiveness of robotic arm assisted total knee arthroplasty is yet uncertain after the initiation of the program. The objective of the study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty and the influence of the VBP program to its cost-effectiveness in China.
METHODS: The study was a Markov model-based cost-effectiveness study. Cases of primary total knee arthroplasty from January 2019 to December 2021 were included retrospectively. A Markov model was developed to simulate patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis. Manual and robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasties were compared for cost-effectiveness before and after the engagement of the VBP program in China. Probability and sensitivity analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty showed better recovery and lower revision rates before and after initiation of the VBP program. Robotic arm-based TKA was superior to manual total knee arthroplasty, with an increased effectiveness of 0.26 (16.87 vs 16.61) before and 0.52 (16.96 vs 16.43) after the application of Volume-based procurement, respectively. The procedure is more cost-effective in the new procurement system (17.13 vs 16.89). Costs of manual or robotic arm-assisted TKA were the most sensitive parameters in our model.
CONCLUSION: Based on previous and current medical charging systems in China, robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty is a more cost-effective procedure compared to traditional manual total knee arthroplasty. As the volume-based procurement VBP program shows, the procedure can be more cost-effective."
pub.1153239270,Segmental Acetabular Defects Managed by Augments in Conjunction with CT During Robotic Total Hip Arthroplasty,"CASES: We present 2 robotic-assisted hip arthroplasty cases with significant segmental acetabular defects that could compromise cup fixation. We outline an algorithmic planning approach on a computed tomography (CT)-based platform to address these defects by predicting augmentation needs, when component adjustments alone are inadequate, and describe the novel combination of augments in conjunction with robotic-assisted hip arthroplasty.
CONCLUSION: CT-based robotic-assisted hip arthroplasty is a powerful tool to assess and address acetabular deficiencies. Rudimentary augment planning extracts additional value out of the preoperative CT. However, there remains room for intelligent assessment of hip centers and for deliberate augment planning and execution."
pub.1164421301,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty improved component alignment in the coronal plane compared with navigation-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a comparative study,"The purpose of this study was to directly compare implant placement accuracy and postoperative limb alignment between robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty and navigation-assisted total knee arthroplasty. This retrospective case–control study included a consecutive series of 182 knees (robotic-assisted group, n = 103 knees; navigation-assisted group, n = 79). An image-free handheld robotic system (NAVIO) or an image-free navigation system (Precision N) was used. Component and limb alignment were evaluated on three-dimensional computed tomography scans and full-length standing anterior–posterior radiographs. We compared the errors between the final intraoperative plan and the postoperative coronal and sagittal alignment of the components and the hip–knee–ankle angle between the two groups. The orientation of the femoral and tibial components in the coronal plane were more accurate in the robotic-assisted group than in the navigation-assisted group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the orientation of the femoral and tibial component in the sagittal plane between the two groups. There were fewer outliers in the tibial coronal plane in the robotic-assisted group (p < 0.05). There was also no significant difference in the frequency of outlying values for coronal or sagittal alignment of the femoral component or sagittal alignment of the tibial component or the hip–knee–ankle angle between the two groups. Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty using a handheld image-free system improved component alignment in the coronal plane compared with total knee arthroplasty using an image-free navigation system. Robotic surgery helps surgeons to achieve personalised alignment that may result in better clinical outcomes."

The application of RAUKA is expected to increase because of its advantages over conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. This review article provides an overview of RAUKA, encompassing the historical development of the procedure, the features of the robotic arm and navigation systems, and the characteristics of contemporary RAUKA. The article also includes a comparison between conventional unicompartmental arthroplasty and RAUKA, as well as a discussion of current challenges and future advancements in the field of RAUKA."
pub.1174523263,Robotic arthroplasty software training improves understanding of total knee arthroplasty alignment and balancing principles: a randomized controlled trial,"Understanding alignment and gap balancing in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) can be challenging for trainee and experienced orthopedic surgeons. Traditional learning methods may not effectively translate to real-life scenarios. The advent of advanced technologies like robotic surgery and navigation systems has revolutionized intraoperative understanding of gap balancing techniques. This trial aims to investigate the effectiveness of robotic TKA planning software in educating trainees about alignment and ligament balancing. We hypothesize that a single session with the software will significantly enhance trainees’ understanding of these techniques. This UK-based single-center, two-arm, group parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted during a national robotic arthroplasty symposium. It aims to evaluate the effect of robotic knee arthroplasty software training on understanding TKA alignment and gap balancing principles using Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). The MCQ test was crafted based on established guidelines from a different institution with expert consensus in the field. Our study revealed that baseline knowledge of gap balancing and alignment principles was generally low among all participants. However, the intervention group, which received comprehensive robotic software training, demonstrated a significant improvement in their MCQ scores compared to the control group, which did not undergo the training. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that robotic arthroplasty software training significantly improves the understanding of TKA alignment and balancing principles among orthopedic trainees.

pub.1159788042,A Bibliometric Analysis of the Top 100 Most Influential Studies on Robotic Arthroplasty,"Background: The use of robotics in arthroplasty surgery has increased substantially in recent years. The purpose of this study was to objectively identify the 100 most influential studies in the robotic arthroplasty literature and to conduct a bibliometric analysis of these studies to describe their key characteristics.
Methods: The Clarivate Analytics Web of Knowledge database was used to gather data and metrics for robotic arthroplasty research using Boolean queries. The search list was sorted in descending order by the number of citations, and articles were included or excluded based on clinical relevance to robotic arthroplasty.
Results: The top 100 studies were cited a total of 5770 times from 1997 to 2021, with rapid growth in both citation generation and the number of articles published occurring in the past 5 years. The top 100 robotic arthroplasty articles originated from 12 countries, with the United States being responsible for almost half of the top 100. The most common study types were comparative studies (36) followed by case series (20), and the most common levels of evidence were III (23) and IV (33).
Conclusions: Research on robotic arthroplasty is rapidly growing and originates from a wide variety of countries, academic institutions, and with significant industry influence. This article serves as a reference to direct orthopaedic practitioners to the 100 most influential studies in robotic arthroplasty. We hope that these 100 studies and the analysis we provide aid healthcare professionals in efficiently assessing consensus, trends, and needs within the field."
pub.1158483848,Technological innovations in shoulder replacement: current concepts and the future of robotics in total shoulder arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) has been rapidly evolving over the last several decades, with innovative technological strategies being investigated and developed in order to achieve optimal component precision and joint alignment and stability, preserve implant longevity, and improve patient outcomes. Future advancements such as robotic-assisted surgeries, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) and other peri- and preoperative planning tools will continue to revolutionize TSA. Robotic-assisted arthroplasty is a novel and increasingly popular alternative to the conventional arthroplasty procedure in the hip and knee but has not yet been investigated in the shoulder. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a narrative review of the literature on the evolution and projected trends of technological advances and robotic assistance in total shoulder arthroplasty.
METHODS: A narrative synthesis method was employed for this review, rather than a meta-analysis or systematic review of the literature. This decision was based on 2 primary factors: (1) the lack of eligible, peer-reviewed studies with high-quality level of evidence available for review on robotic-assisted shoulder arthroplasty, and (2) a narrative review allows for a broader scope of content analysis, including a comprehensive review of all technological advances-including robotics-within the field of TSA. A general literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. These databases were queried by 2 independent reviewers from database inception through November 11, 2022, for all articles investigating the role of robotics and technology assistance in total shoulder arthroplasty. Inclusion criteria included studies describing ""shoulder arthroplasty"" and ""robotics.""
RESULTS: After exclusion criteria were applied, 4 studies on robotic-assisted TSA were described in the review. Given the novelty of this technology and limited data on robotics in TSA, these studies consisted of a literature review, nonvalidated experimental biomechanical studies in sawbones models, and preclinical proof-of-concept cadaveric studies using prototype robotic technology primarily in conjunction with PSI. The remaining studies described the technological advancements in TSA, including PSI, computer-assisted navigation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Although not yet commercially available, robotic-assisted TSA confers the theoretical advantages of precise humeral head cuts for restoration of proximal humerus anatomy, more accurate glenoid preparation, and improved soft-tissue assessment in limited early studies.
CONCLUSION: The evidence for the use of robotics in total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty demonstrates improved component accuracy, more precise radiographic measurements, and improved early/mid-term patient-reported and functional outcomes."
pub.1158663770,Reverse coronal deformity: use of robotic total knee arthroplasty for identification and correction,"BackgroundDespite continued advances in techniques and implant designs, a population of patients who are dissatisfied after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains. During robotic-assisted arthroplasty, real-time intraoperative assessment of patient knee alignment is performed. Here, we assess the prevalence of an under-appreciated deformity, reverse coronal deformity (RCD), and the benefits of utilizing robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty to help correct this dynamic deformity.MethodsA retrospective study evaluating patients undergoing robotic-assisted cruciate-retaining TKA was performed. Intraoperative measurements were obtained using tibial and femoral arrays to assess coronal plane deformity at full extension and at 90° flexion. RCD was defined as ≥ 2° varus in knee extension that reversed to ≥ 2° valgus in flexion, or vice-versa. Coronal plane deformity was then reassessed after robotic-assisted bony resection and implant placement.ResultsOf 204 patients that underwent TKA, 16 patients (7.8%) were found to have RCD, with 14 patients (87.5%) transitioning from varus in extension to valgus in flexion. The average coronal deformity was 7.75°, with a maximum of 12°. These improved to an average coronal change of 0.93° post-TKA. Final medial and lateral gaps were all balanced to within 1° in extension and flexion. Another 34 patients (16.7%) had ≥ 5° change in coronal plane deformity from extension to flexion (average 6.39°), however, did not experience a reversal of their coronal deformity. Outcomes were assessed with KOOS Jr. scores postoperatively.ConclusionComputer and robotic assistance were utilized to demonstrate the prevalence of RCD. We also demonstrated accurate identification and successfully balancing of RCD utilizing robotic-assisted TKA. An increased awareness of these dynamic deformities could aid surgeons in proper gap balancing even in the absence of navigation and robotic-assisted surgery."
pub.1171441986,Evaluating the cost of robotic-assisted total and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"As uptake of robotic-assisted arthroplasty increases there is a need for economic evaluation of the implementation and ongoing costs associated with robotic surgery. The aims of this study were to describe the in-hospital cost of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) and robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RA-UKA) and determine the influence of patient characteristics and surgical outcomes on cost. This prospective cohort study included adult patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing primary unilateral RA-TKA and RA-UKA, at a tertiary hospital in Sydney between April 2017 and June 2021. Patient characteristics, surgical outcomes, and in-hospital cost variables were extracted from hospital medical records. Differences between outcomes for RA-TKA and RA-UKA were compared using independent sample t-tests. Logistic regression was performed to determine drivers of cost. Of the 308 robotic-assisted procedures, 247 were RA-TKA and 61 were RA-UKA. Surgical time, time in the operating room, and length of stay were significantly shorter in RA-UKA (p < 0.001); whereas RA-TKA patients were older (p = 0.002) and more likely to be discharged to in-patient rehabilitation (p = 0.009). Total in-hospital cost was significantly higher for RA-TKA cases (AU$18580.02 vs $13275.38; p < 0.001). Robotic system and maintenance cost per case was AU$3867.00 for TKA and AU$5008.77 for UKA. Patients born overseas and lower volume robotic surgeons were significantly associated with higher total cost of RA-UKA. Increasing age and male gender were significantly associated with higher total cost of RA-TKA. Total cost was significantly higher for RA-TKA than RA-UKA. Robotic system costs for RA-UKA are inflated by the software cost relative to the volume of cases compared with RA-TKA. Cost is an important consideration when evaluating long term benefits of robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty in future studies to provide evidence for the economic sustainability of this practice."
pub.1171020135,Postoperative Communication Volume Following Total Joint Arthroplasty Can Be a Precursor for Emergency Department Visits,"Background: Unplanned calls, messages, and visits to the clinic can occur at a higher rate as newer technologies allow patients more accessibility and connectivity to clinicians. By reviewing postoperative patient phone calls and electronic portal messages, we compared the methods and frequency of communications between conventional and robotic joint arthroplasty cases.
Methods: A retrospective review of total hip, total knee, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty procedures by fellowship-trained adult reconstruction surgeons at our hospitals between 2017 and 2022 was performed. Any unplanned postoperative communication within 30 days of the postoperative period and unplanned emergency department visits were collected.
Results: There were 12,300 robotic and manual consecutive primary total hip, total knee, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty procedures performed on 10,908 patients over the study period. A total of 905 (40.4%) patients and 2012 (23.2%) patients sent an electronic text message (ETM) in the robotic and manual arthroplasty cohorts (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001), respectively. Overall, 1942 (86.6%) patients in the robotic arthroplasty group and 6417 (74%) patients in the manual arthroplasty group had at least one phone call within the first month after their joint arthroplasty.
Conclusions: Robotic arthroplasty patients place an increased demand on the orthopaedic surgery department in terms of unplanned patient contacts. Robotic arthroplasty patients had a significantly increased rate of unplanned postoperative ETMs and phone calls when compared to manual arthroplasty patients. An increased number of postoperative phone calls, but not ETMs, can also be indicative of an emergency department visit. These findings can be used in the perioperative setting to counsel and educate patients about expectations."
pub.1156563837,Incidental findings on CT scans for robot‐assisted total joint arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: This study documented the incidence of incidental findings from preoperative computerized-tomography (CT) scans obtained for robotic-arm-assisted total joint arthroplasty (TJA) and its effect on patient management.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted for patients who underwent robotic-arm assisted primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from 2016 to 2020. All patients obtained preoperative CT scans which were formally read by fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists. CT's were flagged with incidental findings and those requiring physician follow-up were identified as significant.
RESULTS: A total of 1519 patients (mean age, 66 years ±9; 849 females) were evaluated. Seventy-three (4.81%) patients had incidental CT scan findings, and 25 (1.65%) patients had significant incidental findings. Four patients required additional imaging and two patients required intervention.
CONCLUSION: This study found a 4.81% incidence of incidental findings from preoperative CT scans for robotic-arm-assisted THA and TKA. Of these findings, less than 2% required physician follow-up and less than 1% required intervention. With the increasing popularity of robotic-arm assisted total joint arthroplasty, it is important to consider the necessity of detection and management of associated incidental findings from preoperative CT scans."
pub.1170030939,Robotic-Assisted Hip and Knee Arthroplasty: A Bibliometric Analysis Using the Scopus Database,"Robotic-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty represents cutting-edge advancements in orthopedic surgery, harnessing robotic technology to enhance precision, improve clinical outcomes, and facilitate intra-operative procedures. In these robotic-assisted surgeries, the robotic systems assist surgeons in planning and executing joint replacement surgeries, thereby facilitating personalized implant positioning and optimizing the fit and alignment of hip and knee implants. Despite the increasing attention garnered by robotic-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty in recent years, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis using the Scopus database has yet to be conducted. This bibliometric analysis reviews the Scopus database from 1961 until 2022 to investigate the literature on the field of robotic-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty. A total of 577 articles that satisfied the selection criteria were included in this review. The majority of the articles focus more on total knee replacement, compared to total hip replacement and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. The overwhelming majority of the articles were authored by researchers and clinicians from the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK). Similarly, most of the articles with the highest number of citations were authored by researchers and clinicians from these regions. This comprehensive bibliometric analysis using Scopus in the domain of robotic-assisted hip and knee replacement has the potential to act as a roadmap for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, facilitating informed decision-making, promoting collaborative initiatives, and guiding the development of future studies to further advance the field of robotic-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty."
pub.1146447662,Adverse Events Associated With Robotic-Assisted Joint Arthroplasty: An Analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration MAUDE Database,"BACKGROUND: The use of robotic assistance in arthroplasty is increasing; however, the spectrum of adverse events potentially associated with this technology is unclear. Improved understanding of the causes of adverse events in robotic-assisted arthroplasty can prevent future incidents and enhance patient outcomes.
METHODS: Adverse event reports to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database involving robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and partial knee arthroplasty were reviewed to determine causes of malfunction and related patient impact.
RESULTS: Overall, 263 adverse event reports were included. The most frequently reported adverse events were unexpected robotic arm movement for TKA (59/204, 28.9%) and retained registration checkpoint for THA (19/44, 43.2%). There were 99 reports of surgical delay with an average delay of 20 minutes (range 1-120). Thirty-one cases reported conversion to manual surgery. In total, 68 patient injuries were reported, 7 of which required surgical reintervention. Femoral notching (12/36, 33.3%) was the most common for TKA and retained registration checkpoint (19/28, 67.9%) was the most common for THA. Although rare, additional reported injuries included femoral, tibial, and acetabular fractures, MCL laceration, additional retained foreign bodies, and an electrical burn.
CONCLUSION: Despite the increasing utilization of robotic-assisted arthroplasty in the United States, numerous adverse events are possible and technical difficulties experienced intraoperatively can result in prolonged surgical delays. The events reported herein seem to indicate that robotic-assisted arthroplasty is generally safe with only a few reported instances of serious complications, the nature of which seems more related to suboptimal surgical technique than technology. Based on our data, the practice of adding registration checkpoints and bone pins to the instrument count of all robotic-assisted TJA cases should be widely implemented to avoid unintended retained foreign objects."
pub.1156955383,Robotic-assisted unicompartimental knee arthroplasty performed with Navio system: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Robotic-assisted arthroplasty is a relatively modern concept, quickly arising in its use. The aim of this systematic review is to assess, according to the existing literature, which are the functional and clinical outcomes and component positioning and implant survivorship of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty surgery performed using an image-free hand-held robotic system. Moreover, we analyzed whether there are significant differences and advantages compared to conventional surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review has been performed on studies published between 2004 and 2021, on the electronic library databases, according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. The inclusion criteria were all studies described as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty performed with the Navio robotic system.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included, and 1,262 unicondylar knee arthroplasties were analyzed. These studies showed a satisfactory recovery of joint function, with a good range of motion (extension <5° and flexion which ranged from 105° to 130.3°) in patients of the NAVIO group. The revision rate was <2% while the infection rate <1%; no postoperative transfusion was needed in all UKA implanted.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a robotic tool for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) could lead to a better implant positioning and joint alignment than conventional surgery. There is still limited evidence to support that the use of this robot in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is a greater survivorship than other systems or conventional techniques; therefore, a long-term follow-up is needed."

The robotic-assisted system has been shown to enhance the accuracy of preoperative planning and improve reproducibility in primary arthroplasty surgeries. The aim of this paper was to describe the surgical technique for robotic-assisted revision total knee arthroplasty and the potential benefits of this technique.MethodThis single-centre retrospective study included a total of 19 patients recruited from April 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022. Inclusion criteria were patients who had Mako™ robotic-assisted revision total knee arthroplasty done within the study period with a more than 6 months follow-up. Statistical analysis was done using Microsoft Excel 16.0.ResultsAll 19 patients were followed up for 6 to 18 months. All patients in this study had uneventful recoveries without needing any re-revision surgery when reviewed to date.ConclusionWith the development of dedicated revision total knee software, robot-assisted revision TKA can be a promising technique that may improve surgical outcomes by increasing the accuracy of implant placement, and soft tissue protection and achieving a better well-balanced knee."
pub.1144409783,Does robotic technology successfully restore the joint line after total knee arthroplasty? A retrospective analysis,"BackgroundOur study aims to determine the effectiveness of robotic technology for total knee arthroplasty in the successful restoration of the joint line of the knee with respect to that of a normal human anatomical knee. The restoration of the joint line is an important technical goal on which the postoperative outcomes and the success of the surgery depend.MethodsSixty-four postoperative plain anteroposterior radiographs of 60 patients, who received total knee arthroplasty by using the robotic technology were analyzed and compared with 66 similar radiographs of 60 patients who received the conventional method. The distances of the lateral epicondyle to the joint line (LEJL) and proximal tibiofibular joint to the joint line (PTFJJL) were calculated and analyzed.ResultsWe found that the mean value of LEJL minus PTFJJL in the robotic group was 0.334 ± 0.115 (mean ± SD), while in the conventional group, it was 2.304 ± 0.308. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant. The mean ratio (LEJL:PTFJJL) in the robotic group was also equal to 1.017 ± 0.042.ConclusionFrom these findings it could be concluded that the robotic technology significantly increases the accuracy of the total knee arthroplasty and, compared to the conventional method, achieves an almost anatomical position of the joint line."
pub.1166097687,Mako® Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: Avoiding Impingement with Updated THA Software.,"The use of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty and three-dimensional computed tomography scan-based templating has become increasingly popular over the last 10 years. However, proper planning and execution are vital to producing optimal patient outcomes. In order to achieve these outcomes, the robotic-assisted system requires training, familiarity, and experience. The goal of this article is to provide clear and condensed examples of preoperative planning, as well as adjustments that one can make to avoid impingement. The surgical technique for robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty is also briefly discussed. Examples will be given using the latest computed tomography (CT) scan-based robotic platform for osteoarthritic hips, with specific examples of various cases of impingement that might be encountered by the surgeon and how to ultimately avoid this problem when performing the arthroplasty. This article, through case histories, will discuss the various principles and adjustments that can be made to place components in the ideal location based on individual anatomy."

We aimed to review our early results using the image-free robotic-assisted technology in knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: A total of 71 patients suffering from end-stage OA knee receiving TKA operated by robotic-assisted surgery between the years 2018 and mid-2021 were recruited. Clinical and radiological outcomes were compared with age and sex-matched control group (conventional TKA).
RESULTS: The radiological outcome showed significantly more postoperative lower limb alignment outliers in conventional side than robotic-assisted sides. Postoperative knee scores were similar among both groups. Robotic-assisted TKA required a longer implantation time but a shorter hospital stay.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted TKA achieved a lower rate of mechanical axis Outlier in the coronal and sagittal plane with a shorter hospital stay. Yet both methods achieve a similar functional outcome."

pub.1146343341,Fracture through tracking pin sites following a robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"The use of computer-navigated, robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is expanding as the result of widespread efforts to improve the precision of implant placement and to restore mechanical, anatomic, and kinematic alignment. The procedure requires placement of femoral and tibial pins to mount the robotic tracking system. Fractures through tracking pin sites following robotic-assisted TKA are rare; only 30 cases have been reported to our knowledge. It is probable that this complication will become more frequent as the use of robotic-assisted TKAs continues to grow. We report the case of a 67-year-old female who suffered a fracture of the femur through two pin sites 3 months after a robotic-assisted TKA. We believe that this report is the first case in the radiologic literature. Our case demonstrates some of the difficulties of recognizing this complication and raises questions about appropriate post-operative imaging."
pub.1171383985,Robotic assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is not associated with increased patient satisfaction: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"PurposeTotal knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common orthopedic surgery, yet postoperative dissatisfaction persists in around 20% of cases. Robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) promises enhanced precision, but its impact on patient satisfaction compared to conventional TKA remains controversial (cTKA). This systematic review aims to evaluate patient satisfaction post-rTKA and compare outcomes with cTKA.MethodsPapers from the following databases were identified and reviewed: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Online Library, using keywords like ""Knee replacement,"" ""Total knee arthroplasty,"" ""Robotic,"" and ""Patient satisfaction."" Extracted data included patient satisfaction measures, Knee Society Score, Oxford Knee Score, Forgotten Joint Score, SF-36, HSS, and KOOS. Statistical analysis, including odds ratio and 95% CI was performed using R software. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane's Q test.ResultsThe systematic review included 17 articles, involving 1148 patients (571 in the rTKA group and 577 in the cTKA group) assessing patient satisfaction following rTKA. An analysis of proportions reveals rTKA satisfaction rate was 95%, while for cTKA, it was 91%. A meta-analysis comparing rTKA and cTKA found no statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction. Additionally, various patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were examined, showing mixed results across different studies and follow-up periods.ConclusionsThe results of this study found no difference in patient satisfaction outcomes in the short to mid-term for rTKA compared to conventional methods. This study does not assert superiority for the robotic approach, highlighting the need for careful consideration of various factors influencing outcomes in knee arthroplasty."
pub.1150448665,Robotic-Arm Assisted Technology’s Impact on Knee Arthroplasty and Associated Healthcare Costs,"<b>Background:</b> The number of total knee arthroplasties (TKA) carried out globally is expected to substantially rise in the coming decades. Consequently, focus has been increasing on improving surgical techniques and minimizing expenses. Robotic arm-assisted knee arthroplasty has garnered interest to reduce surgical errors and improve precision. <b>Objectives:</b> Our primary aim was to compare the episode-of-care cost up to 90 days for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and TKA performed before and after the introduction of robotic arm-assisted technology. The secondary aim was to compare the volume of UKA vs TKA. <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective study design at a single healthcare system. For the cost analysis, we excluded patients with bilateral knee arthroplasty, body mass index &gt;40, postoperative infection, or noninstitutional health plan insurance. Costs were obtained through an integrated billing system and affiliated institutional insurance company. <b>Results:</b> Knee arthroplasty volume increased 28% after the introduction of robotic-assisted technology. The TKA volume increased by 17%, while the UKA volume increased 190%. Post introduction, 97% of UKA cases used robotic arm-assisted technology. The cost analysis included 178 patients (manual UKA, n = 6; robotic UKA, n = 19; manual TKA, n = 58, robotic TKA, n = 85). Robotic arm-assisted TKA and UKA were less costly in terms of patient room and operating room costs but had higher imaging, recovery room, anesthesia, and supply costs. Overall, the perioperative costs were higher for robotic UKA and TKA. Postoperative costs were lower for robotic arm-assisted surgeries, and patients used less home health and home rehabilitation. <b>Discussion:</b> Surgeons performed higher volumes of UKA, and UKA comprised a greater percentage of total surgical volume after the introduction of this technology. The selective cost analysis indicated robotic arm-assisted technology is less expensive in several cost categories but overall more expensive by up to $550 due to higher cost categories including supplies and recovery room. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings show a change in surgeons' practice to include increased incidence and volume of UKA procedures and highlights several cost-saving categories through the use of robotic arm-assisted technology. Overall, robotic arm-assisted knee arthroplasty cost more than manual techniques at our institution. This analysis will help optimize costs in the future."
pub.1147731674,Moving beyond radiographic alignment: applying the Wald Principles in the adoption of robotic total knee arthroplasty,"Abstract
The use of robotics in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is growing at an exponential rate. Despite the improved accuracy and reproducibility of robotic-assisted TKA, consistent clinical benefits have yet to be determined, with most studies showing comparable functional outcomes and survivorship between robotic and conventional techniques. Given the success and durability of conventional TKA, measurable improvements in these outcomes with robotic assistance may be difficult to prove. Efforts to optimize component alignment within two degrees of neutral may be an attainable but misguided goal. Applying the “Wald Principles” of rationalization, it is possible that robotic technology may still prove beneficial, even when equivalent clinical outcomes as conventional methods, if we look beyond the obvious surrogate measures of success. Robotic systems may help to reduce inventory, streamline surgical trays, enhance workflows and surgical efficiency, optimize soft tissue balancing, improve surgeon ergonomics, and integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms into a broader digital ecosystem. This article explores these less obvious alternative benefits of robotic surgery in the field of TKA."
pub.1175371231,Malunion of a Floating Knee: Overcoming the Challenges of Extra-articular Deformities With a Robotic-Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Extra-articular deformities (EAD) can pose a challenge to surgeons during a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. Obtaining an acceptable post-operative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle may be difficult, especially in a limb with multiplanar deformities of both the femur and the tibia.  Our case is about a 66-year-old gentleman with a long-term deformity of his right lower limb secondary to malunion of the right femoral shaft and tibial shaft fractures. He initially presented with a right floating knee injury, 45 years ago, which was managed with conservative measures. He subsequently presented to us with ipsilateral knee osteoarthritis and underwent a robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty surgery. Robotic- or computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty is an actively developing area and is gaining popularity among arthroplasty surgeons. In cases with severe extra-articular deformities such as in this case, robotic-assisted surgery can be superior to conventional surgery."
pub.1172271864,Robotic-assisted patellofemoral arthroplasty provides excellent implant survivorship and high patient satisfaction at mid-term follow-up,"PurposeRobotic adoption in knee surgery has yielded several benefits, but its application in patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) remains barely reported. The purpose of this study was to determine implant survival, patient satisfaction, and functional outcomes after robotic-assisted PFA at an intermediate follow-up.MethodsThis prospective analysis targeted 18 knees of 16 consecutive patients who underwent robot-aided PFA with three-year minimum follow-up (range, 3 to 6 years). Each patient was evaluated collecting pre-operative and post-operative medical record data, including range of motion, radiographic images, and multiple scores, such as VAS, APKS, and OKS.ResultsAt surgery, the mean age was 55.4 years ± 14.4 (range, 32 to 78 years), and the mean BMI was 26.8 kg/m² ±5.2 (range, 20 to 36). Etiologies of patellofemoral osteoarthritis included idiopathic degeneration (28%), post-traumatic (33%), and dysplasia (39%). Pre-implantation scores were VAS 7.9 ± 1.4, AKPS 34.6 ± 23.3, and OKS 17.3 ± 10.3. One implant was revised with primary total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis progression. Clinical and radiographic follow-up showed no signs of loosening or infection. The maximum flexion reached an average of 131.1°±10.5° (range, 110° to 145°), accompanied by significantly improved score results (P-value < 0.01): VAS 1.1 ± 1.4, AKPS 90.2 ± 8.6, and OKS 46.3 ± 1.8.ConclusionsAt 3 years after robotic assisted patellofemoral arthroplasty, excellent implant survival and patient satisfaction rates can be expected along with significantly improved functional and pain control outcomes. Although the limitations imposed by the restricted cohort, these findings indicate that robotic assistance in PFA is both safe and effective at intermediate follow-up."
pub.1167201993,Robotic-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty: Insights and Implications From Current Literature,"Robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty has emerged as a promising development, aiming to enhance surgical precision and patient outcomes. This literature review examines the clinical efficacy, cost implications, environmental impact, and potential of telesurgery in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) and robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RAUKA) relative to conventional techniques. A thorough literature search was conducted across medical databases. Clinical and radiological outcomes of RATKA and RAUKA were extracted and analyzed. Direct costs, operating time, surgeon learning curve, environmental implications, and the futuristic concept of telesurgery were also considered. Subjective patient assessments such as WOMAC, Oxford Knee Score, and SF-36, alongside objective measures like HSS score and KSS, were commonly used. Radiological parameters like hip-knee-ankle (HKA) and femorotibial angle provided insights into post-operative alignment. Evidence indicated sporadic high-level design studies, often with limited samples. Cost remains a major constraint with robotic systems, though high-volume cases might offset expenses. Environmental assessments revealed robotic surgeries generate a higher carbon footprint. Telesurgery, an evolving field, could transcend geographical boundaries but is not without challenges, including high costs, latency issues, and cyber threats. While robotic-assisted surgeries may hold promise in the future, substantial barriers, including acquisition costs, potential surgeon deskilling, and environmental concerns, need addressing. Greater robot utilization may drive costs down with more competitors entering the market. Continued research, especially multi-center RCTs, is pivotal to solidifying the role of robotic systems in knee arthroplasty."

METHODS: Fifty consecutive posterior-stabilised (PS) robotic TKA and 50 case-controlled PS navigated TKA were enroled. Bone resection thickness, rate of minimal thickness insert usage, and postoperative flexion contracture over 5° were statistically compared.
RESULTS: The tibial bone resection thickness was significantly thinner in robotic TKA. The insert thickness was significantly lower, and the rate of minimal thickness insert usage was significantly higher in robotic TKA. The ROM at 3 months postoperatively and the rate of postoperative flexion contracture were comparable between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Robotic TKA can reduce the tibial bone resection thickness and increase the rate of minimal thickness insert usage without increasing postoperative flexion contracture as compared with navigated TKA."

As part of a retrospective study of a consecutive series of patients over a 3-year period, 211 patients (102 traditional; 109 robotic) between 2013 and 2016 who underwent posterior-lateral THA were reviewed. Hip offset was measured on preoperative and postoperative anterior-posterior (AP) pelvis radiographs. The absolute change in total hip offset was higher in patients undergoing non-robotic THA than in patients undergoing robotic THA (5.98 ± 4.47 mm vs 4.33 ± 3.98 mm; p = 0.008). The rate of symptomatic trochanteric bursitis (p = 0.02) and cortisone injection was higher in non-robotic THA patients than in robotic THA patients (p = 0.002). Robotic arm-assisted THA is associated with a decreased postoperative change in hip offset, incidence of symptomatic trochanteric bursitis, and bursal steroid injections.

pub.1167260249,Robotic-assisted versus conventional total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"ObjectivesRobotic knee arthroplasty procedures have emerged as a new trend, garnering attention from orthopedic surgeons globally. It has been hypothesized that the use of robotics enhances the accuracy of prosthesis positioning and alignment restoration. The objective of this study was to provide a high-level, evidence-based comparison between robotic total knee replacements and conventional methods, focusing on radiological and functional outcomes.MethodsWe searched five databases from their inception until June 1, 2022, specifically targeting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the outcomes of robotic and conventional total knee replacements. We were interested in outcomes such as knee range of motion, clinical and function knee society scores, the Western Ontario and McMaster University score (WOMAC), the Hospital of Special Surgery score, complications, and radiological alignment. This review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes guidelines. We assessed the risk of bias using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2).ResultsOur search returned seven RCTs suitable for our analysis, which included a total of 1942 knees; 974 of these knees were implanted using robotic arms while the remaining 968 utilized jig-based knee systems. Our findings indicated that robotic knees had significantly better post-operative anatomical (OR − 0.82; 95% CI, − 1.027 to − 0.58, p value < 0.00001) and mechanical restoration (OR − 0.95; 95% CI, − 1.49 to − 0.41, p value < 0.0006). While knee range of motion (OR − 2.23; 95% CI − 4.89–0.43, p value 0.1) and femoral prosthesis position (OR − 0.98; 95% CI, − 2.03–0.08, p value 0.07) also favored robotic knees, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Both clinical and functional outcomes, as well as the rate of complications, were found to be statistically similar between the groups undergoing robotic and traditional knee replacement surgeries.ConclusionThis meta-analysis indicates that robotic total knee replacements offer superior post-operative anatomical and mechanical alignment compared to conventional total knee replacements. Despite this, clinical and functional outcomes, as well as complication rates, were similar between the two. These findings should be considered in light of potential confounding factors. More randomized controlled trials with the latest robotic systems are needed to confirm any superior functional and clinical outcomes from robotic-assisted surgeries.Level of evidenceI."
pub.1149653038,The learning curve in robotic assisted knee arthroplasty is flattened by the presence of a surgeon experienced with robotic assisted surgery,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the learning curve associated with robotic assisted knee arthroplasty (RAS KA). Therefore, the evaluation of the influence of an experienced surgeon on the overall team performance of three surgeons regarding the learning curve in RAS KA was investigated. It was hypothesized that the presence of an experienced surgeon flattens the learning curve and that there was no inflection point for the learning curve of the surgical team.
METHODS: Fifty-five cases consisting of 31 total knee arthroplasties (TKA) and 24 unicompartmental arthroplasties (UKA) performed by three surgeons during 2021 were prospectively investigated. Single surgeon and team performance for operation time learning curve and inflection points were investigated using cumulative sum analysis (CUSUM).
RESULTS: A downward trend line for individual surgeons and the team performance regarding the operation time learning curve was observed. No inflexion point was observed for the overall team performance regarding TKA and UKA. The surgeon that performed all cases with the assistance of the experienced surgeon had significantly shorter surgical times than the surgeon that only occasionally received assistance from the experienced surgeon (p = 0.004 TKA; p = 0.002 UKA).
CONCLUSION: The presence of an experienced surgeon in robotically assisted knee arthroplasty can flatten the learning curve of the surgical team formerly unexperienced in robotic assisted systems. Manufacturers should provide expanded support during initial cases in centres without previous experience to robotic assisted knee arthroplasty.

pub.1174523267,Real-world accuracy of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty and its impact on expedited recovery,"Despite total knee arthroplasty (TKA) being the gold standard for end-stage knee osteoarthritis, 20% of patients remain dissatisfied. Robotic-assisted arthroplasty promises unparalleled control of the accuracy of bone cuts, implant positioning, control of gap balance, and resultant hip–knee–ankle (HKA) axis. Patients underwent clinical and radiological assessments, including knee CT scans and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), preoperatively. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-operatively, with imaging repeated at 6 weeks. A total of 155 patients underwent robotic-assisted TKA and have completed 3 months of follow-up. Mean pre-operative HKA axis was 7.39 ± 5.52 degrees varus, improving to 1.34 ± 2.22 degrees varus post-operatively. Restoration of HKA axis was 0.76 ± 1.9 degrees from intra-operative planning (p < 0.0005). Implant placement accuracy in the coronal plane was 0.08 ± 1.36 degrees (p = 0.458) for the femoral component and 0.71 ± 1.3 degrees (p < 0.0005) for the tibial component. Rotational alignment mean deviation was 0.39 ± 1.49 degrees (p = 0.001). Most patients (98.1%) had ≤ 2 mm difference in extension–flexion gaps. PROM scores showed improvement and exceeded pre-operative scores by 6 weeks post-surgery.

pub.1154909446,Robotic-assisted revision total joint arthroplasty: a state-of-the-art scoping review,"Background: During the past decades, robotic-assisted technology has experienced an incredible advancement in the field of total joint arthroplasty (TJA), which demonstrated promise in improving the accuracy and precision of implantation and alignment in both primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, revision TJA remains a technically challenging procedure with issues of large-scale bone defects and damage to nearby anatomical structures. Thus, surgeons are trying to harness the abilities of robotic-assisted technology for revision TJA surgery.
Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were comprehensively searched to identify relevant publications that reported the application of robotic-assisted technology in revision TJA.
Results: Overall, ten studies reported the use of the robotic system in revision TJA, including active (ROBODOC) and semi-active (MAKO and NAVIO) systems. One clinical case reported conversion from hip fusion to THA, and three studies reported revision from primary THA to revision THA. Moreover, four studies reported that robotic-assisted technology is helpful in revising unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to TKA, and two case reports converted primary TKA to revision TKA. In this study, we present the latest evolvements, applications, and technical obstacles of robotic-assisted technology in the revision of TJA and the current state-of-the-art.
Conclusion: Current available evidence suggests that robotic-assisted technology may help surgeons to reproducibly perform preoperative plans and accurately achieve operative targets during revision TJA. However, concerns remain regarding preoperative metal artifacts, registration techniques, closed software platforms, further bone loss after implant removal, and whether robotic-assisted surgery will improve implant positioning and long-term survivorship."
pub.1162792232,Retrospective analysis of robotic unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasties: patient demographics and outcomes,"CONTEXT: With the growing number of robotic knee arthroplasties being performed, new outcomes must be analyzed to provide a database for comparing robotic and nonrobotic surgeries. These results can be utilized in the future to properly assess the significance of utilizing robotic technology in the operating room regarding patient outcomes and cost.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study are to: (1) analyze adverse outcomes from robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty and its relation to sex, body mass index (BMI), and age; and (2) explore any possible differences in outcomes among robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It is hypothesized that sex, BMI, and age will play a role in adverse events experienced among robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty. It is hypothesized that adverse outcomes will differ in robotic-assisted TKA v UKA.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing 1,300 patient cases from a single surgeon that underwent robotic-assisted UKA or TKA utilizing a robotic surgical system. Demographics were sorted by age, sex, and BMI. Outcomes were sorted by the type of adverse event. The most common adverse event was further statistically analyzed by age, sex, and BMI and then compared to the total cohort. The most common adverse event was also broken down by TKA vs. UKA.
RESULTS: The average age of the individuals undergoing this procedure was 63.6 years, with 52.3 % being female. The average BMI was 32.2. Of the 87 patients who experienced adverse events, 111 total events were documented. Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) was the highest experienced adverse event. Among the MUA events, 79.5 % had a BMI over 30 (p=0.067), 72.8 % were female (p=0.014), and the average age was 59 years (p=0.019). Among the MUA adverse events, 76.9 % (n=30) were following a TKA and 23.1 % were following a UKA. When considering the entire sample (n=1,300), there was a statistically significant 12.6 times greater odds that an MUA occurred among those who had a TKA vs. UKA (p<0.001). Similar results were discovered when only considering those who had experienced an adverse event (n=87) because the odds of an MUA occurring among those who underwent a TKA was 4.67 times greater than those who underwent a UKA (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: MUA was the most common adverse event in this cohort of robotic-assisted knee arthroplasties. The other adverse events did not yield large enough cohort sizes to analyze statistically in relation to specific patient demographics. Younger patients and females were at significantly greater odds of needing MUA. A BMI over 30 was not found to have a statistically significant risk of needing an MUA after robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty. Among the total cohort, those who underwent a TKA were at a 12.6 times greater odds of needing an MUA than those who received a UKA."

The problems are related to patient positioning, surgical exposure, femoral neck osteotomy, identifying the true acetabulum, and proper implant positioning. This case series describes our experience using the Mako Robotic-Arm in four bilateral THA procedures (each conducted in a single session) and one unilateral procedure in a fifth patient. Robotic total hip arthroplasty (RTHA) simplified THA by providing real-time information on the relative positions of the femur, pelvis, instruments, and implants to guide the surgery and implant placement."

However, data on the use of robotic-assisted technology for such complex diseases is lacking.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case study described the adoption of MAKO robotic-assisted treatment of revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) combined with severe acetabular defect (Paprosky type IIIB). Robotic-assisted technology accurately achieved preoperative planning; the acetabular component and augment were placed in the original position and angle as planned. Robotic-assisted acetabular reaming was successful in a single pass, preserving the remaining acetabular bone mass very well with no procedure-related complications. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 6 months postoperatively was 84 and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index was 24.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted technology can help in the accurate reconstruction of acetabular defect in complex hip revision surgery."
pub.1163569153,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty in clinical practice: protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Between 2 and 20% of patients who undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) report restricted motion and anterior knee pain. Non-optimal alignment of the implant components is a common cause of such complaints. Robotic-assisted TKA has been advocated to improve the accuracy of component positioning to match patients’ anatomy and biomechanics. However, the advantages of robotic surgery over conventional freehand TKA are still unclear. The present study is a protocol for a single-blind clinical trial in which patients will be randomly allocated to undergo either robotic-assisted TKA or conventional freehand TKA. A restricted kinematic alignment with medial para-stellar approach shall be made in all patients. The present study follows the SPIRIT guidelines. The primary outcome of interest is to compare robotic TKA versus traditional freehand TKA in terms of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), length of hospitalisation, blood values, blood transfusion units, and range of motion. The second outcome of interest is to evaluate the accuracy of component positioning of robotic-assisted TKA compared to the conventional freehand TKA.Level of evidence Level I, randomised controlled trial.Registration German Registry of Clinical Trials (ID: DRKS00030614)."
pub.1156376470,Operating room efficiency after the implementation of MAKO robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionThe aim of this study was to examine if robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) is cost- and time-effective in terms of implant stock and perioperative parameters, as optimizing perioperative efficiency may contribute to value-based care.Materials and methodsFour hundred thirty-two consecutive patients who received primary total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) from May 2017 to March 2020 in a regional hospital were included in this study. Operating room time (OR time), surgical time, number of trays, insert thickness, and length of stay (LOS) were assessed and compared for a cohort group with navigation-assisted procedures to a group with robotic-assisted procedures (MAKO, Stryker, USA). Prediction of implant size was assessed for the robotic-assisted group. The Mann–Whitney U test was used for comparisons between groups when the normality assumption was not met. Categorical variables were assessed using the Fisher’s exact test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsIn the RATKA group, we noticed a significant mean reduction of 11 min in total OR time (p < 0.001), the use of thinner insert (p < 0.001), and a shorter mean length of stay of 1 day (p < 0.001). Compared to the navigation group, surgical time was not significantly longer, nor clinically relevant (0.238). In 76.9% of the robotic-assisted cases, the estimated implant size was equal to the final size and in all other cases, the preoperative implant size was oversized.ConclusionThe introduction of the MAKO robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty resulted in a gain in operating room time, a thinner and more predictable insert thickness, a shorter length of stay in hospital, and less instrumentation compared to navigation-assisted procedures.Level of evidenceLevel III, Retrospective cohort study."
pub.1173403783,Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty utilizing a fluoroscopy-guided system produced similar cup accuracy and precision relative to a computerized tomography-based robotic platform,"Robotic assistance for total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been demonstrated to improve accuracy of acetabular cup placement relative to manual, unassisted technique. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the accuracy and precision between a fluoroscopy-based robotic total hip arthroplasty platform (FL-RTHA) and a computerized tomography-based (CT-RTHA) platform. The study included 98 consecutive FL-RTHA and 159 CT-RTHA procedures performed via direct anterior approach (DAA). All cases were performed for a pre-operative diagnosis of osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Primary outcome variables included cup implantation accuracy and precision (variance). Implantation accuracy was calculated as the absolute value of the difference between pre-operative target cup angles (inclination and anteversion) and the same post-operative angles. Percentage placement in the Lewinnek safe zone was also measured for both cohorts. The FL-RTHA and CT-RTHA cohorts demonstrated a 1.2° difference in absolute values for cup inclination accuracy (4.6° ± 3.6 vs. 3.4 ± 2.7; p = 0.005), and no difference in absolute values for cup anteversion accuracy (4.7° ± 4.1 vs. 4.6 ± 3.4; p = 0.991). Cohorts demonstrated similar precision for cup inclination and anteversion placement parameters, as well as equivalent Lewinnek safe zone placement. The use of a fluoroscopy-based robotic assistance platform for primary DAA THA resulted in similar accuracy and precision of acetabular cup placement when compared to a CT-based robotic assistance system."
pub.1175738964,How Often Does Technology Fail in Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty? A Comprehensive Analysis of a United States Food and Drug Administration Database,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted arthroplasty is a growing alternative to conventionally instrumented arthroplasty; however, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) associated with this technology reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remains poorly quantified. The objective of this study was to categorize AEs associated with robotic-assisted arthroplasty and calculate their annual incidence as reported to the FDA.
METHODS: The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for AEs from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 associated with the most prevalent robotic-arthroplasty system. The AEs were calculated using national surgical numbers provided by the manufacturer and grouped by total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or partial knee arthroplasty (PKA).
RESULTS: There were 1,710 unique AEs across the study period, with 436 THA, 1,005 TKA, and 269 PKA, representing incidence rates of 0.37, 0.30, and 0.40%, respectively. All procedures demonstrated lower rates of AEs in the final year of the study, compared to the first year. Most complications were related to mechanical problems, not software issues. Surgical delays due to AEs occurred in THA (0.13% cumulative incidence, 14.0 minutes average delay), TKA (0.13%, 20.6 minutes), and PKA (0.22%, 19.4 minutes). No cases were canceled due to AEs in THA, though a few TKA (0.003%) and PKA (0.02%) cases were not performed. Patient injuries occurred in 0.05, 0.05, and 0.08% of THA, TKA, and PKA, respectively. Surgical reintervention was necessary in 0.004, 0.003, and 0.01% of THA, TKA, and PKA, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted arthroplasty has a small number and relatively low rate of AEs reported to the FDA as measured through the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, with rates steadily decreasing over the study period. Patient injury, case delay, and reoperation represent only a small fraction of the already rare AEs in the database."
pub.1181123828,Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty outperforms manual technique in obese and overweight patients: a prospective comparative study,"BackgroundWith the increasing prevalence of obesity, there is growing awareness of the impact of overweight and obesity on total hip arthroplasty (THA). Research exploring the accuracy of acetabular component orientation in THA between robotic-assisted and manual techniques across different BMI categories is insufficient.MethodsThis prospective study evaluated 221 patients who underwent THA with a Robotic Interactive Orthopaedic Arm system and 252 patients who underwent manual THA between March 2022 and January 2024. The patients were divided into four groups according to their BMI. We analysed whether there were differences in the accuracy of acetabular component positioning between robotic-assisted THA and manual THA across different BMI categories.ResultsIn the overweight group, robotic-assisted THA achieved a significantly higher rate of abductions within the target range (73/6) than manual THA (62/28) (p = 0.000). Both abductions and anteversions within the target range were also significantly more frequent in the robotic-assisted THA group (69/10) than in the manual THA group (56/34) (p = 0.000). Among the obese patients, robotic-assisted THA showed a perfect record for anteversions within the target range (29/0), markedly outperforming manual THA (39/6) (p = 0.040).ConclusionIn the overweight (24 kg/m² ≤ BMI < 28 kg/m²) and obese (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m²) groups, robotic-assisted THA demonstrates significantly greater accuracy in acetabular component positioning compared to manual THA. This indicates that robotic-assisted technology may provide a more precise positioning of the acetabular component in overweight and obese patients."
pub.1173392734,Robotic arm-assisted conversion of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty to total knee arthroplasty,"Aims: Robotic arm-assisted surgery offers accurate and reproducible guidance in component positioning and assessment of soft-tissue tensioning during knee arthroplasty, but the feasibility and early outcomes when using this technology for revision surgery remain unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of robotic arm-assisted revision of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) versus primary robotic arm-assisted TKA at short-term follow-up.
Methods: This prospective study included 16 patients undergoing robotic arm-assisted revision of UKA to TKA versus 35 matched patients receiving robotic arm-assisted primary TKA. In all study patients, the following data were recorded: operating time, polyethylene liner size, change in haemoglobin concentration (g/dl), length of inpatient stay, postoperative complications, and hip-knee-ankle (HKA) alignment. All procedures were performed using the principles of functional alignment. At most recent follow-up, range of motion (ROM), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) were collected. Mean follow-up time was 21 months (6 to 36).
Results: There were no differences between the two treatment groups with regard to mean change in haemoglobin concentration (p = 0.477), length of stay (LOS, p = 0.172), mean polyethylene thickness (p = 0.065), or postoperative complication rates (p = 0.295). At the most recent follow-up, the primary robotic arm-assisted TKA group had a statistically significantly improved OKS compared with the revision UKA to TKA group (44.6 (SD 2.7) vs 42.3 (SD 2.5); p = 0.004) but there was no difference in the overall ROM (p = 0.056) or FJS between the two treatment groups (86.1 (SD 9.6) vs 84.1 (4.9); p = 0.439).
Conclusion: Robotic arm-assisted revision of UKA to TKA was associated with comparable intraoperative blood loss, early postoperative rehabilitation, functional outcomes, and complications to primary robotic TKA at short-term follow-up. Robotic arm-assisted surgery offers a safe and reproducible technique for revising failed UKA to TKA."

On the other hand, arthroscopic techniques tend to replace open surgical techniques in sports medicine but strive to be developed in the field of arthroplasty. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a micro-invasive bi-compartmental knee arthroplasty using both arthroscopic and robotic technologies (A-BiUKA).Materials and MethodsThe study was conducted on complete fresh-frozen and embalmed cadaveric specimens. The main criterion of judgment was the successful positioning of trial implants through a minimal quad-sparing approach. Arthroscopy was used for bone-morphing and burring, supported by an image-free robotic system. Secondary criteria of judgment were axial deviation (measured using the navigation system), operating time, and incision length.ResultsTen A-BiUKA were performed. Implantation was successful in all cases. The mean preoperative frontal deviation was 179.8° ± 3.2 [175: 185], the mean postoperative frontal deviation was 178.5° ± 2.2 [175: 182], without any outliers. The mean correction was 1.7° ± 1.6 [0: 5]. Once the eight first A-UKA were performed, constituting the learning curve, the mean operative time for the remaining twelves surgeries was 90 min ± 6. The mean skin incision length was 3.35 cm ± 0.13 [3: 4].ConclusionAssociated arthroscopic and robotic technologies allows to perform Bi-UKA procedure using a quad sparing mini-invasive approach. Clinical prospective studies have to confirm the feasibility and the clinical outcomes of this surgery."
pub.1167902792,Patient Perception of Robotic-Assisted Total Joint Arthroplasty in a Hispanic Population,"Background: Robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery has become popular and widely available, mainly for total joint arthroplasty. However, there has been a persistent concern regarding access to robotic-assisted surgery and the utilization rate of total joint arthroplasty among minority groups. As an imperative effort to close the gap regarding health inequalities, we assessed the knowledge and perspective of Hispanics regarding robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery.
Methods: A 28-item questionnaire was established to evaluate Hispanics' perceptions of robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery. Participants answered questions about demographic features, knowledge about robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery, and preferences regarding manual vs robotic-assisted procedures.
Results: A total of 580 questionnaires were analyzed in our study, with an average age of participants of 49.1 years. Only 44.2% of the participants were familiar with robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery. Fifty-three percent of the respondents preferred robotic-assisted surgery over conventional procedures, with many participants believing that robotic-assisted surgery leads to better outcomes (54.7%) and faster recovery (53.1%).
Conclusions: Knowledge about specific factors such as clinical outcomes and costs may influence the perception and preference of Hispanics toward robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery. Therefore, patient education may play a crucial role in the informed decision-making process in Hispanics when opting between robotic-assisted or traditional orthopaedic surgery."
pub.1151579209,A comparison of radiological and clinical outcomes between robotic‐assisted and conventional total hip arthroplasty: A meta‐analysis,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RATHA) is superior to conventional total hip arthroplasty (CTHA) in terms of radiological and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase) were searched for articles published before 11 May 2021. The comparison outcomes of interest included radiological and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 2845 hips that compared the radiological and clinical outcomes of RATHA and CTHA were included in this study. There was no significant difference between RATHA and CTHA in cup anteversion or complications. However, RATHA showed better outcomes in terms of leg-length discrepancy, stem alignment, cup inclination, the Lewinnek safe zone, Callanan safe zone, total complications, and intraoperative complications. Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty was inferior to CTHA in terms of operative time and dislocations (all p-values < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The radiological and clinical outcomes of RATHA were comparable and even better than those of CTHA, except for operative time and dislocation outcomes."
pub.1166750311,Patient satisfaction following robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a viable alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for osteoarthritis patients with single-compartment involvement, with advantages including accelerated recovery, reduced pain, and improved function. Robotic-assisted UKA (rUKA) is a promising development that ensures precise implant positioning and limb alignment. However, concerns about complications remain.
OBJECTIVE: This study looks at patient satisfaction as a key metric for determining the efficacy of rUKA versus manual UKA (mUKA).
METHODS: The search strategy for this study followed PRISMA. Using precise keywords, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library were searched. English articles were searched until August 2, 2023. Selection criteria included mUKA and rUKA patient satisfaction studies. The NOS scale evaluated study quality.

How to achieve a ''safe zone'' alignment total knee arthroplasty in patients with extra-articular deformity.,"The need for total knee arthroplasty is increasing considerably and one of the goals is to achieve post-surgical coronal alignment. Robotic surgical assistance achieves a functional alignment, which is a hip-knee-ankle angle of 0°. However, it is not possible to provide robotic assisted surgery to all our patients so we must include the full-length hip-to-ankle AP weight-bearing radiograph in preoperative planning to obtain a ""safe zone"" alignment, which is a post-surgical hip-knee-ankle Angle of 0 ± 3°.

pub.1164873587,Systematic review and meta-analysis of economic and healthcare resource utilization outcomes for robotic versus manual total knee arthroplasty,"The introduction of robotics in orthopedic surgery has led to improved precision and standardization in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Clinical benefits of robotic versus manual TKA have been well established; however, evidence for economic and healthcare resource utilization outcomes (HRU) is lacking. The primary objective of this study was to compare economic and HRU outcomes for robotic and manual TKA. The secondary objective was to explore comparative robotic and manual TKA pain and opioid consumption outcomes. Multi-database literature searches were performed to identify studies comparing robotic and manual TKA from 2016 to 2022 and meta-analyses were conducted. This review included 50 studies with meta-analyses conducted on 35. Compared with manual TKA, robotic TKA was associated with a: 14% reduction in hospital length of stay (P = 0.022); 74% greater likelihood to be discharged to home (P < 0.001); and 17% lower likelihood to experience a 90-day readmission (P = 0.043). Robotic TKA was associated with longer mean operating times (incision to closure definition: 9.27 min longer, P = 0.030; general operating time definition: 18.05 min longer, P = 0.006). No differences were observed for total procedure cost and 90-day emergency room visits. Most studies reported similar outcomes for robotic and manual TKA regarding pain and opioid use. Coupled with the clinical benefits of robotic TKA, the economic impact of using robotics may contribute to hospitals’ quality improvement and financial sustainability. Further research and more randomized controlled trials are needed to effectively quantify the benefits of robotic relative to manual TKA."

pub.1175889592,The Conversion of Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty to Total Knee Arthroplasty with Non-CT-Based Robotic Assistance: A Novel Surgical Technique and Case Series,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted devices help provide precise component positioning in conversion of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A few studies offer surgical techniques for CT-based robotic-assisted conversion of UKA to TKA, however no studies to date detail this procedure utilizing a non-CT based robotic assisted device. This paper introduces a novel technique employing a non-CT based robotic assisted device (ROSA® Knee System, Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) for converting UKA to TKA with a focus on its efficacy in gap balancing.
CASE: We present three patients (ages 46 to 66) who were evaluated for conversion of UKA to TKA for aseptic loosening, stress fracture, and progressive osteoarthritis. Each patient underwent robotic-assisted conversion to TKA. Postoperative assessments at 6 months revealed improved pain, function, and radiographic stability.
TECHNIQUE: Preoperative planning included biplanar long leg radiographs to determine the anatomic and mechanical axis of the leg. After arthrotomy with a standard medial parapatellar approach, infrared reflectors were pinned into the femur and tibia, followed by topographical mapping of the knee with the UKA in-situ. The intraoperative software was utilized to evaluate flexion and extension balancing and plan bony resections. Then, the robotic arm guided placement of the femoral and tibial guide pins and the UKA components were removed. After bony resection of the distal femur and proximal tibia, the intraoperative software was used to reassess the extension gap, and plan posterior condylar resection to have the flexion gap match the extension gap.
CONCLUSION: The use of a non-CT based robotic assisted device in conversion of UKA to TKA is a novel technique and a good option for surgeons familiar with robotic-assisted arthroplasty, resulting in excellent outcomes at 6 months."
pub.1150356590,Learning curves of robotic technology in an orthopedic teaching hospital,"BackgroundIn recent years there has been an increasing implementation of robotic technology in arthroplasty. Due to the unclear data situation the aim of this study was to analyze the learning curve for robotic technology in residency training.MethodsAfter its introduction, the first 351 consecutive robotic knee replacements were prospectively included in the study. Surgical times, preoperative and postoperative radiographs, intraoperatively recorded alignment data and complications were analyzed. Satisfaction, revision, and referral rates were determined in a 90-day follow-up survey. Data from the last 350 navigated total knee arthroplasties were analyzed as a historical control group.ResultsA learning curve of between 3 and 53 procedures was identified, depending on the surgeon, with further reductions in time measured even after 1 year of use. The operative times of the navigated technique were achieved by all surgeons. With respect to precision (alignment outliers) and patient satisfaction rate, no learning curve was evident. Comparison between tutorial and non-tutorial surgery showed a 16-min increase in operating time, but no significant differences in precision, complications, and patient satisfaction rate.ConclusionThe study showed that there was a learning curve in terms of duration of surgery but not in terms of precision, complications, and patient satisfaction. Robotic tutorial surgery requires more time but provides the same outcome compared to experienced surgeons. Thus, the robotic surgical technique appears to be an excellent training tool in knee arthroplasty."
pub.1164873778,The landscape of surgical robotics in orthopedics surgery,"Orthopedic surgery is one of the first surgical specialties to apply surgical robotics in clinical practice, which has become an interesting field over the years with promising results. Surgical robotics can facilitate total joint arthroplasty by providing robotic support to accurately prepare the bone, improving the ability to reproduce alignment, and restoring normal kinematics. Various robotic systems are available on the market, each tailored to specific types of surgeries and characterized by a series of features with different requirements and/or modus operandi. Here, a narrative review of the current state of surgical robotic systems for total joint knee arthroplasty is presented, covering the different categories of robots, which are classified based on the operation, requirements, and level of interaction with the surgeon. The different robotic systems include closed/open platform, image-based/imageless, and passive/active/semi-active systems. The main goal of a robotic system is to increase the accuracy and precision of the operation regardless of the type of system. Despite the short history of surgical robots, they have shown clinical effectiveness compared to conventional techniques in orthopedic surgery. When considering which robotic system to use, surgeons should carefully evaluate the different benefits and drawbacks to select the surgical robot that fits their needs the best."
pub.1144862928,Learning Curve of Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty for Non-Fellowship-Trained Orthopedic Surgeons,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) serves as a reliable treatment option for patients with end-stage arthritis, but patient dissatisfaction rate remains high. With the projected increase in the volume of arthroplasty operations, surgeons have aimed for methods in which to improve the patient outcomes. Robotic-assisted TKA has become increasingly popular. The learning curve for such technology has been investigated, but these prior studies have only been performed by fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons. The goal of this study was to investigate the learning curve for non-fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons to ameliorate any concerns about increased operative time.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of robotic-assisted TKAs and manual TKAs, performed by two non-fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons, was conducted on a total of 160 patients. For each individual surgeon, the robotic-assisted TKAs were divided into 3 cohorts of 20 consecutive patients. Data from 20 consecutive manual TKAs were also gathered for each surgeon. The mean operative times were compared. Cohorts were then grouped together for both surgeons and compared in a similar fashion.
RESULTS: For surgeon 1, mean operative times were significantly increased for robotic-assisted cohorts compared with those for the manual cohort. For surgeon 2, the first robotic-assisted cohort was significantly longer. However, there were no significant differences for the second and third robotic-assisted cohorts. In the combined surgeon group, there was no significant difference between operative times for the third robotic cohort and the manual cohort.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the general orthopedic surgeon in a community hospital may be able to adequately perform robotic-assisted surgery in a similar timeframe to their manual TKA within their first 40 robotic-arm-assisted TKA."

PurposeIn order to minimize errors during achieving the targeted alignment of the total knee arthroplasty (TKA) components, robotic-assisted surgery has been introduced with the aim to help surgeons to improve implant survival, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction. The primary goal of this paper is to highlight surgical tips and tricks on how to achieve functional alignment (FA) through intra-operative boney mapping, numeric gap, and alignment data, using the next generation of imageless robotic surgical systems.MethodThis retrospective case-series contains planned and achieved data on the FA and joint gap data obtained from 526 patients captured and assessed with use of a semi-autonomous imageless handheld robotic sculpting systems. All patients were operated upon by two experienced TKA surgeons.ResultsThe mean difference between planned and achieved alignment was 1.46° (≥ 7° varus group), 1.02° (< 7° varus group), 1.16° (< 7° valgus group), and 1.43° (≥ 7° valgus group). The mean observed planned and achieved extension and flexion gaps were below 1.47 mm for medial extension gaps, 1.12 mm for the lateral extension gaps, 1.4 mm for the medial flexion gaps, and 1.16 mm for the lateral flexion gaps.ConclusionAnalysis of these first cases highlights the capability of the next generation of imageless robotic-assisted total knee replacement using a semi-autonomous handheld robotic sculpting to maintain accuracy of the desired alignment. The system allows the surgeon to choose freely their own alignment philosophy while maintaining efficiency."

pub.1153122253,Better accuracy and implant survival in medial imageless robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared to conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: two- to eleven-year follow-up of three hundred fifty-six consecutive knees,"Abstract
Purpose
Implant malpositioning, joint line (JL) lowering, and malalignment have been identified as risk factors for implant failure in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). The aims of this study were to compare the accuracy of implant positioning in robotic-assisted UKA versus conventional UKA in a large cohort and examine the correlation with implant survival at mid-term follow-up.MethodsThis retrospective study included 356 medial UKAs from 2011 to 2019. The radiological measurements performed were coronal positioning of tibial implant according to Cartier angle (Δ Cartier), posterior tibial slope (PTS), residual hip-knee-ankle (HKA), and JL restoration. Outliers were defined as follows: post-operative HKA < 175° or > 180°, Δ Cartier > 3° or <  − 3°, JL change ≥ 2 mm, and PTS < 2° or > 8°. The survival probability was reported at the last follow-up.ResultsOut of the 356 knees included, 159 underwent conventional UKA (44.5%) and 197 (55.5%) robotic-assisted UKA. The mean follow-up was 61.3 months ± 24.0. Robotic UKA was associated with better accuracy compared to conventional UKA in relation to HKA (67% vs 56%, p = 0.023), JL restoration (70% vs 44%, p < 0.0001), PTS (83% vs 55%, p < 0.0001), and tibial varus restoration (65% vs 55%, p = 0.049). Implant survival in the robotic group was found to be superior at the last follow-up (96.4% versus 87.3% at 9 years, p = 0.004).ConclusionRobotic assistance in patients undergoing medial UKA was associated with better accuracy compared to conventional UKA with respect to tibial implant positioning, post-operative limb alignment, and JL restoration. This was translated in improved survival at mid-term follow-up favouring the robotic group."
pub.1170665877,Robot-assisted knee arthroplasty: Analyzing the learning curve and initial institutional experience,"Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) involves a learning curve for orthopedic surgeons. The aim of the present study was to assess the surgical times of rTKA procedures performed by initial stage and proficiency stage surgeons in comparison with times of conventional total knee arthroplasty (cTKA). The results reveal that the learning curve for rTKA varies considerable between surgeons, suggesting that the skill and aptitude of the individual to adapt to the robotic system play key roles in the learning process. Proficiency stage surgeons were able to reduce rTKA surgical times to levels comparable with those of conventional surgeries after performing approximately 30 to 40 robotic procedures. Ongoing research has shown promising outcomes in terms of improved clinical results and reduced complications following the application of advanced robotic technology to total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1167748062,Variety of femoral anteversion and its measurement in cementless total hip arthroplasty: Does robotic technology improve accuracy?,"BackgroundHigh-performance total hip arthroplasty (THA) depends on the accurate position of components. However, femoral anteversion is variable, and current studies only used traditional instruments to evaluate it, such as protractor and spirit level with limited cases. This study aimed to identify the variability in the measured femoral native anteversion and intraoperative stem anteversion under different measurement methods, including intraoperative robotic method. We hypothesized that robotic technology was more accurate than traditional instruments for femoral anteversion evaluation.MethodsThis study included 117 hips of patients who underwent robotic-assisted THA between November 2019 and March 2021. Preoperative native femoral anteversion was measured using a robotic system. Intraoperative femoral stem anteversion was evaluated visually, and then measured with a goniometer and a robotic system, respectively. Variability in the measured femoral native anteversion and intraoperative femoral stem anteversion was calculated and compared. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Pearson correlation analysis were used to assess the consistency and correlation of  anteversion of different measurements and postoperative CT-measured stem anteversion, respectively.ResultsThe result of measurement for preoperative native femoral anteversion was more variable than the intraoperative robotic-measured stem anteversion. Intraoperative robotic-measured stem version showed the highest correlation with postoperative CT measurement of stem version (r = 0.806, P < 0.001), while intraoperative surgeon estimation had the lowest correlation coefficient (r = 0.281, P = 0.025). As for the consistency with postoperative CT measurement of femoral stem anteversion, the intraoperative robotic-measured femoral stem version also had the highest value (ICC = 0.892, P < 0.001).ConclusionNative femoral anteversion was variable preoperatively. Using cementless stems, anteversion was also highly variable. Robotic assessment for stem anteversion during surgery was more consistent with the final position than the preoperative assessment and conventional intraoperative estimation."

Studies have demonstrated multiple advantages with these technologies, such as decreased postoperative pain and subsequent decreased narcotic usage, decreased lengths of stay, less complications, reduced damage to soft tissues, decreased readmissions, as well as economic advantages in the form of meaningful cost savings for payors. The purpose of this report was to clearly and concisely summarize the good-to-high methodology peer-reviewed, published literature regarding CT scan-based, 3-dimensional robotically-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty stratified by: (1) prospective randomized studies; (2) database comparison studies; (3) national registry studies; (4) health utility studies; (5) comparison studies; and (6) basic science studies. A literature search was conducted and, after applying inclusion criteria, each study was graded based on the modified Coleman methodology score (""excellent"" 85-100, ""good"" 70-84, ""fair"" 55-69, ""poor"" <54 points). A total of 63 of 63 good-to-excellent methodology score reports were positive for this technology, including 11 that demonstrated decreased pain and/or opioid use when compared to traditional arthroplasty techniques. The summary results of these high-quality, peer-reviewed published studies demonstrated multiple advantages of this CT scan-based robotic-arm assisted platform for lower extremity arthroplasty."
pub.1155432739,Correlations in radiographic and MAKO Total Knee Robotic-Assisted Surgery intraoperative limb coronal alignment.,"Robotic-assisted arthroplasty has become increasingly established in recent years. The aim of the study is to determine if intraoperative coronal alignment during robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty correlates with radiographic alignment. We prospectively compared the pre- and postoperative limb alignment values measured on long leg standing radiographs with intraoperative robotic-assisted measurements for 100 patients who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty. Two-tailed bivariate Pearson correla- tions were performed to evaluate the strength of the association between radiographic and robotic- assisted alignment. The intraclass correlation coeffi- cient (ICC) was used to estimate interrater reliability. There was a male/female ratio of 1.16 and the mean age was 67 years (range 42-88). Robotic-assisted measurements slightly overestimated the degree of varus relative to radiographs. Radiographic and robotic-assisted measurements were strongly correlated (r = 0.915, p < 0.001) preoperatively, with a difference of 1.6 ± 3.2°. The average measure ICC was 0.996 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.995 to 0.997 (p < 0.001). Postoperatively a bigger difference was measured (3.1° ± 1.9°), comparing radiographic and MAKO alignment. A moderate correlation was observed between the postoperative radiographic and MAKO outcome alignment (r = 0.604, p < 0.001). The average measure ICC was 0.977 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.967 to 0.984 (p < 0.001). There is a strong correlation in the preoperative set- ting between radiographic and robotic-assisted lower limb alignment and a moderate correlation in the post-operative setting. The values measured by the MAKO Total Knee application were considerably more in varus."
pub.1158602433,Is robotic assistance more eye-catching than computer navigation in joint arthroplasty? A Google trends analysis from the point of public interest,"Computer-assisted navigation system (CAS) and robotic assisted surgery (RAS) have been widely used in joint arthroplasty, but few studies focused on public interest. We aimed to evaluate current trend and seasonality of public interest in CAS and RAS arthroplasty over the past 10 years, and forecast the future development. All data related to CAS or RAS arthroplasty from January 2012 to December 2021 were collected through Google Trends. Public interest was described by relative search volume (RSV). Pre-existing trend was evaluated by linear and exponential models. Time series analysis and ARIMA model were utilized to analyze the seasonality and future trend. R software 3.5.0 was for statistics analysis. Public interest in RAS arthroplasty has been continuously increasing (P < 0.001) and exponential model (R2 = 0.83, MAE = 7.35, MAPE = 34%, RSME = 9.58) fitted better than linear one (R2 = 0.78, MAE = 8.44, MAPE = 42%, RSME = 10.67). CAS arthroplasty showed a downtrend (P < 0.01) with equivalent R2 (0.04) and accuracy measures (MAE = 3.92, MAPE = 31%, RSME = 4.95). The greatest popularity of RAS was observed in July and October, while the lowest was in March and December. For CAS, a rise of public interest was in May and October, but lower values were observed in January and November. Based on ARIMA models, the popularity of RAS might continuously increase and nearly double in 2030, along with a stability with slight downtrend for CAS. Public interest in RAS arthroplasty has been continuously increasing and seems to maintain this uptrend in the next 10 years, whereas popularity of CAS arthroplasty will likely remain stable."
pub.1164873779,Robotic-assisted foot and ankle surgery: a review of the present status and the future,"The surgical application of robotics has increased significantly since its first application in 1985 for a brain biopsy acquisition. Robotic-assisted surgery has been one of the viable options in various surgical areas, and also in orthopaedic surgery. Robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery has gained popularity as a mean of improving accuracy, reducing complications and achieving better patient satisfaction. Numerous clinical research studies have demonstrated advantages of robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery, however, most of that researches were about the total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty and spine surgery. The application of robotic technology in foot and ankle surgery is in a very nascent stage. Furthermore, there has been little research on intraoperative use of robotics in foot and ankle surgery in literature. A review of previous preclinical studies in foot and ankle robotics and clinical research studies in various fields of robot-assisted orthopaedic surgery shows that its potential application and benefits over conventional techniques, such as total ankle arthroplasty, minimally invasive surgery for foot and ankle trauma or other corrective procedure, and intraoperative biomechanical testing. More studies on practical application of robotic technology to surgical procedure in the field of foot and ankle surgery are needed to confirm its clinical usefulness and cost effectiveness."
pub.1148869614,Learning curve for robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty: our experience with imageless hand-held Navio system,"The main purpose of this study was to determine the learning curve of Robotic assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty surgery through assessment of operative time and comparison with that of conventional jig based Total Knee Arthroplasty. The study included our first 75 Robotic assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty and 25 randomly selected conventional jig-based Total knee arthroplasty from June 2017 to December 2017. The 75 cases were divided into 3 groups of 25 consecutive cases. The mean of operative time for each phase and total time was compared between the 3 groups and with the mean of total time for conventional jig based group. In our experience, Robotic assisted Total Knee arthroplasty was associated with a learning curve of approximately 25 cases. The mean for Registration phase of Group A (1st set of 25 cases) was 6.12 min (SD 1.8 min), group B (2nd set of 25 cases) was 4.46 min (SD 0.79 min) and group C (3rd set of 25 cases) was 4.17 min (SD 0.59 min). The mean for Planning phase of group A was 5.08 min (SD 1.01 min), group B was 4.04 min (SD 0.37 min) and group C was 4.01 min (SD 0.35 min). The mean for Cutting Phase of group A was 28.22 min (SD 6.24 min), group B was 22.49 min (SD 0.79 min) and group C was 22.36 min (SD 0.88 min). The mean for total time of group A was 39.42 min (SD 8.02), group B was 31 min (SD 1.22 min), group C was 30.53 min (SD 1.14 min) and conventional group was 30.54 min (SD 1.14 min). On comparing the Registration phase (Group A vs B, p < 0.001; Group B vs C, p 0.14; Group A vs C, p < 0.001), Planning phase (Group A vs B, p < 0.001; Group B vs C, p 0.75; Group A vs C, p < 0.001), Cutting phase (Group A vs B, p < 0.001; Group B vs C, p 0.58; Group A vs C, p < 0.001) and Total time (Group A vs B, p < 0.001; Group B vs C, p 0.74; Group A vs C, p < 0.001; Group A vs Conventional, p < 0.001; Group B vs Conventional, p 0.17, Group C vs Conventional, p 0.99), the results showed that the inflection point for learning curve in our hands was 25 cases. The learning curve and increased operation theatre time are likely to be major barrier in widespread acceptance of robotic technology amongst arthroplasty surgeons. We, in our experience can say that the learning curve was approximately 25 cases. The results of this study will help the arthroplasty surgeons in accepting this technology and achieve better outcomes."
pub.1157512966,"Robotic-assisted knee replacement surgery & infection: A historical foundation, systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: An increasing proportion of Knee arthroplasty is performed using robotic-assisted surgical techniques. This study sought to use a meta-analytical approach to establish summary rates of surgical site infection in robotic-assisted procedures and compare the rate of deep infections to those seen in conventional knee arthroplasty.
Methods: This study performed a literature search across four online databases to establish a summary rate of surgical site infection across two categories: deep infection and superficial and pin-site infections. This was processed with the aid of a bespoke data-extraction tool. Risk of Bias analysis was performed using the Cochrane RoB2 tool. Meta-analysis was then performed with tests for heterogeneity and a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model.
Results: A total of 17 studies were identified as appropriate for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The summary rate of overall surgical site infections within one year of robotic knee arthroplasty was found to be 0.568% (SE = 0.183, 95% CI = 0.209-0.927). Deep infections fell to 0.154% (SE = 0.069, 95% CI = 0.018-0.290) and to 0.347% (SE = 0.109, 95% CI = 0.133-0.561) in superficial and pin-site infections.
Conclusion: The surgical site infection rates were found to be low across robotic knee arthroplasty. Further research is required to prove its superiority compared to the conventional, non-robotic technique."

AimsTotal hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with hip-dislocation dysplasia remains challenging. This study aims to evaluate whether these patients may benefit from robotic-assisted techniques.MethodsWe reviewed 135 THAs (108 conventional THAs and 27 robotic-assisted THAs) for Crowe type III or IV from January 2017 to August 2019 in our institution. Robotic-assisted THAs were matched with conventional THAs at a 1:1 ratio (27 hips each group) using propensity score matching. The accuracy of cup positioning and clinical outcomes were compared between groups.ResultsThe inclination of the cup for conventional THAs and robotic THAs was 42.1 ± 5.7 and 41.3 ± 4.6 (p = 0.574), respectively. The anteversion of the cup for conventional THAs was significantly greater than that of robotic THAs (29.5 ± 8.1 and 18.0 ± 4.6; p < 0.001), respectively. The ratio of the acetabular cup in the Lewinnek safe zone was 37% (10/27) in conventional THAs and 96.3% (26/27) in robotic THAs (p < 0.001). Robotic THAs did not achieve better leg length discrepancy than that of conventional THAs (− 0.4 ± 10.9 mm vs. 0.4 ± 8.8 mm, p = 0.774). There was no difference in Harris Hip Score and WOMAC Osteoarthritis index between groups at the 2-year follow-up. No dislocation occurred in all cases at the final follow-up.ConclusionRobotic-assisted THA for patients with high dislocation improves the accuracy of the implantation of the acetabular component with respect to safe zone."
pub.1170342938,Comparison of imageless robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty and conventional total knee arthroplasty: early clinical and radiological outcomes of 200 knees,"The aim of this study was to compare the short term clinical and radiological outcomes of imageless robotic and conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and to estimate the accuracy of the two techniques by analysing the outliers after TKA. We have evaluated 200 consecutive knees (158 patients), 100 knees undergoing robotic TKA, and 100 knees treated with conventional TKA. Demographic parameters like age, gender, body mass index, diagnosis and range of motion were obtained. Knee society score (KSS) and Knee society functional score (KSS-F) were used for clinical evaluation. Mechanical alignment (Hip-knee-ankle angle), proximal tibial angle (MPTA), distal femoral angle (LDFA) and tibial slope were analysed for radiological results and outliers were compared between both groups. Outliers were defined when the measured angle exceeded ± 3° from the neutral alignment in each radiological measurement on the final follow-up radiograph.The minimum follow-up was 6 months (range, 6 to 18 months). The preoperative mean HKA angle was 169.7 ± 11.3° in robotic group and 169.3 ± 7.3° in conventional group. There was significant improvement in HKA, LDFA, MPTA and tibial slope compared to the preoperative values in both the groups (p < 0.01). The number of HKA, LDFA and tibial slope outliers were 31, 29 and 37, respectively, in the conventional group compared to 13, 23 and 17 in the robotic group (p < 0.01). There was a significant improvement in the KSS and KSS-F functional scores postoperatively in both the groups (p < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the functional scores between the groups postoperatively (p = 0.08). This study showed excellent improvement with both imageless robotic and conventional TKA, with similar clinical outcomes between both groups. However, radiologically robotic TKA showed better accuracy and consistency with fewer outliers compared with conventional TKA."
pub.1147770873,Is sequential bilateral robotic total knee arthroplasty a safe procedure? A matched comparative pilot study,"IntroductionTo our knowledge, no papers have reported the results of robotic-assisted surgery for sequential bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). Indeed, sequential bilateral TKA present several benefits, as one single anesthesia, surgical episode, hospitalization, and rehabilitation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate peri-operative outcomes and compare the complication rates, clinical outcomes, and implant positioning of sequential bilateral TKA performed with a robotic-assisted system versus a conventional technique.Materials and methodsAll patients who underwent a sequential bilateral robotic-assisted primary TKA (raTKA) in our institution between November 2019 and February 2021 were included. Twenty patients met the inclusion criteria and were matched with 20 sequential bilateral TKA performed with a conventional technique. The two groups were comparable for the demographic data and the preoperative parameters, including preoperative anticoagulation and ASA score. The minimum follow-up was 6 months.ResultsThe operative time was significantly longer in the robotic group (< 0.0001), with a mean additional time of 29 min. There was no significant difference between both groups for postoperative blood loss, rate of blood transfusion, or postoperative pain. The average length of stay was 5 days. There was one early complication in the robotic group due to the tibial trackers. The functional outcomes were similar between both groups, except for the functional KSS score, which was better at 6 months in the robotic group (p < 0.0001). The restoration of the knee alignment and the distal femoral anatomy were significantly better in the robotic group than in the conventional group.ConclusionsDespite a longer operative time, the peri-operative parameters of sequential bilateral TKA were similar between robotic and conventional techniques. Further, sequential bilateral raTKA was at least as safe as a conventional technique, without additional risk of medical complications."
pub.1163683966,A review of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a successful surgical method for hip replacement but still poses challenges and risks. Robotic-assisted THA (rTHA) using new generation robotic systems has emerged to improve surgical precision and outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on rTHA, with a focus on its advantages, such as individualized preoperative planning, intraoperative assistance, and improved accuracy in implantation, especially in complex cases. Additionally, it aims to explore the disadvantages associated with the use of rTHA, including high costs, the learning curve, and prolonged operation time compared to manual THA (mTHA), which are critical drawbacks that require careful consideration and efforts for minimization. Some financial analyses suggest that rTHA may offer cost-effectiveness and reduced postoperative costs compared to mTHA. While technological advancements are expected to reduce technical complications, there are still debates surrounding long-term outcomes. Practical limitations, such as limited availability and accessibility, also warrant attention. Although the development of rTHA shows promise, it is still in its early stages, necessitating critical evaluation and further research to ensure optimal patient benefits."
pub.1168446921,Robotic trials in arthroplasty surgery,"Total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA, TKA) are largely successful procedures; however, both have variable outcomes, resulting in some patients being dissatisfied with the outcome. Surgeons are turning to technologies such as robotic-assisted surgery in an attempt to improve outcomes. Robust studies are needed to find out if these innovations are really benefitting patients. The Robotic Arthroplasty Clinical and Cost Effectiveness Randomised Controlled Trials (RACER) trials are multicentre, patient-blinded randomized controlled trials. The patients have primary osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The operation is Mako-assisted THA or TKA and the control groups have operations using conventional instruments. The primary clinical outcome is the Forgotten Joint Score at 12 months, and there is a built-in analysis of cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes include early pain, the alignment of the components, and medium- to long-term outcomes. This annotation outlines the need to assess these technologies and discusses the design and challenges when conducting such trials, including surgical workflows, isolating the effect of the operation, blinding, and assessing the learning curve. Finally, the future of robotic surgery is discussed, including the need to contemporaneously introduce and evaluate such technologies."
pub.1148785396,Complications and downsides of the robotic total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review is to describe the complications and downsides of robotic systems in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: A comprehensive search according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed across PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception until December 2021. All articles of any study design directly reporting on complications and downsides of the robotic system in TKA were considered for inclusion. Risk of bias assessment was performed for all included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias and MINORS score.
RESULTS: A total of 21 studies were included, consisting of 4 randomized controlled trials, 7 prospective studies and 10 retrospective studies. Complications of the robotic system were pin-hole fracture, pin-related infection, iatrogenic soft tissue and bony injury, and excessive blood loss. While, downsides were longer operative duration, higher intraoperative cost, learning curve and aborting a robotic TKA due to different reasons. Iatrogenic injuries were more common in the active robotic system and abortion of the robotic TKA was reported only with active robotic TKA.
CONCLUSION: Robotic TKA is associated with certain advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, surgeons need to be familiar with the system to use it effectively. Widespread adoption of the robotic system should always be evidence-based.

This study aims to comprehensively analyze the literature on robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (r-TKA), providing insights into its current development, clinical application, and research trends. A systematic search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) to identify relevant articles. Data were collected from the top 100 highly cited articles. Article evidence levels were assessed following established guidelines. Statistical analyses and visualizations were performed to reveal publication trends, citations, research hotspots, and collaborative networks. The analysis covered 100 highly cited articles meeting the research criteria, with a focus on the last five years. The United States emerged as a major contributor, with most publications and citations in the Journal of Knee Surgery and Knee Surgery Sports Traumatology Arthroscopy. Research priorities revolved around clinical outcomes, accuracy, and alignment of r-TKA. Notably, higher evidence levels correlated with more citations, indicating greater attention. Interest in and research on r-TKA is steadily increasing, with a few countries at the forefront of these endeavors. While numerous studies have already reported short- to medium-term follow-up results, it is crucial to conduct longer-term investigations to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical benefits that r-TKA offers compared to conventional techniques. Through ongoing research and a greater embrace of robotic technology, we can continue to improve the quality of life for patients undergoing knee arthroplasty."
pub.1164421105,Increased accuracy in component positioning using an image-less robotic arm system in primary total knee arthroplasty: a retrospective study,"BackgroundRobotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) and navigated total knee arthroplasty (NTKA) have shown improved knee alignment and reduced radiographic outliers. Recent studies have proven that conventional mechanical alignment may not be the optimal goal for every patient. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of the planned implant positioning of a novel image-less robotic technique with an established navigated technique (NTKA).MethodThe study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data that compared the implant positioning and lower-limb alignment of 86 image-less RTKA with 86 image-less NTKA. Radiographic analysis was performed to evaluate the lower-limb overall alignment, femoral and tibial components positioning in the coronal and sagittal planes. Outliers were evaluated with a cutoff of ± 3°.ResultsNo difference was noted between the two groups for radiographic outliers within ± 3° from neutral (p = 0.098). The mean hip–knee–ankle angle deviation from target was 1.3° in the RTKA group compared to 1.9° in the NTKA (p < 0.001). Femoral sagittal deviation (femoral component flexion) was smaller in the RTKA group (0.9° vs 1.9°; p < 0.001). Similarly, tibial coronal deviation (0.8° vs 1.5°; p < 0.001) and tibial sagittal deviation (tibial slope) were smaller in the RTKA group compared to the NTKA group (0.9° vs 1.7°; p < 0.001).ConclusionsThe RTKA group reported a substantial and significant reduced error from the planned target angles for both tibial and femoral components. No difference in terms of radiographic outliers was noted between navigation and robotic assistance."
pub.1152060380,Imageless robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty is accurate in vivo: a retrospective study to measure the postoperative bone resection and alignment,"PurposeConventional instruments for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have limited accuracy. The occurrence of outliers can negatively influence the clinical outcome and long-term survival of the implant. Orthopaedic robotic systems were developed to increase the accuracy of implant positioning and bone resections. Several systems requiring preoperative imaging have shown a higher degree of precision compared to conventional instrumentation. An imageless system needs less preoperative time and preparation and is more cost effective. Aim of this study was to find out whether this system is as precise, reproduces accurately the surgeon's planning and reduces the occurrence of outliers.MethodsThis retrospective study included the first 71 robotic-assisted TKA and 308 conventional TKA in 374 patients. Intraoperatively planned and actual bone resections were compared. Postoperative alignment, measured on full leg weight bearing radiographs, was related to the respective planning and statistically compared between the groups.ResultsBaseline characteristics (age, BMI, ASA, preoperative Knee Society Score and deformity) between both groups were comparable. According to the planned alignment, the postoperative mean difference was – 1.01° in the robotic versus 2.05° in the conventional group. The maximum deviation was − 2/+ 2.5° in the robotic and – 6.6/ + 6.8° in the conventional group. According to the plan, there were no outliers above ± 3° in the robotic versus 24% in the conventional group.The mean difference between planned and measured bone resection was 0.21 mm with a maximum of 2 mm. The 95% confidence interval was at each position 1 mm or below.ConclusionsThe described imageless robotic system is accurate in terms of coronal alignment and bone resections. In precision, it is superior to conventional instrumentation and could therefore be used to evaluate new alignment concepts."
pub.1164494231,Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty utilizing a fluoroscopy-guided system resulted in improved intra-operative efficiency relative to a computerized tomography-based platform,"Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a computerized-tomography (CT) based workflow increases surgical time relative to traditional manual technique. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the intra-operative efficiencies of two robotic THA systems: a fluoroscopy-based platform (FL-RTHA) and a contemporary, CT-based (CT-RTHA) platform. A review of 107 consecutive FL-RTHA and 159 CT-RTHA primary, direct anterior approach (DAA) THA procedures was conducted. All cases were performed by one of two surgeons operating at the same institution, for a pre-operative diagnosis of osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Primary outcome variables included averages and consistencies (variances) for surgical times and operating room (OR) times. A secondary outcome was to quantify the duration of robot-active phases in the FL-RTHA workflow. The FL-RTHA cohort experienced shorter surgical times (38.71 min ± 7.00 vs. 75.33 min ± 11.38; p < 0.001) and OR times (101.35 min ± 12.22 vs. 156.74 min ± 17.79; p < 0.001) compared to the CT-RTHA cohort. Surgical times and OR times were both more consistent in the FL-RTHA cohort compared to the CT-RTHA cohort (p < 0.001). Patients who underwent DAA THA with the assistance of a fluoroscopy-based robotic system experienced shorter and more consistent surgical times and OR times compared to patients who underwent similar DAA THA procedures with a contemporary, CT-based robotic platform."
pub.1152822412,"The learning curve of imageless robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty with standardised laxity testing requires the completion of nine cases, but does not reach time neutrality compared to conventional surgery","Abstract
PurposeThe assistance of robot technology is introduced into the operating theatre to improve the precision of a total knee arthroplasty. However, as with all new technology, new technology requires a learning curve to reach adequate proficiency. The primary aim of this study was to identify the learning curve of an imageless robotic system with standardised laxity testing. The secondary aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the intra-operative coronal alignment during the learning curve.MethodsA prospective study was performed on 30 patients undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty with an imageless robotic system (Corin, Massachusetts, USA) associated with a dedicated standardised laxity testing device. The learning curve of all surgical steps was assessed with intra-operative video monitoring. As comparison, the total surgical time of the last 30 patients receiving conventional total knee arthroplasty by the same surgeon and with the same implant was retrospectively assessed. Coronal lower limb alignment was evaluated pre- and post-operatively on standing full-leg radiographs.ResultsCUSUM (cumulative summation) analysis has shown inflexion points in multiple steps associated with robot-assisted surgery between one and 16 cases, which indicates the progression from the learning phase to the proficiency phase. The inflexion point for total operative time occurred after nine cases. Robot-assisted total knee surgery required significantly longer operative times than the conventional counterpart, with an average increase of 22 min. Post-operative limb and implant alignment was not influenced by a learning curve.ConclusionThe introduction of an imageless robotic system with standardised laxity assessment for total knee arthroplasty results in a learning curve of nine cases based on operative time. Compared to conventional surgery, the surgeon is not able to reach time neutrality with the robotic platform. There is no learning curve associated with coronal limb or implant alignment. This study enables orthopaedic surgeons to understand the implementation of this surgical system and its specific workflow into clinical practice."
pub.1154992334,Functional Component Positioning in Total Hip Arthroplasty and the Role of Robotic-Arm Assistance in Addressing Spinopelvic Pathology,"Hip, spine, and pelvis function as a unified kinetic chain. Any spinal pathology, results in compensatory changes in the other components to accommodate for the reduced spinopelvic motion. The complex relationship between spinopelvic mobility and component positioning in total hip arthroplasty presents a challenge in achieving functional implant positioning. Patients with spinal pathology, especially those with stiff spines and little change in sacral slope, are at high instability risk. In this challenging subgroup, robotic-arm assistance enables the execution of a patient specific plan, avoiding impingement and maximizing range of motion; especially utilizing virtual range of motion to dynamically assess impingement."
pub.1145501153,Robotic-Assisted Versus Manual Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Time-Driven Activity-Based Cost Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RA-UKA) remains unclear. Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) has been shown to accurately reflect true resource utilization. This study aimed to compare true facility costs between RA-UKA and conventional UKA.
METHODS: We identified 265 consecutive UKAs (133 RA, 132 conventional) performed at a specialty hospital in 2016-2020. Itemized facility costs were calculated using TDABC. Separate analyses including and excluding implant costs were performed. Multiple regression was performed to determine the independent effect of robotic assistance on facility costs.
RESULTS: Due to longer operative time, RA-UKA patients had higher personnel costs and total facility costs ($2,270 vs $1,854, P < .001). Controlling for demographics and comorbidities, robotic assistance was associated with an increase in personnel costs of $399.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] $343.75-$454.74, P < .001), reduction in supply costs of $55.03 (95% CI $0.56-$109.50, P = .048), and increase in total facility costs of $344.27 (95% CI $265.24-$423.31, P < .001) per case. However, after factoring in implant costs, robotic assistance was associated with a reduction in total facility costs of $235.87 (95% CI $40.88-$430.85, P < .001) per case.
CONCLUSION: Using TDABC, overall facility costs were lower in RA-UKA despite a longer operative time. To facilitate wider adoption of this technology, implant manufacturers may negotiate lower implant costs based on volume commitments when robotic assistance is used. These supply cost savings appear to offset a portion of the increased costs. Nonetheless, further research is needed to determine if RA-UKA can improve clinical outcomes and create value in arthroplasty."
pub.1168799798,"Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty With an Imageless, Second-Generation Robotic System","BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty is increasingly used in revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA), with imageless systems recently receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. However, there remains a paucity of literature on the use of robotic assistance in revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This paper describes the imageless surgical technique for robotic revision TKA using a second-generation robotic system and details both intraoperative and 90-day outcomes.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 115 robotic revision TKAs from March 2021 to May 2023 at 3 tertiary academic centers. Patient demographics, perioperative surgical data, and 90-day outcomes were collected. Pain and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scores preoperatively and postoperatively were recorded. All-cause reoperations at the final follow-up were detailed. The mean patient age was 65 years (range, 43 to 88), and 58% were women. The mean follow-up time was 13 months (range, 3 to 51).
RESULTS: The most common indications for rTKA were instability (n = 37, 32%) and aseptic loosening (n = 42, 37%). There were 83 rTKAs to a posterior-stabilized liner, 22 to a varus-valgus constrained liner, and 5 to a hinged construct. The median polyethylene size was 11 (interquartile range, 10 to 13), and 93% of patients had their joint line restored within 5 millimeters of the native contralateral knee. Within the 90-day postoperative window, there were 8 emergency department visits and 2 readmissions. At the final follow-up, there were 5 reoperations and 2 manipulations under anesthesia. There were 4 patients who required irrigation and debridement after superficial wound dehiscence, and one had an arthrotomy disruption after a fall.
CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates favorable intraoperative and 90-day outcomes and suggests that imageless robotic surgery is a promising modality in rTKA. Further studies comparing the longitudinal outcomes after robotic and conventional rTKA are warranted."
pub.1155328047,The Impact of Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty on Resident Training,"BACKGROUND: As robotic-assisted total knee replacement (rTKA) continues to gain popularity, the impact of this technology on resident education remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to describe trainee experience and perceptions of rTKA and its effect on surgical training.
METHODS: Two hundred and twenty two senior orthopaedic residents attending a national board review course completed a 17-question survey regarding their experience and perceptions regarding rTKA. Mean and standard deviations were calculated for Likert scale questions, and bivariate analyses were utilized to compare answer groups.
RESULTS: Seventy percent of respondents reported exposure to rTKA during their training. Of those with robotic exposure, 20% reported that greater than half of their TKA experience involved robotics. Only 29% percent agreed that robotics improved outcomes, whereas 21% disagreed and the remainder were unsure. Over half of respondents agreed that robotics are used primarily for marketing purposes. Of those who trained with rTKA, 45% percent believed that robotics improved their understanding of the surgical procedure; however, 25% felt robotics negatively compromised their training with traditional instrumentation. Higher robotic case exposure (P = .001) and attending an industry-sponsored course (P = .02) was associated with the belief that robotics improved outcomes. Robotic case volume and percentage was associated with the belief that robotics improved understanding of the surgical procedure, however, it also was associated with reduced comfort performing traditional knee arthroplasty (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: Current resident training experience varies greatly within the United States with regards to rTKA. While exposure to rTKA may be beneficial for a well-rounded surgical education, over-exposure likely results in decreased comfort with traditional instrumentation."
pub.1173649998,Clinical Benefit of Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty over Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty When Using Mobile-Bearing Implants,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> As a treatment modality for advanced knee osteoarthritis, total knee arthroplasty is well established and has been performed on many patients over time. To improve surgical outcomes, fixed-bearing implant insertion with robotic-assisted TKA has been introduced; however, the insertion of mobile-bearing (MB) implants with the same method is challenging. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term postoperative follow-up outcomes of MB implant insertion using a robotic-assisted TKA system and conventional TKA. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> We investigated functional improvement in the knees of 60 patients who underwent the insertion of MB implants using either robotic-assisted TKA or conventional TKA. Isokinetic muscular function, range of motion, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and Knee Society Score (KSS) were measured 6 months after surgery. The statistical analysis of outcome measurements was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. <i>Results:</i> Some isokinetic muscular functions, as well as Knee Society Scores (pain and function) and VAS scores, were significantly higher in patients who underwent MB insertion with robotic-assisted TKA than in those who underwent conventional TKA. <i>Conclusions:</i> When an MB implant is inserted using a robotic-assisted TKA system, a better surgical outcome can be expected."
pub.1152661268,Robotics in Total Hip Arthroplasty: Current Concepts,"This current concepts article reviews the literature pertaining to the use of robot-assisted systems in total hip arthroplasty (THA). The bulk of the literature is regarding the MAKO (currently the most used system worldwide) and the historic ROBODOC robotic systems. There is a paucity of literature available on other systems, with several still in pilot-phase development. Whilst the evidence shows improved radiological outcomes with robotic THA, functional outcomes are equivocal between conventional and robotic techniques. Acceptance of robotic THA worldwide is limited by its accessibility including cost, and by already exceptional results with the conventional technique. It is, however, a rapidly developing area of orthopaedic surgery. This article discusses the history of robotics in THA, current surgical techniques, functional and radiological outcomes, and ongoing avenues for development."
pub.1154202275,Individualized alignment and ligament balancing technique with the ROSA® robotic system for total knee arthroplasty,"PurposeHigher patient’s expectations and dissatisfaction following total knee arthroplasty are well-documented phenomena. Despite the implications of different patients’ related factors both modifiable and nonmodifiable, in the last decade a lot of emphasis has been focused on surgical technique, implant alignment and stability both as a cause and a potential solution of several problems.MethodsDifferent alignment and balancing techniques have been recently described and the introduction of new technologies such as computer and robotic-assisted surgery have been the basis for their optimization. In this paper, the surgical technique of the ROSA Knee System will be described focusing on the potential alignment options and the ligament balancing technique. The current literature available about the system will also be analyzed.ResultsThe ROSA® robotic system have been recently introduced in the market and presents specific and peculiar features to optimize ligament balancing and an individualized alignment of the implant in a three dimensional prospective.DiscussionThe system is showing a favourable gap balancing technique and the possibility to create an individualized alignment.

pub.1166098838,The Use of Computer Navigation and Robotic Technology in Complex Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"Computer assisted surgical (CAS) navigation and robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) have the potential to improve the reproducibility of accurate component positioning and facilitate complex cases, including revision and preoperative deformity. Numerous studies, including multiple comparing technology with conventional THA control groups, suggest that CAS navigation may improve component accuracy in cases of deformity such as hip dysplasia and significant leg length discrepancy. Revision THA data is also encouraging but limited. The functional benefits compared to conventional techniques remain unclear. The evidence for robot-assisted THA in complex cases is more limited but also demonstrates utility. For complex cases, studies comparing results with conventional THA are not yet available. The limitations of these systems, including cost, operative time, learning curves, and possible complications, require further study. The available data for CAS navigation and robotic-assisted THA indicates that they may play a role in complex deformity and revision cases. Further high-quality randomized studies should be undertaken."
pub.1167657280,An evaluation of factors influencing the adoption and usage of robotic surgery in lower limb arthroplasty amongst orthopaedic trainees: a clinical survey,"BackgroundThe rise of robotics in orthopaedic training, driven by the demand for better training outcomes and patient care, presents specific challenges for junior trainees due to its novelty and steep learning curve. This paper explores how orthopaedic trainees perceive and adopt robotic-assisted lower limb arthroplasty.Methods The study utilised the UTUAT model questionnaire as the primary data collection tool, employing targeted questions on a five-point Likert scale to efficiently gather responses from a large number of participants. Data analysis was conducted using partial least squares (PLS), a well-established method in previous technology acceptance research. ResultThe findings indicate a favourable attitude amongst trainees towards adopting robotic technology in orthopaedic training. They acknowledge the potential advantages of improved surgical precision and patient outcomes through roboticassisted procedures. Social factors, including the views of peers and mentors, notably influence trainees’ decision-making. However, the availability of resources and expert mentors did not appear to have a significant impact on trainees’ intention to use robotic technology.ConclusionThe study contributes to the understanding of factors influencing trainees’ interest in robotic surgery and emphasises the importance of creating a supportive environment for its adoption."
pub.1166539795,Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: Workflow Optimization and Operative Times,".
Robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (RATHA) has been demonstrated to offer several benefits, such as increased accuracy in the placement of implants, improved patient outcomes and reduced complications such as dislocations in total hip arthroplasty. However, the potential increase in surgical time may sway some practitioners to hesitate adopting this technology, despite its benefits.  Studies of RATHA learning curves have demonstrated that time neutrality can be achieved, but do not describe an efficient workflow. This paper lays out a process to achieve an optimal RATHA workflow and efficiencies in an ambulatory surgery center and presents timing data from 105 cases.  We demonstrate that the learning curve for implementing RATHA can be navigated such that providers can offer the clinical benefits of RATHA to their patients without increasing operative or overall perioperative patient time."

pub.1166750309,Modern robotics platform associated with reduced 90-day complications in hospital setting,"BACKGROUND: Early complications in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) associated with modern robotics platforms integrated with digital balancing technology have not been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare 90-day complication rates between a manual technique and a modern robotic-assisted ligament balancing TKA platform.
METHODS: 895 primary TKA procedures from a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed (614 manual TKA, 281 using a modern robotics platform with an integrated digitally controlled ligament balancing device). Post-operative complications within the 90-day episode of care were recorded by the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative. Differences in complication rates between techniques were further divided into inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, and ambulatory surgery center (ASC) cohorts.
RESULTS: In the pooled hospital cohort and inpatient hospital cohort, 'Return to OR' was significantly lower for the robotic assisted group (1.3% vs 5.2% and 0% vs 4.9%, respectively, p< 0.0370). Specifically, the need for manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) was reduced for the robotics group (0.0% vs 2.5%, p= 0.0352). No differences in overall complication rate or cause of complication was found between manual and robotics cases for the hospital outpatient and ASC cohorts (p⩾ 0.68).
CONCLUSION: Within the hospital setting, robotic assisted ligament balancing technology was associated with reduced 90-day postoperative complications for 'Return to OR' and MUA."
pub.1149410588,A propensity score-matched comparison between Mako robotic arm-assisted system and conventional technique in total hip arthroplasty for patients with osteoarthritis secondary to developmental dysplasia of the hip,"BackgroundThe clinical effectiveness of robotic arm-assisted systems remains unclear for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients suffering from osteoarthritis secondary to developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).MethodsPatients with DDH who underwent primary THA were included in this study. We conducted a propensity score-matched comparison between THAs using a robotic arm-assisted system (Mako group) versus those using the manual procedure (manual group) to compare the absolute differences in cup placement angles measured using postoperative computed tomography and those planned preoperatively.ResultsA total of 217 patients with osteoarthritis due to DDH met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-four patients were matched as the Mako group and 84 as the manual group. The differences were smaller in the Mako group than the manual group in terms of both inclination and anteversion angles (1.1 ± 1.0 versus 4.2 ± 3.1, respectively; 95% CI, 2.4 to 3.8; p < 0.0001, and 1.2 ± 1.1 versus 5.8 ± 4.0, respectively; 95% CI, 3.7 to 5.5; p < 0.0001).ConclusionsThe robotic arm-assisted system may provide more accurate cup placement in THA for DDH."
pub.1168136579,Does robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty restore native joint line more accurately than with conventional instruments?,"The study's primary aim is the restoration of native joint line in patients having robotic-assisted unicondylar knee arthroplasty and conventional unicondylar knee arthroplasty. Literature in the past has demonstrated that reducing the joint line can result in greater failure rates. This is a prospective cohort investigation of patients who had medial UKA between March 2017 and March 2022.All patient’s pre-operative and post-operative radiological joint line assessments were examined by two observers by Weber's methods. Robotic-assisted UKA performed with hand-held image-free robots was compared to conventional UKA groups. The distal position of the femoral component was higher in Group B utilizing conventional tools than in Group A employing robotic-assisted UKA. This positional difference was statistically significant. The mean difference among the pre-operative and post-operative joint lines in Group A was 1.6 ± 0.49 (range 0.8 mm–2.4 mm), while it was 2.47 ± 0.51 (range 1.6 mm–3.9 mm) (p 0.005) in Group B. In Group A, a greater percentage of the subjects (64%) attained a femoral component position within two millimeters from the joint line, whereas just 18% in Group B did. When compared with the conventional UKA technique, the meticulous attention to detail and planning for ligament rebalancing when using the robotic-assisted UKA technique not solely enhance surgical precision for implant placing but additionally provides excellent native joint line restoration and balancing. For validation of its longevity and survivability, the cohort must be tracked for a longer period of time."
pub.1164901757,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Conventional Versus Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"This study aims to compare the outcomes and advantages of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed using conventional surgical techniques with those conducted using robotic-assisted methods in terms of operation time, Oxford knee score, range of motion, tourniquet time, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis index. We performed a literature search through five databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, from inception until July 3, 2023. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohorts comparing conventional TKA with robotic-assisted TKA were included. The risk of bias of the included RCTs was determined using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the National Institutes of Health tool for cohort studies. We conducted a meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.4. To analyze continuous data, we calculated the mean difference (MD) along with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). By synthesizing data from a comprehensive analysis, the study unveiled noteworthy distinctions between robotic-assisted arthroplasty and conventional arthroplasty across critical parameters. First, a substantial alteration in the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle was observed, with the robotic-assisted approach demonstrating a significant difference (MD = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.25-1.43, p = 0.005). Second, in terms of operative time, a notable reduction in surgical duration was noted with conventional TKA (MD = 16.85, 95% CI = 8.08-25.63, p = 0.0002). The assessment of tourniquet time exhibited a significantly longer duration for robotic-assisted arthroplasty (MD = 35.70, 95% CI = 27.80-43.61, p < 0.001). Our findings indicate that conventional TKA outperforms robotic-assisted TKA, primarily due to its shorter operative and tourniquet times, along with a more favorable change in the HKA angle. However, it is worth noting that robotic-assisted TKA showed a slight advantage in pain outcomes, although this advantage was not statistically significant. To gain a more comprehensive understanding, we recommend conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial that directly compares both TKA methods. This trial should evaluate costs and long-term outcomes while ensuring consistent follow-up durations among studies. Such an approach would greatly assist orthopedic decision-making and contribute to improved TKA outcomes."
pub.1150184113,Robotic‐arm assisted total knee arthroplasty has a learning curve of 16 cases and increased operative time of 12 min,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-arm assisted systems are increasingly used for knee arthroplasty, however introduction of new systems can involve a learning curve. We aimed to define the learning curve in terms of operative time and component placement/sizing of a robotic system for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in a team of experienced surgeons, and to investigate mid-term patient outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 101 consecutive patients underwent primary robotic-arm assisted TKA by three surgeons (mean 2 year follow-up). Operative times, component placement, implant sizing and reoperations were recorded. Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) was used to analyse learning curves. Patient outcomes were compared between learning and proficiency phases.
RESULTS: The learning curve was 16 cases, with a 12-min increase in operative time (P < 0.01). Once proficiency was achieved, the greatest time reductions were seen for navigation registration (P = 0.003) and bone preparation (P < 0.0001). A learning curve was found with polyethylene (PE) insert sizing (P = 0.01). No differences were found between learning and proficiency groups in terms of implant survival (100% and 97%, respectively, NS) or patient-reported outcome measures at 2 years (NS).
CONCLUSION: Introduction of a robotic-arm assisted system for TKA led to increased operative times for navigation registration and bone preparation, and a learning curve with PE insert sizing. No difference in patient outcomes between learning and proficiency groups at 2 years was found. These findings can inform surgeons' expectations when starting to use robotic-assisted systems."
pub.1150020881,Is Robotic-Assisted Technology Still Accurate in Total Hip Arthroplasty for Fibrous-Fused Hips?,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) for fibrous-fused hips is technically demanding. This study aimed to evaluate the precision and accuracy, as well as the rate of conversion of robotic-assisted THA in such difficult patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 67 patients (84 hips) who underwent THA with fibrous-fused hips between August 2018 and June 2021 at our institution. Demographics, acetabular cup positioning, leg-length discrepancies, and postoperative Harris hip scores were recorded for all patients. Thirty-six patients (44 hips) who underwent robotic-assisted THA and 31 patients (40 hips) who underwent manual THA were enrolled in this study.
RESULTS: The robot accurately executed the preoperative plan, and there were no statistically significant differences between the preoperative planned anteversion, inclination, and postoperative measurements. In the robotic group, the percentage of acetabular cups in the safe zone was significantly higher than in the manual group (87.2 versus 55%, respectively, P = .042). The rate of conversion to manual THA for various reasons in the robotic-assisted THA group was 11.4% (5/44). Compared with manual THA, the mean increase in operative time for conversion from robotic-assisted to manual THA was 24 min (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: In patients who have fibrous-fused hips, preoperative planning can be accurately executed by robotic-assisted technology. Compared with manual THA, robotic-assisted THA had a remarkable advantage in improving the frequency of achieving cup positioning within the target zone. Overall, robotic-assisted technology was helpful in such difficult cases, and the approximately 11.4% of cases converted to manual THA are reminders that surgeons should be thoroughly prepared preoperatively."
pub.1166389666,Learning curve analysis of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty with a Chinese surgical system,"PurposeThe aim of this study was to analyze the learning curve of total operative time, bone cutting accuracy, and limb alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a Chinese image-based knee surgery robot known as HURWA. Additionally, a comparison was conducted with conventional TKA to ascertain the benefits of robotic-assisted TKA.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we analyzed a series of patients (n = 90) who underwent robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty using the HURWA robot between December 2021 and October 2022. The procedures were performed by one of three orthopedic surgeons with varying levels of experience. As a control group, we selected the last 30 conventional TKA cases performed by each of these three surgeons. To determine the learning curve, we recorded the operative time, bone cutting error, and pre- and post-surgery radiographs.ResultsThe study found no significant differences in total operative time, bone cutting accuracy, or limb alignment among the three surgeons. Of the three surgeons, surgeon 1, who had the most experience in joint arthroplasty, reached the learning curve in case 8, with the shortest bone cutting time and robot time. Surgeon 2 reached the learning curve in case 16, while surgeon 3 reached the learning curve in case 9. There was no observable learning curve effect for bone cutting accuracy and limb alignment. However, the percentage of cases where limb alignment differed from preoperative planning by 3° or less was higher in robotic-assisted TKA (77.97%) than in conventional TKA (47.19%).ConclusionThe study determined that the learning curve for robotic-assisted TKA using the HURWA knee surgery robot ranged from 8 to 20 cases. No observable learning curve effect was detected for bone cutting accuracy or limb alignment. Experienced surgeons using the HURWA robot for bone cutting took less time and reached the learning curve earlier. The HURWA robot achieved better limb alignment without depending on the experience of conventional TKA."

pub.1170447853,Study on impact of robotic-assisted orthopaedic industrial noise (SIREN),"IntroductionThe aim of this study was to evaluate noise exposure to the operating room staff consisting of the surgeon, assistant, anaesthetist and Mako Product Specialist (MPS) during Mako robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). We aimed to determine whether employees were exposed to noise at or above a lower exposure action value (LEAV) set out by the Noise at Work Regulations 2005, Health and Safety Executive (HSE), UK.Materials and methodsWe prospectively recorded intra-operative noise levels in Mako robotic-arm assisted TKA and THA over a period of two months using the MicW i436 connected to an iOS device (Apple), using the Sound Level Meter App (iOS) by the National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (NIOSH). Data obtained was then used to calculate “worst case” daily exposure value to assess if sound levels were compliant with UK guidelines. Comparison between operating room staff groups was performed with ANOVA testing.ResultsA total of 19 TKA and 11 THA operations were recorded. During TKA, for the primary surgeon and the assistant, the equivalent continuous sound pressure level (LAeq) was over 80 dB, exceeding the LEAV set out by the Noise at Work Regulations by HSE. During THA, the average LAeq and peak sound pressure levels did not exceed the LEAV. The calculated daily exposure for the primary surgeon in TKA was 82 dB. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that LAeq was statistically significantly lower in the anaesthetist and MPS (p < .001) compared to the primary surgeon and assistant in both TKA and THA.ConclusionsOperating room staff, particularly the primary surgeon and assistant are exposed to significant levels of noise during Mako robotic-arm assisted TKA and THA. Formal assessments should be performed to further assess the risk of noise induced hearing loss in robotic-arm assisted arthroplasty."
pub.1156149140,"Equivalent radiation exposure with robotic total hip replacement using a novel, fluoroscopic-guided (CT-free) system: case–control study versus manual technique","Accurate and precise positioning of the acetabular cup remains a prevalent challenge in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Robotic assistance for THA has increased over the past decade due to the potential to improve the accuracy of implant placement. However, a common criticism of existing robotic systems is the requirement for preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans. This additional imaging increases patient radiation exposure, as well as cost, and requires pin placement during surgery. The goal of this study was to analyze the radiation burden associated with a novel, CT-free robotic THA system compared to an unassisted manual THA approach (n = 100/arm). On average, the study cohort had a higher number of fluoroscopic images captured (7.5 vs. 4.3 images; p < 0.001), radiation dose (3.0 vs. 1.0 mGy; p < 0.001), and a longer duration of radiation exposure (18.8 vs. 6.3 s; p < 0.001), per procedure, than the control group. Additionally, no learning curve was detected by CUSUM analysis with respect to the number of fluoroscopic images taken during the adoption of the robotic THA system. While statistically significant, in comparison to published literature, the radiation exposure of the CT-free robotic THA system was comparable to that of unassisted manual THA approach and less than that of CT-based robotic approaches. Thus, the novel CT-free robotic system likely poses no clinically significant increase in radiation exposure to the patient compared to manual approaches."

This study compared postoperative pain, complications, and costs between patients undergoing raTKA and cTKA using large, propensity score-matched cohorts. We hypothesize that the raTKA cohort will be associated with lower pain, lower anemia, and similar cost and other complications.MethodsA commercially available patient database was used for this study. Patients with raTKA and cTKA were identified with current procedural terminology and international classification of diseases (ICD-9/ICD-10) codes. Exclusions and propensity score matching were applied to mitigate confounding bias. Complication rates, costs, and postoperative opioid uses were then compared between groups.ResultsCompared with patients with cTKAs (n = 31,105), patients with raTKAs (n = 6,221) had less postoperative opioid use (p < 0.01), lower rates of postoperative acute renal failure (OR 0.71; p < 0.01), anemia (OR 0.75; p < 0.01), and periprosthetic joint infection (OR 0.59; p = 0.04), and lower index costs ($875 vs. $1,169, p < 0.01).ConclusionRaTKA was associated with less postoperative pain and complications compared with cTKA."

pub.1165039916,Length of stay and discharge dispositions following robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty versus conventional technique and predictors of delayed discharge,"Aims: In-hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge dispositions following arthroplasty could act as surrogate measures for improvement in patient pathways, and have major cost saving implications for healthcare providers. With the ever-growing adoption of robotic technology in arthroplasty, it is imperative to evaluate its impact on LOS. The objectives of this study were to compare LOS and discharge dispositions following robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RO TKA) and unicompartmental arthroplasty (RO UKA) versus conventional technique (CO TKA and UKA).
Methods: This large-scale, single-institution study included patients of any age undergoing primary TKA (n = 1,375) or UKA (n = 337) for any cause between May 2019 and January 2023. Data extracted included patient demographics, LOS, need for post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) admission, anaesthesia type, readmission within 30 days, and discharge dispositions. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were also employed to identify factors and patient characteristics related to delayed discharge.
Results: The median LOS in the RO TKA group was 76 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 54 to 104) versus 82.5 (IQR 58 to 127) in the CO TKA group (p < 0.001) and 54 hours (IQR 34 to 77) in the RO UKA versus 58 (IQR 35 to 81) in the CO UKA (p = 0.031). Discharge dispositions were comparable between the two groups. A higher percentage of patients undergoing CO TKA required PACU admission (8% vs 5.2%; p = 0.040).
Conclusion: Our study showed that robotic arm assistance was associated with a shorter LOS in patients undergoing primary UKA and TKA, and no difference in the discharge destinations. Our results suggest that robotic arm assistance could be advantageous in partly addressing the upsurge of knee arthroplasty procedures and the concomitant healthcare burden; however, this needs to be corroborated by long-term cost-effectiveness analyses and data from randomized controlled studies."
pub.1175606730,Enhancing total knee arthroplasty outcomes: the role of individualized femoral sagittal alignment in robotic-assisted surgery - A randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundOptimal sagittal alignment of the femoral prosthesis is critical to the success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). While robotic-assisted TKA can improve alignment accuracy, the efficacy of default femoral alignment versus individualized alignment remains under scrutiny. This study aimed to compare the differences in prosthetic alignment, anatomical restoration, and clinical outcomes between individualized femoral sagittal alignment and default sagittal alignment in robotic-assisted TKA.MethodsIn a prospective randomised controlled trial, 113 patients (120 knees) underwent robotic-assisted TKA were divided into two groups: 61 with individualized femoral flexion (individualized alignment group) and 59 with default 3–5° flexion (default alignment group). The individualized alignment was based on the distal femoral sagittal anteverted angle (DFSAA), defined as the angle between the mechanical and distal anatomical axes of the femur. The radiographic and clinical outcomes were compared.ResultsDespite similar postoperative femoral flexion angles between groups (P = 0.748), the individualized alignment group exhibited significantly lower incidences of femoral prosthesis extension and higher rates of optimal 0–3° prosthesis flexion (9.8% vs. 27.1%, P = 0.014,78.7% vs. 55.9%, p = 0.008, respectively). The individualized alignment group also demonstrated more favourable changes in sagittal anatomy, with higher maintenance of postoperative anterior femoral offset within 1 mm (54.1% vs. 33.9%, P = 0.026) and posterior condylar offset within 1 mm and 2 mm (44.3% vs. 25.4%, p = 0.031,73.8% vs. 50.8%, p = 0.010, respectively). Although slight improvement in the Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score (HSS) at three months was observed (P = 0.045), it did not reach a minimal clinically important difference.ConclusionIndividualized tailoring of femoral sagittal alignment in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) enhances prosthetic alignment and anatomical restoration, suggesting potential improvements in postoperative outcomes."

A consecutive series of 81 TKAs were performed in 59 patients using a robotic-assisted system (Mako) at our hospital. The mean follow-up period was 1.1 years (range, 1-1.2 years). No periprosthetic fracture at a pin tracker site was reported at a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. No patients reported minor or major complications associated with the distal femoral pins. In addition, unicortical pin-site drilling marks in all patients disappeared on one-postoperative-year follow-up radiographs. Our technique, which used unicortical pin placement in the distal femur in robotic-assisted TKA, demonstrated that it was a safe and reliable method at a minimum follow-up period of 1 year.

pub.1149334900,Prospective randomized controlled trial on the accuracy of prosthesis positioning in total hip arthroplasty assisted by a newly designed whole-process robotic arm,"Abstract
IntroductionThe purpose of this article is to study whether the newly designed whole-process total hip arthroplasty (THA) robotic arm can improve the accuracy of prosthesis placement in THA.MethodIn this study, 72 patients undergoing THA were prospectively included and randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was treated with THA assisted by a newly designed robotic arm. The control group received THA with conventional surgical methods. The imaging data were compared after operation.ResultCompared with the conventional operation, the whole-process robotic arm can more accurately place the acetabular prosthesis in the anteversion safe zone of 5 ~ 25°, but in terms of the inclination angle, whether the reference is the safe zone of 30 ~ 50° or 30 ~ 45°, there is no statistical difference between the two groups. The average lower limb length discrepancy (LLLD) in the experimental group was 3.77 ± 8.31 mm longer than contralateral side, while the counterpart in the control group was 8.39 ± 9.11 mm, with significant difference (P = 0.029). The femoral prosthesis was fixed in neutral position in 35 (100%) cases in the experimental group and only 30 (83.3%) in the control group (P = 0.036). There was no significant difference in the recovery of hip offset, femoral anteversion, and canal fill ratio (CFR) between the two groups.ConclusionRobotic arm can improve the accuracy of anteversion of acetabular cup, restore the consistency of the length of lower limbs, and more accurately implant the femoral prosthesis to the neutral position in the coronal position.Clinical trial registration numberChiCTR2100044124 (date of registration: 2021–3-11)."
pub.1157574288,The learning curve to ROSA: cases needed to match the surgery time between a robotic-assisted and a manual primary total knee arthroplasty,"PurposeLimited published data regarding the ROSA (Robotic Surgical Assistant) learning curve exist. This study evaluated the number of cases needed for an expert orthopaedic surgeon to master the ROSA system and match the operative time of robotic (raTKAs) and manual primary total knee arthroplasties (mTKAs).MethodsThis retrospective comparative cohort study included two hundred patients with primary knee osteoarthritis. The study group consisted of an expert surgeon’s first 100 raTKAs. The control group included 100 patients that underwent mTKAs from the same surgeon during the same period. The consecutive cases in each group were divided into ten subgroups, each of 10 cases. The groups were comparable concerning age, sex, BMI and Kellgren–Lawrence classification. We compared each subgroup's operative time and complications in mTKA and raTKA groups. We performed a cumsum analysis to construct the ROSA learning curve.
ResultsThe first non-significant difference between the mTKAs and raTKAs operative times was observed in the subgroup of 62 to 71 cases. Till then, the operative time has been significantly lower for the mTKA than the raTKA group. The following groups of tens analysis (8th, 9th and 10th) showed no operative time difference between groups. The learning curve analysis demonstrated that the surgeon switched to the mastering phase from case 73 onwards. The two groups had no complication rate differences.
ConclusionOur study demonstrated that about 70 cases are necessary for a senior surgeon to balance operative time between mTKAs and raTKAs using the ROSA system."
pub.1164970521,Disparities in Access to Robotic Knee Arthroplasty: A Geospatial Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The utilization of robotic knee arthroplasty (RKA) continues to increase across the United States. The aim of this geospatial analysis was to elucidate if RKA is distributed uniformly across the United States or if disparities exist in patient access.
METHODS: Publicly available provider-finding functions for 5 major manufacturers of RKA systems were used to obtain the practice locations of surgeons performing RKA along with their associated RKA system manufacturer. The average travel distance for each county to the nearest RKA surgeon was calculated and Moran's index clustering analysis was used to find hotspots and coldspots of RKA access. A logistic regression model was used to identify the predictive odds ratios between robotic hotspots and coldspots with county-level sociodemographic variables. Of the 34,216 currently practicing orthopedic surgeons in 2022, 2,571 have access to robotic assistance for knee arthroplasty.
RESULTS: Hotspots of increased travel time were predominantly in West South Central and West North Central census regions. Hotspots were significantly more rural and consisted of predominantly White populations, with lower median income and health insurance coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study align with existing literature, demonstrating absolute geographic access disparities for rural and economically disadvantaged populations. Additionally, relative access disparities persist for minority populations and individuals with high comorbidity burdens residing in urban areas."
pub.1167023559,The Relative Importance of Factors That Applicants Weigh When Ranking Adult Reconstruction Fellowships as Well as Their Perspectives on Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic Surgery Fellowship programs offer highly specialized training that varies based on the training environment and surgical experience. Additionally, for Adult Reconstruction programs, robotic-assisted surgery exposure has been a widely discussed topic. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative value of various factors to Adult Hip and Knee Fellowship applicants, and their perceptions of robotic-assisted arthroplasty.
METHODS: We surveyed 780 applicants who applied to our fellowship to matriculate in 2020 to 2024. We received 158 responses (20.3% response rate). We assessed factors concerning people and perceptions, logistics, salary and benefits, program reputation and curriculum, and surgical experience. Additionally, we surveyed fellows' attitudes toward using robotic surgery and its impact on patient outcomes.
RESULTS: The highest-rated factors were Level of Hands-On Operative Experience (4.83), Revision Hip Volume (4.72), Revision Knee Volume (4.71), Multiple Surgical Exposures to the Hip (4.59), and Clinical Case Variety (4.59). Respondents who were postfellowship matriculation placed significantly more value on Exposure to Multiple Attendings with Surgical Diversity (P = .01), and Anterior Hip Volume (P = .04), and less value on Geographic Location (P = .04) and Patient-Specific Instrumentation (P = .02) than prematriculates. Overall, 65% of applicants plan to or currently use robotics, 7.6% do not, and 27.2% said ""Maybe"". Those who plan to or currently use robotics most cited procedure fidelity, patient-preference, and marketability as reasons to use robotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Hands-on surgical experience and revision volume were the most important factors for fellowship applicants. Applicants placed lower importance on robotics exposure and their perspectives on robotics in their future practice were highly variable. Our results will inform fellowship programs and future applicants what previous applicants have valued in their training to help guide fellowship program structure, resource management, as well as recruitment."
pub.1157794621,Ten-Year Survivorship and Patient Satisfaction Following Robotic-Arm-Assisted Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been shown to result in high short- and mid-term survivorship. However, it is not known whether these outcomes are maintained at long-term follow-up. This study aimed to evaluate long-term implant survivorship, modes of failure, and patient satisfaction following robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA.
METHODS: A prospective multicenter study of 474 consecutive patients (531 knees) undergoing robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA was conducted. A cemented, fixed-bearing system with a metal-backed onlay tibial implant was used in all cases. Patients were contacted at 10-year follow-up to determine implant survivorship and satisfaction. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier models.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 366 patients (411 knees) with a mean follow-up of 10.2 ± 0.4 years. A total of 29 revisions were reported, corresponding to a 10-year survivorship of 91.7% (95% confidence interval, 88.8% to 94.6%). Of all revisions, 26 UKAs were revised to total knee arthroplasty. Unexplained pain and aseptic loosening were the most commonly reported modes of failure, accounting for 38% and 35% of revisions, respectively. Of patients without revision, 91% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their overall knee function.
CONCLUSIONS: This prospective multicenter study found high 10-year survivorship and patient satisfaction following robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA. Pain and fixation failure remained common causes for revision following cemented fixed-bearing medial UKA, despite the use of a robotic-arm-assisted technique. Prospective comparative studies are needed to assess the clinical value of robotic assistance over conventional techniques in UKA.

pub.1165448554,Robotic arm-assisted unicondylar knee arthroplasty resulted in superior radiological accuracy: a propensity score-matched analysis,"IntroductionUnicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an effective surgical treatment for medial compartment arthritis of the knee, yet surgical outcomes are directly related to surgical execution. Robotic arm-assisted surgery aims to address these difficulties by allowing for detailed preoperative planning, real-time intraoperative assessment and haptic-controlled bone removal. This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes between conventional manual mobile bearing and robot arm-assisted fixed bearing medial UKA in our local population.Materials and methodsThis is a retrospective case–control study of 148 UKAs performed at an academic institution with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. 74 robotic arm-assisted UKAs were matched to 74 conventional UKAs via propensity score matching. Radiological outcomes included postoperative mechanical axis and individual component alignment. Clinical parameters included a range of motion, Knee Society knee score and functional assessment taken before, 6 and 12 months after the operation.ResultsRobot arm-assisted UKA produced a more neutral component coronal alignment in both femoral component (robotic -0.2 ± 2.8, manual 2.6 ± 2.3; P = 0.043) and tibial component (robotic -0.3 ± 4.0, manual 1.7 ± 5.3; P < 0.001). While the postoperative mechanical axis was comparable, robot arm-assisted UKA demonstrated a smaller posterior tibial slope (robotic 5.7 ± 2.7, manual 8.2 ± 3.3; P = 0.02). Clinical outcomes did not show any statistically significant differences.ConclusionCompared with conventional UKA, robotic arm-assisted UKA demonstrated improved component alignment and comparable clinical outcomes. Improved radiological accuracy with robotic-arm assistance demonstrated promising early results."
pub.1181304315,Does Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Improve Alignment and Outcomes?,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) continues to increase in popularity as an excellent option for patients with single compartment disease. Robotic-assisted UKA has emerged as an optional tool with hopes for improvement in component placement, limb alignment, and patient outcomes. Furthermore, as patients continue to educate themselves, robotic assistance will become increasingly prevalent. There are now various robotic platforms on the market, each with varying differences, and more published data is emerging on alignment and outcomes. The literature to date largely concludes that robotic-assisted UKA provides more accuracy when compared to manual UKA. Short to mid-term outcomes may be improved with robotic UKA, but definitive differences in outcomes is uncertain. Survivorship with robotic UKA is non-inferior to reported manual UKA survivorship rates, and more long-term data is needed to fully elucidate this point. Orthopaedic surgeons should weigh these potential advantages against the drawbacks including cost and operative time when making a decision about whether robotic technology is right for their practice."

Hundred and four patients were randomly assigned to two groups—the robotic-assisted THA group (RAS group) and the conventional THA group (CON group). The preoperative and postoperative Harris Hip score (HHS), acetabular inclination, anteversion, femoral offset, and leg length discrepancy (LLD) were compared. During the follow-up, no patients had any complications that could be associated with the use of the robot. The proportion of acetabular cups in the safety zone was significantly higher in the RAS group than that in the CON group. The two groups had significantly different mean absolute difference of inclination and anteversion. There was no significant difference in the postoperative HHSs, changes in HHSs, femoral offset, and lower limb length between the two groups. The seven-axis robotic-assisted THA system is safe and effective, and leads to better acetabulum cup positioning compared to conventional THA.

In August 2023, the following databases were accessed: PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase with no additional filters or time constraints. All the clinical studies investigating functional alignment in robotic TKA were accessed. Only studies published in peer-reviewed journals were considered. The risk of bias was evaluated following the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) were evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomised Studies of Interventions (NRSI) (ROBINS-I) tool.ResultsData from 1198 patients (seven studies) were retrieved. The mean length of the follow-up was 17.1 ± 6.4 months. The mean age was 67.2 ± 5.4 years, and the mean BMI was 30.9 ± 2.7 kg/m2.ConclusionFA might improve resection accuracy, implant alignment, and gap balancing in TKA, and additional high-quality clinical trials are necessary to properly establish the superiority of FA to other alignment techniques in TKA.

The purpose of this study was to compare the change in JL position between robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) and conventional TKA (C-TKA).MethodsA retrospective, radiographic analysis was conducted of patients who underwent RA-TKA and C-TKA to compare JL position change. JL position was measured in consecutive RA-TKAs and C-TKAs performed by four fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons. Statistical analysis was done utilizing t-tests and Mann Whitney U tests, with statistical significance being defined as a p value < 0.05.ResultsSix hundred total RA-TKAs and 400 total C-TKAs were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in patient baseline characteristics such as body mass index, range of motion, and tibiofemoral coronal alignment. RA-TKAs were associated with an average of 0.04 (2.2) mm JL position change, and C-TKAs were associated with an average 0.5 (3.2) mm JL position change (p = 0.030). There were inter-surgeon differences when comparing the change in JL position for RA-TKAs and C-TKAs between the four participating surgeons.ConclusionRA-TKA leads to better preservation of the JL position than C-TKA, and this seems to be dependent on the arthroplasty surgeon’s preferences and techniques during TKA. Whether this statistically significant difference is clinically relevant needs to be further investigated."
pub.1150594516,Comparison of CT with intra-operative navigation reported implant position utilising a robotic assisted technique in total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Validation of navigated total knee arthroplasty (TKA) systems assists clinicians in making treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to independently review a navigation assisted robotic system for use in TKA.
METHODS: We evaluated 87 patients (92 knees) undergoing robotic assisted TKA. Position estimated by the navigation software and postoperative CT scan were compared. Post-operative CT scans were interpreted by a senior radiologist blinded to intra-operative component position. Recorded were femoral varus/valgus, tibial varus/valgus and overall limb alignment in the coronal plane. In the sagittal plane tibial slope and femoral flexion/extension. Femoral component rotation was assessed in relation to the transepicondylar axis (TEA).
RESULTS: Mean difference between software estimation and postoperative CT scan of the femoral component position in the coronal plane was 1.02° (0.86-1.18, 95%CI). Tibial coronal position was 1.19° (0.97-1.41). Sagittal plane component position for the femur was 1.64° (1.41-1.87). Tibial slope was 1.44° (1.21-1.68). Mean femoral component rotation was 1.27° (1.01-1.53). Overall 94.57% of intraoperative measures were within 3° of the component position measured on CT.
CONCLUSION: Robotic assisted navigation used in combination with a novel balancing system can result in very accurate component positioning during total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1135414878,Robotic total knee arthroplasty: A missed opportunity for cost savings in Bundled Payment for Care Improvement initiatives?,"BACKGROUND: The use of robotic total knee arthroplasty has become increasingly prevalent. Proponents of robotic total knee arthroplasty tout its potential to not only improve outcomes, but also to reduce costs compared with traditional total knee arthroplasty. Despite its potential to deliver on the value proposition, whether robotic total knee arthroplasty has led to improved outcomes and cost savings within Medicare's Bundled Payment for Care Improvement initiative remains unexplored.
METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries who underwent total knee arthroplasty designated under Medicare severity diagnosis related group 469 or 470 in the year 2017 were identified using the 100% Medicare Inpatient Standard Analytic Files. Hospitals participating in the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement were identified using the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement analytic file. We calculated risk-adjusted, price-standardized payments for the surgical episode from admission through 90-days postdischarge. Outcomes, utilization, and spending were assessed relative to variation between robotic and traditional total knee arthroplasty.
RESULTS: Overall, 198,371 patients underwent total knee arthroplasty (traditional total knee arthroplasty: n= 194,020, 97.8% versus robotic total knee arthroplasty: n = 4,351, 2.2%). Among the 3,272 hospitals that performed total knee arthroplasty, only 300 (9.3%) performed robotic total knee arthroplasty. Among the 183 participating in the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement, only 40 (19%) hospitals performed robotic total knee arthroplasty. Risk-adjusted 90-day episode spending was $14,263 (95% confidence interval $14,231-$14,294) among patients who underwent traditional total knee arthroplasty versus $13,676 (95% confidence interval $13,467-$13,885) among patients who had robotic total knee arthroplasty. Patients who underwent robotic total knee arthroplasty had a shorter length of stay (traditional total knee arthroplasty: 2.3 days, 95% confidence interval: 2.3-2.3 versus robotic total knee arthroplasty: 1.9 days, 95% confidence interval: 1.9-2.0), as well as a lower incidence of complications (traditional total knee arthroplasty: 3.3%, 95% confidence interval: 3.2-3.3 versus robotic total knee arthroplasty: 2.7%, 95% confidence interval: 2.3-3.1). Of note, patients who underwent robotic total knee arthroplasty were less often discharged to a postacute care facility than patients who underwent traditional total knee arthroplasty (traditional total knee arthroplasty: 32.4%, 95% confidence interval: 32.3-32.5 versus robotic total knee arthroplasty: 16.8%, 95% confidence interval 16.1-17.6).

pub.1181287027,Are all robotic technologies created equal? Comparing one of the latest image-free robotic technologies to all other robotic systems for total knee arthroplasty,"BackgroundRobotic-assisted technologies have been developed to increase surgical precision and reduce surgical variability in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Several different robotic systems have been introduced in the last decade for TKA. The DePuy Synthes VELYS™ Robotic-Assisted Solution (VRAS) is an imageless system designed to eliminate the need for preoperative CT scans and is one of the latest entrants in the rapidly evolving field of robotic technology in TKA. This study compared the clinical and economic outcomes associated with VRAS and other robotic-assisted technologies for primary TKA.MethodsA retrospective cohort study using the Premier Healthcare Database included patients who underwent primary TKA with VRAS or other robotic-assisted technologies from January 1, 2022, to April 30, 2023. The primary outcome for the study was hospital follow-up visits (revisits) within 90 days post-TKA. Secondary outcomes included readmission and revision rates within 90 days post-TKA, operating room time, length of stay, discharge status and hospital costs. Cohorts were balanced using propensity score fine stratification, and generalized linear models were constructed to evaluate outcomes.ResultsThis study included 827 VRAS TKA patients and 16,428 TKA patients treated with other robotic-assisted technologies. The 90-day all-cause and knee-related revisit rates were significantly lower for VRAS than for other robotic-assisted technologies (all-cause 13.9% vs. 22.8% and knee-related 2.8% vs. 5.4%, respectively; p value < 0.01). The all-cause and knee-related 90-day readmission rates were also lower for VRAS, although the differences were not statistically significant. The 90-day revision rates were similar for VRAS and other robotic-assisted technologies (0.48% vs. 0.45%), as was the operating room time (138 vs. 137 min). The 90-day knee-related cost for the VRAS cohort was $15,048 compared to $16,867 for other robotic technologies.ConclusionsThis database study demonstrated that early postoperative revisit rates and total cost of care are lower for VRAS than for all other robotic-assisted technologies for TKA, while operating room time and discharge status were similar. These are important findings in ever-evolving healthcare systems that are increasingly cost conscious and cognizant of principles associated with value-based care."
pub.1157914032,Acetabular cup placement and offset control in robotic total hip arthroplasty performed through the modified anterolateral approach,"PurposeThe modified anterolateral approach (Röttinger) for total hip arthroplasty (THA) offers great advantages over conventional approaches, especially concerning early postoperative symptoms, which are mild and well tolerated by patients. Robotic-assisted implantation might facilitate rapid adoption of the modified anterolateral approach without exposing surgeons to risks encountered during the learning curve. This study posits that the use of robotic assistance in conjunction with the modified anterolateral approach for total hip arthroplasty (THA) can provide a substantial enhancement in the accuracy of cup placement in comparison to manual surgery.MethodsThirty-two robotic-assisted THAs met the inclusion criteria and were matched to 32 conventional cases. Acetabular cup inclination, anteversion, limb-length discrepancy, and acetabular offset were assessed using certified planning software by two independent observers using pre- and postoperative anterior–posterior radiographs. Data was analyzed for normal distribution. Chi2 test was used to determine whether implanted acetabular cups that were within Lewinnek’s safe zones were influenced by type of implantation. Effect size estimates and statistical power analysis were also performed to appreciate the appropriateness of the chosen sample size.ResultsRobotic-assisted implantation was found to significantly improve acetabular cup placement in terms of inclination (p < 0.001) but not anteversion (p = 0.783). Although mean postoperative limb-length discrepancy and mean acetabular offset did not differ between groups, a significantly smaller variance was found in the robotic-assisted group (p < 0.001) and (p = 0.04), respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of consistently implanting the acetabular cup within the Lewinnek safe zones p = 0.641 for anteversion and p = 0.230 for inclination, respectively.ConclusionsOur results show that although robotic-assisted acetabular cup implantation performed through the modified anterolateral approach did not significantly differ from conventional implantation, it did offer increased accuracy in cup positioning, acetabular bone preservation, and limb-length restoration."
pub.1174799969,Robot-Assisted Patellofemoral Arthroplasty,"Background: Patellofemoral arthroplasty is indicated in patients with isolated patellofemoral arthritis in whom nonoperative treatment has failed<sup>2</sup>. The goal of the presently described procedure is to provide relief from patellofemoral arthritis pain while maintaining native knee kinematics<sup>2</sup>.
Description: Patient radiographs are carefully reviewed for isolated patellofemoral arthritis in order to determine the appropriateness of robotic-assisted patellofemoral arthroplasty. Magnetic resonance imaging can be performed preoperatively to help confirm isolated patellofemoral arthritis. We perform this procedure with use of the MAKO Surgical Robot (Stryker). Preoperative computed tomography is performed to plan the bone resection, the size of the implant, and the positioning of the device. The steps of the procedure include (1) medial parapatellar arthrotomy, (2) intraoperative inspection to confirm isolated patellofemoral arthritis, (3) patellar resurfacing, (4) placement of optical arrays and trochlear registration, (5) trochlear resection, (6) trialing of implants, (7) removal of the optical array, (8) impaction of final implants, (9) confirmation of appropriate patellar tracking, and (10) closure.
Alternatives: Alternatives to patellofemoral arthroplasty include standard nonoperative treatment, bicompartmental arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, tibial tubercle osteotomy, partial lateral facetectomy, and arthroscopy<sup>2</sup>.
Rationale: Patellofemoral arthroplasty is indicated in patients with isolated patellofemoral arthritis in whom nonoperative treatment has failed<sup>2</sup>. Patellofemoral arthroplasty may be superior to total knee arthroplasty because it helps treat pain that affects patient quality of life and activities of daily living while also preserving greater tibiofemoral bone stock<sup>2</sup>. We recommend against performing patellofemoral arthroplasty in patients with arthritis of the tibiofemoral joints<sup>2</sup>.
Expected Outcomes: In properly selected patients, outcomes include improvement in patient pain and function<sup>1</sup>. One study found that robotic-assisted patellofemoral arthroplasty may result in improved patellar tracking compared with non-robotic-assisted patellofemoral arthroplasty<sup>1</sup>; however, functional outcomes were found to be similar between procedures, and data for all non-robotic-assisted controls were retrospectively captured<sup>1</sup>.
Important Tips: Confirm isolated patellofemoral arthritis on radiographs and/or magnetic resonance imaging.Review the preoperative plan for appropriate positioning of the trochlear implant.○ Confirm coverage of the trochlear groove.○ Avoid medial overhang.○ Avoid lateral overhang.○ Avoid anterior femoral notching.○ Avoid impingement of the trochlear component into the notch.○ Avoid excessive prominence of the trochlear component on the anterior femoral cortex.○ General principles are to place the trochlear component in 0° to 6° of "
pub.1150394504,Two‐ and three‐dimensional measurements following robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare component alignment using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) measurements following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with a new robotic system.
METHODS: A total of 38 patients underwent TKA with the robotic system. Cutting errors were measured. Errors in 2D and 3D component alignments from the planned angle, validated cutting angle, and validated implantation angle were calculated. These errors were compared with 2D and 3D measurements.
RESULTS: Cutting errors were below 0.6°, except for femoral sagittal angle (1.0°). Errors in component alignment from the planned and cutting angles were significantly higher in 3D measurements than that in 2D measurements, in the femoral coronal and sagittal planes and tibial coronal planes. Errors in component alignments from implantation showed no differences between the measurements.
CONCLUSION: The accuracies of component alignment from the planned and cutting angles were better in 3D measurements."
pub.1174858206,A Radiological Comparison of Robotic-Assisted Versus Manual Techniques in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"PurposeThis study investigates the radiological outcomes of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RATHA) compared to manual total hip arthroplasty (mTHA), addressing the ongoing debate on the effectiveness of RATHA in achieving superior implant positioning accuracy.MethodsA prospective cohort of 212 patients (103 robotic, 109 manual) underwent THA and were evaluated for postoperative radiological outcomes, focusing on the inclination and anteversion angles of the acetabular cup. Outlier prevalence was assessed based on angles outside the defined Lewinnek safe zones. All post-operative measurements were made using the BoneNinja application.ResultsHigh inter-observer and intra-observer reliabilities were observed, validating the measurement accuracy. The mean anteversion and inclination angles in the RATHA cohort were 40.5 ± 1.5 and 24.5 ± 3.1° respectively; and the mTHA cohort were 42.1 ± 4.9 and 24.9 ± 4.5°. There was a statistically significant difference in inclination angles between the two cohorts whereas the anteversion angles showed no difference. Majority of the conventional THRs (N = 72, 55.4%) were placed outside the safe zone for anteversion. The inclination angles revealed a highly significant difference between the cohorts (p < 0.0001), with all the robotic THRs (N = 121, 100%) being placed within the safe zone for inclination, whereas only 70% (N = 91) of the conventional THRs were within the safe zone. 97.5% of RA-THRs were within 3° of the proposed plan, demonstrating high accuracy.ConclusionRATHA significantly outperforms MTHA in radiological accuracy, achieving precise acetabular cup positioning with minimal outliers. These results advocate for RATHA's adoption in THA to enhance outcome predictability and affirm its reliability and safety over manual methods."
pub.1152643536,How long does image based robotic total knee arthroplasty take during the learning phase? Analysis of the key steps from the first fifty cases,"Abstract
IntroductionRobotically assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) is an emerging surgical tool. The purpose of this study was to analyze the length of time taken to perform the key steps of a RA-TKA for a surgeon and centre new to the MAKO robotic system.MethodThis was a prospective cohort study of the first 50 patients undergoing TKA using a robotic platform (Mako, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) performed by a single surgeon. Each key surgical step was recorded. The first 50 patients were chronologically allocated into five groups of ten and compared.ResultsMean operation length was 59.4 ± 7.4 min with significant improvement after 30 cases. A significant effect on certain steps of the surgery also occurred over 50 cases: after 30 cases for pre-operative planning (3.8 min in group 1 versus 1.2 min in group 4, p < 0.005), ten cases for registration time (5.2 min in group 1 versus 3.8 in group 2, p = 0.039) and ten cases for tibial cutting time (1.6 min in group 1 versus 1.3 in group 2, p < 0.005). Nurse setup, femur cutting, and intraoperative planning did not demonstrate a significant improvement in time over 50 cases.ConclusionA significant decrease in total operating length occurred after the 30th case. Anatomical registration and tibial cutting time demonstrated the largest improvements. MAKO image-based robotically assisted TKA is not a time-intensive intervention for both the surgeon and scrub nursing staff, and significant improvements in total surgical time occurs early in the learning phase."
pub.1153020996,Image-based robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty allowed to match the rotation of the tibial implant with the native kinematic knee alignment,"PurposeImage-based robotic tools improve the accuracy of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) positioning, but few studies have examined its effect on axial alignment. The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics of tibial and femoral implant positioning, mainly the tibial rotation, during medial or lateral UKA, performed with an image-based robotic assisted system.MethodsA total of 71 UKA performed between September 2021 and June 2022 (53 medial and 18 lateral) were analyzed. All data regarding implant positioning (rotation, coronal and sagittal alignment) for tibial and femoral components were obtained using MAKO® software (Stryker®, Mahwah, USA) intra-operatively.ResultsThe lateral UKA had a mean internal tibial rotation of 15.4 ± 3°, a mean external femoral rotation of 0.96 ± 2.4°, and a mean tibial slope of 4.7 ± 1.3°. The medial UKA had a mean internal tibial rotation of 0.18 ± 2.7°, a mean internal femoral rotation of 0.35 ± 2.2°, and a mean tibial slope of 5.4 ± 1.3°. The tibial rotations, femoral valgus, tibial varus and tibial size significantly differed between medial and lateral UKA (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in femoral rotation, flexion, femoral size, slope, and polyethylene thickness between medial and lateral UKA.ConclusionMedial and lateral UKA had significantly different implantation characteristics related to the biomechanics of the knee compartments. Image-based robotic UKA allowed precise femorotibial positioning per-operatively to match native kinematic alignment."
pub.1147021052,Robotics versus personalized 3D preoperative planning in total knee arthroplasty: a propensity score-matched analysis,"PurposeLower limb alignment is crucial in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Previous studies have shown that robotics and personalized three-dimensional (3D) preoperative planning could improve postoperative alignment accuracy compared with conventional TKA, but comparison between the above two techniques has never been reported. The authors hypothesized that robotics may be superior to personalized 3D preoperative planning in terms of postoperative alignment in primary TKA, with similar patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) but higher cost and longer operative time.MethodsA consecutive series of patients who received TKA in our center from September 2020 to January 2021 were enrolled retrospectively. After 1:2 matching, 52 and 104 patients were included and divided into study group for robotics and control group for personalized 3D preoperative planning, respectively. Multiple postoperative alignment angles were measured, and clinical features such as operation and tourniquet time, length of hospital stay and hemoglobin (Hb) were recorded. Knee Society Score (KSS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were used to evaluate clinical results.ResultsCompared with control group, robotics group had significantly lower frontal femoral component angle (FFC) and frontal tibial component angle (FTC) absolute deviation (P < 0.05). It also had less outliers in hip–knee–ankle angle (HKA), FTC, lateral femoral component angle (LFC) and lateral tibial component angle (LTC) (P < 0.05). Hb loss of robotics group was significantly lower than control group (P < 0.001), while the operation and tourniquet time were longer (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in KSS and WOMAC scores between two groups.ConclusionCompared with control group, patients in robotics group had significantly less malalignment, malposition, Hb loss, but similar PROMs. The operations in robotics group spent longer operation time and cost more compared with control group.

pub.1170989398,Detecting contamination events during robotic total joint arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted total joint arthroplasty (robotic-TJA) has become more widespread over the last 20 years due to higher patient satisfaction and reduced complications. However, robotic TJA may have longer operative times and increased operating room traffic, which are known risk factors for contamination events. Contamination of surgical instruments may be contact- or airborne-related with documented scalpel blade contamination rates up to 9%. The robot arm is a novel instrument that comes in and out of the surgical field, so our objective was to assess whether the robot arm is a source of contamination when used in robotic TJA compared to other surgical instruments.
METHODS: This was a prospective, single-institution, single-surgeon pilot study involving 103 robotic TJAs. The robot arm was swabbed prior to incision and after closure. Pre- and postoperative control swabs were also collected from the suction tip and scalpel blade. Swabs were incubated for 24 hours on tryptic soy agar followed by inspection for growth of any contaminating bacteria.
RESULTS: A contamination event was detected in 10 cases (10%). The scalpel blade was the most common site of contamination (8%) followed by the robot arm (2%) and suction tip (0%).
DISCUSSION: Robotic TJA is contaminated with bacteria at a rate around 10%. Although the robot arm is an additional source of potential contamination, the robot arm accrues bacterial contamination infrequently compared to the scalpel blade.
CONCLUSION: Contamination of the robot arm during robotic TJA is minimal when compared to contamination of the scalpel blade."
pub.1163849529,Intra-operative Safety of an Autonomous Robotic System for Total Knee Replacement: A Review of 500 Cases in India,"BackgroundManual total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been documented several times for their safety and complications data. In contrast, there is a limited evidence-based analysis for safety and complications of autonomous robotic-assisted (RA)-TKA. This study aimed to evaluate the safety features and intra-operative surgical complications associated with the use of Cuvis Joint™ autonomous robotic system for TKA.MethodsThe study included 500 consecutive patients who underwent TKA using the Cuvis Joint™ autonomous robotic system from November 2020 to November 2021. All surgeries were performed by a senior surgeon. Patients in whom the surgery was abandoned midway due to technical errors, were excluded from the analysis. In case of unilateral abandonment of the robotic arm during a bilateral RA-TKA, data of the side on which the surgery was completed with robotic assistance was recorded.ResultsThere was no incidence of neurological injury, vascular injury, extensor mechanism disruption, or medial collateral ligament injury. There was one case of superficial abrasion of the patellar tendon; however, it did not require any intervention. There were no cases of midway abandonment due to threatened soft tissue injury. There was no intra-operative pin loosening or stress-related fractures at the pin sites. There was one case of Steinmann pin breakage and another case of drill bit breakage, which were removed without any damage to the bone.ConclusionThe Cuvis Joint™ autonomous robotic system for TKA is safe with no significant intra-operative complications."
pub.1151314048,"The evolution of robotic systems for total knee arthroplasty, each system must be assessed for its own value: a systematic review of clinical evidence and meta-analysis","IntroductionRobotic systems have been introduced to improve the precision of total knee arthroplasty. However, different robotic systems are available, each with unique features used to plan and execute the surgery. As such, due to this diversity, the clinical evaluation of each robotic platform should be separated.MethodsAn extensive literature search of PubMed, Medline, Embase and Web of Science was conducted with subsequent meta-analysis. Randomised controlled trials, comparative studies, and cohort studies were included regarding robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty. Evaluated outcomes included clinical results, surgical precision, ligament balance, surgical time, learning curve, complications and revision rates. These were split up based on the robot-specific brand: ROBODOC (T-SOLUTION ONE), OMNIBOT, MAKO, NAVIO (CORI) and ROSA.ResultsWith a follow-up of more than 10 years, no improved clinical outcomes have been noted with the ROBODOC system compared to the conventional technique. If available, other platforms only present short-term clinical outcomes. Radiological outcomes are published for most robotic setups, demonstrating improved surgical precision compared to the conventional technique. Gap balance assessment is performed differently between all systems, leading to heterogeneous outcomes regarding its relationship on clinical outcomes. There is a similar learning curve based on operative time for all robotic platforms. In most studies, robot assistance requires longer operative time compared to the conventional technique. Complications and revision rates are published for ROBODOC and MAKO, without clear differences to conventional total knee arthroplasty.ConclusionThe main finding of this systematic review is that the current evidence regarding each robotic system is diverse in quantity and quality. Each system has its own specificities and must be assessed for its own value. Regarding scientific literature, the generic term of robotic should be banned from the general conclusion.Level of evidenceSystematic review level IV."
pub.1152581216,Image-based robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty through direct anterior approach allows a better orientation of the acetabular cup and a better restitution of the centre of rotation than a conventional procedure,"PurposeThe aim was to investigate the contribution of robotics assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) through direct anterior approach (DAA) in improving radiographic precision, functional results and complications.MethodsThis retrospective study compared 100 primary conventional THA (cTHA) to 50 primary robotic THA (rTHA) through DAA. All cups were placed with the objective of having no anterior overhang while respecting the safe zones (SZ). Radiographic analysis included cup inclination and anteversion, vertical and horizontal changes of the rotation centre (ΔVCOR, ΔHCOR), acetabular and femoral offset. SZ were 30–50° of inclination and 10–30° of anteversion. Outliers were defined as medial displacement of the COR > 5 mm, vertical displacement of the COR > 3 mm superiorly. Harris hip score (HHS) and complications were compared at one year of follow-up.ResultsThe robotic cups were better oriented with 98% in the global SZ versus 68% in the cTHA group (p = 0.0002). The COR was on average better restored in the robotic group in both the horizontal and vertical planes (Δ HCOR =  − 5.0 ± 5.0 vs − 3.4 ± 4.9, p = 0.03; Δ VCOR = 1.6 ± 3.3 vs 0.2 ± 2.7, p = 0.04). There were fewer outliers in the rTHA group concerning VCOR (28% versus 10%, p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in HHS and complication rate at one year.ConclusionThe use of robotics for THA by DAA provided an advantage in controlling the orientation of the cup and the restoration of its rotation centre. Thanks to the 3D planning on CT scan, it allowed to respect the thresholds while avoiding the anterior overhangs."
pub.1168555071,Pitfalls with the MAKO Robotic-Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) with the MAKO system minimizes deviations in implant alignment and yields superior precision in implant position compared to a manual total knee arthroplasty. In this comprehensive commentary, we present and categorize the limitations and pitfalls of the procedure and we also provide recommendations for avoiding each limitation. The main surgeon-related limitations include prolonged operation duration, loose insertion of the checkpoints and pins, wrong registration and mapping, and damage to soft tissues during bone cutting. The system-related issues include the interruptions of the saw-cutting due to vibrations, specifications for the operating room floor and power supply, the high cost of the system, as well as the cost of each operation due to the extra implants, inability to use the system with various prostheses, wireless connection interruptions between the system's components, and hardware issues with the six joints of the robotic device. In order to circumvent the potential challenges in this surgical procedure, it is essential to possess sufficient experience and undergo comprehensive training. Maintaining continuous awareness of the additional implants throughout the entire operation and prioritizing the preservation of soft tissues are of paramount significance. A profound comprehension of the system and its inherent constraints can also prove to be pivotal in certain situations."

We compared rates of complications within 90 days of surgery, length of hospital stay (LOS), and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores.ResultsNo differences existed between groups with respect to demographic data or perioperative recovery protocols. The RA-THA cohort had a significantly greater proportion of outpatient surgeries compared to the mTHA cohort (37.4% vs. 3.8%; p < 0.001) and significantly lower LOS (26.0 vs. 39.5 h; p < 0.001). The RA-THA cohort had a smaller 90-day postoperative complication rate compared to the mTHA cohort (0.9% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.029). The RA-THA cohort had significantly lower patient-reported VAS pain scores at 2-week follow-up visits (2.5 vs. 3.3; p = 0.048), but no difference was seen after 6-week follow visits (2.5 vs. 2.8; p = 0.468).ConclusionFluoroscopy-based RA-THA demonstrates low rates of postoperative complications, improved postoperative pain profiles, and shortened LOS when compared to manual, fluoroscopy-assisted THA."
pub.1144786200,Midterm Survivorship of Robotic-Assisted Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a popular alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for patients with isolated lateral compartment osteoarthritis. Few studies have investigated outcomes following robotic-assisted lateral UKA. The purpose of this study is to evaluate mid-term survivorship and patient-reported outcomes of robotic-assisted lateral UKA.
METHODS: A retrospective case series was conducted on all robotic-assisted lateral UKAs performed by a single surgeon between 2013 and 2019. Patient demographics, surgical variables, and Kozinn and Scott criteria were collected. Implant survivorship was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with all-cause reoperation and conversion to TKA as endpoints. Participating patients were assessed for patient satisfaction and the Forgotten Joint Score-12. Correlations between patient demographics and patient outcome scores were investigated.
RESULTS: In total, 120 lateral UKAs were identified, 84 of which met inclusion criteria, with a mean follow-up of 4.0 years (range 2.0-7.0). Five-year survivorship was 92.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.5-96.7) with all-cause reoperation as the endpoint, and 100% (95% CI 95.0-100) with conversion to TKA as the endpoint. One patient was converted to TKA after the 5-year mark, resulting in a 6-year survival for conversion to TKA of 88.9% (95% CI 44.9-98.5). Average Forgotten Joint Score-12 score was 82.7/100, and patient satisfaction 4.7/5. Mean coronal plane correction was 2.5° ± 1.9° toward the mechanical axis. Neither final postoperative alignment nor failure to meet classic Kozinn and Scott criteria for UKA resulted in differences in patient-reported outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates high mid-term survivorship and excellent patient-reported outcomes with robotic-assisted lateral UKA. Robotic-assisted lateral UKA is a viable treatment option for isolated lateral compartment arthritis even in patients who do not meet classic indications."
pub.1164373922,Preliminary study of short-term outcomes and learning curves of robotic-assisted THA: comparison between closed platform robotic system and open platform robotic system,"BackgroundBoth closed platform and open platform robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) have recently been recommended as a viable treatment option for achieving accurate positioning of components. Yet, limited studies paid attention to the differences between the closed platform robotic system and the open platform robotic system. Hence, this study aimed to investigate clinical outcomes, radiographic outcomes, complication rates and learning curve of two systems.Materials and methodsWe retrospectively included 62 patients (31 closed robotic system and 31 open robotic system) who underwent THA between February 2021 and January 2023. The demographics, operating time, cup positioning, complications and hip Harris score were evaluated. Learning curves of operation time was conducted using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis.ResultsThere were no differences in surgical time (76.7 ± 12.1 min vs. 72.3 ± 14.8 min), estimated blood loss (223.2 ± 13.2 ml vs. 216.9 ± 17 ml) and Harris Hip score (HHS) between closed platform robotic system and the open platform robotic system. The closed robotic system and the open robotic system were associated with a learning curve of 9 cases and 7 cases for surgical time respectively, based on the satisfying rate of Lewinnek’s safe zone outliers (1/31, 96.8%) and no occurrence of complication. Both robotic systems had significant reduction in overall surgical time, the duration of acetabulum registration, and estimated blood loss between learning phase and proficiency phase.ConclusionThe authors suggest that the surgical outcomes and safe zone outlier rate of the open robotic-assisted THA were similar to those of the closed robotic-assisted THA. These two robotic-assisted are associated with comparable learning curves and both have the precise positioning of acetabular component. From learning phase to proficiency phase, the rate of positions within the safe zone differed only marginally (88.9–100% vs. 85.7–100%) based on a rather low number of patients. This is not a statistically significant difference. Therefore, we suggest that THA undergoing with the robotic-assisted system is the relatively useful way to achieve planned acetabular cup position so far."
pub.1160561361,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty for extra-articular femur deformity correction,"Femoral shaft fracture is one of the most common injuries encountered. However, improper management can lead to significant long-term complications, of which is malunion. Patients with femoral malunion are at increased risk of developing knee osteoarthritis, and if arthroplasty is indicated, these extra-articular deformities pose a challenge as corrective osteotomy and soft tissue release are also required. In such circumstances, robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) might be an appropriate option. In this case, we present a 66-year-old woman who had previously suffered a femur shaft fracture, which was treated conservatively, and developed a varus malunion and severe knee osteoarthritis, and who was treated with RATKA."
pub.1147719111,Pin-Related Complications in Computer Navigated and Robotic-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: Computer-assisted navigation (CAN) and robotic-assisted (RA) knee arthroplasty procedures carry unique risks of tracking pin-related complications. This systematic review aimed to quantitatively assess the incidence, timing, treatment, and clinical outcomes of all tracking pin-related complications following CAN and RA knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Central and Scopus databases. All clinical studies that documented pin-related complications associated with the use of CAN or RA for total or partial knee arthroplasty were included. Descriptive statistics were analyzed when data were available.
RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were included: 18 case reports (25 cases) and 18 randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and case series i.e., non-case reports (7,336 cases). The most common pin-related complication among case reports was fracture (n = 22; 81%). The overall rate of pin-related complications among non-case reports was 1.4%. The intraoperative and postoperative complication with the highest incidence were pin dislodgement (0.6%) and superficial pin site infections (0.6%), respectively. Most postoperative complications were related to the tibial site (69%). All complications were effectively treated and resolved at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Pin-related complications following CAN and RA knee arthroplasty are relatively uncommon. While pin loosening, superficial infections and fractures have been most commonly documented, other complications such as vascular injury, myositis ossificans, and osteomyelitis can also occur. The potential for pin-related complications should be considered by arthroplasty surgeons, especially during early stages of adoption. Further studies investigating patient risk factors for pin-related complications are warranted."
pub.1153554841,Functional implant positioning in total hip arthroplasty and the role of robotic-arm assistance,"Abstract

IntroductionAccurate implant positioning, tailored to the phenotype and unique biomechanics of each patient is the single most important objective in achieving stability in THA and maximise range of motion. The spine-pelvis-hip construct functions as a single unit adapting to postural changes. It is widely accepted in the literature that no universaltarget exists and variations in spinopelvic mobility mandate adjustments to the surgical plan; thus bringing to the fore the concept of personalised, functional component positioning.MethodsThis manuscript aims to outline the challenges posed by spinopelvic imbalance and present a reproducible, stepwise approach to achieve functional-component positioning. We also present the one-year functional outcomes and Patient Reported Outcome Measures of a prospective cohort operated with this technique.Results and ConclusionRobotic-arm assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty has facilitated enhanced planning based on the patient’s phenotype and evidence suggests it results in more reproducible and accurate implant positioning. Preservation of offset, avoiding leg-length discrepancy, accurate restoration of the centre of rotation and accomplishing the combinedversion target are very important parameters in Total Hip Arthroplasty that affect post-operative implant longevity, patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes."
pub.1167991641,Mako versus ROSA: comparing surgical accuracy in robotic total knee arthroplasty,"There is increasing adoption of robotic surgical technology in Total Knee Arthroplasty. The ROSA® knee system can be used in either image-based mode (using pre-operative calibrated radiographs) or imageless modes (using intra-operative bony registration). The Mako knee system is an image-based system (using a pre-operative CT scan). This study aimed to compare surgical accuracy between the ROSA and Mako systems with specific reference to joint line height, patella height, posterior condylar offset and tibial slope. This was a retrospective review of a prospectively collected data of the initial 50 consecutive ROSA TKAs and the initial 50 consecutive Mako TKAs performed by two high-volume surgeons. To determine the accuracy of component positioning, the immediate post-operative radiograph was reviewed and compared with the immediate pre-operative radiograph with regards to joint line height (JLH), patella height (PH), tibial slope (TS) and posterior condylar offset (PCO). Mean difference between pre- and post-operative radiographs using the ROSA knee system of joint line height was 0.47 mm (SD 0.95) posterior condylar offset 0.16 mm (SD 0.76), tibial slope 0.9 degrees (SD 1.6) and patella height 0.01 (SD 0.05). Mean difference using the MAKO knee system of joint line height was 0.26 (SD 1.08), posterior condylar offset −0.26 mm (SD 0.78), tibial slope 1.8 degrees and patella height 0.03. No significant difference was demonstrated between the accuracy of component positioning of the ROSA or MAKO knee systems. Our study is the first study to compare the accuracy of the ROSA and MAKO knee systems in total knee arthroplasty. Both systems are highly accurate in restoring native posterior condylar offset, joint line height, tibial slope and patella height in TKA with no significant difference demonstrated between the two groups."
pub.1181127717,Robotic assisted versus conventional total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,"The aim of this study is To compare robotic-assisted and conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on both short- and long-term outcomes A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant studies. The studies included were randomised controlled trials directly comparing robotic-assisted versus conventional TKA. The outcomes were pooled as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence interval. RevMan software version 5.4 was used for performing the statistical analysis. Nine studies deemed eligible for inclusion. The data showed a significant favouring of robotic-assisted than the conventional TKA in mechanical alignment, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and femoral coronal plane outliers (MD =  − 1.10, 95% CI [− 1.51, − 0.69], p < 0.00001), (MD =  − 1.19, 95% CI [− 2.35, − 0.03], p = 0.04), and (RR = 0.49, 95% CI [0.30, 0.80], p = 0.004), respectively. On the other hand, conventional TKA was better in range of motion-flexion (long-term) than the robotic-assisted one (MD =  − 3.02, 95% CI [− 3.68, − 2.37], p < 0.00001). There were no significant differences between them in knee society score-knee score, knee society score-function score, change in hospital for special surgery (HSS) knee rating scale, and change in range of motion-extension (MD =  − 0.36, 95% CI [− 2.43, 1.70], p = 0.73), (MD =  − 0.34, 95% CI [− 2.36, 1.68], p = 0.74), (MD = 0.78, 95% CI [− 0.84, 2.40], p = 0.34), and (MD = 0.16, 95% [− 1.32, 1.64], p = 0.83), respectively. Robotic-assisted TKA demonstrated better outcomes than conventional TKA in terms of mechanical alignment and WOMAC scores. However, the conventional TKA showed a better range of motion-flexion in the long term. More data are needed to assess long-term outcomes comprehensively."
pub.1167371880,A Three-dimensional Comparison of Pre- and Post-component Position in a Series of Off-label Robotic-assisted Revision Total Knee Arthroplasties,"Background: The application of robotic-assisted arthroplasty in revision knee scenarios continues to evolve. This study compares the pre- and post-revision implant positions in series of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) using a robotic arm system.
Methods: Twenty-five consecutive off-label robotic-assisted revision TKA were performed. After virtual revision femoral and tibial components were positioned to achieve ""balanced"" medial and lateral flexion and extension gaps, the existing primary implants (PI) were removed, and bone cuts were executed with the robotic arm system. Preoperative coronal, sagittal, and axial position of the PI was compared to the final planned positions of the robotic revision implants (RRI) for each subject. A repeated measures ANOVA using the absolute difference in millimeters and degrees between the PI and RRI orientation was completed.
Results: Intra-operatively, the virtual gaps were balanced within the planning software followed by successful execution of the plan. There was a statistically significant difference between posterior condylar offset and tibial component positioning for RRI compared to PI. There was no difference between the distal femoral component values between PI and RRI.
Conclusions: The sagittal alignment of the revision implants, specifically the femoral posterior condylar offset and tibial component slope, are statistically significant considerations for a stable revision TKA with off-label use of a robotic-arm system. Other potential benefits may include appropriate implant sizing which can affect the resultant ligamentous tension important for a functional revision TKA. Future research and software iterations will be needed to determine the overall accuracy and utility of robotic-assisted revision TKA."
pub.1154501710,Accuracy of Advanced Active Robot for Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Cadaveric Study,"Although the accuracy of other types of robotic systems for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been assessed in cadaveric studies, no investigations have been performed to evaluate this newly advanced active robotic system. Therefore, the authors aimed to analyze the accuracy of bone resection in terms of thickness and alignment in a cadaveric study. Three cadaveric specimens (six knees) and an active robotic system (CUVIS Joint, CUREXO) were used in the study. Three surgeons with different experiences in robotic TKAs performed this cadaveric study using the same robotic protocol with two different implant designs. The thickness and angle of bone resection planes obtained from the optical tracking system and the difference between resection planes and the planning data were assessed to determine accuracy. With respect to the overall resection accuracy compared to the plan, the cutting depth accuracy was within 1.0 mm mean of root mean square (RMS), and the resection angle accuracy in terms of sagittal, coronal, and axial planes was within 1.0 degree mean RMS. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the planned and measured values in terms of the resection angles and cutting thickness. The hip-knee-ankle angle at postoperative evaluation was 0.7 degrees ± 0.7 degrees (RMS 1.0 degrees). This in vivo study suggests that the use of this newly advanced active robotic system for TKA demonstrates a high degree of accuracy in terms of resection thickness and alignment. This finding supports the clinical application of this advanced robotic system. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:  Cadaveric study, Level V."
pub.1173259462,Total Knee Arthroplasty With Robotic and Augmented Reality Guidance: A Hierarchical Task Analysis,"Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a commonly performed procedure that has traditionally utilized reproducible steps using a set of mechanical instruments. The number of TKAs performed using robotic assistance is increasing, and augmented reality (AR) navigation systems are being developed. Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) aims to describe the steps of a specific task in detail to reduce errors and ensure reproducibility. The objective of this study was to develop and validate HTAs for conventional, robotic-assisted, and AR-navigated TKA.
Methods: The development of HTAs for conventional TKA involved an iterative review process that incorporated the input of 4 experienced arthroplasty surgeons. The HTAs were then adapted for robotic-assisted and AR-navigated TKA by incorporating specific steps associated with the use of these systems. The accuracy and completeness of the HTAs were validated by observing 10 conventional and 10 robotic-assisted TKA procedures.
Results: HTAs for conventional, robotic-assisted, and AR-navigated TKA were developed and validated. The resulting HTAs provide a comprehensive and standardized plan for each procedure and can aid in the identification of potential areas of inefficiency and risk. Robotic-assisted and AR-navigated approaches require additional steps, and there are an increased number of instances where complications may occur.
Conclusions: The HTAs developed in this study can provide valuable insights into the potential pitfalls of robotic-assisted and AR-navigated TKA procedures. As AR-navigation systems are developed, they should be optimized by critical analysis using the developed HTAs to ensure maximum efficiency, reliability, accessibility, reduction of human error, and costs."
pub.1163638048,Validation of a Robotic Testbench for Evaluating Biomechanical Effects of Implant Rotation in Total Knee Arthroplasty on a Cadaveric Specimen,"In this study, we developed and validated a robotic testbench to investigate the biomechanical compatibility of three total knee arthroplasty (TKA) configurations under different loading conditions, including varus-valgus and internal-external loading across defined flexion angles. The testbench captured force-torque data, position, and quaternion information of the knee joint. A cadaver study was conducted, encompassing a native knee joint assessment and successive TKA testing, featuring femoral component rotations at -5°, 0°, and +5° relative to the transepicondylar axis of the femur. The native knee showed enhanced stability in varus-valgus loading, with the +5° external rotation TKA displaying the smallest deviation, indicating biomechanical compatibility. The robotic testbench consistently demonstrated high precision across all loading conditions. The findings demonstrated that the TKA configuration with a +5° external rotation displayed the minimal mean deviation under internal-external loading, indicating superior joint stability. These results contribute meaningful understanding regarding the influence of different TKA configurations on knee joint biomechanics, potentially influencing surgical planning and implant positioning. We are making the collected dataset available for further biomechanical model development and plan to explore the 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic platform for additional biomechanical analysis. This study highlights the versatility and usefulness of the robotic testbench as an instrumental tool for expanding our understanding of knee joint biomechanics."
pub.1152426890,Comparison of the radiological parameters between dynamic-referencing tactile guidance robotic system and Microplasty® instrumentation in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the radiological outcomes of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) performed by a navigation-based robotic system versus Microplasty® instrumentation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2018 and January 2019, a total of 90 knees of 75 patients (65 males, 10 females; mean age: 62.0±9.4 years; range, 50 to 73 years) were included. Among these, 54 knees underwent Oxford mobile-bearing UKA with an Microplasty® instrumentation set and 36 knees were operated with the aid of a Restoris® MCK with MAKO navigation-based robotic system. Postoperative anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of all patients were evaluated according to nine different parameters. On the femoral side, femoral varus-valgus angle, flexion-extension angle, femoral condyle posterior fit; on tibial side, tibial component varus/valgus, tibial posterior slope, medial, anterior, posterior and lateral fit of tibial component assessed.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in terms of age, sex, and affected side. On the femoral side, no significant difference was observed in the component position between groups. On the tibial side, tibial component medial fit (p=0.032) and anterior fit (p=0.007) were better in navigation-based robotic system group.
CONCLUSION: Microplasty® instrumentation may lead to comparable implant positioning compared to a tactile-based navigated robotic instrumentation."
pub.1163404939,Robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty for preoperative planning and intraoperative decision-making,"AimsThis article aimed to explore the efficacy of robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) in improving preoperative planning and intraoperative decision-making.MethodsIn this single-center, prospective, randomized clinical controlled trial, 60 patients were randomly divided into two groups: conventional THA (cTHA) and robotic arm-assisted THA (rTHA). The rTHA underwent procedures using a robot-assisted surgical system, which generated three-dimensional models to determine the most appropriate prosthesis size and position. The standard process of replacement was executed in cTHA planned preoperatively via X-ray by experienced surgeons. Differences between predicted and actual prosthetic size, prosthetic position, and leg length were evaluated.ResultsSixty patients were included in the study, but one patient was not allocated due to anemia. No significant preoperative baseline data difference was found between the two groups. The actual versus predicted implantation size of both groups revealed that 27/30 (90.0%) in the rTHA group and 25/29 (86.2%) in the cTHA group experienced complete coincidence. The coincidence rate for the femoral stem was higher in the rTHA group (83.3%) than that in the cTHA group (62.7%). Between the actual and predicted rTHA, the difference in anteversion/inclination degree (< 6°) was largely dispersed, while cTHA was more evenly distributed in degree (< 9°). The differences in leg length between the surgical side and contralateral side showed a significant deviation when comparing the two groups (P = 0.003), with 0.281 (− 4.17 to 3.32) mm in rTHA and 3.79 (1.45–6.42) mm in cTHA.ConclusionRobotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty can be valuable for preoperative planning and intraoperative decision-making."
pub.1144337604,Image-Free Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Improves Implant Alignment Accuracy: A Cadaveric Study,"BACKGROUND: Improving resection accuracy and eliminating outliers in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is important to improving patient outcomes regardless of alignment philosophy. Robotic-assisted surgical systems improve resection accuracy and reproducibility compared to conventional instrumentation. Some systems require preoperative imaging while others rely on intraoperative anatomic landmarks. We hypothesized that the alignment accuracy of a novel image-free robotic-assisted surgical system would be equivalent or better than conventional instrumentation with fewer outliers.
METHODS: Forty cadaveric specimens were used in this study. Five orthopedic surgeons performed 8 bilateral TKAs each, using the VELYS Robotic-Assisted System (DePuy Synthes) and conventional instrumentation on contralateral knees. Pre-resection and postresection computed tomography scans, along with optical scans of the implant positions were performed to quantify resection accuracies relative to the alignment targets recorded intraoperatively.
RESULTS: The robotic-assisted cohort demonstrated smaller resection errors compared to conventional instrumentation in femoral coronal alignment (0.63° ± 0.50° vs 1.39° ± 0.95°, P < .001), femoral sagittal alignment (1.21° ± 0.90° vs 3.27° ± 2.51°, P < .001), and tibial coronal alignment (0.93° ± 0.72° vs 1.65° ± 1.29°, P = .001). All other resection angle accuracies were equivalent. Similar improvements were found in the femoral implant coronal alignment (0.89° ± 0.82° vs 1.42° ± 1.15°, P = .011), femoral implant sagittal alignment (1.51° ± 1.08° vs 2.49° ± 2.10°, P = .006), and tibial implant coronal alignment (1.31° ± 0.84° vs 2.03° ± 1.44°, P = .004). The robotic-assisted cohort had fewer outliers (errors >3°) for all angular resection alignments.
CONCLUSION: This in vitro study demonstrated that image-free robotic-assisted TKA can improve alignment accuracy compared to conventional instrumentation and reduce the incidence of outliers."
pub.1146382038,A Comparison of Component Positioning Between Fluoroscopy-Assisted and Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: This single-surgeon retrospective study examined a consecutive series of direct anterior approach total hip arthroplasties (THAs). Differences for the accuracy of acetabular component placement, leg length discrepancy, femoral offset, and absolute global offset difference were measured for patients who underwent hip replacement surgery with either fluoroscopic or robotic guidance.
METHODS: One hundred THAs were included in both the fluoroscopically guided and robotically guided groups in the study. The program TraumaCad was used to analyze the preoperative and 6-week postoperative standing anteroposterior pelvic radiographs used in this study to evaluate the accuracy of component positioning.
RESULTS: Robotic-guided surgery demonstrated a small improvement in acetabular inclination error, 3.8° average robotic error vs 4.63° average fluoroscopic error (P < .01). There was no statistically significant difference in accuracy for acetabular anteversion, leg length discrepancy, femoral offset, or global offset difference between the 2 groups. There was also no significant difference in the placement of acetabular components into the Lewinnek safe zone or Callanan safe zone. Both fluoroscopically guided and robotically guided THA patients had similar patterns of error, with excessive anteversion and inclination being more common than inadequate anteversion or inclination.
CONCLUSION: The findings from our study question the use of haptic robotic guidance during direct anterior approach THA when compared to fluoroscopic guidance."
pub.1169837326,Discrepancies in Sagittal Alignment of the Lower Extremity Among Different Brands of Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty Systems,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing number of different brands of robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) systems. Most robotic TKA systems share the same coronal alignment, while the definitions of sagittal alignment vary. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether these discrepancies impact the sagittal alignment of the lower extremity.
METHODS: A total of 72 lower extremity computed tomography scans were included in our study, and 3-dimensional models were obtained using software. A total of 7 brands of robotic TKA systems were included in the study. The lower extremity axes were defined based on the surgical guide for each implant. We also set the intramedullary axis as a reference to evaluate the discrepancies in sagittal alignment of each brand of robotic system.
RESULTS: On the femoral side, the axis definition was the same for all 7 robotic TKA systems. The robotic TKA axes showed a 2.41° (1.58°, 3.38°) deviation from the intramedullary axis. On the tibial side, the 7 robots had different axis definitions. The tibial mechanical axis of 6 of the TKA systems was more flexed than that of the intramedullary axis, which means the posterior tibial slope was decreased while the tibial mechanical axis of the remaining system was more extended.
CONCLUSIONS: The sagittal alignment of the lower extremity for 7 different brands of robotic TKA systems differed from each other and all deviated from the intramedullary axis. Surgeons should be aware of this discrepancy when using different brands of robotic TKA systems to avoid unexpected sagittal alignment and corresponding adverse clinical outcomes.

pub.1154003554,Index surgery and ninety day re-operation cost comparison of robotic-assisted versus manual total knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionThis study looks to compare early costs of index surgery and re-operations of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasties (rTKA) and manual total knee arthroplasty (mTKA) re-operations within 90 days.Material and methodsThe Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative (MARCQI) database was queried for patients undergoing rTKA and mTKA at our institution from January 1st, 2018, to March 31st, 2021. Primary outcomes were the day of surgery and overall encounter variable direct costs (VDC). Secondary outcomes included 90-day re-operations and costs.ResultsOne thousand two hundred seventy-six (21.2%) patients were in the rTKA cohort, while 4740 (78.8%) were in the mTKA cohort. When comparing rTKA to mTKA, rTKA had higher median total encounter costs (p < 0.001) and higher encounter VDC costs (p < 0.001). TKA had higher day of surgery total VDC (p < 0.001), VDC supplies (p < 0.001), and VDC of post-op recovery (p < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression showed no relationship with age, BMI, OR time, or LOS with cost for rTKA or mTKA.ConclusionResults from our study show that rTKA is associated with a higher index surgery costs, and no difference in 90-day re-operation costs. The main factor driving increased cost is supply cost, with other variables between too small in difference to make a significant financial impact. Future studies should focus on post-operative costs including readmission and episode of care costs and should consider cost to the payor as opposed to VDC. rTKA will become more common, and other institutions may need to take a closer financial look at this more novel instrumentation before adoption.Level of evidence: III, retrospective cohort"

METHODS: Component positioning, hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), and clinical outcome 1-year postoperatively were compared between 40 patients who underwent TKA with Navio (robot group) and 40 control patients who underwent TKA with a jig-based technique (manual group). The clinical outcomes evaluated were range of motion and the 2011 Knee Society Score.
RESULTS: Implantation errors in the coronal and sagittal alignments were significantly fewer in the robotic group than in the manual group. All knees in the robotic group achieved component positions within 3°. However, the HKA and clinical outcomes did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Although the accuracy of implantation in the robotic group was superior to that in the manual group, the clinical outcomes were similar."

This retrospective study included 88 patients (88 knees) who underwent TKA using the NAVIO (40 patients) or ROSA (48 patients) robotic systems. The accuracies of the robotic systems were compared. Clinical scores were evaluated using the Knee Society Score 2011 (KSS 2011) and the forgotten joint score (FJS)-12 at 1 year postoperatively. The femoral sagittal cutting error was smaller in the NAVIO group than in the ROSA group. The other cutting errors were not statistically different in both groups. Implantation errors did not differ between the groups. Regarding the clinical outcomes of the KSS 2011 subscales, the symptoms score was higher in knees operated using ROSA than in those using NAVIO. The other KSS 2011 subscales and the FJS-12 showed no differences between the two groups. In conclusion, the femoral sagittal cutting error was smaller in the NAVIO group than in the ROSA group, and the KSS 2011 symptom score subsection at one year was higher in the knees operated using ROSA than in those using NAVIO."
pub.1145877778,Robotic-arm assisted versus conventional technique for total knee arthroplasty: early results of a prospective single centre study,"Abstract
PurposeThe purpose of this study was to compare the early functional outcomes between robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) and conventional manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA).MethodsThis prospective cohort study included 52 patients (26 RATKA and 26 TKA). All procedures were performed by a single experienced surgeon using identical approach and implant designs. Post-operative evaluation consisted of the risks of inflammatory and blood loss, the accuracy of mechanical alignment, post-operative pain, peri-operative and post-operative functional outcomes, and complications for 30 days after index surgery.ResultsThere was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics of patients between two groups (p > 0.05). There was a trend that the operative time of RATKA was prolonged compared with manual TKA (p < 0.0001). However, the risks of infection and blood loss did not increase accordingly (p > 0.05). No statistical difference was found in the correction of mechanical alignment between two groups (p > 0.05). The RATKA was associated with reduced pain post-operatively in day 1 (p < 0.05). Afterwards, there was no systematic difference in VAS score from day two to three post-operatively (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in functional recovery (p > 0.05). No complication occurred in both groups.ConclusionAlthough the operative time was prolonged in RATKA, it did not increase the risks of infection and blood loss. There was no significant difference in radiological or functional outcomes between RATKA and conventional manual TKA. RATKA might be related to reduced pain after surgery."

pub.1154599536,No difference in clinical outcomes between functionally aligned cruciate-retaining and posterior-stabilized robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"Abstract
PurposeTo compare the clinical outcomes of subjects undergoing primary robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA), following functional alignment (FA) principles, with cruciate-retaining (CR) or posterior-stabilized (PS) bearing designs, at a minimum of 24 months of follow-up.MethodsThis observational, retrospective study included 167 consecutive patients undergoing RA-TKA with cemented PS and cementless CR implants performed with a CT-base robotic-arm assisted system (Mako, Stryker), following FA principles, between 2017 and 2020. Patients were followed up with a clinical and radiographic assessment and were administered the Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR), and the 5-level Likert scale (5-LLS).ResultsThree TKA revisions were performed (2 PS, 1 CR); therefore, a total of 164 knees with a mean age of 71.7 years (SD 8.9) were considered (80 cemented PS; 84 cementless CR). No statistically significant differences were recorded between study groups relative to FJS-12, KOOS-JR, and 5-LLS at a minimum of two year follow-up (FJS-12 89.3 ± 9.2 vs 87.5 ± 12.8, p-value 0.46; KOOS-JR 88.8 ± 10.0 vs 86.7 ± 14.0, p-value 0.31; 5-LLS 4.5 ± 0.7 vs 4.5 ± 0.8, p-value 0.34).ConclusionNo significant outcome differences were reported between patients undergoing PS and CR RA-TKA at a minimum of two year follow-up.

pub.1145664465,Total Knee Arthroplasty With Robotic Surgical Assistance Results in Less Physician Stress and Strain Than Conventional Methods,"BACKGROUND: Poor surgical ergonomics and physiological stress have been shown to impair surgical performance and cause injuries. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain among arthroplasty surgeons is inordinately high. This study compared surgeon stress and strain during robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) and conventional TKA (cTKA).
METHODS: Continuous cardiorespiratory and ergonomic data of a single surgeon were measured during 40 consecutive unilateral TKAs (20 rTKAs, 20 cTKAs) using a smart garment and wearable sensors. Heart rate (HR), HR variability, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, and calorie expenditure were used as surrogate measures for physiological stress. Intraoperative ergonomics were assessed by measuring cervical and lumbar flexion, extension and rotation, and shoulder abduction/adduction.
RESULTS: Mean operative time was longer for rTKA (48.2 ± 9 vs 31.8 ± 7 min, P < .001). Calories expended per minute was lower for rTKA (2.53 vs 3.50, P < .001). Total calorie expenditure in rTKA cases 11-20 was significantly lower than the first 10 (107.1 ± 27 vs 137.6 ± 24, P = .015), and lower than cTKA (112.3 ± 37). Mean HR was lower for rTKA (81.5 ± 4 vs 90.1 ± 5, P < .001). Minute ventilation was also lower for rTKA (14.9 ± 1 vs 17.0 ± 1.0 L/min, P < .001). Mean lumbar flexion as well as the percentage of time spent in a demanding flexion position >20° were significantly lower during rTKA (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: rTKA resulted in less surgeon physiologic stress, energy expenditure per minute, and postural strain compared to cTKA. Robotic assistance may help to increase surgical efficiency and reduce physician workload, but further studies are needed to determine whether these benefits will reduce musculoskeletal pain and injury among surgeons."
pub.1175564066,Surgical Technique for Complementing Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty in Middle-Aged Patients with Rigid Knee Bones,"This study reports 12 cases of inaccurate bone cutting from a single-surgeon series of 509 consecutively performed robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for 1 year. In addition, a complementary technique with the combined benefits of robotic-assisted and manual techniques that address this issue is described. From June 2020 to May 2021, a consecutive series of 509 TKAs was performed on 338 patients using a posterior-stabilized total knee prosthesis with a robotic-assisted system at our hospital. The surgical records were reviewed to identify the causative bone locations and bone re-cutting events correlated with improper trial instrument positioning. The re-cutting rate was 2.4% (12/509). All re-cutting attempts occurred because of improper cutting of the femoral posterior chamfer. Re-cutting was attempted mostly on middle-aged male patients. This complementary technique can facilitate manual bone cutting while retaining the advantages of robotic surgery during robotic-assisted TKA. Additionally, the combined technique of manual bone cutting and robotic-assisted surgery can be a useful alternative for middle-aged male patients with rigid knee bones."

Careful preoperative, multidisciplinary planning/treatment included magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the venous malformations throughout the right lower extremity, preoperative sclerotherapy, sirolimus, and robotic-assisted cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
CONCLUSION: Cementless robotic-assisted TKA with selective patellar resurfacing can be a viable option for young KTS patients with severe osteoarthritis when a meticulous multidisciplinary approach, including sclerotherapy and advanced imaging, is undertaken to analyze vascular abnormalities, minimize surgical risks, preserve bone stock, and optimize outcomes."
pub.1145099870,"Accuracies of bone resection, implant position, and limb alignment in robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a prospective single-centre study","ObjectiveThis study assessed the accuracy of robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) for bone resection, component size prediction, implant placement, and limb alignment.MethodsThis prospective cohort study included 36 patients. All procedures were performed by a single experienced surgeon, using an identical approach and implant designs. The MAKO RIO Robotic Interactive Orthopaedic Arm (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA) system was used. The actual bone resection, implant placement, component size, and postoperative mechanical alignment were recorded, then compared with the preoperative plan.ResultsThe mean absolute differences from the plan for the distal (medial and lateral) and posterior (medial and lateral) femoral cuts were 0.39 mm (0.62), 0.49 mm (0.70), 0.62 mm (0.79), and 0.65 mm (0.81), respectively, with 0.57° (0.65) varus. The mean absolute differences in the medial and lateral tibial cuts were 0.56 mm (0.75) and 0.58 mm (0.76), with 0.48° (0.16) varus and 0.54° (0.25) anterior/posterior slope. Of 192 bone resections, 176 (91.7%) were within ≤ 1 mm of the preoperative plan. The accuracies of femoral and tibial component size prediction were 100% and  97.22%, respectively. The mean absolute difference in final limb coronal alignment was 0.92° (0.65). Of the alignments, 18 (75.0%) were within ≤ 1.00° of the plan, and 100% were within ≤ 3.00° of the plan.ConclusionRATKA could accurately predict the component size and execute a preoperative plan to achieve precise bone resection, and implant placement, thereby reducing alignment outliers."
pub.1172480979,Reducing edge loading and alignment outliers with image-free robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a case controlled study,"BackgroundSurvivorship of medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is technique-dependent. Correct femoral-tibial component positioning associates with improved survivorship. Image-free robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty enables preoperative and intraoperative planning of alignment and assessment of positioning prior to execution. This study aimed to compare the radiological outcomes between robotic-assisted UKA (R-UKA) and conventional UKA (C-UKA).MethodsThis retrospective case control study involved 140 UKA (82 C-UKA and 58 R-UKA) performed at an academic institution between March 2016 to November 2020, with a mean follow-up of 3 years. Postoperative radiographs were evaluated for mechanical axis and femoral-tibial component position. Component position was measured by two methods: (1) femoral-tibial component contact point with reference to four medial-to-lateral quadrants of the tibial tray and (2) femoral-tibial component contact point deviation from the center of the tibial tray as a percentage of the tibial tray width. Baseline demographics and complications were recorded.ResultsThere was a higher mean component deviation in C-UKA compared with R-UKA using method 2 (17.2% vs. 12.8%; P = 0.007), but no difference in proportion of zonal outliers using method 1 (4 outliers in C-UKA, 5.1% vs. 1 outlier in R-UKA, 1.8%; P = 0.403). R-UKA showed no difference in mean mechanical alignment (C-UKA 5° vs. R-UKA 5°; P = 0.250). 2-year survivorship was 99% for C-UKA and 97% for R-UKA. Mean operative time was 18 min longer for R-UKA (P < 0.001).ConclusionImage-free robotic-assisted UKA had improved component medio-lateral alignment compared with conventional technique."

METHODS: The femoral, tibial, patellar, and fibular segmentation performance and speed were evaluated and the accuracy of component sizing, bone resection and alignment of the robotic-assisted TKA system constructed using this deep learning network was clinically validated.
RESULTS: Overall, DDA-Transformer outperformed six other networks in terms of the Dice coefficient, intersection over union, average surface distance, and Hausdorff distance. DDA-Transformer exhibited significantly faster segmentation speeds than nnUnet, TransUnet and 3D-Unet (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the robotic-assisted TKA system outperforms the manual group in surgical accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: DDA-Transformer exhibited significantly improved accuracy and robustness in knee joint segmentation, and this convenient and stable knee joint CT image segmentation network significantly improved the accuracy of the TKA procedure."

Robotic-assisted THA enhances the accuracy and stability of THA surgery and achieves better clinical outcomes than manual THA.
CASE SUMMARY: We report the clinical outcomes of robotic-assisted THA and manual THA in the same patient with osteonecrosis of the femoral head. A 49-year-old male patient attended our hospital due to more than 3 years of pain in both hip joints. The left hip was treated with robotic-assisted THA. The patient underwent manual THA of the right hip 3 mo after robotic-assisted THA. We obtained postoperative radiograph parameters, Harris hip score and forgotten joint score of the patient 1 year after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Compared with manual THA, the patient's left hip felt better 1 year after robotic-assisted THA. Robotic-assisted THA resulted in a better Harris hip score and forgotten joint score than manual THA in the same patient with osteonecrosis of the femoral head."
pub.1171613908,Survivorship and Outcomes of Robotic Arm-Assisted Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty at a Minimum of 5-Year Follow-Up.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate implant survivor-ship, complications, and re-operation rates following robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) at mid-term follow-up.
METHODS: Patient satisfaction, clinical outcome, and knee alignment restoration were evaluated. All patients undergo-ing robotic arm-assisted medial UKA during a 2-year period were prospectively enrolled. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, varus-valgus deformity, and knee range of motion were studied pre- and postoperatively. Revisions and surgery-related complications were recorded.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were included in the study (mean age: 71.2 years). The mean follow-up was 74.7 months. One conversion to total knee arthroplasty was performed due to periprosthetic fracture 4.5 years after initial surgery result-ing in a survivorship rate of 98.8%. Overall satisfaction was excellent; 97.7% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied, while none was dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. WOMAC score in total, as well as in each component, exhibited sig-nificant improvement postoperatively. Additionally, knee alignment in the coronal plane as well as flexion contracture were significantly improved following the procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of the present cohort revealed that precise prosthesis implantation through the robotic arm-assisted system in UKA provided excellent overall satisfac-tion rates and clinical outcomes at mid-term follow-up."
pub.1172350966,Stem anteversion is not affected by proximal femur geometry in robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"BackgroundIn the present study, the surgeon aimed to align the stem at 5° to 25° in anteversion. The robotic technology was used to measure stem anteversion with respect to proximal femur anteversion at different levels down the femur.MethodsA total of 102 consecutive patients underwent robotic-arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RTHA). 3D CT-based preoperative planning was performed to determine femoral neck version (FNV), posterior cortex anteversion (PCA), anterior cortex anteversion (ACA), and femoral metaphyseal axis anteversion (MAA) at 3 different levels: D (10 mm above lesser trochanter), E (the midpoint of the planned neck resection line) and F (head-neck junction). The robotic system was used to define and measure stem anteversion during surgery.ResultsMean FNV was 6.6° (SD: 8.8°) and the mean MAA was consistently significantly higher than FNV, growing progressively from proximal to distal. Mean SV was 16.4° (SD: 4.7°). There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.16) between SV and MAA at the most distal measured level. In 96.1% cases, the stem was positioned inside the 5°–25° anteversion range.ConclusionsFemoral anteversion progressively increased from neck to proximal metaphysis. Aligning the stem close to femoral anteversion 10 mm above the lesser trochanter often led to the desired component anteversion."
pub.1147578797,"Dislocation risk after robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty: a comparison of anterior, lateral and posterolateral approaches","AIMS: Dislocation is a major cause of early failure after THA and is highly influenced by surgical approach and component positioning. Robotic-arm assisted arthroplasty has been developed in an attempt to improve component positioning and reduce postoperative complications.The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of dislocation after robotic total hip arthroplasty through 3 different surgical approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who had undergone robotic arm-assisted THA at 3 centres between 2014 and 2019 were reviewed. After applying exclusion criteria, 1059 patients were included in the study. An anterior approach was used in 323 patients, a lateral approach in 394 and a posterior approach in 342 patients.Episodes of dislocation were recorded after 6 months follow-up. Stem anteversion, cup anteversion, cup inclination and combined anteversion were collected using the integrated navigation system.Cumulative incidence (CI), incidence rate (IR) and risk ratio (RR) were calculated with a confidence interval of 95%.
RESULTS: 3 cases of dislocation (2 posterior approach, 1 anterior approach) were recorded, with a dislocation rate of 0.28% and an IR of 0.14%.The rate of placement of the cup in the Lewinnek safe zone was 82.2% for the posterior approach, 82.0% for the lateral approach and 95.4% for the anterior approach.The rate of placement in the combined version safe zone was 98.0% for the posterior approach, 73.0% for the lateral approach and 47.1% for the anterior approach.The incidence rate of dislocation was 0.30% for the anterior approach, 0.34% for the posterior approach and 0% for the lateral approach.
CONCLUSIONS: The robotic arm-assisted technique is associated with a low risk of dislocation. The combined version technique appears to be a reliable way to reduce the risk of dislocation through the posterolateral approach but does not appear to be essential when using the lateral and anterior approaches."
pub.1169174882,"Use of a fluoroscopy-based robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty system produced greater improvements in patient-reported outcomes at one year compared to manual, fluoroscopic-assisted technique","IntroductionThe adoption of new technology should be supported by improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROMs). The purpose of this study was to assess the one-year PROMs of patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a novel, fluoroscopy-based, robotic-assisted (RA-THA) system when compared to a manual, fluoroscopic-assisted technique (mTHA).Materials and methodsA review of 91 consecutive mTHA and 85 consecutive RA-THA via a direct anterior approach was conducted. All cases were performed by the same surgeon at the same institution, for a pre-operative diagnosis of osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Outcomes included one-year Veterans RAND-12 (VR-12) Physical/Mental, Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome (HOOS) Pain/Physical Function/Joint Replacement, and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Activity scores, as well as the difference between pre-operative and one-year post-operative PROMs.ResultsPatients in the RA-THA cohort had lower pre-operative HOOS-JR scores compared to patients in the mTHA cohort (37.0 vs. 43.1; p = 0.031). Cohorts experienced similar one-year post-operative VR-12, HOOS, and UCLA Activity scores. Patients in the RA-THA cohort experienced greater improvements across all pre- and post-operative HOOS scores compared to patients in the mTHA cohort: Pain (+ 54.7 vs. +42.1; p = 0.009), Physical Function (-41.6 vs. -28.7; p = 0.007), and Joint Replacement (+ 46.6 vs. +33.0; p = 0.002). These differences exceeded minimum clinically important difference (MCID).ConclusionsBoth manual and robotic cohorts experienced benefit from THA at one-year post-operative. Importantly, the use of a novel, fluoroscopy-based robotic assistance system for primary THA resulted in greater improvements in PROMs at one-year relative to manual technique."
pub.1153157921,Cost-effectiveness analysis of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is widely recognized as an effective treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA). Compared with conventional TKA, robotic-arm assisted TKA may improve patients' functionality and resulting quality of life by more accurate and precise component placement. Currently, the literature on cost-effectiveness of robotic-arm assisted TKA in the US is limited. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of robotic-arm assisted TKA relative to TKA in the Medicare-aged population including exploring the impact of hospital volume on cost-effectiveness outcomes.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the costs, health outcomes, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of robotic-arm assisted TKA vs TKA in Medicare population with OA. We evaluated cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We sourced costs from the literature including episode-of-care (EOC) costs from a Medicare study. We assessed cost-effectiveness of robotic-arm assisted TKA by hospital procedure volume and conducted deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: For the average patient treated in a hospital with an annual volume of 50 procedures, robotic-arm assisted TKA resulted in a total QALY of 6.18 relative to 6.17 under conventional TKA. Total discounted costs per patient were $32,535 and $31,917 for robotic-arm assisted TKA and conventional TKA, respectively. Robotic-arm assisted TKA was cost-effective in the base case with an ICER of $41,331/QALY. In univariate DSA, cost-effectiveness outcomes were most sensitive to the annual hospital procedure volume. Robotic-arm assisted TKA was cost-effective at a WTP of $50,000/QALY only when hospital volume exceeded 49 procedures per year. In PSA, robotic-arm assisted TKA was cost-effective at a $50,000/QALY WTP threshold in 50.4% of 10,000 simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite high robotic purchase costs, robotic-arm assisted TKA is likely to be cost-effective relative to TKA in the Medicare population with knee OA in high-volume hospitals through lowering revision rates and decreasing post-acute care costs. Higher-volume hospitals may deliver higher value in performing in robotic-arm assisted TKA."
pub.1151226431,Identifying Trends and Quantifying Growth for Technological Innovation in Knee Arthroplasty: An Analysis of a Patent Database (1990 to 2020),"Technological innovation is the key for surgical progress in knee arthroplasty and improvement in patient outcomes. Exploring patented technologies can help elucidate trends and growth for numerous innovative technologies. However, patent databases, which contain millions of patents, remain underused in arthroplasty research. Therefore, the present study aimed to: (1) quantify patent activity; (2) group patents related to similar technologies into well-defined clusters; and (3) compare growth between technologies in the field of knee arthroplasty over a 30-year period. An open-source international patent database was queried from January 1990 to January 2020 for all patents related to knee arthroplasty A search strategy identified 70,154 patents, of which 24,425 were unique and included analysis. Patents were grouped into 14 independent technology clusters using Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) codes. Patent activity was normalized via a validated formula adjusting for exponential growth. Compound annual growth rates (CAGR) were calculated (5-year, 10-year, and 30-year CAGR) and compared for each cluster. Overall yearly patent activity increased by 2,023%, from 104 patents in 1990 to 2,208 patents in 2020. The largest technology clusters were ""drugs"" (<i>n</i> = 5,347; 23.8%), ""components"" (<i>n</i> = 4,343; 19.0%), ""instruments"" (<i>n</i> = 3,130; 13.7%), and ""materials"" (<i>n</i> = 2,378; 10.4%). The fastest growing technologies with their 5-year CAGR were: ""user interfaces for surgical systems"" (58.1%); ""robotics"" (28.6%); ""modularity"" (21.1%); ""navigation"" (15.7%); and ""computer modeling"" (12.5%). Since 1990, overall patent growth rate has been greatest for ""computer modeling"" (8.4%), ""robotics"" (8.0%), ""navigation"" (7.9%), and ""patient-specific instrumentation"" (6.4%). Most patents in knee arthroplasty for the last 30 years have focused on drugs, components, instruments, and materials. Recent exponential growth was mainly observed for user interfaces for surgical systems, robotics, modularity, navigation, and computer-assisted technologies. Innovation theory would suggest that these rapidly growing technologies are experiencing high innovation output, increased resource investments, growing adoption by providers, and significant clinical impact. Periodic monitoring of technological innovation via patent databases can be useful to establish trends and future directions in the field of knee arthroplasty."
pub.1174719725,A new gap balancing technique with functional alignment in total knee arthroplasty using the MAKO robotic arm system: a preliminary study,"BackgroundGap tension is an important factor influencing the clinical outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Traditional mechanical alignment (MA) places importance on neutral alignment and often requires additional soft tissue releases, which may be related to patient dissatisfaction. Conversely, the functional alignment requires less soft tissue release to achieve gap balance. Conventional gap tension instruments present several shortcomings in practice. The aim of this study is to introduce a new gap balancing technique with FA using the modified spacer-based gap tool and the MAKO robotic arm system.MethodsA total of 22 consecutive patients underwent primary TKA using the MAKO robotic arm system. The gap tension was assessed and adjusted with the modified spacer-based gap tool during the operation. Patient satisfaction was evaluated post-operatively with a 5-point Likert scale. Clinical outcomes including lower limb alignment, Knee Society Score (KSS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) were recorded before surgery, 3 months and 1 year after surgery.ResultsThe range of motion (ROM) was significantly increased (p < 0.001) and no patients presented flexion contracture after the surgery. KSS and WOMAC score were significantly improved at 3 months and 1 year follow-up (p < 0.001 for all). During the surgery, the adjusted tibial cut showed more varus than planned and the adjusted femoral cut presented more external rotation than planned (p < 0.05 for both). The final hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) was also more varus than planned (p < 0.05).ConclusionsThis kind of spacer-based gap balancing technique accompanied with the MAKO robotic arm system could promise controlled lower limb alignment and improved functional outcomes after TKA."
pub.1169822462,Comparative analysis of radiation exposure in robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty using popular robotic systems,"Robotic-assisted TKA (RATKA) is a rapidly emerging technique that has been shown to improve precision and accuracy in implant alignment in TKA. Robotic-assisted TKA (RATKA) uses computer software to create a three-dimensional model of the patient’s knee. Different types of preoperative imaging, including radiographs and CT scans, are used to create these models, each with varying levels of radiation exposure. This study aims to determine the radiation dose associated with each type of imaging used in RATKA, to inform patients of the potential risks. A retrospective search of our clinical radiology and arthroplasty database was conducted to identify 140 knees. The patients were divided into three groups based on the type of preoperative imaging they received: (1) CT image-based MAKO Protocol, (2) Antero-posterior long leg alignment films (LLAF), (3) standard AP, lateral, and skyline knee radiographs. The dose of CT imaging technique for each knee was measured using the dose-length product (DLP) with units of mGycm2, whereas the measurement for XRAY images was with the dose area product (DAP) with units of Gycm2. The mean radiation dose for patients in the CT (MAKO protocol) image-based group was 1135 mGy.cm2. The mean radiation dose for patients in the LLAF group was 3081 Gycm2. The mean radiation dose for patients undergoing knee AP/lateral and skyline radiographs was the lowest of the groups, averaging 4.43 Gycm2. Through an ANOVA and post hoc analysis, the results between groups was statistically significant. In this study, we found a significant difference in radiation exposure between standard knee radiographs, LLAF and CT imaging. Nonetheless, the radiation dose for all groups is still within acceptable safety limits."
pub.1090618912,Robotic surgery in hip and knee arthroplasty,"This article provides an overview of current use of robotics in hip and knee arthroplasty. Several studies have reported radiographic improvements in joint alignment using robotic-assisted arthroplasty surgery. The economic case made for introducing robotics in joint arthroplasty largely focuses on the hypothesis of reduced hospital stay and reduction in the rate of revisions. This awaits robust data from long-term studies along with the documentation of clinical benefits that will follow the larger implementation of robotic-assisted surgery. However, modern robotic systems offer an opportunity for reproducible implementation of a preoperative plan, with low complication rates. Growing clinical use may in future present robust data demonstrating an appreciable clinical benefit that justifies the large scale clinical use of robotic technology."
pub.1173639065,Opioid Use After Robotic-Assisted Versus Conventional Total Hip Arthroplasty: A National Database Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we tested the null hypothesis that robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) vs conventional THA was not associated with (1) the amount of postoperative opioid use and (2) the incidence of new, persistent opioid use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a large, national administrative database to identify patients 50 years and older undergoing primary robotic or conventional THA. Patients with hip fractures or a history of malignancy, hip infection, or opioid use disorder were excluded. Patients who filled an opioid prescription within 1 year to 30 days preoperatively or who underwent a subsequent procedure within 1 year after THA were excluded. Outcomes included the morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) filled within the THA perioperative period and the incidence of new, persistent opioid use. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between robotic-assisted THA and new, persistent opioid use, adjusting for age, sex, insurance plan, region, location of surgery, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: In the postoperative period, robotic-assisted THA, compared with conventional THA, was associated with a lower mean total MMEs filled per patient (452.2 vs 517.1; <i>P</i>&lt;.001) and a lower mean MMEs per patient per day (71.53 vs 74.64; <i>P</i>&lt;.001). Patients undergoing robotic-assisted THA had decreased odds of developing new, persistent opioid use compared with patients undergoing conventional THA (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74-0.90]).
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted THA is associated with lower postoperative opioid use and a decreased odds of developing new, persistent opioid use compared with conventional THA. For the purposes of reducing opioid use, our results support the adoption of robotic-assisted THA. [<i>Orthopedics</i>. 2024;47(5):289-294.]."

pub.1171196587,Operating room efficiency for a high-volume surgeon in simultaneous bilateral robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a prospective cohort study,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has been shown to achieve more accurate component positioning and target alignment than conventional jig-based instrumentation; however, concerns remain regarding its adoption since it is associated with steep learning curves, higher operational costs, and increased surgical time. This study aims to compare the operating times of three cohorts of patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKA, i.e., first 50 RATKA, last 50 RATKA (at the end of 1 year), and 50 conventional TKA. This prospective cohort study was conducted at a single high-volume tertiary care center by a single experienced surgeon on 150 patients (300 knees), who were allotted into three equal cohorts of 50, between February 2020 and December 2021. Simultaneous bilateral TKAs were done in all three groups and operative times recorded. We describe the technique for optimizing the surgical time of SB-RATKA for efficient operative room logistics. The operating times of the two robotic-assisted TKA cohorts were compared with the operating times of the conventional SB-TKA cohort. The mean age of the study population was 59(±6.2) years with the majority of females (82%). The mean coronal deformity was comparable between the cohorts. The mean operating time in the conventional CTKA, initial 50 RATKA, and final 50 RATKA cohorts were 115.56 (±10.7), 127.8 (±26), and 91.66 (±13.5) min, respectively, all of which showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). The mean operating times of the final 50 RATKA at the end of 1 year improved by about 36 min with all the SB-RATKA cases being completed in under 120 min. The efficiency of SB-RATKA improved significantly with time and experience, resulting in shorter operational times within a year, revealing the potential of robotic-assisted surgery to surpass conventional approaches in TKA in terms of operating room efficiency."

The purpose of this study was to present implant survivorship, complications and evaluate patients' satisfaction, clinical and functional outcome of RATKA with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. The Oxford Knee Score was recorded preoperatively and at last follow-up. Patients' satisfaction rates, as well as complications and re-operations were studied. Anatomical alignment including varus, valgus deformities and flexion, extension, pre-and postoperatively were evaluated. A total of 156 patients with mean age = 71.9 years were included in the study. The mean follow-up was 35.7 months, while one revision was performed due to infection. Statistically significant improvement of the Oxford Knee Score, as well as of the knee alignment deformities were recorded, while 99.4% of patients reported to be ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with the procedure. RATKA seems to be a safe, as well as reproductible procedure at short-and mid-term follow-up, while the accurate implant positioning may lead to favorable long-term outcomes."

PurposeComputer-assisted arthroplasty supports the surgeons in planning, simulating, and performing the replacement procedure, using robotic or navigation technologies. However, the safety of the technology has not been widely ascertained. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database was interrogated about software-related recalls in computer-assisted arthroplasty, aiming to assess: (1) the incidence, (2) the root causes, and (3) the actions taken due to recalls.MethodsThe Medical Device Recalls database was investigated about software-related recalls in computer-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty surgery, between 2017 and 2022. The incidence of the software-related recalls, the root causes according to FDA and manufacturers, and the corrective actions taken by firms were determined.ResultsEighteen recall numbers could be identified (1.6%), corresponding to 11 recall events. A total of 4634 units were involved. The FDA determined root causes were: software design (66.6%), design change (22.2%), manufacturing deployment (1, 5.6%), and design manufacturing process (5.6%). Among the manufacturers’ reasons for recalls, a specific error was declared in 16 cases (88.9%). In seven cases (43.8%), a coding error about lower limb alignment assessment was identified. Seventeen software-related recalls (94.4%) were classified as class 2; only one case was class 3 (5.6%). Return of the device was the main action taken by firms (8, 44.4%), followed by software update (7, 38.9%).ConclusionSoftware-related recalls in computer-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty were quite uncommon among all the recalls, deemed non-life threatening and usually due to software design errors. The main actions taken by manufacturers were the return of the device or the software update."

Their demographics, diagnosis, acetabular cup positioning, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Harris Hip Score (HHS), and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) at the final follow-up were recorded for analysis.ResultsThere were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in height, weight, BMI, ASA score, or preoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS). Also, there was no difference in inclination angle between the two groups (R-THA: 41.29° ± 3.04°; manual THA (M-THA): 40.47° ± 5.46°; P = 0.312). However, the mean anteversion angle was greater in the R-THA group (20.71° ± 1.98° vs. 19.08° ± 4.04°; P < 0.001). Compared to M-THA, R-THA more frequently achieved an acetabular cup angle within 5° of the target (anteversion, 98.1% vs. 78.1% P = 0.001; inclination, 88.5% vs. 53.1%, P < 0.001). The R-THA group was more advantageous in restoring the hip center of rotation (COR) and leg length difference (LLD). There was no statistical difference in postoperative HHS (P = 0.404) or FJS (P = 0.497) between the two groups.ConclusionsCompared to manual technique, robotic-assisted technique provided more precise acetabular cup positioning and better leg length restoration for obese patients. The robotic-assisted technique was more advantageous in recovering the center of rotation position and achieved a higher proportion of the acetabular cup placed in the target safety zone. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical outcomes of surgeries in obese patients using robotic-assisted technology."
pub.1173747157,Fewer Dislocations After Total Hip Arthroplasty With Robotic Assistance or Fluoroscopic Guidance,"BACKGROUND: Computer navigation and robotic assistance may reduce total hip arthroplasty (THA) dislocations by improving the accuracy and precision of component positioning. We investigated dislocation rates for THAs using conventional techniques, robotic assistance, and computer navigation, while controlling for surgical approach, dual mobility (DM) use, and fluoroscopic guidance.
METHODS: We reviewed 11,740 primary THAs performed between June 2016 and December 2022, including 5,873 conventional, 1,293 with robotic-arm assistance, and 4,574 with navigation. The approach was posterior in 6,580 (56.0%), anterior in 4,342 (37.0%), and lateral in 818 (7.0%). A DM was used in 10.4%. Fluoroscopy was used in 3,653 cases and only with the anterior approach. Multivariate analyses yielded odds ratios (OR) for dislocation and revision. Additional regression analyses for dislocation were performed for approach and DM.
RESULTS: Raw dislocation rates were as follows: conventional 1.2%, robotic 0.4%, navigation 0.9%, anterior with fluoroscopy 0.4%, anterior without fluoroscopy 2.3%, posterior 1.3%, and lateral 0.5%. Upon multivariate analysis, use of robotics was found to be associated with significantly reduced dislocation risk compared to conventional (OR: 0.3), as did anterior (OR: 0.6) compared to posterior approach; navigation and lateral approach were not found to be associated with a significant reduction in risk. For the anterior approach, multivariate analysis demonstrated that fluoroscopy significantly reduced dislocation risk (OR: 0.1), while DM, robotics, and navigation were not significant. For the posterior approach, the dislocation risk was lower with robotics than with conventional (OR: 0.2); the use of navigation or DM did not demonstrate a significant reduction in risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of robotics was associated with a reduction in dislocations for this cohort overall. Further, fluoroscopy in the anterior approach and robotic assistance in the posterior approach were both associated with decreased dislocation risk. The role of imageless computer navigation and DM implants requires further study."
pub.1165464526,Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty is Associated with Earlier Return of Postoperative Range of Motion.,"INTRODUCTION: Postoperative range of motion (ROM) is an important measure for the functional outcome and overall success after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). While robotic knee systems have been shown to reduce pain and improve early function, the return of postoperative ROM specifically has not been adequately studied. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative ROM in robotic and conventional TKA. We hypothesized that robotic TKA leads to an improvement in postoperative ROM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 674 primary TKAs by a single surgeon between January 2018 and February 2023 was completed. Patients that did not have both a two-week follow up and eight-week follow up were excluded. Revision/conversion TKAs were excluded. The population was divided into two cohorts based on technique utilized: robotic versus conventional. Preoperative extension/flexion data, postoperative extension/flexion data at two-week and eight-week follow ups, and manipulation under anesthesia data were collected. ROM was defined as flexion minus extension. Chi-square tests were used to examine for differences between categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables.
RESULTS: A total of 307 robotic and 265 conventional knees were included. There were no differences in demographics, mean follow up, or preoperative ROM between groups. The robotic group had significantly more flexion (99.20° vs. 96.98°; p=0.034) and ROM (97.81° vs. 95.56°; p=0.047) at the two-week follow up. The loss in ROM at the two-week follow up from preoperative ROM was significantly less for the robotic group (-11.21° vs. -14.16°; p=0.031). There were no significant differences in extension at either follow up, in flexion at the eight-week follow up, or in ROM at the eight-week follow up.
CONCLUSION: Robotic TKA leads to an improvement in postoperative flexion and ROM when compared to preoperative ROM at two-week follow up. These findings could partially explain the quicker recovery associated with robotic TKA."
pub.1158088206,Exposure to Extended Reality and Artificial Intelligence-Based Manifestations: A Primer on the Future of Hip and Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Software-infused services, from robot-assisted and wearable technologies to artificial intelligence (AI)-laden analytics, continue to augment clinical orthopaedics - namely hip and knee arthroplasty. Extended reality (XR) tools, which encompass augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality technology, represent a new frontier for expanding surgical horizons to maximize technical education, expertise, and execution. The purpose of this review is to critically detail and evaluate the recent developments surrounding XR in the field of hip and knee arthroplasty and to address potential future applications as they relate to AI.
METHODS: In this narrative review surrounding XR, we discuss (1) definitions, (2) techniques, (3) studies, (4) current applications, and (5) future directions. We highlight XR subsets (augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality) as they relate to AI in the increasingly digitized ecosystem within hip and knee arthroplasty.
RESULTS: A narrative review of the XR orthopaedic ecosystem with respect to XR developments is summarized with specific emphasis on hip and knee arthroplasty. The XR as a tool for education, preoperative planning, and surgical execution is discussed with future applications dependent upon AI to potentially obviate the need for robotic assistance and preoperative advanced imaging without sacrificing accuracy.
CONCLUSION: In a field where exposure is critical to clinical success, XR represents a novel stand-alone software-infused service that optimizes technical education, execution, and expertise but necessitates integration with AI and previously validated software solutions to offer opportunities that improve surgical precision with or without the use of robotics and computed tomography-based imaging."
pub.1137610592,A cautionary case: osteoporotic femur fracture after robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"Osteoporosis is a disease of low bone mass which leads to an increased risk of fracture. The prevalence of osteoporosis is greatest amongst postmenopausal women who also form a large portion of patients with osteoarthritis presenting for total knee arthroplasty. We present a case of a 77-year-old female with knee osteoarthritis and osteoporosis on denosumab who underwent robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty. Postoperatively, she suffered an atraumatic midshaft femur fracture at the pin site associated with the use of intraoperative robotic technology. This is a unique complication related to the use of robotics which requires additional skeletal fixation versus standard arthroplasty surgical technique. We recommend caution and further study regarding the use of robotics in total knee arthroplasty in the setting of osteoporosis and denosumab use."
pub.1101552458,Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: State-of-the Art and Review of the Literature,"BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is a successful treatment for unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis that has lower complication rates, faster recovery, and a more natural feeling knee compared to total knee arthroplasty. However, long-term survival has been a persistent concern. As more surgeon-controlled variables have been linked to survival, interest in robotic-assisted surgery has continued to grow.
METHODS: A review and synthesis of the literature on the subject of robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty was performed.
RESULTS: We present the driving factors behind the development of robotic-assisted techniques in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and the current state-of-the art. The ability of surgeons to achieve intraoperative targets with robotic assistance and the outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery are also described.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted surgery has become increasingly popular in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, as it allows surgeons to more accurately and reproducibly plan and achieve operative targets during surgery. Cost remains a concern, and it remains to be seen whether robotic-assisted surgery will improve long-term survivorship after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty."
pub.1163613211,"Revolutionizing orthopedics: a comprehensive review of robot-assisted surgery, clinical outcomes, and the future of patient care","Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery (RAOS) is revolutionizing the field, offering the potential for increased accuracy and precision and improved patient outcomes. This comprehensive review explores the historical perspective, current robotic systems, advantages and limitations, clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, future developments, and innovation in RAOS. Based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and recent studies, this article highlights the most significant findings and compares RAOS to conventional techniques. As robotic-assisted surgery continues to evolve, clinicians and researchers must stay informed and adapt their practices to provide optimal patient care. Evidence from published studies corroborates these claims, highlighting superior component positioning, decreased incidence of complications, and heightened patient satisfaction. However, challenges such as costs, learning curves, and technical issues must be resolved to fully capitalize on these advantages."
pub.1156098900,A comparison of pin site complications between large and small pin diameters in robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty typically necessitates use of tracking pins, which can vary in diameter. Complications such as infections and fractures at the pin-site have been observed, but clarification of the effect of pin diameter on complication is needed. The aim of this study is to compare the pin-related complication rates following robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty between 4.5 mm and 3.2 mm diameter pins.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 90-day pin-site complication rates after robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty were compared between 4.5 mm diameter and 3.2 mm diameter groups. In total, 367 patients were included: 177 with large pin diameter and 190 with small pin diameter. All four pin sites were evaluated using postoperative radiographs. Cases without orthogonal views or visualization of all four pin tracts were noted. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for age, which differed between the two cohorts.
RESULTS: The rate of pin-site complications was 5.6% in the large pin diameter cohort and 2.6% in the small pin diameter cohort, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. The adjusted odds ratio for complications in small compared to large diameter group was 0.48, with a p-value of 0.18. The most common pin-site complication was infection/persistent drainage, found in 1.9% of patients, followed by intraoperative fracture of the second cortex in 1.4%. Intraoperative fracture could not be ruled out in 96 cases due to inadequate radiographic visualization of all pin sites. There was one postoperative pin-site fracture in the large diameter cohort, which required operative fixation.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates no statistically significant difference in pin-site complication rates after robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty between 4.5 mm and 3.2 mm pin diameter cohorts, although there was a trend towards increased intraoperative and postoperative pin-site fractures in the 4.5 mm group."
pub.1170447890,Contemporary analysis of the learning curve for robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty emerging technologies,"Robotic assisted (RA) total hip arthroplasty (THA) offers improved acetabular component placement and radiographic outcomes, but inconsistent assessment methods of its learning curves render the evaluation of adopting novel platforms challenging. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to assess the learning curve associated with RA-THA, both tracking a surgeon's performance across initial cases and comparing their performance to manual THA (M-THA). PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar were searched on June 16, 2023, to identify studies published between January 1, 2000 and June 16, 2023 (PROSPERO registration: CRD42023437339). The query yielded 655 unique articles, which were screened for eligibility. The final analysis included 11 articles, evaluating 1351 THA procedures. Risk of bias was assessed via the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) tool. The mean MINORS score was 21.3 ± 0.9. RA-THA provided immediate improvements in acetabular component placement accuracy and radiographic outcomes compared to M-THA, with little to no experience required to achieve peak proficiency. A modest learning curve (12–17 cases) was associated with operative time, which was elevated compared to M-THA (+ 9–13 min). RA-THA offers immediate advantages to M-THA for component placement accuracy and radiographic outcomes. Surgeons should expect to experience increased operative times, which become less pronounced or equivalent to M-THA after a modest caseload."
pub.1144753917,The Cost-Effectiveness of Robotic-Assisted Versus Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Markov Model–Based Evaluation,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) versus conventional manual TKA in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
METHODS: A Markov model simulated the lifetime outcomes of TKA of patients at average age 60 years. Costs of robotic-assisted TKA included a preoperative CT scan and the costs for acquisition and use of robotic equipment (average $706,250). We used three institutional case volumes to generate average per-case robotic costs: low volume (10 cases, $71,025 per case), mid volume (100 cases, $7,463 per case), and high volume (200 cases, $3,931 per case). Systematic reviews were used to determine early (≤1 year) and late (> 1 year) revision rates after robotic-assisted TKA (0.3 and 0.6%, respectively) and conventional TKA (0.78% and 1.5%, respectively). Outcomes were total costs and health outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were organized into incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A procedure was considered cost-effective if its ICER fell below willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the effect of data uncertainty.
RESULTS: Robotic-assisted TKA produced 13.55 QALYs versus 13.29 QALYs for conventional TKA. Total costs per case for robotic-assisted TKA were $92,823 (low volume), $29,261 (mid volume), and $25,730 (high volume) compared with $25,113 for conventional. The ICERs for robotic-assisted TKAs were $256,055/QALY (low volume), $15,685/QALY (mid volume), and $2,331/QALY (high volume). ICERs for mid- and high-volume institutions were below WTP. Average number needed to treat was >42 and >24 robotic-assisted TKAs for cost-effectiveness at the $50,000 and $100,000/QALY WTP. Robotic-assisted TKAs remained cost-effective when annual revision rates <1.6% and quality of life values were >0.85.
CONCLUSION: With lower annualized revision rates and higher postoperative quality of life, robotic-assisted TKAs potentially offer improved health outcomes, especially when annual institutional case volume >24 cases per year. Continued prospective investigation will be crucial to demonstrate the value of this new technology."
pub.1167793743,Automated digital templating of component sizing is accurate in robotic total hip arthroplasty when compared to predicate software,"Accurate pre-operative templating of prosthesis components is an essential factor in successful total hip arthroplasty (THA), including robotically-assisted THA (RA-THA) techniques. We sought to validate the accuracy of a novel, robotic-optimized THA planning software compared to a predicate THA planner for component sizing. We analyzed a series of 199 patients who received manual THA (mTHA) and fluoroscopy-based RA-THA at a single institution. All cases were templated using a predicate pre-operative templating software. For RA-THA cases, the novel robotic-optimized pre-operative planner software was also used for templating. The differences between templated and implanted acetabular cup, femoral head, and stem component sizes were compared based on matching within 1, 2, and ≥3 sizes. Differences in templated and implanted femoral stem implant geometry were also compared. The robot-optimized pre-operative RA-THA plans demonstrated equivalent accuracy to that of predicate pre-operative plans for both RA-THA and mTHA cases. Templated acetabular cups (90.4 vs. 86.8 vs. 82.8; p = 0.421), femoral stems (76.0 vs. 65.1 vs. 67.7; p = 0.096), and femoral heads (91.3 vs. 96.2 vs. 88.2; p = 0.302) were within +/-1 size of implanted components. No significant differences were detected in the proportion of matching templated and implanted stem geometry across the study cohorts."
pub.1158258303,Early muscle recovery following robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"BackgroundRobotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) improves implant accuracy, however whether this translates to patient function is less clear. Various outcomes have been reported but muscle recovery has not been previously investigated.ObjectiveTo explore sequential change in lower limb muscle strength following robotic-assisted UKA with isokinetic dynamometry.Results12 participants undergoing rUKA for medial compartment osteoarthritis were assessed pre-operatively, and at 6- and 12-weeks post-operatively. Maximal muscle strength changed over time in both quadriceps (p = 0.006) and hamstrings (p = 0.018) muscle groups. Quadriceps strength reduced from 88.52(39.86)Nm to 74.47(27.58)Nm by 6-weeks (p = 0.026), and then recovered to 90.41(38.76)Nm by 12-weeks (p = 0.018). Hamstring strength reduced from 62.45(23.18)Nm to 54.12(20.49)Nm by 6-weeks (p = 0.016), and then recovered to 55.07(17.99)Nm by 12-weeks (p = 0.028). By 12-weeks quadriceps strength was 70% and hamstrings 83% of the values achieved in the un-operated limb. Substantial improvement was seen in all other measures over time, with sequential positive change in Timed-up-and-go test (p = 0.015), 10 m walk test (p = 0.021), range of knee flexion (p = 0.016) and PROMs (p < 0.025)."
pub.1169271043,Factors associated with decreased length of stay following robotic arm-assisted and conventional total hip arthroplasty,"Aims: Postoperative length of stay (LOS) and discharge dispositions following arthroplasty can be used as surrogate measurements for improvements in patients' pathways and costs. With the increasing use of robotic technology in arthroplasty, it is important to assess its impact on LOS. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with decreased LOS following robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RO THA) compared with the conventional technique (CO THA).
Methods: This large-scale, single-institution study included 1,607 patients of any age who underwent 1,732 primary THAs for any indication between May 2019 and January 2023. The data which were collected included the demographics of the patients, LOS, type of anaesthetic, the need for treatment in a post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), readmission within 30 days, and discharge disposition. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors and the characteristics of patients which were associated with delayed discharge.
Results: The multivariate model identified that age, female sex, admission into a PACU, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade > II, and CO THA were associated with a significantly higher risk of a LOS of > two days. The median LOS was 54 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 34 to 78) in the RO THA group compared with 60 hours (IQR 51 to 100) in the CO THA group (p < 0.001). The discharge dispositions were comparable between the two groups. A higher proportion of patients undergoing CO THA required PACU admission postoperatively, although without reaching statistical significance (7.2% vs 5.2%, p = 0.238).
Conclusion: We found that among other baseline characteristics and comorbidities, RO THA was associated with a significantly shorter LOS, with no difference in discharge destination. With the increasing demand for THA, these findings suggest that robotic assistance in THA could reduce costs. However, randomized controlled trials are required to investigate the cost-effectiveness of this technology."
pub.1169860651,Excellent 10-Year survivorship of robotic-arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Introduction: Robotic-arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an excellent solution for patients suffering from single-compartment knee arthritis. While outcomes tend to be favorable for UKAs, revision operations, commonly due to component malpositioning and malalignment resulting in accelerated wear, are a major concern. Intraoperative technologies, such as robotic assistance, can help better ensure that implants are positioned based on a patient's specific anatomy and mechanical physiology. However, long-term survivorship and patient-reported satisfaction with robotic-assisted UKAs are limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the 10-year outcomes of patients who underwent robotic-arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) 10-year survivorships; 2) patient satisfaction scores; and 3) re-operations.
Methods: From a single surgeon and single institution, 185 patients who had a mean age of 65 years (range, 39 to 92) and a mean body mass index of 31.6 (range, 22.4 to 39) at a mean of 10 years follow-up were evaluated (range, 9 to 11). For all patients, the same robotic-assistive device was utilized intraoperatively, and all patients underwent standardized physical therapy and received standardized pain control management. Then 10-year survivorships with Kaplan-Meir curves, patient satisfaction evaluations with a 5-point Likert scale, and re-operations were assessed as primary outcomes.
Results: Overall implant survivorship was 99%, with only two patients requiring revision surgery. There was one patient who was converted to a total knee arthroplasty, while the other patient underwent polyethylene exchange at 5 weeks for an acute infection with successful implant retention. Overall, 97% of the patients were satisfied with their postoperative outcomes, with 81% of patients reporting being very satisfied. There were two other patients who required arthroscopic intervention: one to remove a cement loose body, the other to remove adhered scar from the fat pad and the anterior cruciate ligament.
Conclusion: This study is one of the first to provide longer-term (mean 10-year) survivorship and patient-reported satisfaction outcomes for robotic-assisted UKA patients. These data show strong support for utilizing this surgical technique, as nearly all patients maintained their original prostheses and reported being satisfied after a mean of 10 years. Therefore, based on these results, we recommend the use of robotic assistance when performing UKAs."
pub.1053428144,Robotics in Arthroplasty: A Comprehensive Review,"Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery has been available clinically in some form for over 2 decades, claiming to improve total joint arthroplasty by enhancing the surgeon's ability to reproduce alignment and therefore better restore normal kinematics. Various current systems include a robotic arm, robotic-guided cutting jigs, and robotic milling systems with a diversity of different navigation strategies using active, semiactive, or passive control systems. Semiactive systems have become dominant, providing a haptic window through which the surgeon is able to consistently prepare an arthroplasty based on preoperative planning. A review of previous designs and clinical studies demonstrate that these robotic systems decrease variability and increase precision, primarily focusing on component positioning and alignment. Some early clinical results indicate decreased revision rates and improved patient satisfaction with robotic-assisted arthroplasty. The future design objectives include precise planning and even further improved consistent intraoperative execution. Despite this cautious optimism, many still wonder whether robotics will ultimately increase cost and operative time without objectively improving outcomes. Over the long term, every industry that has seen robotic technology be introduced, ultimately has shown an increase in production capacity, improved accuracy and precision, and lower cost. A new generation of robotic systems is now being introduced into the arthroplasty arena, and early results with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty have demonstrated improved accuracy of placement, improved satisfaction, and reduced complications. Further studies are needed to confirm the cost effectiveness of these technologies."
pub.1078635247,Computer-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty. Navigation and active robotic systems: an evidence-based analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The Medical Advisory Secretariat undertook a review of the evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computer assisted hip and knee arthroplasty. The two computer assisted arthroplasty systems that are the topics of this review are (1) navigation and (2) robotic-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty.
THE TECHNOLOGY: Computer-assisted arthroplasty consists of navigation and robotic systems. Surgical navigation is a visualization system that provides positional information about surgical tools or implants relative to a target bone on a computer display. Most of the navigation-assisted arthroplasty devices that are the subject of this review are licensed by Health Canada. Robotic systems are active robots that mill bone according to information from a computer-assisted navigation system. The robotic-assisted arthroplasty devices that are the subject of this review are not currently licensed by Health Canada.
REVIEW STRATEGY: The Cochrane and International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment databases did not identify any health technology assessments on navigation or robotic-assisted hip or knee arthroplasty. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published between January 1, 1996 and November 30, 2003. This search produced 367 studies, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: NAVIGATION-ASSISTED ARTHROPLASTY: Five studies were identified that examined navigation-assisted arthroplasty.A Level 1 evidence study from Germany found a statistically significant difference in alignment and angular deviation between navigation-assisted and free-hand total knee arthroplasty in favour of navigation-assisted surgery. However, the endpoints in this study were short-term. To date, the long-term effects (need for revision, implant longevity, pain, functional performance) are unknown.(1)A Level 2 evidence short-term study found that navigation-assisted total knee arthroplasty was significantly better than a non-navigated procedure for one of five postoperative measured angles.(2)A Level 2 evidence short-term study found no statistically significant difference in the variation of the abduction angle between navigation-assisted and conventional total hip arthroplasty.(3)Level 3 evidence observational studies of navigation-assisted total knee arthroplasty and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have been conducted. Two studies reported that ""the follow-up of the navigated prostheses is currently too short to know if clinical outcome or survival rates are improved. Longer follow-up is required to determine the respective advantages and disadvantages of both techniques.""(4;5) ROBOTIC-ASSISTED ARTHROPLASTY: Four studies were identified that examined robotic-assisted arthroplasty.A Level 1 evidence study revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between functional hip scores at 24 months post implantation between patients who underwent robotic-assisted primary hip arthropl"
pub.1151967110,Where are We Now and What are We Hoping to Achieve with Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty? A Critical Analysis of the Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) has been developed to improve knee kinematics and functional outcomes, expedite recovery, and improve implants long-term survivorship. Robotic devices are classified into active, semi-active, and passive, based on their degree of freedom. Their capacity to provide increased accuracy in implants positioning with reduced radiographic outliers has been widely proved. However, these early advantages are yet to be associated with long-term survivorship. Moreover, multiple drawbacks are still encountered including a variable learning curve, increased setup and maintenance costs, and potential complications related to the surgical technique. Despite recent technologies applied to TKA have failed to prove substantial improvements, robotic-assisted surgery seems to be here to stay and revolutionize the field of TKA. To support its consistent usage on a daily basis, long-term results are still awaited, and further improvements are necessary to reduce the expenses related to it."

While total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is preferred for osteoarthritic patients with osteopetrosis, inherent disease characteristics pose surgical challenges. This article presents a patient with osteopetrosis treated with robotic arm-assisted TKA (RA-TKA).

(HKA) angle and prosthetic alignment with three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) measurements in patients who underwent robotic-assisted (RA) TKA, with consideration of the soft tissue envelope via an intraoperative joint-balancing procedure. We hypothesized that intraoperative consideration of soft tissue laxity in individual patients using imageless RA technology will not necessarily result in kinematically aligned bicruciate stabilized total knee arthroplasty (KA TKA). This retrospective study included consecutive patients who underwent RA TKA between 2019 and 2020. The indication for TKA was varus osteoarthritis of the knee. During this period, 60 RA bi-cruciate stabilized TKAs were performed. Prosthetic alignments were measured using computer software with 3DCT. We determined prosthetic positioning and bone resection volume with consideration of the soft tissue envelope using an intraoperative full range of motion joint-balancing procedure during RA TKA. 3DCT scans of the entire lower extremity were taken before and after surgery. Postoperative varus HKA alignment occurred in 58% of patients who underwent RA TKA, 31% of knees were in femoral valgus alignment and tibial varus alignment, and 42% had femoral components in internal rotation among knees with femoral valgus alignment and tibial varus alignment. The mean thickness of the osteotomized medial and lateral posterior condyles of the femur were 11.2 and 9.1 mm, respectively, based on 3DCT measurements. Intraoperative consideration of soft tissue laxity in individual patientsusing an imageless RA technique does not necessarily result in KA bicruciate TKA."
pub.1173003518,"Clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes of robotic assisted versus conventional total hip arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aims to compare important clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes between robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RATHA) and conventional total hip arthroplasty (COTHA) in patients with hip osteoarthritis. We identified published RCTs comparing RATHA with COTHA in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently performed study screening, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main outcomes were major complications, revision, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and radiological outcomes. We included 8 RCTs involving 1014 patients and 977 hips. There was no difference in major complication rate (Relative Risk (RR) 0.78; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.22 to 2.74), revision rate (RR 1.33; 95%CI 0.08 to 22.74), and PROMs (standardized mean difference 0.01; 95%CI − 0.27 to 0.30) between RATHA and COTHA. RATHA resulted in little to no effects on femoral stem alignment (mean difference (MD) − 0.57 degree; 95%CI − 1.16 to 0.03) but yielded overall lower leg length discrepancy (MD − 4.04 mm; 95%CI − 7.08 to − 1.0) compared to COTHA. Most combined estimates had low certainty of evidence mainly due to risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Based on the current evidence, there is no important difference in clinical and functional outcomes between RATHA and COTHA. The trivial higher radiological accuracy was also unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Regardless, more robust evidence is needed to improve the quality and strength of the current evidence.PROSPERO registration: the protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42023453294). All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations."
pub.1155517997,Image-Free Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Results in Quicker Recovery but Equivalent One-Year Outcomes Compared to Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed whether robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) significantly impacts functional outcomes. This study was conducted to determine whether image-free RA-TKA improves function compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty (C-TKA), performed without the utilization of robotics or navigation, using the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) and Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) as measures of meaningful clinical improvement.
METHODS: A multicenter propensity score-matched retrospective study was conducted of RA-TKA using an image-free robotic system and C-TKA cases at an average follow-up of 14 months (range, 12 months to 20 months). Consecutive patients who underwent primary unilateral TKA and had a preoperative and postoperative Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR) were included. The primary outcomes were the MCID and PASS for KOOS-JR. 254 RA-TKA and 762 C-TKA patients were included, with no significant differences in sex, age, body mass index, or comorbidities.
RESULTS: Preoperative KOOS-JR scores were similar in the RA-TKA and C-TKA cohorts. Significantly greater improvement in KOOS-JR scores were achieved at 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively with RA-TKA compared to C-TKA. While the mean 1-year postoperative KOOS-JR was significantly higher in the RA-TKA cohort, no significant differences were found in the Delta KOOS-JR scores between the cohorts, when comparing preoperative and 1-year postoperative. No significant differences existed in the rates of MCID or PASS being achieved.
CONCLUSION: Image-free RA-TKA reduces pain and improves early functional recovery compared to C-TKA at 4 to 6 weeks, but functional outcomes at 1 year are equivalent based on the MCID and PASS for KOOS-JR."
pub.1140942775,Robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty: an evolution in progress. A concise review of the available systems and the data supporting them,"IntroductionA review of the data supporting robotic systems currently available is presented focussing on precision and reproducibility, radiological outcomes, clinical outcomes, and survivorship.Materials and methodsScientific literature published on robotic systems for knee arthroplasty was reviewed using the reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Inclusion criteria were any study involving robotic-assisted UKA or TKA that reported precision of implant positioning or functional outcomes or range of motion or survivorship, including cadaveric or dry bone studies with a minimum of 6-month follow-up.ResultsThirty-nine studies were identified for robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and 24 studies for robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty. Those that reported on radiological outcomes or cadaver studies consistently demonstrated improved precision with the use of robotic systems irrespective of the system. PROMS and survival data demonstrated equivalent short-term results. However, many studies reported outcomes inconsistently and few had long-term clinical follow-up or survivorship data.ConclusionsThis review adds to the body of evidence supporting improved precision and reproducibility with robotic assistance in knee arthroplasty. Despite intensive funding of research into robotic knee systems, there remains considerable heterogeneity in exposure and outcome analysis and few quality long-term studies demonstrating translation to better clinical outcomes and implant survivorship."
pub.1153122688,Preliminary outcomes of kinematically aligned robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty with patient-specific cartilage thickness measurement,"This study aimed to assess the preliminary outcomes of kinematically aligned robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with patient-specific cartilage thickness measurement. Patients who underwent kinematically aligned robot-assisted TKA were included in this study. Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasties were performed by NAVIO Surgical System (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, USA), an image-free handheld robotic system. The kinematic alignment technique was performed according to our intraoperative cartilage thickness measurement technique. Hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA), joint-line orientation angle (JLOA), and joint-line convergence angle (JLCA) were measured through standing full-length anteroposterior radiographs. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Oxford score, VAS pain and satisfaction score, and Forgotten Joint Score were used to assess clinical outcomes. A total of 142 knees of 109 patients (92 females and 17 males) were evaluated in this study. There was a significant correction in HKA, JLCA, and mMPTA postoperatively (p ≤0.001, < 0.001, and 0.029, respectively). We observed no significant change in mLDFA and JLOA measurements. All clinical scores significantly increased at the latest follow-up. Our results demonstrated that kinematically aligned robot-assisted TKA with patient-specific cartilage thickness measurement demonstrated no significant change in mLDFA and JLOA, as expected; however, significantly corrected the deformity in HKA, mMPTA, and JLCA measurements."
pub.1164787139,Robotic‐arm assisted total knee arthroplasty is associated with comparable functional outcomes but improved forgotten joint scores compared with conventional manual total knee arthroplasty at five‐year follow‐up,"PURPOSE: This study reports the five-year functional outcomes from a prospective cohort study comparing robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RO TKA) versus conventional manual total knee arthroplasty (CO TKA).
METHODS: This prospective single-surgeon study included 120 patients with symptomatic end-stage knee arthritis undergoing primary TKA. This included 60 consecutive patients undergoing CO TKA followed by 60 consecutive patients undergoing RO TKA using a semi-automated robotic device. Study patients were reviewed at one, two, and five years after surgery and the following outcomes recorded: The University of California at Los Angeles activity-level (UCLA), Knee Society Score (KSS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS) Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), and any complications.
RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between RO TKA and CO TKA in the median UCLA score (p = N.S), median KSS (p = N.S), and median OKS (p = N.S) at five-year follow-up. RO-TKA was associated with statistically significant improvements in the FJS at one (p = 0.001), two (p = 0.003), and five (p = 0.025) years of follow-up compared with CO TKA. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of knee stiffness requiring manipulation under anesthesia between the two treatment groups (p = N.S).
CONCLUSION: Patients in both treatment groups had excellent functional outcomes with comparable patient reported outcomes at five-year follow-up. RO TKA was associated with statistically significant improvements in the FJS compared with CO TKA, but these differences did not reach the minimal clinically important difference at any follow-up interval. There was no overall difference in complications between the two treatment groups at five-year follow-up.

pub.1107037484,The effectiveness of robotic hip and knee arthroplasty on patient-reported outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"PurposeThe purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of semi-active and active robotic hip and knee arthroplasty on post-operative patient-reported outcomes of function, pain, quality of life and satisfaction with surgery.MethodsPubMed, Medline, Embase and CENTRAL were searched. Included were comparative studies investigating the effectiveness of semi-active or active robotic hip or knee arthroplasty compared to any other surgical intervention on function, pain, quality of life and satisfaction with surgery. Risk of bias and the strength of the evidence were assessed using the Downs and Black tool and the GRADE system, respectively. Relative risks, mean differences and 95% CI were calculated using random-effects models.ResultsFourteen studies involving 1342 patients were included. All studies compared robotic to conventional surgery, with active robotic surgery evaluated in total hip or knee arthroplasty and semi-active robotic surgery in total hip or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Most studies presented some risk of bias, and the strength of evidence was rated as low to very low quality. Random-effects meta-analyses showed that post-operative functional outcomes were comparable between active robotic and conventional total hip and knee arthroplasty at the short-, medium- and long-term follow-up. No significant difference in pain, quality of life and satisfaction with surgery were reported in individual studies.ConclusionsThis systematic and meta-analyses indicates that functional outcomes for patients undergoing active robotic total hip and knee arthroplasty were comparable to conventional surgery. Whether semi-active or active robotic hip or knee arthroplasty is effective in improving post-operative pain, quality of life and satisfaction with surgery is unclear.PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42017059932."
pub.1164102069,"Implant Position, Survivorship, and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Manual Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty","BACKGROUND: Two related recent reports described high error rates for implant positioning and reduced implant survivorship in manual unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (MUKA) compared to robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RUKA). The present study scientifically replicated these reports by comparing MUKAs similarly performed by an experienced high-volume surgeon in similar patients using the same study methods as these reports.
METHODS: A total of 216 consecutive MUKAs were retrospectively evaluated radiographically for achievement of implant positioning targets. Achievement of targets was compared to the published MUKA and RUKA outcomes and correlated with revision rates and patient-reported outcome measures.
RESULTS: There were 20% of study MUKAs compared to 88.1% of comparison MUKAs (P < .001) and 31.4% of comparison RUKAs (P < .048) that failed to meet all 7 implant positioning targets. The MUKA revision rates were significantly lower in the study sample than for comparison MUKAs (3.2% versus 14.2%, P < .001). Implant survivorship was 91.7% (95% confidence interval 84.9, 98.5%) at 8.9 years compared to 70.0% (95% confidence interval 56.0, 80.0%) at 10.2 years, respectively. Most patient-reported outcome measures did not differ based on achievement of implant positioning targets (P ≥ .072).
CONCLUSIONS: Present study findings indicate that observations in the 2 recent reports may not be generalizable to all UKA surgeons. Additional data on the relationship between implant positioning and revision as well as functional outcomes are needed to identify appropriate robotic arthroplasty applications."
pub.1150356591,Status and future of modern technologies in arthroplasty,"BackgroundThe orthopedic community is divided on the question of whether modern technologies in arthroplasty improve outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this initiative of the working group on intraoperative imaging and technology integration (Arbeitsgemeinschaft intraoperative Bildgebung und Technologieintegration, AGiTEC) is to initiate the collection of additional data for the scientific evaluation of modern technologies.QuestionTo what extent are modern technologies currently used and which implementations are planned? Do the members of the German Society for Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) consider the acquisition of additional data for scientific assessment necessary?MethodsMembers of the DGOU were asked via an e‑mail survey about the distribution and projected introduction of modern technologies in arthroplasty. They were also asked whether sufficient data were collected for scientific evaluation and whether acquisition of additional data in studies or arthroplasty registries were considered necessary.ResultsOf the 7923 probands surveyed, 428 completed the questionnaire in full (5.4%). It was found that individual implants and navigation are currently the most frequently used (31% and 29%, respectively). The largest increases in the next 2 years are projected for virtual reality and robotics (+30% and +23%, respectively), 85% of respondents indicated that insufficient data were collected for scientific evaluation, and 89% each requested initiation of multicenter studies and inclusion of technologies in the arthroplasty registry.ConclusionThe results of this study should motivate the scientific community, industry, and those responsible for the arthroplasty registries to collect and analyze data for the scientific assessment of modern technologies."

No patient experienced any minor or major complications related to the use of pin trackers in the distal femur and proximal tibia. <i>Conclusions:</i> This periarticular technique that uses pin trackers in the distal femur and proximal tibia through a single main incision could be a useful option for orthopedic surgeons while performing robotic-assisted TKA."
pub.1157569946,Learning curve of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty and its effects on implant position in asian patients: a prospective study,"BackgroundRobot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (r-TKA) can reportedly achieve more accurate implant positioning than conventional total knee arthroplasty (c-TKA), although its learning curve is controversial. Moreover, few studies have investigated r-TKA in Asians, who have different anatomical characteristics. This study aimed to determine the learning curve for r-TKA and compare implant positions between r-TKA and c-TKA according to the learning curve in Asian patients.MethodsThis prospective study included 50 consecutive c-TKAs (group C), followed by 50 consecutive r-TKAs conducted using the MAKO robotic system (Stryker, USA). Cumulative summation analyses were performed to assess the learning curve for operative time in r-TKA. Accordingly, the r-TKA cases were divided into the initial (group I) and proficiency cases (group P). The femoral and tibial component positions in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes and lower limb alignment were compared among the three groups.Resultsr-TKA was associated with a learning curve for operative time in 18 cases. The operative time was significantly shorter in groups C and P than that in group I, with no significant difference between groups C and P. Groups I and P demonstrated fewer outliers with respect to lower limb alignment, femoral component coronal position, axial position, and tibial component sagittal position than those in group C, with no significant difference between groups I and P.ConclusionThe operative time did not differ significantly between r-TKA and c-TKA after the learning curve. Surgeons could expect more accurate and reproducible lower limb alignment and implant positioning with r-TKA in Asian patients, irrespective of the learning curve."

pub.1165943341,Efficacy of the newly designed “SkyWalker” robot compared to the MAKO robotic system in primary total knee arthroplasty: a one-year follow-up study,"PurposeRobot-assisted surgical systems for performing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have gained significant attention. This study was designed to compare the surgical outcomes in primary TKA surgery between the recently developed “SkyWalker” robot system and the more commonly used MAKO robot.MethodsA total of 75 patients undergoing primary TKA surgery by the same surgical team were included in this study, with 30 patients in the “SkyWalker” group and 45 patients in the “MAKO"" group. We documented the osteotomy plan for both robotic systems. The lower limb alignment angles were evaluated by postoperative radiographic assessment. The operation time, estimated blood loss, postoperative hospital stays, and changes in laboratory indexes were collected during hospitalization. In addition, a comparative evaluation of knee functional assessments and complications was conducted during six month and one year follow-ups.ResultsThere were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the accuracy of restoring lower limb alignment, estimated blood loss, or operation time. The knee function assessments at six months and one year postoperatively were similar in both groups. Except for day three after surgery, the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the change in IL-6 (∆IL-6) from preoperative baseline were higher in the “SkyWalker” group than in the MAKO group (median: 20.53 vs. 14.17, P=0.050 and median: 17.30 vs. 10.09, P=0.042, respectively). Additionally, one patient from the MAKO group underwent revision surgery at nine months postoperatively due to ongoing periprosthetic discomfort.ConclusionsThe newly developed “SkyWalker” robot showed comparable efficacy to the MAKO robot in terms of lower limb alignment accuracy and postoperative six month and one year follow-up of clinically assessed resumption of knee function."
pub.1175528282,Is bicortical femoral pin insertion safe for Image-based Robotic Knee Arthroplasty Surgery ? A comparative complications analysis in 970 Consecutive Cases,"OBJECTIVES: Limited data exists on complications associated with robotic image-based system in knee arthroplasty. This study aims to document complications in robotic arm-assisted knee arthroplasties, and evaluate the system's safety by comparing two femoral pin insertion methods: bicortical diaphyseal with additional stab wounds, and unicortical metaphyseal placement through the main incision.
METHODS: All patients undergoing primary knee arthroplasty with the image-based robotic system (Mako, Stryker, Mako Surgical Corp., Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA) from 1<sup>st</sup> March 2021 to 31<sup>st</sup> January 2024 with a minimum follow-up of 2 months were included. Demographics, system and non-system-related complications, as well as outcomes were recorded. Complications were categorized as either major (requiring a second surgical intervention) or minor.
RESULTS: A total of 970 consecutive cases (median age 69.3 years) were analyzed. The unicortical group comprised 651 cases, while the bicortical group 319. The incidence of non-system-related complications was 2.37%, with the most common being joint stiffness (10 cases; 1.03%), followed by lateral femoral condyle fracture (4;0.41%). The overall incidence of system-specific complications was 1.03%. Pin-related femoral fractures occurred in 0.2% of cases, all postoperatively and in the unicortical group. There was no statistically significant difference between the femoral pin insertion-related complication rates among the two groups (0.3% in the unicortical, compared to 0% in the bicortical group; p-value= 0.3). Complications included tibia fracture (0.1%), delayed wound healing (0.2%), superficial wound infection (0.1%), tibia osteomyelitis (0.1%), and ""exostosis"" (0.2%). The major complications rate was 0.3% and minor 0.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimal system-specific overall complications indicate that robotic arm-assisted surgery is safe. The bicortical diaphyseal femoral pin insertion method does not increase the complication rates compared to the unicortical metaphyseal method.

pub.1156182170,"Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: What are Patients’ Perspectives, Understanding and Expectations?","BACKGROUND: The rate of using robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has increased markedly. Understanding how patients view the role of robotics during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) informs shared decision making and facilitate efforts to appropriately educate patients regarding the risks and benefits of robotic assistance.
METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 440 potential TKA patients at the time of their surgery scheduling. Participants answered 25 questions regarding RA-TKA, socioeconomic factors, and their willingness to pay (WTP) for RA-TKA. Logistic regressions were used to determine if population characteristics and surgeon preferences influenced the patients' perceptions of RA-TKA.
RESULTS: There were 39.7% of respondents who said that they had no knowledge regarding RA-TKA. Only 40.7% of participants had expressed a desire for RA-TKA to be used. There were 8.7% who were WTP extra for the use of RA-TKA. Participants believed that the main 3 benefits of RA-TKA compared to conventional methods were: more accurate implant placement (56.2%); better results (49.0%); and faster recovery (32.1%). The main 3 patient concerns were harm from malfunction (55.2%), reduced surgeon role in the procedure (48.1%), and lack of supportive research (28.3%). Surgeon preference of RA-TKA was associated with patient's willingness to have RA-TKA (odds ratio 4.60, confidence interval 2.98-7.81, P < .001), and with WTP extra for RA-TKA (odds ratio 2.05, confidence interval: 1.01-4.26, P = .049).
CONCLUSION: Patient knowledge regarding RA-TKA is limited. Nonpeer-reviewed online information may make prospective TKA candidates vulnerable to misinformation and aggressive advertising. The challenge for orthopaedic surgeons is to re-establish control and reliably educate patients about the proven advantages and disadvantages of this emerging technology."
pub.1145664468,Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Allows for Trainee Involvement and Teaching Without Lengthening Operative Time,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) is more accurate than mechanical total knee arthroplasty (M-TKA) and can provide real-time feedback about alignment and soft-tissue balancing that may be helpful in trainee education. However, both robotic-assist and trainee involvement potentially increase the surgical time. This study sought to evaluate whether RA-TKA procedures were longer than M-TKA procedures and whether trainee participation added additional surgical time.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 220 consecutive primary TKAs (110 M-TKA and 110 RA-TKA) performed by an orthopedic trainee under supervision or performed by the consultant surgeon with an assistant present. For M-TKAs, a measured resection technique was used. For all RA-TKAs, the MAKO robotic system (Stryker, USA) was used. Tourniquet time was measured from inflation immediately prior to skin incision to deflation after placement of the final polyethylene insert. Procedures performed by a consulting surgeon with a surgical assist were used as controls for procedures performed by the trainee. In trainee-conducted procedures, the trainee is responsible for performing all critical aspects of the procedure while the consulting surgeon provides supervision and acts as first assist.
RESULTS: 103 M-TKA and 96 RA-TKA were included. Tourniquet time was significantly longer for RA-TKAs vs M-TKAs (100 vs 89 minutes, P < .0001). However, there were no significant differences in tourniquet times between surgery performed by a trainee vs the consulting surgeon with surgical assist for either M-TKA (P = .3452) or RA-TKA (P = .6724).
CONCLUSIONS: While RA-TKA takes longer, orthopedic trainees do not add additional time. Trainees at all stages of postgraduate learning can be educated in the use of robotic technology and potentially benefit from real-time feedback without further compromising surgical efficiency or increasing patient risk."
pub.1172913294,Evaluating the accuracy of a new robotically assisted system in cadaveric total knee arthroplasty procedures,"BackgroundRobot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been shown to facilitate high-precision bone resection, which is an important goal in TKA. The aim of this cadaveric study was to analyze the accuracy of the target angle and bone resection thickness of a recently introduced robotic TKA system.MethodsThis study used 4 frozen cadaveric specimens (8 knees), 2 different implant designs, navigation, and a robotic system. The 4 surgeons who participated in this study were trained and familiar with the basic principles and operating procedures of this system. The angle of the bone cuts performed using the robotic system was compared with the target angles from the intraoperative plan. For each bone cut, the resection thickness was recorded and compared with the planned resection thickness.ResultsThe mean angular difference for all specimens was less than 1°, and the standard deviation was less than 2°. The mean difference between the planned and measured angles was close to 0 and not significantly different from 0 except for the difference in the frontal tibial component angle, which was 0.88°. The mean difference in the hip-knee-ankle axis angle was − 0.21°± 1.06°. The mean bone resection difference for all specimens was less than 1 mm, and the standard deviation was less than 0.5 mm.ConclusionsThe results of the cadaveric experimental study showed that the new TKA system can realize highly accurate bone cuts and achieve planned angles and resection thicknesses. Despite the limitations of small sample sizes and large differences between cadaveric and clinical patients, the accuracy of cadaveric experiments provides strong support for subsequent clinical trials."
pub.1168565209,Predictability of implant sizes during cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty using an image-free hand-held robotic system,"The use of appropriately sized implants is critical for achieving optimal gap balance following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Inappropriately sized implants could result in several complications. Robot-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) using CT-based pre-operative planning predicts implant sizes with high accuracy. There is scant literature describing the accuracy of image-free RA-TKA in predicting implant sizes. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of an image-free robotic system in predicting implant sizes during RA-TKA. Patients who underwent cruciate-retaining RA-TKA for primary osteoarthritis, using an image-free hand-held robotic system were studied. The predicted and implanted sizes of the femoral component, tibial component and polyethylene insert, for 165 patients, were recorded. Agreement between robot-predicted and implanted component sizes was assessed in percentages, while reliability was assessed using Cohen’s weighted kappa coefficient. The accuracy of the robotic system was 63% (weighted-kappa = 0.623, P < 0.001), 94% (weighted-kappa = 0.911, P < 0.001) and 99.4% (weighted-kappa = 0.995, P < 0.001), in predicting exact, ± 1 and ± 2 sizes of the femoral component, respectively. For the tibial component, an accuracy of 15.8% (weighted-kappa = 0.207, P < 0.001), 55.8% (weighted-kappa = 0.378, P < 0.001) and 76.4% (weighted-kappa = 0.568, P < 0.001) was noted, for predicting exact, ± 1 and ± 2 sizes respectively. An accuracy of 88.5%, 98.2% and 100%, was noted for predicting exact, ± 1 and ± 2 sizes of the polyethylene insert respectively. Errors in predicting accurate implant sizes could be multi-factorial. Though the accuracy of image-free RA-TKA with respect to alignment and component positioning is established, the surgeon’s expertise should be relied upon while deciding appropriate implant sizes."
pub.1168864395,Comparison of Time Taken in Conventional versus Active Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: Computer- and robotic-assisted total knee replacement procedures have been shown to improve the accuracy of the implant size. It also allows dynamic confirmation of the implant and limb alignment during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The major inhibition of the arthroplasty surgeon in adapting to the robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) is the extra time spent during the registration process and milling of the bone with the robot. The aim of the study was to ascertain the extra time spent during these 2 steps as compared to the conventional TKA (C-TKA).
Methods: It is a prospective study involving 30 patients each in the conventional TKA and RA-TKA operated by the same surgical team. The patients were given a choice between the C-TKA and RA-TKA and consecutive 30 cases in each group were studied by an independent observer. In the C-TKA group, the time for the application of appropriate zigs and execution of the bone cuts and soft-tissue release was recorded whereas in the RA-TKA group, the time taken for fixation of the tibial and femoral arrays and bone registration and bone milling with robot and required soft-tissue release was measured.
Results: The preoperative patient characteristics were the same in both groups. The time taken in the C-TKA and RA-TKA groups was 24.77 ± 1.92 minutes and 25.03 ± 3.27 minutes, respectively, which is statistically insignificant (<i>p</i> = 0.709).
Conclusions: The study findings show that RA-TKA does not take additional time than C-TKA."
pub.1169824222,Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty Surgeon Marketing: Do Claims Align With the Literature?,"Background: Robotic total knee arthroplasty (R-TKA) utilization and marketing continue to rise. We examined the marketing on surgeon websites regarding R-TKA benefits and sought to determine if the claims were supported by existing literature.
Methods: A Google search identified 10 physician websites from each of the 5 largest U.S. markets by population with the term ""robotic total knee arthroplasty city, state."" Claims on websites about R-TKA were categorized. Literature from 2012-2022 was reviewed for data ""for"" or ""against"" each claim. Level of evidence for each publication was collected.
Results: Fifty websites were captured that included 59 surgeons. A specific R-TKA platform was mentioned on 68% of websites. Website claims about robotics were placed into 8 major categories. Literature review supported the claims of more precise/accurate, reduced injury to tissue, and less pain with more literature ""for"" than ""against"" the claims.
Conclusions: Claims made on physician websites regarding the benefits of R-TKA are variable and not definitively supported by existing literature. Most available data can be categorized into levels of evidence III, IV, and V. There is a paucity of level I evidence to support the various marketing statements. Physicians should be cognizant of both the claims made on their websites and the literature that could be used to support or refute those specific claims."

The efficacy of robotic-assisted PFA and the most suitable PFA implant design, however, remain ongoing matters of debate. This study sought to compare clinical outcomes between patients who underwent robotic-assisted versus conventional PFAs with inlay and onlay prosthetic designs.MethodsA single-center retrospective review found 237 knees (211 patients) which underwent PFA between 2011 and 2021. One hundred eighty-four knees were included in the final analysis after cases were excluded for having indications other than osteoarthritis or having less than one year of follow-up. There were 90 conventional PFAs and 94 robotic-assisted PFAs performed. Inlay components were implanted in 89 knees and onlay components were implanted in 95 knees. Propensity score matching was utilized to address demographic differences between groups.ResultsOverall, there was a revision-free survivorship rate of 89.7% with an average time to follow-up of 4.6 years (range 1.2 to 11.1). Twenty-nine knees (15.8%) required various non-conversion procedures. The conventional matched cohort exhibited a higher all-cause revision rate, accounting for revision PFAs and conversions to TKA, (18.8 vs. 6.4%, p = 0.014) and a shorter mean time to revision than the robotic-assisted cohort (3.1 vs. 5.8 years, p = 0.026). A Kaplan–Meier survivorship curve showed differences between the conventional and robotics cohorts (p = 0.041). All revisions following robotic-assisted PFA were caused by progression of osteoarthritis, whereas conventional PFAs also required revision due to aseptic loosening and patellar maltracking. The rate of infection resulting in irrigation and debridement was higher for conventional cases (4.3 vs. 0%, p = 0.041). No significant differences in clinical outcomes between the inlay and onlay prosthetic design matched cohorts were identified.ConclusionPFA is an effective treatment for addressing advanced patellofemoral arthritis. Robotic-assisted surgery may lead to improved clinical outcomes.Level of evidenceIII."
pub.1158569668,Impact of Alignment and Alignment Correction on Outcomes Following Robotic Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively examine the relationship between preoperative and postoperative alignment in robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and postoperative patient-reported outcome measures.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 374 patients who underwent robotic-assisted UKA was conducted. Patient demographics, history, and preoperative and postoperative Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR) scores were obtained via chart review. Average follow-up period was 2.4 years (range: 0.4 to 4.5 years) to chart review and 9.5 months (range: 6 to 48 months) to latest KOOS-JR. Preoperative and postoperative robotically-measured knee alignment was obtained from operative reports. Incidence of conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was determined by review of a health information exchange tool.
RESULTS: Multivariate regressions showed no statistically significant relationship between preoperative alignment, postoperative alignment, or degrees of alignment correction and change in KOOS-JR score or achievement of KOOS-JR minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (P > .05). Patients who had >8 degrees of postoperative varus alignment had on average a 20% lower achievement of KOOS-JR MCID compared to patients who had <8 degrees of postoperative varus alignment; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P > .05). There were 3 patients who required conversion to TKA in the follow-up period, with no significant relationship to alignment variables (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in KOOS-JR change for those patients who had a larger or smaller degree of deformity correction, and correction did not predict MCID achievement."
pub.1151071780,Alignment philosophy influences trochlea recreation in total knee arthroplasty: a comparative study using image-based robotic technology,"PurposeThe ability of kinematic alignment (KA) to consistently restore trochlea anatomy in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is unknown despite recreation of constitutional anatomy being its rationale for use. The purpose of this study was to assess if alignment choice in TKA effects the ability to restore the native trochlea groove.MethodsOne hundred and twenty-two consecutive patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA using the MAKO image-based robotic platform had simulated femoral components placed according to kinematic, mechanical and functional alignment principals. Implant position and trochlea restoration between groups were compared. Restoration was assessed by shift (medial–lateral) and depth relative to the native groove from three consistent points; full extension (0°), mid-flexion (30°–40°) and deep flexion (70°–80°).ResultsThree hundred and sixty-six alignment options were analysed. Femoral alignment was significantly different between groups. Of KA, 13.1% compared to 3.3% of FA plans were outside safe coronal boundaries. The trochlear groove was translated the most by MA compared to KA and FA (full extension, MA 7.84 ± 1.99 mm lateral to the native groove, KA 6.40 ± 2.43 mm and FA 6.88 ± 1.74 mm, p ≤ 0.001). In full extension, FA most closely restored the trochlear groove depth in all three positions of flexion.ConclusionAlignment philosophy led to significant differences in trochlea groove recreation. A kinematically placed femoral component led to positioning considered unsafe in over 13% of cases. A functionally placed femoral component most closely restored trochlea depth in all three positions of flexion."
pub.1175891373,Adverse events related to robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty: a cross-sectional study from the MAUDE database,"BackgroundRobotic-assisted surgical technique has been clinically available for decades, yet real-world adverse events (AEs) and complications associated with primary knee arthroplasty remain unclear.MethodsIn March 2023, we searched the FDA website and extracted AEs related to robotic assisted knee arthroplasty (RAKA) from the MAUDE database over the past 10 years. The “Brand Name” function queried major robotic platforms, including active and semi-active systems. The overall incidence of AEs was estimated based on annual surgical volume from the current American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR). Two authors independently collected data on event date, event type, device problem, and patient problem.ResultsOf 839 eligible reports, device malfunction comprised mechanical failure (343/839, 40.88%) and software failure (261/839, 31.11%). For surgical complications, inappropriate bone resection (115/839, 13.71%) was most frequent, followed by bone/soft tissue damage (83/839, 9.89%). Notably, over-resection exceeding 2 mm (88/839, 10.49%), joint infection (25/839, 2.98%), and aseptic loosening (1/839, 0.12%) were major complications. Only two track pins related AEs were found. Moreover, the distribution of these AEs differed substantially between robot manufacturers. According to the AEs volume and AJRR data, the overall incidences of AEs related to RAKAs were calculated with 0.83% (839/100,892) between November 2010 and March 2023.ConclusionOur analysis shows that while reported AEs might be increasing for RAKAs, the overall rate remains relatively low. Reassuringly, device malfunction was the most commonly AEs observed, with a minor impact on postoperative outcomes. Furthermore, our data provide a benchmark for patients, surgeons, and manufacturers to evaluate RAKA performance, though continued improvement in reducing serious AEs incidence is warranted."
pub.1158258229,Coronal alignment in total knee arthroplasty: a review,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) alignment has recently become a hot topic in the orthopedics arthroplasty literature. Coronal plane alignment especially has gained increasing attention since it is considered a cornerstone for improved clinical outcomes. Various alignment techniques have been described, but none proved to be optimal and there is a lack of general consensus on which alignment provides best results. The aim of this narrative review is to describe the different types of coronal alignments in TKA, correctly defining the main principles and terms."
pub.1147652403,Improved joint awareness two years after total knee arthroplasty with a handheld image-free robotic system.,"Literature into the short-term follow-up of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a handheld image- free robotic system are scarce. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between patients operated for TKA with an image- free robotic system (robot group) or conventionally TKA (conventional group) 2 years postoperatively. A total of 147 patients were evaluated after TKA, respectively 73 in the robot and 74 in conventional group. Outcome measures included adverse events (AEs), hospital readmission rate, patient satisfaction and the following PROMs: Pain Visual Analogue Score (VAS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Forgotten Joint Score Knee (FJS-12) and the EuroQOL-5D (EQ-5D). There were no statistically significant differences in the number of AEs; 8 (10.8%) in the conventional group versus 7 (9.7%) in the robot group. The FJS (p ≤ 0.05) and OKS (p ≤ 0.05) differed statistically in favour of the robot group. The EQ-5D and EQ-5D VAS did not statistically differed between the groups (p=0.231 and p=0.373 respectively). The VAS pain improved statically significant in both groups when comparing the pre- and postoperative values (5.8 points). Patients operated with a handheld image-free robotic system have the ability to forget their artificial knee joint in everyday life as measured with the FJS-12 at short-term follow-up."
pub.1127351433,Robots in the Operating Room During Hip and Knee Arthroplasty,"Purpose of the ReviewThe utilization of technology has increased over the last decade across all surgical specialties. Robotic-assisted surgery, among the most advanced surgical technology, applied to hip and knee arthroplasty has experienced rapid growth in utilization, surgical applications, and robotic platforms. The goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of the most commonly utilized robotic platforms for hip and knee arthroplasty and the most up to date literature on the benefits and limitations of robotic arthroplasty.Recent FindingsStudies consistently demonstrate that that robotic-assisted surgery during total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) improves component position and alignment. There is also growing evidence that robotic-assisted UKA improves clinical outcomes and implant survivorship and, therefore, may be cost-effective. However, there remains to be convincing evidence that robotic-assisted arthroplasty improves clinical outcome measures or reduces revision rates for THA and TKA. Potential disadvantages of robotic arthroplasty remain, including a learning curve, potential for additional radiation exposure preoperatively, and the financial costs.SummaryRobotic hip and knee arthroplasty remains attactive as studies show that it consistently improves implant position and alignment over conventional techniques. There is growing evidence that robotic UKA may improve patient outcomes and reduce revision rates, but further study is needed. In addition, further and longer-term studies are needed to determine if improved component position and alignment in TKA and THA leads to improved clinical outcomes and reduced revision rates."
pub.1174500126,Adverse events associated with robotic-assistance in total hip arthroplasty: an analysis based on the FDA MAUDE database,"BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for reporting adverse events associated with medical devices, including emerging technologies, such as robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA). Aim of this study was to evaluate the variation of adverse events associated with robotics in THA.
METHODS: Medical device reports (MDRs) within the MAUDE database were identified between 2017 and 2021. For MDR identification the product class ""orthopaedic stereotaxic equipment"" and terms associated with THA were used. Individual adverse events were identified and organised by type and consequences, such as patient injury, surgical delay, or conversion to the manual technique.
RESULTS: 521 MDRs constituting 546 discrete events were found. The most common reported complication was intraoperative hardware failure (304/546, 55.7%), among which the most common failure was a broken impaction handle/platform (110, 20.1%). Inaccurate cup placement was the second most common reported complication (63, 11.5%). Abandoning the robot occurred in 13.0% (71/521) of reports. A surgical delay was noted in 28% (146/521) of reports, with an average delay of 17.9 (range 1-60) minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying complications that may occur with robotics in THA is an important first step in preventing adverse events and surgical delays. Database analysis provide an overview of the range of complications."
pub.1147391571,"Comparison of Surgical Time, Short-term Adverse Events, and Implant Placement Accuracy Between Manual, Robotic-assisted, and Computer-navigated Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Network Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","INTRODUCTION: Recent years have observed the increasing utilization of robotic-assisted and computer navigation techniques in total hip arthroplasty (THA), given the proposed benefits of enhanced consistency and precision in implant placement. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine whether differences in surgical times, adverse events, and implant positioning existed between manual, robotic-assisted, and computer navigation THA.
METHODS: PubMed, OVID/MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were queried for RCTs comparing robotic-assisted versus manual THA and computer navigation versus manual THA at a minimum 1-year follow-up. Frequentist model network meta-analyses with P-scores were conducted to compare revisions, complications, and surgical times among the three treatment groups. A random-effects meta-analysis between computer navigation and manual THAs was conducted to analyze cup positioning because no robotic-assisted THA studies reported this outcome.
RESULTS: Five RCTs compared robotic-assisted and manual THAs, while seven compared computer navigation and manual THAs. manual THA was associated with significantly reduced surgical time in comparison with computer navigation (mean difference: 23.3 minutes) and robotic-assisted THAs (mean difference: 8.6 minutes; P < 0.001). No difference was observed in the incidence of all-cause complications (computer navigation: 1.7%, manual: 6.6%, and robotic-assisted: 16.2%) or revisions (computer navigation: 1.0%, manual: 1.7%, and robotic-assisted 4.8%) among the three treatment groups based on the network meta-analysis. In three studies that reported acetabular implant positioning, computer navigation had a significantly higher percentage of acetabular cups placed in the Lewinnek ""safe zone"" compared with manual THA (79% versus 52%; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: manual THA results in markedly shorter surgical times and a similar incidence of complications and revisions compared with robotic-assisted and computer navigation THAs, given the sample sizes available for study. However, computer navigation THA led to increased precision in the placement of acetabular implants."
pub.1154829613,Robotic-assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty restores estimated pre-arthritic coronal limb alignment: A retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) aims to restore pre-arthritic (constitutional) limb alignment, by re-tensioning of the medial collateral ligament (MCL). This study aimed to determine whether pre-arthritic coronal alignment was restored following robotic-assisted medial UKA in patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis.
METHOD: A retrospective study was undertaken, including 102 patients with a unilateral robotic-assisted medial UKA and a contralateral unaffected knee. Both the validated arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA) and alignment of the contralateral unaffected knee were used to estimate pre-arthritic alignment. The aHKA is a radiographic method to estimate the pre-arthritic mechanical hip-knee-ankle angle (mHKA). To verify restoration of pre-arthritic alignment, postoperative mHKA was compared to the aHKA. Additionally, postoperative mHKA, joint line congruence (JLCA), and knee joint line obliquity (KJLO) angles were compared between the operative and contralateral unaffected knee. Equivalence between postoperative and pre-arthritic alignment was assessed through the two-one-sided t-test (TOST), using equivalence margins of ±2.0°.
RESULTS: Postoperative mHKA was equivalent to the aHKA (mean difference -0.38°, 90% CI -0.69 to -0.07;p < .001), with 93 knees (91%) restored within 3.0° of their aHKA. Postoperative mHKA, JLCA and KJLO were equivalent between the operative and contralateral unaffected knees, with mean differences of -0.65°, -0.65°, and -0.40°, respectively; all p < .001.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative and pre-arthritic coronal alignment were equivalent following robotic-assisted medial UKA, with 91% of knees restored within 3.0° of their pre-arthritic mechanical axis. These results demonstrate that both mechanical alignment and joint line congruence are restored by MCL re-tensioning in patients undergoing robotic-assisted medial UKA for medial compartment osteoarthritis."
pub.1133119237,Evolution of 3-Dimensional Functional Planning for Total Hip Arthroplasty with a Robotic Platform.,"Robotic-assisted surgery was introduced to make various mechanical aspects of a total hip arthroplasty more reproducible. When paired with sophisticated three-dimensional preoperative planning, robotic surgery offers the promise that a surgeon might select and reliably achieve targets for component position to optimize hip center-of-rotation, acetabular anteversion and inclination, femoral offset, as well as limb length. This paper describes a patient-specific step-by-step approach to performing these procedures including taking into account pelvic tilt. It is hoped that these described techniques will further optimize robotic-assisted hip arthroplasty procedures."
pub.1160815642,Robotic-Arm Assisted Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: Case Series with Minimum Five-Year Follow-Up.,"INTRODUCTION: Lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty has been shown to be a successful treatment modality for isolated lateral osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The reproduction of proper knee kinematics, limb alignment, as well as proper soft tissue balancing and component positioning have been shown to be of the utmost importance for a successful unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Robotic assistance has shown to be a reliable tool in order to replicate these factors, as compared to manual instrumentation alone. Recent studies have shown the potential of robotic-assisted surgery in controlling these surgical factors for medial UKA; however, studies assessing outcomes of robotic-assisted lateral UKA (RAUKA) are lacking. Therefore, a retrospective single-center study was performed to assess outcomes of lateral RAUKA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent lateral RAUKA from a single surgeon at a central institution between January 2008 and June 2017 were identified. All patients received a lateral UKA with a fixed-bearing metal backed onlay tibial component. Patients over the age of 18, with at least a five-year follow-up and a lateral UKA were contacted by phone and asked a series of questions to determine satisfaction and survivorship. Each patient was asked in a ""yes"" or ""no"" manner, if they have had their implant revised or reoperated for any reason, and a 5-point Likert scale was used to assess satisfaction.
RESULTS: Data was collected from 50 patients (53 knees). Of the patients that responded: 32 (60%) were right knees; 32 (60%) were female, and average follow-up was 7.6 years (5-14 years). Of the 53 knees, one had a revision (98% survivorship). Excluding the revision, 51 (98%) of the included cases were either ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with their surgery.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-arm assisted lateral UKA was found to have high survivorship and a satisfaction rate in patients that had at least a five-year follow-up. In the future, larger prospective comparison studies with longer follow-ups are necessary to adequately compare survivorship and satisfaction rates of robotic-assisted lateral UKA to conventional UKA."
pub.1165963923,"Fluoroscopy-based robotic assistance for total hip arthroplasty improves acetabular cup placement accuracy for obese patients compared to the manual, fluoroscopic- assisted technique","BACKGROUND: Patient obesity is a risk factor for poor acetabular cup positioning in total hip arthroplasty (THA).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of using a novel, fluoroscopy-based robotic THA system on acetabular cup placement in obese versus non-obese patients.
METHODS: A review of 105 consecutive manual unassisted (mTHA) (47 Obese/58 Non-obese) and 102 robotic-assisted (RA-THA) (50 Obese/52 Non-obese) primary, direct anterior approach THA procedures was conducted. All cases were performed by a single surgeon, for a pre-operative diagnosis of osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Obesity was defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) ⩾ 30 kg/m2. Outcomes included acetabular cup inclination and anteversion, and the proportion of cups within the Lewinnek safe-zone.
RESULTS: Obese patients in the mTHA cohort had larger cup inclination angles on average compared to non-obese patients (44.82∘± 6.51 vs. 41.39∘± 6.75; p= 0.009). Obese mTHA patients were less likely to have cup placement within the Lewinnek zone compared to non-obese mTHA patients (0.48 vs. 0.67; p= 0.027). Obesity had no effect on the accuracy of RA-THA.
CONCLUSION: Obesity affects the placement of the acetabular component in manual THA. The novel, fluoroscopy-based robotic THA system in this study demonstrated accurate cup placement regardless of obesity status."
pub.1079288641,Robotic-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty: An Overview.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty are reliable treatment options for osteoarthritis. In order to improve survivorship rates, variables that are intraoperatively controlled by the orthopedic surgeon are being evaluated. These variables include lower leg alignment, soft tissue balance, joint line maintenance, and tibial and femoral component alignment, size, and fixation methods. Since tighter control of these factors is associated with improved outcomes of knee arthroplasty, several computer-assisted surgery systems have been developed. These systems differ in the number and type of variables they control. Robotic-assisted systems control these aforementioned variables and, in addition, aim to improve the surgical precision of the procedure. Robotic-assisted systems are active, semi-active, or passive, depending on how independently the systems perform maneuvers. Reviewing the robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty systems, it becomes clear that these systems can accurately and reliably control the aforementioned variables. Moreover, these systems are more accurate and reliable in controlling these variables when compared to the current gold standard of conventional manual surgery. At present, few studies have assessed the survivorship and functional outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery, and no sufficiently powered studies were identified that compared survivorship or functional outcomes between robotic-assisted and conventional knee arthroplasty. Although preliminary outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery look promising, more studies are necessary to assess if the increased accuracy and reliability in controlling the surgical variables leads to better outcomes of robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty.

pub.1171592955,Robotic‐arm‐assisted lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty leads to high implant survival and patient satisfaction at mean 10‐year follow‐up,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of literature reporting on long-term outcomes following robotic-arm-assisted lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). This study assessed the long-term survivorship, patient-reported satisfaction and pain scores following robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA for lateral compartment osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: A single surgeon's database was reviewed to identify all patients who underwent robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA with a cemented, fixed-bearing prosthesis prior to May 2015. Patients were contacted to determine implant survivorship, satisfaction and pain. Kaplan-Meier models were applied to analyse survival.
RESULTS: A total of 77 knees (70 patients) with a mean follow-up of 10.2 ± 1.5 years (range: 8.1-13.3) were included. Five knees were revised, corresponding to a 10-year survivorship of 96.1% and estimated survival time of 12.7 ± 0.3 years (95% confidence interval: 12.2-13.2) with all-cause revision as the endpoint. Unexplained pain (40.0%) and progression of OA (40.0%) in contralateral compartments were the most reported reasons for revision. Among patients without revision, 94.4% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their lateral UKA and the average pain score was 1.1.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA led to high implant survivorship and patient satisfaction, and low pain scores at long-term follow-up. Progression of OA in contralateral compartments and unexplained pain were the most frequent reasons for revision. These findings support the continued use of robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA for lateral compartment OA; however, its clinical value over conventional techniques remains to be established in prospective comparative studies.

pub.1170398522,Small deviations between planned and performed bone cuts using a CT‐based robotic‐arm‐assisted total knee arthroplasty system,"PURPOSE: Computed tomography (CT)-based robotic system for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has shown improved accuracy compared to conventional. This study was designed to (1) confirm the accuracy of the robotic system in achieving the plan and (2) establish the alignment and positioning deviation between final components and planning, by measuring the discrepancy between final implant alignment and the corresponding planned cut.
METHODS: Ninety-six cementless robotic-arm assisted (RA) TKAs were assessed. Bone resections were performed using the haptically controlled robotic arm. Alignment in the coronal and sagittal plane and resection depth of the distal femoral and proximal tibial cuts were recorded with a navigation planar probe. After final components were impacted, the probe was positioned on each implant surface to determine its alignment and positioning.
RESULTS: The mean tibial resections and implanted tibial component's positioning were 0.4 mm (standard deviation, SD: 0.6) and 0.9 mm (SD: 0.8), respectively, higher than planned (p < 0.01). The tibial sagittal cut had 19/96 cases (19.8%) of ±1° outliers from plan. In 40/96 cases (41.7%), the tibial component was more prominent than planned of more than 1 mm. The mean femoral resections and impacted femoral component's positioning was 0.1 mm (SD: 0.8) and 0.2 mm (SD: 0.7), respectively, higher than planned. In 23/96 cases (24.0%), the femoral sagittal cut and femoral component coronal alignment deviated more than ±1° from plan.
CONCLUSIONS: The computed tomography-based robotic-assisted TKA system showed good accuracy regarding bone preparation and component's positioning relative to the planning. Cementless tibial component impaction resulted in the most deviation from plan, with a large proportion of cases resulting in being more prominent than planned.

pub.1168945375,Improved radiographic outcomes and decreased complications rate on the femoral side can be achieved by a novel designed whole-process robotic assisted hip system for total hip arthroplasty: a prospective randomized controlled trial,"Postoperative complications due to inaccurate prosthesis positioning are the main causes of early revision. The aim of this study was to (1) determine whether novel designed whole-process robotic assisted hip system allowed better radiographic outcomes and lower complications risk on the femoral side particularly stem subsidence compared to conventional THA, and to (2) identify the comparison of early clinical outcomes. 72 patients were initially enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups. Finally, only 65 patients (31 RA-THAs, 34 C-THAs) were analyzed who had full 18-month follow-up data. Radiographic follow-up was performed at immediate and 6-month postoperatively, while clinical follow-up at 18-month postoperatively. Stem-related radiographic outcomes, femoral side complications and clinical scores were compared. The robotic arm allowed better radiographic outcomes of the femoral side, including a higher canal fill ratio (CFR) at B1 (P = 0.040), more neutral stem alignment (P = 0.029), lower subsidence (P = 0.023) and lower leg length discrepancy (LLD) (P = 0.010). In addition, low CFR at B1 (P = 0.001) was found the risk factor for subsidence. However, early clinical outcomes were consistent between both groups. The novel designed whole-process robotic assisted hip system covers both femoral and acetabular side operations. It allows accurate and safe manipulation of femoral side, including better stem-related radiographic outcomes and lower risk of subsidence and LLD. However, no advantage of robotic system in early clinical score was identified. Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR2100044124."
pub.1168988356,Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty in Obese Patients,"Background: Robotic-assisted systems have gained popularity in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate operative characteristics and radiographic outcomes of obese patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA.
Methods: A retrospective review of consecutive cases performed by a single surgeon was performed from January 1, 2016, to January 31, 2022. Adult patients with body mass index ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who underwent primary TKA using a computed tomography-assisted robotic system were compared to patients who underwent primary TKA using conventional instrumentation. Demographics, preoperative and postoperative radiographic measurements, and intraoperative outcomes were compared between cohorts. In total, 119 patients were identified, 60 in the robotic-assisted cohort and 59 in the conventional instrumentation cohort.
Results: Age, body mass index, and estimated blood loss were not significantly different between the cohorts. The robotic-assisted cohort experienced longer tourniquet times (93.3 vs 75.5 minutes, <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Preoperative hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) was similar between the robotic-assisted and conventional cohorts (8.4° ± 4.9° vs 9.3° ± 5.3°, <i>P</i> = .335). Postoperative HKA was 2.0° ± 1.4° in the robotic-assisted group and 3.1° ± 3.23° in the conventional group (<i>P</i> = .040). The proportion of patients with postoperative HKA &gt; 3° of varus or valgus was 9 of 60 (15.0%) in the robotic-assisted cohort compared to 18 of 59 (30.5%) using conventional instrumentation (<i>P</i> = .043).
Conclusions: Obese patients treated with robotic-assisted TKA had postoperative alignment closer to neutral and fewer postoperative radiographic outliers than patients treated with conventional instrumentation. The results of this study support use of robotic-assisted technologies in TKA, particularly in obese patients."
pub.1158226648,Improved accuracy of a novel fluoroscopy-based robotically assisted THA system compared to manual THA,"Accurate acetabular cup position remains a persistent challenge in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Studies investigating the early outcomes of robotic-assisted THA (RA-THA) systems have shown improved cup placement compared to manual THA (mTHA) approaches, however, contemporary robotic platforms are reliant on pre-operative CT imaging. The goal of this study was to analyze the accuracy of a novel, fluoroscopy-based RA-THA system compared to an unassisted mTHA approach and determine the effect of the robotic system on operative time. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis on a consecutive series of 198 patients who received mTHA and RA-THA between March 2021 and July 2022. The primary outcome of interest was the accuracy of acetabular component placement, defined by average cup inclination and anteversion. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of acetabular cups positioned within the Lewinnek safe zone, operative time, and overall room time. The RA-THA group demonstrated significantly higher accuracy of acetabular anteversion to target compared to the manual group (18.5 vs. 21.7˚; p < 0.001), and had a significantly greater proportion of acetabular cups placed within the Lewinnek safe zone (81.6 vs. 59.0%; p < 0.001). The RA-THA cohort had longer operative times compared to mTHA group (39.0 vs. 35.3 min; p = 0.003), but no difference was seen in total operating room time (101.2 vs. 101.2 min; p = 0.982). This study demonstrates that the use of a novel, fluoroscopy-based, pin-less THA robotic platform increased the accuracy of acetabular cup placement, including a 22.6% improvement in safe zone placement, compared to mTHA approach, with no increase in overall case time."

Outcomes included one-year post-operative Veterans RAND-12 (VR-12) Physical (PCS)/Mental (MCS), Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome (HOOS) Pain/Physical Function (PS)/Joint replacement, and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Activity scores.
RESULTS: The FL-RTHA cohort had lower pre-operative VR-12 PCS, HOOS Pain, HOOS-PS, HOOS-JR, and UCLA Activity scores compared with patients in the CT-RTHA cohort. The FL-RTHA cohort reported greater improvements in HOOS-PS scores (-41.54 vs. -36.55; p = 0.028) than the CT-RTHA cohort. Both cohorts experienced similar rates of major post-operative complications, and had similar radiographic outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the fluoroscopy-based robotic system resulted in greater improvements in HOOS-PS in one-year relative to the CT-based robotic technique."
pub.1156943670,Patellofemoral Arthroplasty Is an Efficient Strategy for Isolated Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis with or without Robotic-Assisted System,"There is relative paucity in the literature concerning outcomes after robotic-assisted Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA). The aims were (1) to evaluate outcomes in patients undergoing PFA with inlay or onlay components, with or without robotic arm assistance and (2) to identify risk factors of poor outcomes after PFA. This retrospective study included 77 PFA for isolated patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis, assigned to three groups (18 conventional technique, 17 image-free robotic-assisted system and 42 image-based robotic-assisted system). The demographic data were comparable between the three groups. The clinical outcomes assessed were: Visual Analogue Scale, Knee Society Score, Kujala score and satisfaction rate. The radiological measures were: Caton Deschamps index, patellar tilt and frontal alignment of the trochlea. Functional outcomes, satisfaction rate and residual pain were comparable between the three groups. Patellar tilt improvement was superior when a robotic device was used (either image-based or image-free) compared to the conventional technique. There were three revisions (3.9%) at the last follow-up related to femorotibial osteoarthritis progression. Multivariate analysis found no significant risk factors for poor outcomes, with respect to the surgical technique or implant design. Functional outcomes and revisions rate after PFA were comparable between the surgical techniques and implants. Robotic-assisted systems were associated with a superior improvement of the patellar tilt compared to the conventional technique."
pub.1157807668,Comparison of Femoral Component Rotation between Robotic-Assisted vs. Soft-Tissue Tensor Total Knee Arthroplasty with Anatomic Implants,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the most effective treatment method for end-stage osteoarthritis. One of the most important aspects of this surgery is adequate implant positioning, as it guarantees the desired outcome of restoring limb biomechanics. Surgical technique is being continuously improved along with hardware development. There are two novel devices designed to help establish proper femoral component rotation: soft-tissue tensor and robotic-assisted TKA (RATKA). This study compared the femoral component rotation achieved with the use of three methods: RATKA, soft tissue tensioner and the conventional measured-resection technique, all of them utilizing anatomical design prosthesis components. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A total of 139 patients diagnosed with end-stage osteoarthritis underwent total knee arthroplasty between December 2020 and June 2021. After the surgery, they were divided into three groups depending on procedure technique and implant type: Persona (Zimmer Biomet) + Fuzion Balancer, RATKA + Journey II BCS or conventional TKA + Persona/Journey. Postoperatively, a computed tomography examination was performed in order to measure femoral component rotation. All three groups were compared independently during statistical analysis. Fisher's exact, Kruskal-Wallis and Dwass-Steel-Crichtlow-Fligner tests were used for particular calculations. <i>Results</i>: Statistically significant differences in femoral component rotation between groups were noticed. However, in terms of values other than 0° in external rotation, no significant variance was revealed. <i>Conclusions</i>: Additional total knee arthroplasty instruments seem to improve the outcomes of the surgery, providing better component positioning than in the conventional measured-resection technique based only on bone landmarks."

pub.1139793698,Blood loss and transfusion risk in robotic‐assisted knee arthroplasty: A retrospective analysis,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare total blood loss and the risk of receiving a blood transfusion in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) against conventional jig-based techniques.
METHODS: Robotic TKA (n = 50) and UKA (n = 50) patients were matched to contemporary controls for TKA (n = 50) and UKA (n = 50) and retrospectively analysed.
RESULTS: Robotic TKA patients experienced 23.7% less blood loss compared to conventional TKA patients (911.0 ml vs 1193.7 ml, p < 0.01), and were associated with an 83% relative risk reduction of receiving a transfusion (2% of patients vs 12%, p = 0.02). Robotic UKA patients did not demonstrate less blood loss compared to corresponding controls (821.7 ml vs 854.7 ml, p = 0.69). Both UKA groups received no transfusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic surgical systems in TKA reduces blood loss and lowers the risk of requiring a blood transfusion. In UKA, robotic-assisted arthroplasty did not reduce blood loss compared to conventional arthroplasty."
pub.1145337909,Comparison of Postoperative Instability and Acetabular Cup Positioning in Robotic-Assisted Versus Traditional Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (R-THA) affords precision yet uncertain clinical benefits. This study compares dislocation rates and related revisions between R-THA and manual total hip arthroplasty (M-THA). Secondarily we evaluated cup position, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and postoperative complications.
METHODS: A three-surgeon cohort study was conducted on 2247 consecutive patients (1724 M-THA and 523 R-THA) who received a primary THA between January 2014 and June 2020 at a single hospital. Demographics, PROMs, emergency department visits, readmissions, and 90-day complications were collected via the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative. Chart review yielded instability occurrence with an average follow-up of 4 years. Multivariate regression analysis was performed, and a sample of 368 radiographs, including all dislocations, were assessed.
RESULTS: There were significantly lower rates of dislocation in R-THA (0.6%) vs M-THA (2.5%; Multivariate odds ratio 3.74, P < .046). All cases of unstable R-THA were successfully treated conservatively, whereas 46% of unstable M-THA were revised for recurrent instability. Cup anteversion (25.6° ± 5.4° R-THA vs 20.6° ± 7.6° M-THA) was greater, and cup inclination (42.5° ± 5.3° R-THA vs 47.0° ± 6.7° M-THA) was lower in the R-THA group (P < .05). No significant differences were noted for demographics, PROMs, or other complications (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: R-THA resulted in less than one-fourth the dislocation rate compared to M-THA and no revision for instability. It was associated with no difference in PROMs or other early complications. The influence of R-THA on stability goes beyond simply cup positioning and deserves further study."
pub.1165221240,MakoTM robotic-arm-assisted total hip and total knee arthroplasty outcomes in an orthopedic oncology setting: A case series,"Background: The MAKO Robotic-Arm system is a cutting-edge technology which combines both computed tomography (CT) scanning and three-dimensional planning to determine the ideal size and orientation of implants prior to bone resection. It is typically utilized within a general orthopedic setting for joint replacement procedures, such as total joint arthroplasties. However, its use within orthopedic oncology, which contains a much more compromised patient population and more complex surgical treatment, is not well documented within the literature.
Question/purposes: To determine the patient outcomes of those who underwent a total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at Morristown Medical Center using the MAKO Robotic-Arm System. Particularly, we aspired to delve into the use of the MAKO in an orthopedic oncology setting for patients with a degenerative hip or knee and a history of cancer or other orthopedic tumor, impending pathological fracture, PVNS, chondromatosis, radiation therapy, or other oncological related conditions.
Patients and methods: Our institution monitored twenty-five individuals with unique orthopedic oncology conditions that underwent MAKO robotic-assisted total hip and knee arthroplasty. This was performed between 2020 and 2022 at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. During this time period, 52% (13/25) of the operations were performed on knees and 48% (12/25) were performed on hips. Data regarding patient demographics, body mass index (BMI), medications, hemoglobin, hematocrit, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class, operative data, the length of stay (LOS), readmission rates due to infection or periprosthetic fractures, and complications were collected retrospectively. All confidence intervals were calculated at the 95% confidence level.
Results: Postoperatively, the average LOS was 3.2 days, and there were no complications after any of the MAKO-assisted joint arthroplasty procedures. Additionally, there were no readmissions at any of our recorded intervals - 1-30, 1-60, 1-90, and 1 year - however one patient presented to the emergency department after falling 4 days post-operatively. X-ray imaging ultimately revealed no periprosthetic fracture or malalignment of the prosthesis.
Conclusions: The utilization of the MAKO Robotic-Arm System for joint arthroplasty procedures (THAs and TKAs) on orthopedic oncology patients yielded exceptional outcomes, with no complications or readmissions directly attributed to the use of this innovative robotic technology. Thus, this newly emerging surgical system holds great promise, potentially revolutionizing the approach for selected orthopedic oncology patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty compared to the traditional manual techniques. It further demonstrates that its use in an orthopedic oncology setting - where the cohort of patients are often compromised, leading to more intricate surgeries with heightened risks - elicits safety and"
pub.1157979738,Transition to Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty With Kinematic Alignment is Associated With a Short Learning Curve and Similar Acute-Period Functional Recoveries,"Background Robotic instruments are increasingly being used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The adoption of robotics has allowed surgeons a new level of precision and facilitated the adoption of a kinematic approach in TKA. We sought to examine one surgeon's transition from a traditional mechanical alignment technique to a modified kinematic approach by comparing short-term recovery outcomes of robotic TKA patients with those who underwent traditionally instrumented TKAs. Methodology We examined six-week and six-month postoperative data from 99 traditionally instrumented, mechanically aligned and 66 kinematically aligned robotic TKA patients between January 2021-October 2021 and October 2021-April 2022, respectively. Robotic surgery was performed with VELYS™ (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, IN, USA) a semi-active, imageless, table-affixed, robotic TKA solution. Results Robotic and traditionally instrumented TKAs did not differ significantly in any functional outcome measures examined, including pain scores, use of assistive devices, or range of motion at six weeks postoperatively. Robotic TKA patients had a better range of motion in knee flexion than traditional TKA patients at six months postoperatively. There were no differences in surgical complications or rates of manipulation under anesthesia within one year postoperatively. Robotic surgery tourniquet times exhibited a steep drop off and equaled traditional methods after only two robotic surgeries were performed. Conclusions Transition to a kinematic, semi-active, robotic TKA demonstrated encouraging results by demonstrating acute-period recovery of function consistent with the current standard of care, as well as a better range of motion at six months postoperatively. The learning curve of this new-to-market device was shorter than previous research on the transition to robotic TKA. Clear advantages of transitioning to robotic instrumentation by any specific functional measure are yet to be elucidated. Further randomized trials are necessary to characterize long-term outcomes."
pub.1176096894,Predictive factors for deep medial collateral ligament release in adjusted mechanical alignment total knee arthroplasty,"BackgroundTotal knee arthroplasty (TKA) demands precision in achieving optimal alignment and soft tissue balance, especially in cases of medial compartment osteoarthritis where the need for medial soft tissue release is critical yet challenging to ascertain.ObjectiveThis study aims to systematically investigate the relationship between preoperative data, initial knee conditions and the necessity for deep collateral ligament (MCL) release in adjusted mechanical alignment total knee arthroplasty.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study involving 61 TKA patients who underwent adjusted mechanical alignment robotic-assisted procedures. Soft tissue release was carried out when clinically indicated. We collected and statistically analyzed patient demographics, initial knee conditions, and surgical details.ResultsAmong the patients, 52% required deep MCL release. Notably, patients without soft tissue release exhibited lower initial hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angles, reduced varus-valgus stress test angles, and a greater range of flexion. We identified a predictive threshold HKA angle of 6.250 degrees, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity for determining the need for deep MCL release.ConclusionThis study underscores the significance of the initial HKA angle and varus-valgus stress tests in predicting deep MCL release during TKA. The established HKA angle threshold simplifies surgical decision-making, reducing the likelihood of unnecessary soft tissue release."
pub.1147577379,Robotic arm-assisted versus manual unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"AIMS: This systematic review aims to compare the precision of component positioning, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), complications, survivorship, cost-effectiveness, and learning curves of MAKO robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RAUKA) with manual medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (mUKA).
METHODS: Searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar were performed in November 2021 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta--Analysis statement. Search terms included ""robotic"", ""unicompartmental"", ""knee"", and ""arthroplasty"". Published clinical research articles reporting the learning curves and cost-effectiveness of MAKO RAUKA, and those comparing the component precision, functional outcomes, survivorship, or complications with mUKA, were included for analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 179 articles were identified from initial screening, of which 14 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. The papers analyzed include one on learning curve, five on implant positioning, six on functional outcomes, five on complications, six on survivorship, and three on cost. The learning curve was six cases for operating time and zero for precision. There was consistent evidence of more precise implant positioning with MAKO RAUKA. Meta-analysis demonstrated lower overall complication rates associated with MAKO RAUKA (OR 2.18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 4.49); p = 0.040) but no difference in re-intervention, infection, Knee Society Score (KSS; mean difference 1.64 (95% CI -3.00 to 6.27); p = 0.490), or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score (mean difference -0.58 (95% CI -3.55 to 2.38); p = 0.700). MAKO RAUKA was shown to be a cost-effective procedure, but this was directly related to volume.
CONCLUSION: MAKO RAUKA was associated with improved precision of component positioning but was not associated with improved PROMs using the KSS and WOMAC scores. Future longer-term studies should report functional outcomes, potentially using scores with minimal ceiling effects and survival to assess whether the improved precision of MAKO RAUKA results in better outcomes.

pub.1144737449,What’s new in artificially intelligent joint surgery in China? The minutes of the 2021 IEEE ICRA and literature review,"ObjectiveTo outline the main results of the 2021 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2021) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and review the advances in artificially intelligent joint surgery in China.MethodsThe keynote speeches of the 2021 ICRA were summarized in detail, and publications indexed by five core electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, Embase and CNKI) were systematically surveyed (cutoff date: July 30, 2021) in terms of the main topics of the conference. Publications directly related to artificially intelligent joint surgery in China were identified by using the search strategies of (robotic AND arthroplasty OR replacement), (navigation AND arthroplasty OR replacement), (artificial intelligent AND arthroplasty OR replacement), and (mixed reality AND arthroplasty OR replacement) and systemically reviewed.ResultsWhile robot-assisted arthroplasty in China is mainly performed using robots made in other countries (e.g., Mako from Stryker, USA), China’s domestic R&D of robots and clinical studies of robotic joint surgery have made some achievements. Although reports on the safety, effectiveness and clinical efficacy of China’s domestic robot-assisted joint surgery were presented at conferences, they have rarely been published in journals. Existing data indicate that, after the learning curve is overcome, robot-assisted hip and knee replacement surgery can fully achieve the established goals of precision and individualization and can significantly improve the accuracy of prosthesis placement angle and the recovery of the mechanical axis as compared with conventional surgery. The downside is that the low level of intelligentization and individualization means that existing designs are not conducive to personalization during surgery, resulting in low cost-effectiveness.ConclusionThe safety and efficacy of domestic robot-assisted arthroplasty in China are well documented, and its accuracy and short-term clinical efficacy have been reported. However, the long-term clinical efficacy and the cost-effectiveness of large-scale clinical application of this technique warrants further study. The inadequacies of robot-assisted surgery should be remedied through the deep integration of medicine, engineering and the network."

pub.1017050267,Robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty,"Robotics in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has undergone vast improvements. Although some of the systems have fallen out of favor due to safety concerns, there has been recent increased interest for semi-active haptic robotic systems that provide intraoperative tactile feedback to the surgeon. The potential advantages include improvements in radiographic outcomes, reducing the incidence of mechanical axis malalignment of the lower extremity and better tissue balance. Proponents of robotic technology believe that these improvements may lead to superior functional outcomes and implant survivorship. We aim to discuss robotic technology development, outcomes of unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasty and the future outlook. Short-term follow-up studies on robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty suggest that, although some alignment objectives may have been achieved, more studies regarding functional outcomes are needed. Furthermore, studies evaluating the projected cost-benefit analyses of this new technology are needed before widespread adoption. Nevertheless, the short-term results warrant further evaluation. "

pub.1149374999,A 90-Day Episode-of-Care Analysis Including Computed Tomography Scans of Robotic-Arm Assisted versus Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty,"In this observational, retrospective study, we performed economic analyses between robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) and manual total knee arthroplasty (MTKA). Specifically, we compared: (1) index costs including computed tomography (CT) scans; (2) 90-day postoperative health care utilization, (3) 90-day episode-of-care (EOC) costs, and (4) lengths of stay between CT scan-based robotically-assisted versus MTKAs. A large national database, Blue Health Intelligence (BHI), was used for RATKAs and MTKAs performed between April 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019. Based on strict inclusion-exclusion criteria, with propensity score matching, 4,135 RATKAs and 4,135 MTKAs were identified and analyzed. Index costs to the payer for RATKA patients were found to be less than those for MTKA patients ($29,984 vs. $31,280, <i>p</i> &lt;0.0001). Overall, 90-day EOC costs for RATKA patients were found to be less than that for MTKA patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings. This also holds true for the use of skilled nursing facilities, pharmacies, or other services. In conclusion, the results from our study show that RATKA were associated with lower costs than MTKAs, even when including the cost of CT scans. These results are of marked importance given the emphasis to contain and reduce health care costs."
pub.1171590068,Robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty is associated with the use of thinner polyethylene liners compared to navigation‐guided and manual techniques,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of intraoperative technology use on the rate of using polyethylene liners 15 mm or greater during primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: There were 103,295 implants from 16,386 primary unilateral TKAs performed on 14,253 patients at a single institution between 1 January 2018, and 30 June 2022, included in the current study. Robotic assistance and navigation guidance were used in 1274 (8%) and 8345 (51%) procedures, respectively. The remaining 6767 TKAs (41%) were performed manually. Polyethylene liners were manually identified and further subcategorised by implant thickness. Patients who underwent robotic-assisted TKA were younger (p < 0.001) and more likely to be male (p < 0.001) compared to patients who underwent navigation-guided or manual TKAs.
RESULTS: Average polyethylene liner thickness was similar between groups (10.5 ± 1.5 mm for robotic-assisted TKAs, 10.9 ± 1.8 mm for navigation-guided TKAs and 10.8 ± 1.8 mm for manual TKAs). The proportions of polyethylene liners 15 mm or greater used were 4.9%, 3.8% and 1.9% for navigation-guided, manual and robotic-assisted procedures, respectively (p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that navigation-guided (odds ratio [OR]: 2.6, 95% confidence Interval [CI]: [1.75-4.07], p < 0.001) and manual (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: [1.34-3.20], p = 0.001) procedures were associated with an increased use of polyethylene liners 15 mm or greater.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted TKA was associated with a lower proportion of polyethylene liners 15 mm or greater used compared to navigation-guided and manual TKA. These findings suggest that robotic assistance can reduce human error via a more precise cutting system, limit over-resection of the tibia and flexion-extension gap mismatch and ultimately allow for more appropriately sized implants.

pub.1156635282,A biomechanical comparison between robotic and conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in resection accuracy: a meta‐analysis on cadaveric specimens,"PURPOSE: Robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has seen a rapid increase in utilization with recent literature suggesting that implant accuracy and resection are better optimized than in conventional TKA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical properties of robotic-assisted versus conventional TKA in minimizing biplanar femoral and tibial resection error in cadaveric specimens.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching through PubMed, Cochrane library, and Embase to identify studies that analyzed the biomechanical properties of robotic assisted and conventional TKA, according to standard PRISMA guidelines. Evaluated outcomes included femoral coronal resection error (deg), femoral sagittal resection error (deg), tibial coronal resection error (deg), and tibial sagittal resection error (deg).
RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria, including a total of 140 cadaveric specimens (robotic: 70, conventional: 70), for resection accuracy between robotic and conventional TKA. Pooled analysis from seven studies revealed a significant difference in femoral coronal and sagittal resection error in favor of robotic systems compared to conventional systems (p < 0.001 & p < 0.001, respectively). The pooled analysis from seven studies revealed a significant difference in tibial sagittal resection error in favor of robotic systems compared to conventional systems following TKA (p = 0.012). Posthoc power analysis revealed a power of 87.2%.
CONCLUSION: The use of robotic TKA is associated with lower femoral coronal, lower femoral sagittal and tibial sagittal resection error compared to conventional TKA. It should be noted that these findings are purely biomechanical - surgeons should interpret these findings along with clinical differences between conventional and robotic systems to determine which system is best for each patient."
pub.1173064147,Robotic assessment of patella tracking in total knee arthroplasty,"OBJECTIVES: Robotic tools have been developed to improve planning, accuracy and outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to describe and illustrate a novel technique for assessing the patellofemoral (PFJ) in TKA using an imageless robotic platform.
METHODS: A consecutive series of 30 R-TKA was undertaken by a single surgeon utilising the described technique. A technique to dynamically assess the PFJ intra-operatively, pre- and post-implantation was developed. A full set of data from 9 cases was then collected and reviewed for analysis. A series of dynamic PFJ tracks collected intra-operatively pre- and post-implantation are presented. Furthermore, a full assessment of PFJ over and under-stuffing through a 90° arc of flexion is illustrated. Finally, a pre- and post-centre of rotation for the PFJ was defined and measured.
RESULTS: The described technique was defined over a series of 30 R-TKA using the described robotic platform. Nine cases were analysed to determine what data could be measured using the robotic platform. Intra-operative real-time data allowed a visual assessment of PFJ tracking through a range of motion of 0°-90° flexion pre- and post-implantation. PFJ over and under-stuffing was also assessed intra-operatively through a range of motion of 0°-90° flexion. Post-operative analysis allowed a more detailed study to be performed, including defining a pre- and post-implantation centre of rotation (COR) for the patella. Defining the COR allowed the definition of a patella plane. Furthermore, patella mediolateral shift in full extension, and end flexion could be measured.
CONCLUSION: Intra-operative assessment of the PFJ in TKA is challenging. Robotic tools have been developed to improve measurement, accuracy of delivery and outcomes in TKA. These tools can be adapted in novel ways to assess the PFJ, which may lead to further refinements in TKA techniques."
pub.1162938448,Early Tibial Baseplate Fracture After Medial Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty,"CASE: Implant failure after unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a rare but well-described complication in the arthroplasty literature. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding rapid catastrophic failure of modern implant designs. This is a case report of 2 patients with early catastrophic failure of the tibial baseplate after UKA with a Stryker Restoris MultiCompartmental Knee System implant using Mako robotic assistance, both requiring revision to total knee arthroplasty.
CONCLUSION: Improved awareness and understanding of early UKA tibial baseplate failure may help identify both patient and surgical risk factors that could help prevent further instances in the future."
pub.1168885789,Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip,"PurposesDue to the morphological diversity of deformities, technical difficulties, improperly designed components, and so on, THA remains a challenging task in dysplastic hips, especially in highly dislocated hips. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the clinical outcomes of robot-assisted THA in patients with DDH through a large cohort study, including the precision of acetabular cup positioning, indicators of inflammatory response, indicators of muscle damage, and complications.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed patients with DDH who underwent THA in our prospectively constructed joint registry between August 2018 and August 2022. Finally, 147 manual THAs and 147 robotic-assisted THAs were included in the final analysis. Patient demographics, indicators of inflammation, indicators of muscle damage, operative time, Harris hip scores (HHS), and forgotten joint score (FJS) were recorded for analysis. The precision of the positioning of the acetabular component was assessed with plain radiographs.ResultsIn the Crowe II/III groups, the reconstructed center of rotation (COR) in the robotic-assisted group was closer to the anatomical COR with less variation than the manual group (absolute horizontal distances of COR 3.5 ± 2.8 vs. 5.4 ± 4.9 mm, p < 0.05; absolute vertical distances of COR 6.4 ± 4.1 vs. 11.7 ± 8.2 mm, p = 0.001). For all Crowe subtypes, the robotic-assisted THA significantly increased the proportion of acetabular cups located in the safety zone within 5° (all p < 0.05). Interleukin-6 and creatine kinase levels were slightly lower and significantly different in the robotic-assisted group at three days postoperatively (all p < 0.05).ConclusionsCompared to the manual technique, the robot-assisted technique improved the precision and reproducibility of acetabular component positioning, particularly in DDH patients with Crowe types II/III. The robotic-assisted technique did not increase operative time, bleeding, complications, or revision rates, and had a slighter early inflammatory response and muscle damage."
pub.1078871784,Makoplasty and the accuracy and efficacy of robotic-assisted arthroplasty.,"In comparison with standard surgical techniques robotic-assisted surgery has the advantages of increased surgical accuracy, reproducibility, optimization of component position, and improved patient outcomes in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and total hip arthoplasty (THA) procedures. The MAKO Tactile Guidance System (TGS; MAKO Surgical Corp, Fort Lauderdale, FL) facilitates robotic-assisted arthroplasty procedures currently implemented in many operating rooms. The benefits of this technology are evident, but have not been shown to improve patient outcomes and justify the added financial burden imposed. Further research is needed to determine if this technological advancement will translate into improvements in longevity and clinical outcomes. "
pub.1169311352,Imageless robotic total knee arthroplasty determines similar coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) parameters to long leg radiographs,"BackgroundThe coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) classification was first developed using long leg radiographs (LLR) and has since been reported using image-based and imageless robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) systems. However, the correspondence between imageless robotics and LLR-derived CPAK parameters has yet to be investigated. This study therefore examined the differences in CPAK parameters determined with LLR and imageless robotic navigation using either generic or optimized cartilage wear assumptions.MethodsMedial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) were determined from the intraoperative registration data of 61 imageless robotic TKAs using either a generic 2 mm literature-based wear assumption (Navlit) or an optimized wear assumption (Navopt) found using an error minimization algorithm. MPTA and LDFA were also measured from preoperative LLR by two observers and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. MPTA, LDFA, joint line obliquity (JLO), and arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA) were compared between the robotic and the average LLR measurements over the two observers.ResultsICCs between observers for LLR were over 0.95 for MPTA, LDFA, JLO, and aHKA, indicating excellent agreement. Mean CPAK differences were not significant between LLR and Navlit (all differences within 0.6°, P > 0.1) or Navopt (all within 0.1°, P > 0.83). Mean absolute errors (MAE) between LLR and Navlit were: LDFA = 1.4°, MPTA = 2.0°, JLO = 2.1°, and aHKA = 2.7°. Compared to LLR, the generic wear classified 88% and the optimized wear classified 94% of knees within one CPAK group. Bland–Altman comparisons reported good agreement for LLR vs. Navlit and Navopt, with > 95% and > 91.8% of measurements within the limits of agreement across all CPAK parameters, respectively.ConclusionsImageless robotic navigation data can be used to calculate CPAK parameters for arthritic knees undergoing TKA with good agreement to LLR. Generic wear assumptions determined MPTA and LDFA with MAE within 2° and optimizing wear assumptions showed negligible improvement."

Anterior femoral notching (AFN) is one of a perioperative risk factor for PPF. The main purpose of this study was to compare between the rates of anterior femoral notching (AFN) and supracondylar periprosthetic femoral fracture (sPPF) of manual TKA and robotic arm-assisted TKA (RATKA). Meanwhile, blood loss, transfusion rates, inflammatory responses, complications, early clinical and radiological outcomes were also assessed.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 330 patients (133 RATKA and 197 manual TKA). Differences in risks of inflammatory, blood loss, complications (periprosthetic fracture and periprosthetic joint infection), pre-operative and post-operative distal lateral femoral angle (LDFA), distal femoral width (DFW), prosthesis-distal femoral width (PDFW) ratio, AFN, femoral component flexion angle (FCFA), peri-operative and post-operative functional outcomes between the RATKA and manual TKA groups were compared.
RESULTS: The operation time and postoperative CRP level in the RATKA group was significantly longer and higher than that in the manual TKA group (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). However, there was no significant difference in postoperative WBC level (<i>p</i> = .217), hemoglobin loss (<i>p</i> = .362), postoperative drainage (<i>p</i> = .836), and periprosthetic fracture (<i>p</i> = 1.000). There was no significant difference in LDFA (<i>p</i> &gt; .05), DFW(<i>p</i> = .834), PDFW ratio (<i>p</i> = .089) and FCFA (<i>p</i> = .315) between the two groups, but the rate of AFN in the RATKA group was significantly lower than that in the manual TKA group (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). There was no significant difference in ROM between the two groups on POD3, POD 90 and 1 year (<i>p</i> &lt; .05), but the FJS-12 score in the RATKA group was higher than that in the manual TKA group on 1 year (<i>p</i> = .001).
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty can decrease the incidence of anterior femoral notching compared to posterior referenced instrumented total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1169154799,Lower 90-day inpatient readmission and 1-year reoperation in patients undergoing robotic versus manual total hip arthroplasty through an anterior approach,"BACKGROUND: The value of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) has yet to be determined compared to conventional manual THA (mTHA).
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate 90-day inpatient readmission rates, rates of reoperation, and clinically significant improvement of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at 1-year in a cohort of patients who underwent mTHA or rTHA through a direct anterior (DA) approach.
METHODS: A single-surgeon, prospective institutional cohort of 362 patients who underwent primary THA for osteoarthritis via the DA approach between February 2019 and November 2020 were included. Patient demographics, surgical time, discharge disposition, length of stay, acetabular cup size, 90-day inpatient readmission, 1-year reoperation, and 1-year PROMs were collected for 148 manual and 214 robotic THAs, respectively.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing rTHA had lower 90-day readmission (3.74% vs 9.46%, p= 0.04) and lower 1-year reoperation (0.93% vs 4.73% mTHA, p= 0.04). rTHA acetabular cup sizes were smaller (rTHA median 52, interquartile range [IQR] 50; 54, mTHA median 54, IQR 52; 58, p< 0.001). Surgical time was longer for rTHA (114 minutes vs 101 minutes, p< 0.001). At 1-year post-operatively, there was no difference in any of the PROMs evaluated.
CONCLUSION: Robotic THA demonstrated lower 90-day readmissions and 1-year reoperation rates than manual THA via the DA approach. PROMs were not significantly different between the two groups at one year."
pub.1152212438,Short-Term Outcomes Following Cemented Versus Cementless Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Cemented fixation during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has long been the gold standard due to excellent survivorship and clinical outcomes. With recent biomaterial advancements, cementless fixation has gained renewed interest. Most studies demonstrate similar clinical outcomes and survivorship between these two fixation methods, without consensus regarding the optimal method of fixation during TKA. Outcomes following TKA also depend upon the proper alignment and positioning of components. Robotic-assisted TKA has been shown to improve outcomes related to component positioning, overall lower limb alignment, and soft tissue balancing. No study to date has investigated the role of robotic-assisted surgery on postoperative outcomes following cementless versus cemented TKA.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age and older who underwent primary robotic-assisted TKA performed by a single fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeon. Oxford Knee Scores and Short Form Health Survey scores were obtained preoperatively and at a two-year follow-up. Complications such as DVT, infection, arthrofibrosis requiring manipulation, and revision surgery were collected.
RESULTS: Three hundred eighty knees in the cementless cohort and 72 cemented knees were included for analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between the two cohorts in terms of SF-12, Oxford Knee Scores, complications, or revision surgery rates.
CONCLUSION: Cementless fixation during TKA offers an alternative to cemented fixation with similar short-term results in terms of patient-reported outcomes, complication rates, and revision surgery rates. Further research is warranted to better understand long-term outcomes and survivorship following cementless versus cemented fixation during robotic-assisted TKA."

The posterior tibial slope (PTS) is measured radiographically with the intramedullary axis (IMA) to the tibial baseplate on the sagittal plane radiograph. However, in most computer-navigated or robotic mUKAs, the PTS is set from a transmalleolar axis (TMA).The PTS difference was evaluatedbetween the sagittal TMA and the sagittal IMA of patients undergoing a CT-based primary robotic-assisted mUKA.We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans taken according to the MAKO system protocol (Stryker) of 67 patients undergoing mUKAs. We measured the angular difference between the IMA and the TMA in the sagittal plane.Using the TMA to set the PTS the estimation of the slope of the medial tibial plateau would increase by an average of 1.9 ± 3.2 degreescompared to the IMA. Furthermore, in nineknees, PTS was decreased.Tibial components implanted with the help of a CT scan-based preoperative planning MAKO will show an average of 1.9 degrees more than those measured on sagittal radiographs potentially of concern for knee kinematics. A universal language is needed to standardize the slope calculation and the respective reference axis used."
pub.1152754865,Functional alignment with robotic‑arm assisted total knee arthroplasty demonstrated better patient‐reported outcomes than mechanical alignment with manual total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: Given the improved accuracy of robot-assisted surgery, robotic-arm assisted functionally aligned total knee arthroplasty (RFA-TKA) aims to preserve the native pre-arthritic knee biomechanics, to achieve balanced flexion-extension gaps. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of the implant position and short-term clinical outcomes of patients who underwent RFA-TKA vs. mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty with manual technique (MA-TKA).
METHODS: A prospectively collected database was reviewed retrospectively for patients who underwent primary TKA. Sixty patients who underwent RFA-TKA between February 2020 and July 2020 were included in the RFA-TKA group. Sixty patients who underwent MA-TKA were included via 1:1 matching for age, sex, and body mass index based on the RFA-TKA group. For radiological evaluation, knee X-rays were used to assess the functional knee phenotype and implant position accuracy by measuring the coronal and sagittal alignment, and these measurements were compared between the two groups. Patient demographic characteristics and patient-reported outcomes including Knee Society scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index, and forgotten joint score-12 were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in postoperative 2-year clinical outcomes in favor of RFA-TKA group which showed greater accuracy in the tibial component sagittal alignment than MA-TKA (1.0 ± 2.3 vs. 0.7 ± 1.6, respectively; P < 0.001). However, outliers in the component positions were more common in the MA-TKA group, which was statistically significant for the femoral coronal and tibial sagittal alignments (P = 0.017 and 0.015, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Functional alignment in TKA could be accurately obtained with the assistance of a robotic arm, and the results showed greater 2 year postoperative patient-reported outcome and satisfaction than mechanically aligned TKA using manual instruments.

Case Report: A 30-year-old man with a history of bilateral patellar instability treated in youth with multiple surgeries presented with 8+ months of recurrent bilateral knee pain. Evaluation showed bilateral severe patellofemoral arthritis with preserved medial and lateral compartments. Bilateral sequential robotic-assisted PFAs (RA-PFA) were offered as a precise approach to reconstructing patellofemoral biomechanics while minimizing bone resection to avoid compromising potential future TKA. Four months after his latest surgery, he returned to a physically demanding job, and he remains active and pain free at 1 year postoperatively.
Conclusion: RA-PFA can provide less invasive, accurate, and individualized treatment for younger patients with severe disease without compromising future conversion to TKA."

Joint line height and PCO were measured and compared in 182 raTKA and 144 mTKA patients.ResultsThe groups were matched in age (p = 0.847) and sex distribution (p = 0.2). Excellent interobserver agreement (ICC ≥ 0.9). RaTKA mean joint line height difference was − 0.0001 mm (± 3.48, 95% CI − 0.509, 0.509) (p = 0.523), − 0.951 mm for mTKA (± 4.33, 95% CI − 1.664, − 0.237) (p = 0.009). RaTKA mean PCO difference was 0.52 mm (± 2.45, 95% CI 0.160, 0.880) (p = 0.005), 1.15 mm for mTKA (± 4.01, 95% CI – 1.496, 1.818) (p < 0.001). Mean difference in joint line height of 0.95 mm between groups was significant (p = 0.027), and for PCO, it was 0.63 mm, demonstrating tendency towards significance (p = 0.08). Mean absolute value in joint line height difference between groups was not significant (p = 0.235) but highly significant for PCO (p < 0.001).ConclusionThe ROSA knee robotic system can more accurately restore joint line height and PCO compared to conventional manual TKA. The improved degree of precision raTKA offers may be a vehicle for better Patient-Reported Outcome Measures, but further correlational studies are required."
pub.1164226363,No Benefit of Robotic-Assisted over Computer-Assisted Surgery for Achieving Neutral Coronal Alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"The use of robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is becoming increasingly popular due to better precision, potentially superior outcomes and the ability to achieve alternative alignment strategies. The most commonly used alignment strategy with RAS is a modification of mechanical alignment (MA), labeled adjusted MA (aMA). This strategy allows slight joint line obliquity of the tibial component to achieve superior balancing. In the present study, we compared coronal alignment after TKA using RAS with aMA and computer-assisted surgery (CAS) with MA that has been the standard in the center for more than 10 years. We analyzed a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing TKA in a single center. Lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) and medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) were compared for both techniques. In 140 patients, 68 CASs and 72 RASs, we observed no difference in postoperative measurements (median 90 degrees for all, LDFA <i>p</i> = 0.676, MPTA <i>p</i> = 0.947) and no difference in outliers &lt;2 degrees (LDFA <i>p</i> = 0.540, MPTA <i>p</i> = 0.250). The present study demonstrates no benefit in eliminating outliers or achieving neutral alignment of both the femoral and the tibial components in robotic-assisted versus computer-assisted TKA if MA is the target. To utilize the precision of RAS, it is recommended to aim for more personalized alignment strategies. The level of evidence is level III retrospective study."
pub.1099695742,Component Placement Accuracy in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Is Improved with Robotic-Assisted Surgery: Will It Have an Effect on Outcomes?,"Bell et al.’s “Improved Accuracy of Component Positioning with Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: Data from a Prospective, Randomized Controlled Study” compared the accuracy of a robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) using the MAKO Robotic Interactive Orthopedic Arm (RIO) system to a conventional UKA using standardized instrumentation. This review examines the authors’ findings and their relevance to clinical practice. Bell et al. conclude that the MAKO RIO system leads to more accurate implantation of both the tibial and femoral components in UKA in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. This well-designed, level I study suggests what many arthroplasty surgeons assume about robotic assistance, which admittedly is of unknown clinical significance at this time. Evaluating this article in the context of the current literature provides valuable insight into areas in need of future investigation. The effect of implant positioning on long-term clinical outcomes and implant survivorship remains unclear. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the role of robotic-assisted arthroplasty in the future."
pub.1172455533,Intraoperative Navigation in Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty: Advantages and Future Prospects,"Intraoperative navigation is a novel technology that can provide real-time feedback to the surgeon during implantation and enhance the accuracy and precision of glenoid component positioning. Applications of intraoperative navigation systems have demonstrated increased precision in baseplate version and inclination, as well as improved baseplate screw placement, with fewer screws used and greater purchase length achieved when compared to standard instrumentation. Early clinical studies have shown favorable results, with significantly improved patient-reported and clinical outcomes and decreased complications. The implementation of intraoperative navigation is associated with a short learning curve and a minimal increase in operative time. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to substantiate the clinical benefit of navigation and evaluate its economic cost-effectiveness and impact on implant survival. Augmented reality and robotic-assisted surgery are additional emerging technologies that, while novel, hold the potential to further advance the field of shoulder arthroplasty."
pub.1170803405,"The learning curve for robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty in low, medium, and high-volume surgeons","Background: Robotic systems have been designed to increase the accuracy of implant alignment in total knee and hip arthroplasty. This technology is associated with a learning curve for the operative time to reach peak efficiency in its use. Prior studies done on high-volume orthopedic surgeons have suggested a learning curve of 14-35 cases for robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA). It is unclear if this learning curve is different for surgeons with lower volumes.
Methods: Data was collected retrospectively from 299 THA procedures done by three different surgeons, with low (1-15 cases/year), medium (16-50), and high (51+) volume caseload. The learning curve was assessed primarily by average operative time from cases 1-20, 21-50, and 51+.
Results: The high-volume surgeon had a learning curve of 20 cases, while the low and medium volume surgeons had no significant decrease in their operative time through the cases included in the study (20 and 63, respectively).
Conclusions: High volume surgeons have a learning curve of about 20 cases, while low and medium volume surgeons have a longer curve, which was not able to be measured in this study."
pub.1152661468,"Robotic-Arm-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Review of the Workflow, Outcomes and Its Role in Addressing the Challenge of Spinopelvic Imbalance","Robotic-arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RoTHA) offers the opportunity to improve the implant positioning and restoration of native hip mechanics. The concept of individualised, functional implant positioning and how it relates to spinopelvic imbalance is an important yet rather novel consideration in THA. There is mounting evidence that a significant percentage of dislocations occur within the perceived ""safe zones""; hence, in the challenging subset of patients with a stiff spinopelvic construct, it is imperative to employ individualised component positioning based on the patients' phenotype. Restoring the native centre of rotation, preserving offset, achieving the desired combined anteversion and avoiding leg length inequality are all very important surgeon-controlled variables that have been shown to be associated with postoperative outcomes. The latest version of the software has a feature of virtual range of motion (VROM), which preoperatively identifies potential dynamic causes of impingement that can cause instability. This review presents the workflow of RoTHA, especially focusing on pragmatic solutions to tackle the challenge of spinopelvic imbalance. Furthermore, it presents an overview of the existing evidence concerning RoTHA and touches upon future direction."

pub.1173115316,Comparison of the in vivo kinematics between robotic‐assisted Bi‐cruciate retaining and Bi‐cruciate stabilised total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Up to 20% of patients remain unsatisfied after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), prompting the development of new implants. Bi-Cruciate Retaining (BCR) TKA preserves both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), with the ACL beneficial for its proprioceptive qualities. The Bi-Cruciate Stabilised (BCS) TKA substitutes the ACL and PCL with a unique dual cam-post mechanism. Robotics improve accuracy and facilitate technically demanding TKA.
METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study recruited from two centres. Measured outcomes included kinematic analysis, proprioception, and functional outcomes.
RESULTS: There was a significantly larger maximum flexion angle and range of flexion to extension in sit-to-stand and stairs in BCR when compared to BCS. Further analysis revealed more similarities between BCR and normal native knees. Proprioception and functional scores did not have any statistical difference.
CONCLUSION: BCR TKA demonstrated better knee flexion in weight-bearing active range of motion and showed similarities with normal knee kinematics."
pub.1169464382,Can Robotic-Arm Assistance Decrease Iatrogenic Soft-Tissue Damage During Direct Anterior Total Hip Arthroplasty?,"INTRODUCTION: Manual techniques for total hip arthroplasty (THA) have been widely utilized and proven to be clinically successful. However, the use of advanced computed tomography (CT) scan-based planning and haptically-bounded reamers in robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (RTHA) holds promise for potentially limiting surrounding soft-tissue damage. This cadaver-based study aimed to compare the extent of soft-tissue damage between a robotic-arm assisted, haptically-guided THA (RTHA) and a manual, fluoroscopic-guided THA (MTHA) direct anterior approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were six fresh-frozen torso-to-toe cadaver specimens included, with two surgeons each performing three RTHA and three MTHA procedures. One hip underwent an RTHA and the other hip received an MTHA in each cadaver. Postoperatively, one additional surgeon, blinded to the procedures, assessed and graded damage to nine key anatomical structures using a 1 to 4 grading scale: (1) complete soft-tissue preservation to <5% of damage; (2) 6 to 25% of damage; (3) 26 to 75% of damage; and (4) 76 to 100% of damage. Kruskal-Wallis hypothesis tests were used to compare soft-tissue damage between RTHA and MTHA cases and adjusted for ties.
RESULTS: Pooled analysis of the gluteus minimus, sartorius, tensor fascia lata, and vastus lateralis muscle grades demonstrated that cadaver specimens who underwent RTHA underwent less damage to these structures than following MTHA (median, IQR: 1.0, 1.0 to 2.0 vs. 3.0, 2.0 to 3.0; p=0.003). Pooled analysis of the calculated volumetric damage (mm3) for the gluteus minimus, sartorius, tensor fascia lata, and vastus lateralis muscles demonstrated that the cadaver specimens that underwent RTHA underwent less damage to these structures than those that followed MTHA (median, IQR: 23, 2 to 586 vs. 216, 58 to 3,050; p=0.037).
CONCLUSION: This cadaver-based study suggests that utilizing RTHA may lead to reduced soft-tissue damage compared with MTHA, likely due to enhanced preoperative planning with robotic-arm assisted software, real-time intraoperative feedback, haptically-bounded reamer usage, reduced surgical steps, as well as ease of use with reaming. These findings should be carefully considered when evaluating the utilization of robotic-arm assisted THA in practice."

Robotic-arm systems may improve surgical accuracy and could contribute to reduced pain, improved function and lower overall cost of total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. However, TKR with conventional instruments may be just as effective and may be quicker and cheaper. There is a need for a robust evaluation of this technology, including cost-effectiveness analyses using both within-trial and modelling approaches. This trial will compare robotic-assisted against conventional TKR to provide high-quality evidence on whether robotic-assisted knee replacement is beneficial to patients and cost-effective for healthcare systems.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Robotic Arthroplasty Clinical and cost Effectiveness Randomised controlled trial-Knee is a multicentre, participant-assessor blinded, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted TKR compared with TKR using conventional instruments. A total of 332 participants will be randomised (1:1) to provide 90% power for a 12-point difference in the primary outcome measure; the Forgotten Joint Score at 12 months postrandomisation. Allocation concealment will be achieved using computer-based randomisation performed on the day of surgery and methods for blinding will include sham incisions for marker clusters and blinded operation notes. The primary analysis will adhere to the intention-to-treat principle. Results will be reported in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. A parallel study will collect data on the learning effects associated with robotic-arm systems.

However, what is not known is whether the addition of an intra-articular sensor (VerasenseTM) to aid intraoperative balancing of the total knee replacement (TKR) offers improved functional outcomes for the patient. The purpose of this research is to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing a conventional manual knee replacement to those undergoing TKR using robotic-assisted surgery and the VerasenseTM to optimise alignment and balance the knee joint, respectively, and assess the associated cost economics of such technology.Methods and analysisThis randomised controlled trial will include 90 patients with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee undergoing primary TKR. Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria that consent to be in the study will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 to either manual TKR (standard of care) or robotic-arm-assisted TKR with VerasenseTM to aid balancing of the knee. The primary objective will be functional improvement at 6 months following surgery between the two groups. The secondary objectives are to compare changes in knee-specific function, joint awareness, patient expectation and fulfilment, satisfaction, pain, stiffness and functional ability, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and gait patterns between the two groups. Ethical approval was obtained by the Tyne & Wear South Research Ethics Committee, UK. The study is sponsored by the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.DiscussionThis study will assess whether the improved accuracy of component positioning using the robotic-arm-assisted surgery and the VerasenseTM to aid balancing of the TKR offers improved outcome relative to standard manual jig-based systems that are currently the standard of care. This will be assessed primarily according to knee-specific function, but several other measures will also be assessed including whether these are cost-effective interventions.Trial registrationInternational Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN47889316 https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN47889316.

pub.1151892221,"Robotic-assisted TKA reduces surgery duration, length of stay and 90-day complication rate of complex TKA to the level of noncomplex TKA","IntroductionComplex primary total knee arthroplasties (TKA) are reported to be associated with excessive episode of care (EOC) costs as compared to noncomplex procedures. The impact of robotic assistance (rTKA) on economic outcome parameters in greater case complexity has not been described yet. The purpose of this study was to investigate economic outcome parameters in the 90-days postoperative EOC in robotic-assisted complex versus noncomplex procedures.Materials and methodsThis study is a retrospective, single-center review of 341 primary rTKAs performed between 2017 and 2020. Patient collective was stratified into complex (n = 218) and noncomplex TKA (n = 123) based on the presence of the following criteria: Obese BMI, coronal malalignment, flexion contracture > 10°, posttraumatic status, previous correction osteotomy, presence of hardware requiring removal during surgery, severe rheumatoid arthritis. Group comparison included surgery duration, length of stay (LOS), surgical site complications, readmissions, and revision procedures in the 90-days EOC following rTKA.ResultsThe mean surgery duration was marginally longer in complex rTKA, but showed no significant difference (75.26 vs. 72.24 min, p = 0.258), neither did the mean LOS, which was 8 days in both groups (p = 0.605). No differences between complex and noncomplex procedures were observed regarding 90-days complication rates (7.34 vs. 4.07%, p = 0.227), readmission rates (3.67 vs. 3.25%, p = 0.841), and revision rates (2.29 vs. 0.81%, p = 0.318).ConclusionsRobotic-assisted primary TKA reduces the surgical time, inpatient length of stay as well as 90-days complication and readmission rates of complex TKA to the level of noncomplex TKA. Greater case complexity does not seem to have a negative impact on economic outcome parameters when surgery is performed with robotic assistance."
pub.1164580963,Virtual assessment of coronal balance prior to bone resection with the MAKO robotic-assisted system accurately predicts final balance in TKA,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has traditionally relied on the surgeon’s judgement and manual instruments to determine balance. The MAKO robotic system (Stryker Ltd, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) allows assessment of virtual compartmental gaps from CT-derived bone models intra-operatively as a predictor of soft tissue balance that will be achieved, prior to any bony resection. This study aims to assess the accuracy of this pre-resection balancing technique in determining the resultant final soft tissue balance of the TKA. A consecutive prospective cohort of 2027 Robotic-Assisted TKAs (RATKA) were performed between January’17 and March’22. Osteophytes were removed; initial virtual gaps on the virtual bone model were measured at 10° and 90° of flexion prior to bone resections. Optimization of the virtual component positions was then made and final pre-resection gaps were measured. The gaps were then re-assessed post-implantation and compared to the final pre-resection values. Virtual balancing in extension within 1 mm was achieved in 95% of cases. Of those, 98% maintained coronal balance within 1 mm after implantation, with 1.5% requiring a coronal plane soft tissue release. Inability to virtually balance a TKA within 2 mm prior to bone resection resulted in a soft tissue release in 44.4% of cases. The absolute values of the final gaps achieved were a mean of 1.3 mm greater than virtual gaps. The ability to balance a knee on the virtual bone model prior to bone resection, in conjunction with robotic-assisted execution of TKA, consistently achieves a balanced knee after component implantation."

pub.1163194310,Safe Sex After Total Hip Arthroplasty: Using Computed Tomography-Based Robotics to Evaluate “At-Risk” Sexual Positions,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) can improve sexual satisfaction, but fear of dislocation can lead to sexual difficulties following this procedure. Previous kinematic research identified 4 sexual positions in women and 2 in men that were considered at risk for impingement. This study aimed to validate these findings using current robotic THA simulations.
METHODS: The 3-dimensional renderings from 12 patients who received computed tomography (CT)-based robotic THA were used to assess for prosthetic and/or bony impingement among 12 popular sexual positions. There were 9 cup orientations tested for each position (a combination of anteversion [0 °, 15 °, and 30 °] and inclination [40 °, 45 °, and 60 °]). The at-risk positions were tested again using the unique hip positions and cup orientations where previous geometric modeling data found impingement to occur.
RESULTS: Using mean hip positions, impingement occurred in at least 1 patient in 1 of the 12 positions for women (position 5) and 5 of the 12 positions for men (positions 1, 5, 8, 10, and 11). Among the at-risk positions, impingement occurred in none of the 2 at-risk women positions (0 of 17 cup orientations) and in both at-risk men positions (9 of 9 cup orientations for position 8 and 1 of 1 for position 11).
CONCLUSION: Recreating popular and at-risk sexual positions following THA with a CT-based robotics system yielded results that were inconsistent with previous geometric modeling data. Resolving these discrepancies is crucial for surgeons to provide accurate postoperative patient education. The CT-based robotic systems may provide necessary input to feasibly individualize such recommendations, but current limitations in CT-based robotics require continued attention and innovation."
pub.1150353899,Comparison of patient reported outcomes after robotic versus manual total knee arthroplasty in the same patient undergoing staged bilateral knee arthroplasty,"Background: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has been proven to improve accuracy of component positioning and reducing alignment target outliers. However, the clinical benefit of robotics is often debated. Recent studies have shown reduced pain and faster recovery in the immediate post-operative period and may be associated with improved PROMs and satisfaction. The aim of this study was to assess PROMs and satisfaction in a unique patient population undergoing bilateral staged TKA to compare manual (MTKA) and RATKA in the same patient.
Methods: 55 patients underwent bilateral staged TKA, performed by a single surgeon at a single institute. Patients who underwent TKA for the first knee with manual technique and RATKA for the second side, were eligible for inclusion in the study. Primary outcome assessed was the Oxford Knee Score and secondary outcomes included the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), patient satisfaction, mean duration for independent ambulation after TKA, and patient perspectives on recovery evaluated with a questionnaire.
Results: Both RATKA and MTKA were associated with comparable PROMs. Though RATKA was associated with improved joint perception (Mean FJS after MTKA surgery was 70.3 (SD = 10.66) and significantly lower than the mean FJS after RATKA (73, SD = 10.95, p-value < 0.01), but the difference was not clinically relevant. A higher proportion of patients were more likely to be very satisfied or satisfied after RATKA. A significant proportion of patients felt the knee operated with RATKA was less painful and felt more natural compared to MTKA at final follow-up (p < 0.01). Majority of patients would undergo RATKA again and recommend robotic-TKA to others.
Conclusion: Robotic-assisted surgery was associated with improved patient satisfaction, faster independent ambulation compared to manual techniques. PROMs however, were comparable without clinically significant differences. Patients preferred robotic-assisted surgery, with a significantly higher proportion perceiving knee operated by RATKA felt more natural."
pub.1044718091,Robotic Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Modern total hip replacement is typically effective and durable, but early failures do occur. Component position influences functional outcome, durability, and risk of complications. Surgical robotics provides the detail-oriented surgeon with a robust tool to optimize the accuracy and precision of total hip arthroplasty, with the potential to minimize risk of mechanical failure. This article describes efficient workflows for using surgical robotics to optimize surgical precision without increasing surgical complexity. "
pub.1145699986,Intraoperative Technology Use Improves Accuracy of Functional Safe Zone Targeting in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Targets of acetabular inclination and anteversion have been suggested based on a patient's spinopelvic mobility. Current methods in total hip arthroplasty (THA) include manual instrumentation, computer-assisted navigation, and robotic-assisted surgery. This study aims to compare the accuracy of these 3 methods in targeting the functional safe zone.
METHODS: This is a prospective multicenter study including a series of 251 consecutive primary posterior THA patients from April 2019 to January 2021. Preoperative lateral standing and sitting spinopelvic radiographs were obtained. Each patient was classified using the Hip-Spine Classification. A functional safe zone plan was determined. Surgeons used their preferred method (manual instrumentation, computer-assisted, or robotic-assisted). Postoperative anteversion and inclination was measured and compared to the preoperative plan. Mean differences between preoperative and postoperative values were calculated. Welch's t-test was used to assess significant between-group differences with P < .05 considered significant.
RESULTS: Of the 249 patients, there were 63 manual instrumentation, 68 computer-assisted navigation, and 118 robotic-assisted surgery. Robotic-assisted surgery (rTHA) was significantly more accurate in targeting anteversion (1 ± 2) compared to manual instrumentation (mTHA; 7 ± 6, P < .001) and computer-assisted navigation (cTHA; 6 ± 6, P < .001). rTHA was also significantly more accurate in targeting inclination (1 ± 1) compared to mTHA (8 ± 7, P < .001) and cTHA (6 ± 7, P < .001). Although cTHA had greater accuracy in targeting both inclination and anteversion compared to mTHA, these differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted surgery was more accurate than both computer-assisted navigation and manual instrumentation in targeting the functional safe zone in primary THA. Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of improved accuracy on dislocation rates."
pub.1079288648,Active Robotics for Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"Robotics and computer-assisted navigation have been developed to increase the accuracy of hip implant placement and improve long-term outcomes of total hip arthroplasty (THA). These technologies have shown significant improvements in implant positioning when compared to conventional techniques. Currently, 3 robotic systems are cleared for use for THA in the US. The lead author (DSD) describes his preferred technique for using one of these systems, the TSolution One® (Think Surgical, Inc.). "
pub.1079307100,Outpatient Robotic-Arm Total Hip Arthroplasty Surgical Technique.,"Outpatient total hip arthroplasty (THA) has remained controversial and challenging. Traditional hospital stays following total joint arthroplasty were substantial and resulted in increased rates of morbidity, significant pain, and severe restriction in mobility. Advancements in the surgical approach, anesthetic regimens, and the initiation of rapid rehabilitation protocols have had an impact on the length of recovery following elective THA. Still, very few studies have specifically outlined outpatient hip arthroplasty and, thus far, none have addressed the use of robotic-arm navigation in outpatient THA. This article describes in detail the technique used to perform outpatient THA with the use of robotic-arm assistance. We believe that outpatient THA using robotic-arm assistance in combination with tissue-preserving surgery, multi-modal pain and nausea management, early rehabilitation, and stringent patient selection yields a suitable alternative to inpatient joint replacement ."
pub.1112878177,Low rate of iatrogenic complications during unicompartmental knee arthroplasty with two semiautonomous robotic systems,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative complications due to utilization of robotic assistance during unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have not been reported. While inadvertent soft tissue injury has been reported during total knee and hip arthroplasty with autonomous style robotic systems, the incidence of these problems with semiautonomous (i.e. surgeon-driven) systems is unknown.
METHODS: We report on a series of 1064 consecutive unicompartmental knee arthroplasties performed by one surgeon with either one of two commercially available semiautonomous robotic systems.
RESULTS: There were no soft tissue, bone injuries or other complications related to the use of the robotic bone preparation method. Six complications related to the use of standard computer navigation pins occurred (0.6%) - one pseudoaneurysm of a branch of the tibialis anterior artery, one tibial metaphyseal stress fracture, and four areas of pin site irritation/superficial infection that resolved with a short course of oral antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: Current semiautonomous robotic methods are safe, with few complications using meticulous surgical techniques."
pub.1164341894,Correcting Hip Dysplasia in Young Adults: Intraoperative Navigation and Outcomes,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) often leads to characteristic acetabular dysplasia and typical femoral anomalies. There are numerous treatments for skeletally mature patients with DDH including hip arthroscopy, pelvic and femoral osteotomies, as well as total hip arthroplasty. Before proceeding to an arthroplasty procedure, it can be helpful to obtain an opinion of a hip preservation specialist to ascertain if alternative surgical treatments could contribute to the patient's care. In general, the use of robotic navigation has been associated with a higher proportion of cups placed in the Lewinnek safe zone, larger improvements in Harris Hip Scores, and no difference in overall complication rates in comparison to manual total hip arthroplasty. The use of robotic navigation allows for both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional preoperative templating, enabling the surgeon to plan the position of the construct such that it achieves maximum bony purchase and hip stability. In complex DDH cases, surgeons can work with a biomechanics department to complete a fit check assessment, which utilizes 3-dimensional templating software to ascertain the appropriateness of the implant's geometry with the patient's anatomy. Furthermore, a 3-dimensional printed plastic model of the pelvis and/or femur can be constructed in order to complete a rehearsal procedure, which may be particularly helpful for those cases involving osteotomies. The literature on the use of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty in patients with DDH demonstrates improved component positioning in comparison to navigated as well as manual methods; however, studies with long-term follow-up in this patient population are lacking."
pub.1159716506,Subgroup analysis of scientific performance in the field of arthroplasty,"Introduction: Arthroplasty is the final treatment option for maintaining mobility and quality of life in many primary degenerative and (post-) traumatic joint diseases. Identification of research output and potential deficits for specific subspecialties may be an important measure to achieve long-term improvement of patient care in this field.
Methods: Using specific search terms and Boolean operators, all studies published since 1945 to the subgroups of arthroplasty listed in the Web of Science Core Collection were included. All identified publications were analysed according to bibliometric standards, and comparative conclusions were drawn regarding the scientific merit of each subgroup.
Results: Most publications investigated the subgroups of septic surgery and materials followed by approach, navigation, aseptic loosening, robotic and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). In the last 5 years, research in the fields of robotic and ERAS achieved the highest relative increase in publications In contrast, research on aseptic loosening has continued to lose interest over the last 5 years. Publications on robotics and materials received the most funding on average while those on aseptic loosening received the least. Most publications originated from USA, Germany, and England, except for research on ERAS in which Denmark stood out. Relatively, publications on aseptic loosening received the most citations, whereas the absolute scientific interest was highest for the topic infection.
Discussion: In this bibliometric subgroup analysis, the primary scientific outputs focused on septic complications and materials research in the field of arthroplasty. With decreasing publication output and the least financial support, intensification of research on aseptic loosening is urgently recommended."
pub.1163572454,Total Knee Arthroplasty in Paget’s Disease using 3D-Printed Patient-Specific Femoral Jig – A Case Report,"Introduction: Patients with Paget's disease develop abnormal bony anatomy which can result in significantly altered lower limb alignment predisposing them to early secondary osteoarthritis. Due to the severe extra-articular deformity, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in these patients is challenging. Conventional knee arthroplasty using intramedullary guides is not an option and can lead to erroneous limb alignment postoperatively. Patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) is a simple solution in such complex primary knee arthroplasty.
Case Report: A 70-year-old male patient presented with a severe left femur deformity and left knee pain. He was diagnosed to have monostotic Paget's disease of the left femur with tricompartmental osteoarthritis of the left knee. After reduction in pathological bone turnover, the patient was planned for a total knee replacement. As a standard intramedullary femoral jig was not applicable due to the femoral deformity, a computed topography-based 3D-printed patient-specific instrument was used. This custom jig was used to define and perform the distal femur cut at 90 degrees to the mechanical axis of the femur in the coronal and sagittal plane. Postoperatively, the patient did well and achieved good function and pain relief.
Conclusion: The use of a 3D-printed PSI for complex primary knee arthroplasty is an excellent option with no additional operative time than a conventional knee arthroplasty. Although a robotic or computer-navigated TKA would be an excellent option in this case, we restored the limb alignment using a cost-effective patient-specific femoral jig. This could be a viable option in centers without navigation or robotic arthroplasty."
pub.1124777383,The evolution of robotic arm-assisted arthroplasty in Greece.,"BACKGROUND: The robotic arm-assisted (Mako) arthroplasty was introduced in Greece in January 2014, through the years of financial crisis. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate its evolution per procedure throughout the years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data regarding type of procedure: partial knee arthroplasty (PKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) were collected from the official distributor of the Mako platform in Greece. The number of Mako arthroplasties were calculated annually and monthly per procedure type from January 2014 to December 2018.
RESULTS: A total of 1081 robotic arm-assisted arthroplasties have been performed in Greece in two private hospitals. Mako cases showed overall 163.06% increase, while THA showed 235.1% increase, during the study period. On the other hand PKA showed 61% decrease, while in during one year (2017-2018) TKA showed 402% increase.
CONCLUSIONS: Introducing robots into the orthopedic operating theater may improve precision, could lead to lower complication rates and finally may offer higher patient satisfaction scores. However, the total growth of robotic arm-assisted arthroplasties in Greece should be interpreted with caution, since all surgeries were performed in private institutions and, therefore, the economic burden of these procedures may have been withstood by specific social class patients."
pub.1144501775,No difference in PROMs between robotic-assisted CR versus PS total knee arthroplasty: a preliminary study,"The purpose of this study was to determine if significant clinical differences exist in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between PS and CR TKAs implanted using robotic-assisted technology. This was an IRB-approved retrospective study from an institutional database evaluating 214 knees in 190 patients. Inclusion criteria included: primary RA-TKA, age 22–89 at the time of surgery, preoperative coronal limb deformity within 15º of neutral alignment, and minimum 1-year follow-up. The PS cohort consisted of 103 patients with 107 RA-TKAs, whereas the CR cohort consisted of 87 patients with 107 RA-TKAs. Cohorts were compared on the basis of demographics and PROMs (KSS knee, KSS function, FJS-12, KOOS-JR, WOMAC, and 5-point satisfaction Likert scale) collected preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up. Statistical analyses comparing measures were conducted via Student’s t tests for continuous data and Chi-squared analyses for categorical data. There were no significant differences identified in short-term PROMs at 1-year follow-up between cohorts (all p values > 0.05). 93.1% of patients with CR knees and 94.7% of patients with PS knees reported a satisfaction level of “very satisfied” or “satisfied”. Revision arthroplasty occurred in six knees (2.8%, 3 knees in CR cohort, 3 knees in PS cohort) with no differences in overall complications between groups. The use of RA-TKA technology promoted high patient satisfaction scores within this study, independent of CR or PS implant type with no significant differences in PROMs, satisfaction, revisions, or complications between the two groups."

These systems allow surgeons to sculpt bone precisely with or without direct visualization of the surgical site. It is in this context that we explored a novel system of implant components for modular knee arthroplasty intended to maximize the benefits of the robotic tools. In this article, we present the constraints, data, and decisions made to produce a version of a system of implant components for robot-assisted modular knee arthroplasty of the cruciate-intact knee."
pub.1147571026,"No Difference in Clinical Outcomes and Survivorship for Robotic, Navigational, and Conventional Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty with a Minimum Follow-up of 10 Years","Background: Computer-assisted surgery, including robotic and navigational total knee arthroplasty (TKA), has been proposed as a technique used to improve alignment of implants. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes during a minimum follow-up period of 10 years among robotic, navigational, and conventional TKA.
Methods: A total of 855 knees (robotic group, 194; conventional group, 270; and navigational group, 391) were available for physical and radiological examinations over a mean follow-up period of 10 years. The survival rate was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method based on the survival endpoint. The Hospital for Special Surgery score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Knee Society Score, and range of motion were used for clinical evaluation. The hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis angle, the coronal inclination of femoral and tibial components, and the presence of radiolucent lines were also assessed at the final follow-up.
Results: All clinical assessments at the final follow-up revealed improvements in the three groups without any significant difference among the groups (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). The cumulative 10-year survival rate was 97.4% in the robotic group, 96.6% in the conventional group, and 98.2% in the navigational group, with no significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.447). The rates of complication-associated surgery were not significantly different among the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.907). Only the proportion of outliers in the HKA axis angle showed a significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.001), but other radiological outcomes were not significantly different among the three groups.
Conclusions: Our study demonstrated satisfactory survival rates for robotic, navigational, and conventional TKAs and similar clinical outcomes during the long-term follow-up. Larger studies with continuous serial data are needed to confirm these findings."
pub.1176313783,High accuracy of component positioning and restoration of lower limb alignment using robotic medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: Unicondylar arthroplasty was performed using robotic medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (R-mUKA) and gap-balancing instrumentation. Our hypothesis was that robotic unicondylar knee arthroplasty accurately restores component positioning and lower limb alignment when compared to preoperative planning with actual implantation throughout the range of knee motion due to proper knee balancing.
METHODS: Data were collected prospectively and were analysed for patients undergoing RM-UKA. A cemented UKA was implanted using the MAKO® robotic system. Lower limb alignment at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° of flexion was recorded of the native knee, with the trial components in place and finally after component implantation. A spacer according to the femorotibial gap was introduced and the alignment was measured. The position of the final component was planned based on three-dimensional computed tomography images before making the bone cuts. The positioning of the femoral and tibial components was analysed in all three planes.
RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were included (mean age 66.3 ± 6.7 years; 34 males, 18 females). The difference in femoral component position after planning and final implantation was 0.04° ± 0.58° more valgus in the coronal plane (p = 0.326) and 0.6° ± 1.4° more flexion relative to the sagittal plane (p = 0.034). The tibial component was placed in the coronal plane in 0.3° ± 0.8° of more varus (p = 0.113) and in the sagittal plane in 0.6° ± 1.2° of more posterior tibial slope (p = 0.001). Lower limb alignment of the native knee in extension was 5.8° ± 2.6° of varus and changed to 3° ± 2.1° varus after UKA (p ≤ 0.01).
CONCLUSION: R-mUKA helps to achieve the target of alignment and component position without any significant differences to the planning. Ligament balancing causes non-significant changes in component position. It allows optimal component position even for off-the-shelf implants respecting the patient's specific anatomy.

pub.1169069547,Analysis of robot-specific operative time and surgical team anxiety level and its effect on alignment during robot-assisted TKA,"Adapting to robotic-assisted (RA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is hindered by the surgeon's fear of extra time. The main purpose of this study was to determine the robot's operative time, and the secondary goals were to assess the surgical team's anxiety, implant location and size, and limb alignment. From February to April 2022, 40 participants participated in prospective research. The study included primary Cuvis joint active RA-TKA patients for end-stage arthritis, but conversion of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty to TKA, and patients with prior knee surgery were excluded. The active RA-TKA surgical time included surgeon-dependent and surgeon-independent/active robot time. The surgeon's anxiety was measured using the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI). The implant size/position and limb alignment were checked by post-operative weight-bearing lateral, anteroposterior, and full-length scanograms. Operative time specifically related to active RA-TKA was higher in the first 10 cases as against 10–20, 20–30 and 30–40 cases which was observed to lower from cohort 2. A similar trend was observed for the surgical team’s anxiety levels which seem to lower from cohort 2 (case 10–20). Cumulative experience of active RA-TKA showed no effect on the precision of implant alignment/ size, limb alignment and complications. The study showed progressive improvement in the surgical anxiety scores and reduction in operating time indicating the proficiency gained by the surgical team. Further no learning curve was involved in achieving the implant positioning and sizing, limb alignment with the absence of complications."
pub.1175116567,The Use of the Robotic Arm-Assisted System (MAKO) for Hip Revision Surgery,"The robotic arm-assisted system (MAKO) has pioneered a transformative approach to hip joint restoration, excelling in reinstating innate hip joint anatomy and biomechanics. This case represents the initial application of the system in revision surgery following a cut-out complication. A 69-year-old female, previously independent and mobile, presented with left hip pain. X-rays revealed a cut-out complication of the proximal nail, necessitating revision to total hip arthroplasty due to the patient's prior activity level and implant prominence. Utilizing the robotic system, preoperative planning accurately identified limb length discrepancy and guided implant sizing. The system facilitated precise acetabular reaming and optimal component placement. The patient regained functional independence. This report also underscores the system's potential for accurate acetabulum component placement and restoration of hip joint anatomy and biomechanics in revision cases. Future advancements in this technology may expand its role in complex reconstructions and revisions, further enhancing patient outcomes in hip arthroplasty."
pub.1163391133,"Total Hip Arthroplasty: An Update on Navigation, Robotics, and Contemporary Advancements","While total hip arthroplasty (THA) remains effective for improvement of pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis, there remain areas of continued pursuit of excellence, including decreasing rates of dislocation, leg length discrepancy, implant loosening, and infection. This review article covers several bearing surfaces and articulations, computer-assisted navigation and robotic technology, and minimally invasive surgical approaches that have sought to improve such outcomes. Perhaps the most significant improvement to THA implant longevity has been the broad adoption of highly cross-linked polyethylene, with low wear rates. Similarly, navigation and robotic technology has proven to more reproducibly achieve intraoperative component positioning, which has demonstrated clinical benefit with decreased risk of dislocation in a number of studies. Given the projected increase in THA over the coming decades, continued investigation of effective incorporation of technology, soft tissue-sparing approaches, and durable implants is imperative to continued pursuit of improved outcomes in THA."
pub.1152984339,Variation in knee balance as a function of hip-knee-ankle angle and joint line obliquity in robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty,"PurposeTo describe the mediolateral (ML) gap balance in pre-resection arthritic knees undergoing robot-assisted (RA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) within the nine phenotypes of the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) classification.MethodsA total of 1124 RA TKA cases were retrospectively reviewed. ML balance was calculated using a digital ligament tensioning device following tibial resection and prior to any femoral resection throughout flexion (10°, 40°, and 90°). Lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) and medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) were landmarked intra-operatively and adjusted for wear based on hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA). Knees were then subdivided into CPAK categories based on the arithmetic HKA (aHKA) and joint line obliquity (JLO). Differences in balance between CPAK phenotypes were compared.ResultsFor aHKA, a greater medial gap was observed in varus compared to neutral or valgus knees at 10° (5.2 ± 3.0 mm vs 3.3 ± 3.2 mm vs − 0.4 ± 5.0 mm respectively; p < 0.0001). A similar trend was observed for JLO in distal apex compared to neutral and proximal apex knees at 10° (3.4 ± 3.6 vs 1.1 ± 5.0 vs − 2.4 ± 6.3 respectively; p < 0.0001). The greatest ML balance differences were found when combining JLO and aHKA at 10° (type I vs type VI: ∆6.6 mm; p < 0.0001).ConclusionThere is a high degree of variability in arthritic ML balance within and between each CPAK phenotype. A single alignment philosophy based on bony landmarks alone may not be sufficient to balance all knees. Utilisation of robotics and digital ligament tensioning devices serves as important adjuncts to characterize the patient-specific soft tissue profile."
pub.1165963922,"Fluoroscopy-based robotics in total hip arthroplasty mitigates laterality-based differences in acetabular cup placement when compared to the manual, fluoroscopic- assisted technique","BACKGROUND: Robotic assistance in total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) has been shown to minimize laterality-based differences in acetabular cup positioning.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if the use of a novel, fluoroscopy-based RA-THA system mitigates differences in acetabular cup placement between left (L) and right (R) side hip procedures, when compared to manual, fluoroscopic-assisted technique.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 106 consecutive mTHA (40 L/66 R) and 102 RA-THA (48 L/54 R) primary direct anterior approach procedures. All cases were performed by a single right-hand-dominant surgeon, for a pre-operative diagnosis of osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Outcomes included acetabular cup inclination and anteversion, and the proportion of cups within the Lewinnek safe-zone.
RESULTS: The average inclination of mTHA L cases was smaller than that of mTHA R cases (41.10∘± 7.38 vs. 43.97∘± 6.27; p= 0.04). For RA-THA, L and R cup angles were similar. There were fewer overall mTHA hips within the Lewinnek safe-zone compared to RA-THA (0.59 vs. 0.78; p= 0.003), as well as fewer mTHA R cases than RA-THA R cases (0.59 vs. 0.80; p= 0.03) within safe zone.
CONCLUSION: Use of a novel, fluoroscopy-based robotic system mitigates laterality-based differences in acetabular cup placement that were observed in a manual, fluoroscopic-assisted cohort."
pub.1146560188,Patient-Specific TKA with the VELYS™ Robotic-Assisted Solution.,"The VELYS™ Robotic-Assisted Solution (VRAS) (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana) utilises new technology to accurately collect the bony anatomy and soft tissue envelope of the knee. This enables surgeons to use this information to intraoperatively plan anatomical placement of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with preservation of the soft tissues with the aim of restoring functional knee motion. The robotic-assisted saw delivers precise, accurate, and efficient delivery of this implantation plan. This article describes the patient-specific TKA technique which maximises the full potential of VRAS; however, all TKA techniques and alignment philosophies can be accommodated with VRAS. The first case was performed in late 2020. An early outcome study shows an improvement in knee function and pain with activity at discharge and six weeks and a neutral surgical time comparable with the author's extensive experience with patient-specific balanced TKA with navigation. Only a limited number of patients have one-year results. However, the data of this limited cohort demonstrates favourable outcome scores and high patient satisfaction."
pub.1156492839,How reproducible are clinical measurements in robotic knee surgery?,"PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted surgery has been recently introduced to improve biomechanical restoration, and thus better clinical and functional outcomes, after knee joint arthroplasty operations. Robotic-assisted uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) aims indeed to improve surgical bone resection and alignment accuracy, optimized component positioning and knee balancing, relying on a series of calibration measurements performed during the surgery. These advantages focus therefore on improving the reproducibility of UKA surgeries, reducing (if not eliminating) eventual differences among high- and low-volume surgeons. The purpose of this study is to investigate and quantify the reproducibility of in-vivo measurements performed with a robotic system: the intra- and inter-observer variability of a series of measurements was therefore analyzed and compared among differently experienced operators.
METHODS: Five patients were analyzed and underwent robotic-assisted UKA using a semi-active robotic system. Three different observers with different experience levels were involved to independently perform the measurements of two parameters of the preoperative knee (Hip-Knee-Ankle angle [HKAa], Internal-External Rotation) at different degrees of knee flexion. Inter-observer and intra-observer comparisons were performed.
RESULTS: The average variability in the measurements obtained from the intra-observer and inter-observer comparisons were always < 0.68° for HKAa and < 2.59° for internal-external rotation, and the ICCs showed excellent agreement (> 0.75) for most cases and good agreement (> 0.60) in the remaining ones.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated high reproducibility of the measurements obtainable in clinical environment with the robotic system. The inter-observer results furthermore showed that the level of confidence with the robotic system is not significantly influencing the measurement."

Methods: A consecutive series of patients treated with unilateral primary robotic or standard TKA from January 2018-February 2021 were retrospectively identified. Regional pain modalities included peri-articular injection (PAI), adductor canal block (ACB), and infiltration between popliteal artery and capsule of knee (IPACK). Patient demographics, operative/perioperative variables, and postoperative function were recorded. Daily opiate consumption was calculated as morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Multivariate regression was performed to control for age, sex, and race.
Results: After review, 283 patients (177 Females; 106 Males) were included. Robotic TKA patients received IPACK + ACB (36), while standard TKA patients received either ACB (45), IPACK + ACB (167), or PAI (35). Daily inpatient opioid consumption in the standard IPACK + ACB (p = 0.02) and robotic IPACK + ACB groups (p = 0.0001) was significantly lower compared to standard ACB. When combined with IPACK block, robotic procedures synergistically lowered opiate consumption (p = 0.004) compared to standard procedures and led to earlier discharge (p = 0.003). The robotic IPACK + ACB cohort also demonstrated improved early ambulation compared to standard ACB, (p = 0.05), whereas the same benefit was not seen for patients who received IPACK during standard TKA.
Conclusions: The utilization of IPACK block decreases inpatient postoperative opioid requirements following TKA. Robotic TKA and IPACK block appeared to have a synergistic effect on opioid consumption and postoperative recovery."

pub.1157425968,Is There a Scope for an Open Source Philosophy in Robotic Joint Replacement?: Why and How to Make Robotic Platforms Common and Universal for All Implants !,"BackgroundStandardisation and open source technologies has transformed our world by levelling the field for innovation and improvisation. In the field of arthroplasty, we are seeing robotic technology make giant strides in terms of  wide spread adoption across geographies. The benefits of consistency, reduced intra-surgeon and inter-surgeon variability as well as decreased dependence on complex instrumentation sets and large implant inventories, is a step in the right direction. However they suffer from a very significant drawback; today’s  robotic systems are essentially closed systems and do not offer cross platform and cross implant compatibility.Materials and MethodsThis point of view dwells on why it is important that robotics become open source and how this can be achieved.  A universal system of implant sizing and nomenclature is proposed. This may enable the use of Robotic platform across various commercially available implants seamlessly.ResultsAs of today, scientific literature and also the marketing literature provides no verifiable rationale for use of varied implant sizing terminology. The proposed universal implant sizing and nomenclature can be based on the Anteroposterior and mediolateral size data obtained from various anthropometric studies down across varied races.ConclusionTBy building a consensus on the universal implant sizing nomenclature, the field of arthroplasty will achieve a major milestone. It will have benefits including easier documentation, storage and transmission of data. Most importantly, it will be the right step in direction of making the Robotic Technology – open source and thus making it available, accessible and affordable to all."
pub.1151071164,Registration of Bony Landmarks and Soft Tissue Laxity during Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty is Highly Reproducible.,"INTRODUCTION: There is growing interest and enthusiasm for robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Many robotic systems require registration of bony landmarks as well as a dynamic soft tissue evaluation to plan femoral and tibial resections. Variability in this user-driven registration can introduce error and undermine the purported precision and accuracy offered by robotics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate inter- and intrarater reliability in robotic registration with a new robotic system (ROSA®; Zimmer-Biomet, Warsaw, IN).
METHODS: Two unpaired cadaveric knee specimens were exposed, and optical arrays were placed into the femur and tibia. Three separate evaluators conducted repeated trials of anatomic registration and assessment of soft tissue laxity, as well as coronal alignment, sagittal alignment, femoral size, and maximum opening in the medial and lateral compartments in both flexion and extension. Repeated trials were conducted using these specimens with and without preoperative imaging for landmarking (image-based and image-free workflows). An Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was calculated for each observer and across observers to determine intra-and interrater reliability, respectively, in robotic registration.
RESULTS: There was good to excellent reliability for all conditions, and all correlation coefficients were >0.767. On average, ICCs for intrarater reliability were excellent for Doctor 1 (0.952), Doctor 2 (0.975), and Doctor 3 (0.925). On average, the ICCs for interrater reliability were excellent for both the ""Registration + Gap Assessment"" condition (0.961) and the ""Gap Assessment"" condition (0.994).
CONCLUSION: Our results show a high repeatability of registration of anatomic landmarks and gap assessment among observers using this robotic system for both image-based and image-free software."
pub.1150631622,CT Scan-Based Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: What Do Today's Highest-Quality Studies Tell Us?,"INTRODUCTION: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) aims to restore function and reduce pain for patients suffering from hip pathologies. However, some procedures require revision THA, with the most common reasons including: mechanical failure, aseptic loosening, infection, and component malposition leading to dislocations. Computed tomography (CT) scan-based, three-dimensional imaging operating techniques can help address some of these issues by helping to provide more optimal implant positioning, which can potentially confer improved outcomes. To date, only a few studies have evaluated the utilization of CT scan-based robotic-arm assisted THA in total hip arthroplasty, and those that do are not necessarily of the high-methodological quality. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to select the most recent and good- to high-quality studies focusing on robotic-assisted THA, to help provide a more comprehensive representation of postoperative outcomes. Specifically, we evaluated each study independently as well as performed a cumulative assessment of this most recent high-quality data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive, cross-platform search of total hip arthroplasty on August 1, 2022 was performed. Studies were included only if they addressed robotic-assisted THA in comparison to manual techniques. Additional inclusion criteria consisted of studies scoring excellent (100 to 85 points) or good (84 to 70 points) based on their Coleman methodology score. Studies were evaluated as individual pieces of work, as well as a cumulative assessment. Specific outcomes evaluated were: component placement in safe zones, leg- length discrepancies, dislocation rates, clinical outcomes, patient clinical scores, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS), lengths of stay, and costs.
RESULTS: Overall, 24 studies were included for analyses. CT scan-based robotic-arm assisted THA had some potential key advantages as compared to manual techniques. Specifically, robotic-assisted THA was associated with more accurate component placement in safe zones, fewer chances of leg-length discrepancies, and lower risks of dislocation. Patient satisfaction and reported outcome measures were superior for CT scan-based robotic-arm assisted THA. Costs were also lower. Overall, 23 of 24 studies were positive for this technology, with one study of cases done between 2010 and 2014 more neutral. The robot led to positive findings for component placement in safe zones, leg-length discrepancies, dislocation rates, clinical outcomes, PROMS, lengths of stay, and costs.
CONCLUSION: The current literature suggests potential advantages for CT scan-based robotic-arm assisted THA compared to manual THA. Surgeons should consider CT scan-based robotic-arm assisted THA for their patients given the multiple added benefits of improved clinical scores and PROMS, less dislocations (with a few exceptions reported), more component placements in safe zones, less leg-length discrepancies, decreased lengths of st"
pub.1157506247,Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Conventional Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus Robotic-Arm Assisted Arthroplasty: A Prospective Cohort Study With Minimum 3 Years’ Follow-Up,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (RO THA) has been shown to improve the accuracy of component positioning compared with conventional total hip arthroplasty (CO THA). This study reports Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) of a previous trial that showed that RO THA was associated with improved accuracy and reduced outliers in acetabular component positioning compared with CO THA.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 50 patients undergoing CO THA versus 50 patients receiving RO THA. The Oxford hip score, Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), University of California at Los Angeles hip score were recorded at a minimum of 3 years following surgery.
RESULTS: At minimum 3 years follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in CO THA versus RO THA with respect to the Oxford hip score [median 42(6.25) versus 41(5.5), P = .914]; FJS [89 (9.25) versus 86 (9), P = .065], and University of California at Los Angeles score [median 7.5 (3) versus 7 (2), P = .381]. None of the study patients had dislocations or underwent revision surgery within 3 years follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The previously reported improvement in accuracy of acetabular component in this study population did not translate to statistically significant improvements in PROMs. Patients in both groups achieved excellent PROMs and there was a trend towards higher FJS scores postoperatively in the RO THA group that did not reach statistical significance. Further studies are needed to assess the significance of these findings on longer-term clinical outcomes and implant survivorships, and also to explore the impact of the enhanced RO THA workflow and functional implant positioning on these outcomes."
pub.1068898169,Improved Accuracy of Component Positioning with Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Higher revision rates have been reported in patients who have undergone unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared with patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty, with poor component positioning identified as a factor in implant failure. A robotic-assisted surgical procedure has been proposed as a method of improving the accuracy of component implantation in arthroplasty. The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial was to evaluate the accuracy of component positioning in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty comparing robotic-assisted and conventional implantation techniques.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either a robotic-assisted surgical procedure using the MAKO Robotic Interactive Orthopaedic Arm (RIO) system or a conventional surgical procedure using the Oxford Phase-3 unicompartmental knee replacement with traditional instrumentation. A postoperative computed tomographic scan was performed at three months to assess the accuracy of the axial, coronal, and sagittal component positioning.
RESULTS: Data were available for 120 patients, sixty-two who had undergone robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and fifty-eight who had undergone conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Intraobserver agreement was good for all measured component parameters. The accuracy of component positioning was improved with the use of the robotic-assisted surgical procedure, with lower root mean square errors and significantly lower median errors in all component parameters (p < 0.01). The proportion of patients with component implantation within 2° of the target position was significantly greater in the group who underwent robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared with the group who underwent conventional unicompartmental knee arthroscopy with regard to the femoral component sagittal position (57% compared with 26%, p = 0.0008), femoral component coronal position (70% compared with 28%, p = 0.0001), femoral component axial position (53% compared with 31%, p = 0.0163), tibial component sagittal position (80% compared with 22%, p = 0.0001), and tibial component axial position (48% compared with 19%, p = 0.0009).
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted surgical procedures with the use of the MAKO RIO lead to improved accuracy of implant positioning compared with conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty surgical techniques.

pub.1149896002,A new robotically assisted technique can improve outcomes of total knee arthroplasty comparing to an imageless navigation system,"BackgroundRobotic assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) has shown improved knee alignment and reduced radiographic outliers. However, there remains debate on functional outcomes and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs). This study compares the 1-year clinical outcomes of a new imageless robotically assisted technique (ROSA Knee System, Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) with an imageless navigated procedure (NTKA, iAssist Knee, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN).MethodsThe study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data that compared the functional outcomes and PROMs of 50 imageless RTKA with 47 imageless NTKA at 1-year follow-up. Baseline characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative information were collected including complications, revisions, Knee Society Score (KSS), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) score, and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12). Radiographic analysis of preoperative and postoperative images evaluating hip–knee–ankle (HKA) angle was performed.ResultsThere was no difference regarding baseline characteristics between the groups. Mean operative time was significantly longer in the RTKA group (122 min vs. 97 min; p < 0.0001). Significant differences were reported for the “Pain” (85 [RTKA] vs 79.1 [NTKA]; p = 0.0283) subsection of the KOOS score. In addition, RTKA was associated with higher maximum range of motion (119.4° vs. 107.1°; p < 0.0001) and better mean improvement of the arc of motion by 11.67° (23.02° vs. 11.36°; p < 0.0001). No significant differences were noted for other subsections of KOOS, KSS, FJS-12, complications, or limb alignment at 1-year follow-up.ConclusionsImageless RTKA was associated with longer surgical time, better pain perception and improved ROM at 12-month follow-up compared with NTKA. No significant differences were reported on other PROMs, complication rates and radiographic outcomes.Level of evidenceIII."
pub.1113301532,A review of the evolution of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is currently a very successful operation but continues to evolve as we try to perfect techniques and improve outcomes for our patients. Robotic hip surgery (RHS) began with the 'active' ROBODOC system in the 1980s. There were drawbacks associated with the original ROBODOC and most recently, the MAKO robot was introduced with early promising results.
AIM: The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review surrounding this area and discuss the pros and cons of this technique.
METHODS: A literature review searching Medline, Embase, Ovidsp, Cochrane library, pubmed database and google scholar was performed searching keywords including: 'Robotic hip surgery', 'Robotic orthopaedic surgery', 'Computer assisted hip surgery', 'robotic arthroplasty', and 'computer assisted orthopaedic surgery'.
CONCLUSION: Robotic hip surgery aims to tackle the limitations of the human factor in surgery by promising reproducible and reliable methods of component positioning in arthroplasty surgery. However, as orthopaedic surgeons, we must critically appraise all new technology and support the use providing there is sound robust evidence backing it."
pub.1147540167,Artificial intelligence in knee arthroplasty: current concept of the available clinical applications,"BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) is defined as the study of algorithms that allow machines to reason and perform cognitive functions such as problem-solving, objects, images, word recognition, and decision-making. This study aimed to review the published articles and the comprehensive clinical relevance of AI-based tools used before, during, and after knee arthroplasty.MethodsThe search was conducted through PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases from 2000 to 2021 using the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol (PRISMA).ResultsA total of 731 potential articles were reviewed, and 132 were included based on the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. Some steps of the knee arthroplasty procedure were assisted and improved by using AI-based tools. Before surgery, machine learning was used to aid surgeons in optimizing decision-making. During surgery, the robotic-assisted systems improved the accuracy of knee alignment, implant positioning, and ligamentous balance. After surgery, remote patient monitoring platforms helped to capture patients’ functional data.ConclusionIn knee arthroplasty, the AI-based tools improve the decision-making process, surgical planning, accuracy, and repeatability of surgical procedures."
pub.1164832833,Learning curve for imageless robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty in non-fellowship trained joint replacement surgeons,"Introduction: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has become increasingly popular, although an associated learning curve can be a deterrent for some surgeons. Prior studies have addressed this learning curve in fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons, however the learning curve among non-fellowship-trained surgeons remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the learning curve for imageless RA-TKA related to operative time and rates of complications among two non-arthroplasty-trained orthopedic surgeons.
Methods: This retrospective case series included 200 RA-TKA consecutive cases performed by two non-arthroplasty-trained orthopedic surgeons (100 each). Cases were divided into 2 cohorts for each surgeon: the first 50 consecutive cases and the second 50 cases. These cohorts were then compared to assess for trends in each surgeon as well as in both surgeons combined. Mean operative times were compared, as were hospital length of stay, complications, readmission, and reoperations.
Results: For both surgeons, the mean operative time significantly decreased from the first 50 cases to the next 50 cases (116.5 vs 108.4 min for surgeon 1, <i>P</i> = 0.031; 125.7 vs 109.1 min for surgeon 2, <i>P</i> = 0.001). No significant differences were found among length of stay, complications, readmissions, or reoperations between cohorts.
Conclusion: General orthopedic surgeons can expect to optimize operative time within 50 cases, while not carrying associated risks of related complications during the early learning period."

METHODS: We retrospectively compared the short-term clinical and radiological outcomes of 424 knees (408 patients). The patients were divided into four groups: BMI &lt; 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (normal); BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight); BMI between 30.0 and 34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese class I) and BMI between 35.0 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese class II). Clinical and radiologic outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in radiologic outcomes between those groups (<i>p</i> &gt; .05). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in operation time, drainage volume, fall in hemoglobin, post-operative CRP and complications, including periprosthetic fracture and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), between those groups.
CONCLUSION: High BMI does not affect short-term clinical and radiologic outcomes in robot-assisted TKA."
pub.1171329416,The Perspectives of Robotic Surgeons.,"Given recent advancements in artificial intelligence and robotic surgery, attention has now been paid to the concept of autonomous surgery. As robotic surgery has developed and matured, examples of autonomous surgery have arisen through the assistance of artificial intelligence. As with any new technology, ethical and legal considerations also arise, and there are special considerations that should be taken into account with the adaptation of new technology involving patient care.

pub.1150916892,Accuracy of intraoperative bone registration and stereotactic boundary reconstruction during total knee arthroplasty surgery,"BACKGROUND: The intraoperative registration of the bones play a crucial role in image-based computer-assisted knee arthroplasty to achieve accurate implant placement and to create reliable stereotactic bone boundaries for robot-assisted surgical systems.
METHOD: This study assessed the intraoperative registration accuracy on six intact fresh frozen cadavers.
RESULTS: Rotational errors around the mechanical axis were the largest, with a standard deviation of 1.2° and outliers up to 3.7°. The mean translational errors were lower than 1 mm, with outliers up to 1.5 mm. These errors were amplified to 2 mm for the registration-based reconstruction of the posterior bone surface at the resection levels.
CONCLUSION: Given the cumulative behaviour of surgical errors, registration errors can affect the final implant positioning. Furthermore, inaccuracies in the reconstructed bone boundary directly affect the virtual stereotactic boundaries used in robotic-assisted surgery and can result in an incomplete resection or inadvertent soft tissue damage."
pub.1007024077,Retrospective Clinical and Radiological Outcomes after Robotic Assisted Bicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Purpose. Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BiKA) is a favorable alternative to total knee arthroplasty for degenerative disease limited to two knee compartments. Recently developed robotic-assisted systems improved the clinical efficacy of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty by providing enhanced component positioning with dynamic ligament balancing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term outcomes of patients, undergoing bicompartmental knee arthroplasty at a single institution by a single surgeon using a robotic-assisted system. It was hypothesized that robotic assisted BiKA is a prevailing choice for degenerative disease limited to two knee compartments with good functional results. Methods. A search of the institution's joint registry was conducted to identify patients that underwent robotic-assisted BiKA of the patellofemoral compartment and the medial or lateral compartment. Results. A total number of 29 patients (30 BiKA) with a mean age of 63.6 years were identified who received a patellofemoral resurfacing in combination with medial or lateral compartment resurfacing. Twenty-four out of 29 patients had good to excellent outcome. Conclusion. Robotic assisted bicompartmental arthroplasty using broad indications and only excluding patients with severe deformity and those that have less than 4 mm of joint space in the surviving compartment demonstrated 83% good to excellent results.

pub.1174785951,DEIT-Based Bone Position and Orientation Estimation for Robotic Support in Total Knee Arthroplasty—A Computational Feasibility Study,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established and successful treatment option for patients with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee, providing high patient satisfaction. Robotic systems have been widely adopted to perform TKA in orthopaedic centres. The exact spatial positions of the femur and tibia are usually determined through pinned trackers, providing the surgeon with an exact illustration of the axis of the lower limb. The drilling of holes required for mounting the trackers creates weak spots, causing adverse events such as bone fracture. In the presented computational feasibility study, time differential electrical impedance tomography is used to locate the femur positions, thereby the difference in conductivity distribution between two distinct states s0 and s1 of the measured object is reconstructed. The overall approach was tested by simulating five different configurations of thigh shape and considered tissue conductivity distributions. For the cylinder models used for verification and reference, the reconstructed position deviated by about ≈1 mm from the actual bone centre. In case of models mimicking a realistic cross section of the femur position deviated between 7.9 mm 24.8 mm. For all models, the bone axis was off by about φ=1.50° from its actual position."
pub.1144366741,High accuracy of a new robotically assisted technique for total knee arthroplasty: an in vivo study,"PURPOSE: Over the last decade, robotic TKA gained popularity for improving the accuracy of implant positioning and reducing outliers in limb alignment comparing to conventional jig-based TKA. Hypothesis of this study was that this newly designed robotically assisted system will achieve a high level of accuracy for bone resection. Purpose of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of the system.
METHODS: For this study, 75 knees in 75 patients were operated using a new, robotic system (ROSA<sup>®</sup> Knee System; Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) with a Posterior Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty (Persona<sup>®</sup> Knee System). The planned, validated and measured angles and cuts for the distal and posterior femur, for the proximal tibia and for the final coronal alignment on long standing x-rays were compared.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found only between the average planned and the average validated angle for femoral flexion, tibial coronal axis, medial and lateral cuts; the average difference was in any case below 1 mm or under 1 degree with SD &lt; 1. No statistical difference was found between planned validated and measured cuts. Average difference between planned HKA and measured was 1.2 ± 1.1. No statistically significant difference was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that using this new surgical robot in total knee arthroplasty it is possible to perform accurate bone cuts and to achieve the planned angles and resections."
pub.1101848900,Pros and Cons: A Balanced View of Robotics in Knee Arthroplasty,"In both unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), compared with conventional techniques robotic technology has been shown to optimize the precision of bone preparation and component alignment, reducing outliers and increasing the percentage of components aligned within 2° or 3° of the target goal. In addition, soft tissue balance can be quantified through a range of motion in UKA and TKA using the various robotic technologies available. Although the presumption has been that the improved alignment associated with robotics will improve function and implant durability, there are limited data to support that notion. Based on recent and emerging data, it may be unreasonable to presume that robotics is necessary for both UKA and TKA. In fact, despite improvements in various proxy measures, the precision of robotics may be more important for UKA than TKA, although if system costs and surgical efficiencies continue to improve, streamlining perioperative processes, reducing instrument inventory, and achieving comparable outcomes in TKA may be a reasonable goal of robotic surgery."
pub.1169069403,Outcomes following robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionThis study elaborates on previous research to compare length of stay, complication rates, and total cost between patients undergoing robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) and conventional total knee arthroplasty (cTKA). We hypothesized that patients undergoing rTKA would have reduced length of stay, lower complication rates, improved perioperative outcomes, and higher total healthcare costs than those undergoing cTKA.MethodsData were collected from the National Inpatient Sample Database Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project between the years 2016–2019. Patients undergoing rTKA and cTKA were identified under International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes (ICD-10-CM/PCS). Length of stay, specific complications, and total costs were examined at time point. SPSS (v 27.0 8, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) was utilized to compare demographic and analytical statistics between rTKA and cTKA. rTKA and cTKA were compared both before and after propensity matching.Results17,249 rTKA (3.09%) and 541,122 cTKA (96.91%) were included. Compared to cTKA patients, rTKA patients had reduced average length of stay of 1.91 days (p < 0.001), higher average total cost of $67133.34 (p < 0.001), reduced periprosthetic infection (OR = 0.027, p < 0.001), periprosthetic dislocation (OR = 0.117, p < 0.001), periprosthetic mechanical complication (OR = 0.315, p < 0.001), pulmonary embolism (OR = 0.358, p < 0.001), transfusion (OR = 0.366, p < 0.001), pneumonia (OR = 0.468, p = 0.002), deep vein thrombosis (OR = 0.479, p = 0.001), and blood loss anemia (OR = 0.728, p < 0.001). These differences remained statistically significant even after propensity matching.ConclusionsThis study supports our hypothesis that rTKA is associated with fewer complications, but higher average total cost than cTKA. Our study shows that rTKA can be safely performed in older and sicker patients. Future studies assessing the impacts of these findings on patient reported outcomes would provide further insight into the benefits of rTKA. Furthermore, identifying patient specific factors that place them at risk for increased complications with cTKA as opposed to rTKA could provide surgeons insight on the method of TKA that maximizes patient outcomes while minimizing healthcare cost."
pub.1132262715,Incidental findings detected on preoperative CT imaging obtained for robotic-assisted joint replacements: clinical importance and the effect on the scheduled arthroplasty,"ObjectiveTo determine the type and frequency of incidental findings detected on preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging obtained for robotic-assisted joint replacements and their effect on the planned arthroplasty.Materials and methodsAll preoperative CT examinations performed for a robotic-assisted knee or total hip arthroplasty were obtained. This resulted in 1432 examinations performed between September 2016 and February 2020 at our institution. These examinations were initially interpreted by 1 of 9 fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists. Using a diagnosis search, the examination reports were then reviewed to catalog all incidental findings and further classify as significant or non-significant findings. Demographic information was obtained. In those with significant findings, a chart review was performed to record the relevant workup, outcomes, and if the planned arthroplasty was affected.ResultsIncidental findings were diagnosed in 740 (51.7%) patients. Of those with incidental findings, 41 (5.5%) were considered significant. A significant finding was more likely to be detected in males (P = 0.007) and on the hip protocol CT (P = 0.014). In 8 patients, these diagnoses resulted in either delay or cancelation of the arthroplasty. A planned total hip arthroplasty was more likely to be altered as compared to a knee arthroplasty (P = 0.018).ConclusionIncidental findings are commonly detected by radiologists on preoperative CT imaging obtained for robotic-assisted joint replacement. Several were valuable findings and resulted in a delay or even cancelation of the planned arthroplasty after the detection of critical diagnoses, which if not identified may have resulted in devastating outcomes."
pub.1170314079,A prospective randomized controlled trial comparing CT-based planning with conventional total hip arthroplasty versus robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"Aims: Achieving accurate implant positioning and restoring native hip biomechanics are key surgeon-controlled technical objectives in total hip arthroplasty (THA). The primary objective of this study was to compare the reproducibility of the planned preoperative centre of hip rotation (COR) in patients undergoing robotic arm-assisted THA versus conventional THA.
Methods: This prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 60 patients with symptomatic hip osteoarthritis undergoing conventional THA (CO THA) versus robotic arm-assisted THA (RO THA). Patients in both arms underwent pre- and postoperative CT scans, and a patient-specific plan was created using the robotic software. The COR, combined offset, acetabular orientation, and leg length discrepancy were measured on the pre- and postoperative CT scanogram at six weeks following surgery.
Results: There were no significant differences for any of the baseline characteristics including spinopelvic mobility. The absolute error for achieving the planned horizontal COR was median 1.4 mm (interquartile range (IQR) 0.87 to 3.42) in RO THA versus 4.3 mm (IQR 3 to 6.8; p < 0.001); vertical COR mean 0.91 mm (SD 0.73) in RO THA versus 2.3 mm (SD 1.3; p < 0.001); and combined offset median 2 mm (IQR 0.97 to 5.45) in RO THA versus 3.9 mm (IQR 2 to 7.9; p = 0.019). Improved accuracy was observed with RO THA in achieving the desired acetabular component positioning (root mean square error for anteversion and inclination was 2.6 and 1.3 vs 8.9 and 5.3, repectively) and leg length (mean 0.6 mm vs 1.4 mm; p < 0.001). Patient-reported outcome measures were comparable between the two groups at baseline and one year. Participants in the RO THA group needed fewer physiotherapy sessions postoperatively (median six (IQR 4.5 to 8) vs eight (IQR 6 to 11; p = 0.005).
Conclusion: This RCT suggested that robotic-arm assistance in THA was associated with improved accuracy in restoring the native COR, better preservation of the combined offset, leg length correction, and superior accuracy in achieving the desired acetabular component positioning. Further evaluation through long-term and registry data is necessary to assess whether these findings translate into improved implant survival and functional outcomes."
pub.1166863265,High return to sport rate in patients undergoing image-based robotic arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionThis study was aimed to assess the return to sport (RTS) rate in patients who underwent CT-based robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RA-UKA) and to evaluate the clinical performance and the assocition between patients’ sport activity levels and Patient Reported Outcome Measures after surgery.Materials and methodsThis retrospective study included 218 patients undergoing medial RA-UKA with fixed-bearing implants, performed at a single center between 2014 and 2019. Patients were allocated into two groups based on sport’s practice and were administered the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR) and the 5-Level Likert Scale.ResultsA total of 136 patients were included for assessment. The overall RTS rate after surgery was 93.1%. Six subjects who did not practice sport preoperatively, were able to start sport activities after surgery and all patients performing sports preoperatively, returned to same activity level. The mean UCLA and FJS-12 scores in the group of patients practicing sports were significantly higher than in the no-sport group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Patients who practiced sports were more likely to attain higher FJS-12 and UCLA scores than those who were not performing physical activity.ConclusionsPatients undergoing RA-UKA showed a 93.1% RTS rate after surgery. Differences were detected in terms of postoperative UCLA and FJS-12 scores between patients who performed and who did not practice sport activities after surgery. High levels of postoperative UCLA scores were associated with higher KOOS-JR and patients’ satisfaction."
pub.1126647219,"Robotic-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty (RAKA): The Technique, the Technology and the Transition","BackgroundThere has been an exponential increase in knee arthroplasty over the past 20 years. This has led to a quest for improvement in outcomes and patient satisfaction. While the last decade of last century proved to be the decade for Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) or Computer Navigation wherein the technology demonstrated a clear benefit in terms of improving mechanical axis alignment and component positioning, this decade is likely to belong to Robotics. Robotics adds an independent dimension to the benefits that CAS offers. The article deals with the generation of robots, technical steps in robotics, advantages and downsides of robotics and way forward in the field of knee arthroplasty.Materials and MethodsThe review article was designed and edited by six different authors reviewing 32 relevant pubmed-based articles related to robotics in arthroplasty and orthopaedics. The concept, design and the definition of the intellectual content were based on the internationally published literature and insightful articles. The review is also based on the clinical experimental studies published in the literature.DiscussionThe robotic arm is actively involved with surgeon to achieve the precision and outcomes that the surgeon aims for. With the concept of haptic boundaries and augmented reality being incorporated in most systems, Robotic Assisted Arthroplasty (RAA) is likely to offer several advantages. The potential advantages of these systems may include accuracy in gap balancing, component positioning, minimal bone resection, reduced soft tissue handling and trauma, patient anatomy specific resection, and real time feedback. They, however, come with their own downsides in terms of capital cost, learning curve, time consumption and unclear advantages in term of long-term clinical outcomes.ConclusionTo conclude, this review article offers a balanced view on how the technology is impacting current arthroplasty practice and what can be expected in coming years. The commitment of almost all major implant manufacturers in investing in robotics likely means that the evolution of Robotic technology and this decade will be exciting with rapid strides revealing paradigm shift and evolution of technology with significant reductions of cost enabling it to be available universally. For technology to populate in operating room, I think it will be result of exposure of young surgeons to these computers and robotics, as they grow in with confidence with technology from residency days to offer better precision in future."
pub.1168194847,Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Reduces Radiographic Outliers for Low-volume Total Knee Arthroplasty Surgeons,"Background: Most studies evaluating robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA TKA) analyzed the advantages offered to high-volume surgeons. This study aims to determine if RA TKA improves radiographic or clinical outcomes for low-volume, non-arthroplasty-trained surgeons.
Methods: Radiographic and early clinical outcomes of 19 RA TKAs and 41 conventional TKAs, all performed by a single, non-arthroplasty-trained orthopaedic surgeon, were compared. Radiographic outliers were based on surgeon targets and defined as tibial posterior slope outside of 0°-5°, tibial tray varus outside of 0°-3°, and the presence of notching. Clinical outcomes included inpatient narcotic usage, length of stay, range of motion, and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System scores.
Results: There was a significant decrease in tibial slope outliers (RA TKA 0% vs non-RA TKA 22%, <i>P</i> = .024) and notching incidence (RA TKA 0% vs non-RA TKA 19.5%, <i>P</i> = .044) in the RA group. Tibial tray varus/valgus outliers trended lower in the RA TKA group (10.0% vs 26.8%, <i>P</i> = .189). Length of stay was significantly shorter in RA patients (48.0 hours [standard deviation: 25.5] vs 67.7 hours [34.3], <i>P</i> = .038). RA patients trended toward lower in postoperative inpatient total mean morphine equivalents usage (79.9 [89.2] vs 140.1 [169.3], <i>P</i> = .142) and inpatient mean morphine equivalents usage per day (30.36 [26.9] vs 45.6 [36.7], <i>P</i> = .105). There was no significant difference in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System scores or range of motion at first and second postoperative follow-up within 3 months.
Conclusions: RA TKA reduced the incidence of radiographic outliers when compared to conventional TKA for a low-volume arthroplasty surgeon."
pub.1146805129,"Are there functional biomechanical differences in robotic arm-assisted bi-unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared with conventional total knee arthroplasty? A prospective, randomized controlled trial.","AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare any differences in the primary outcome (biphasic flexion knee moment during gait) of robotic arm-assisted bi-unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (bi-UKA) with conventional mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at one year post-surgery.
METHODS: A total of 76 patients (34 bi-UKA and 42 TKA patients) were analyzed in a prospective, single-centre, randomized controlled trial. Flat ground shod gait analysis was performed preoperatively and one year postoperatively. Knee flexion moment was calculated from motion capture markers and force plates. The same setup determined proprioception outcomes during a joint position sense test and one-leg standing. Surgery allocation, surgeon, and secondary outcomes were analyzed for prediction of the primary outcome from a binary regression model.
RESULTS: Both interventions were shown to be effective treatment options, with no significant differences shown between interventions for the primary outcome of this study (18/35 (51.4%) biphasic TKA patients vs 20/31 (64.5%) biphasic bi-UKA patients; p = 0.558). All outcomes were compared to an age-matched, healthy cohort that outperformed both groups, indicating residual deficits exists following surgery. Logistic regression analysis of primary outcome with secondary outcomes indicated that the most significant predictor of postoperative biphasic knee moments was preoperative knee moment profile and trochlear degradation (Outerbridge) (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.381; p = 0.002, p = 0.046). A separate regression of alignment against primary outcome indicated significant bi-UKA femoral and tibial axial alignment (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.352; p = 0.029), and TKA femoral sagittal alignment (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.252; p = 0.016). The bi-UKA group showed a significant increased ability in the proprioceptive joint position test, but no difference was found in more dynamic testing of proprioception.
CONCLUSION: Robotic arm-assisted bi-UKA demonstrated equivalence to TKA in achieving a biphasic gait pattern after surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee. Both treatments are successful at improving gait, but both leave the patients with a functional limitation that is not present in healthy age-matched controls.

pub.1170674616,Bi-cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty is here to stay: A consecutive series transitioning from manual instrumentation to enabling technologies,"BACKGROUND: Bicruciate-retaining (BCR) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has seen renewed interest due to the potential for more natural knee kinematics with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) retention.
OBJECTIVE: The present study attempts to determine differences in the 2-year survivorship and patient-reported outcomes between two surgical strategies (traditional instrumentation versus robotics) applied to the extensive use of a modern, 2nd generation BCR TKA design.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with prospectively collected data of 113 patients who underwent primary TKA between 2018 and 2020 using a 2nd generation BCR TKA implant. Patient demographics, PROMS, and intra/post-operative complications were collected. Patients were also evaluated according to the use or not of robotics. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate revision-free survival at follow up.
RESULTS: 102 patients were enrolled: 90 received traditional surgery and 12 robotic-assisted surgery. The mean age was 68 years (SD 7.76) with an average BMI of 29.6 kg/m2 (SD 3.56). The mean follow up (FU) was 32.4 ± 6.2 months (range 24-45 months). Survivorship at 2 years was 98% (95% CI: 92.4-99.5). Revisions/reoperations were performed for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear (1/4), pain (1/4), arthrofibrosis (1/4) and acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) (1/4). At final FU, 92 patients (90.2%) considered themselves satisfied, showing a mean OKS of 40.6 (SD 5.1) and a mean FKS of 76.7 (SD 11.8). No differences in the outcome were found between traditional and robotic-assisted procedures.
CONCLUSION: The modern BCR design evaluated in this study achieved excellent results in terms of implant survivorship, low rate of reoperation and clinical results, independently from the use of enabling technologies."
pub.1169244087,High three‐dimensional accuracy of component placement and lower limb alignment using a robotic arm‐assisted system and gap‐balancing instrument in total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: It was hypothesized that robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) using additionally a gap-balancing instrumentation will show high accuracy in executing the planning in femoral and tibial component placement throughout the range of knee motion (ROM) during TKA surgery.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data were analysed for patients undergoing RA-TKA. A cruciate retaining cemented design was implanted using the MAKO® robotic system. Lower limb alignment at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° of flexion was recorded at the beginning of surgery and finally after implantation of the components. A ligament tensioner was inserted after tibial precut to measure the extension and flexion gap, and final component placement was planned based on 3D CT images. Femoral and tibial component placement was measured in all three planes.
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were included (mean age 69.4 ± 9 years; 44 male, 60 female). The difference in component placement after planning and final implantation showed less valgus of 0.7° ± 1.4° (p < 0.001), less external rotation of 0.6° ± 1.9° (p = 0.001) and less flexion of 0.9° ± 1.8° (p < 0.001) for the femoral component. The tibial component was placed in more varus of 0.2° ± 0.9° (p = 0.056) and more posterior slope of 0.5° ± 0.9° (p < 0.001). The lower limb alignment in extension was 4.4° ± 5.2° of varus of the native knee and changed to 1.2° ± 1.9° of varus after TKA (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted TKA helps to achieve the target of alignment and component placement very close to the planning. It allows optimal component placement of off-the-shelf implants respecting patient's specific anatomy.

pub.1154600477,"Leveraging large, real‐world data through machine‐learning to increase efficiency in robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty","PURPOSE: Increased operative time can be due to patient, surgeon and surgical factors, and may be predicted by machine learning (ML) modeling to potentially improve staff utilization and operating room efficiency. The purposes of our study were to: (1) determine how demographic, surgeon, and surgical factors affected operative times, and (2) train a ML model to estimate operative time for robotic-assisted primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: A retrospective study from 2007 to 2020 was conducted including 300,000 unilateral primary TKA cases. Demographic and surgical variables were evaluated using Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis tests to determine significant factors of operative time as predictors in the ML models. For the ML analysis of robotic-assisted TKAs (&gt; 18,000), two algorithms were used to learn the relationship between selected predictors and operative time. Predictive model performance was subsequently assessed on a test data set comparing predicted and actual operative time. Root mean square error (RMSE), R<sup>2</sup> and percentage of predictions with an error &lt; 5/10/15 min were computed.
RESULTS: Males, BMI &gt; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and cemented implants were associated with increased operative time, while age &gt; 65yo, cementless, and high surgeon case volume had reduced operative time. Robotic-assisted TKA increased operative time for low-volume surgeons and decreased operative time for high-volume surgeons. Both ML models provided more accurate operative time predictions than standard time estimates based on surgeon historical averages.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that greater surgeon case volume, cementless fixation, manual TKA, female, older and non-obese patients reduced operative time. ML prediction of operative time can be more accurate than historical averages, which may lead to optimized operating room utilization.

pub.1163225921,Does Computer Navigation or Robotic Assistance Affect the Risk of Periprosthetic Joint Infection in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty? A Propensity Score-Matched Cohort Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The use of technology during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been associated with more accurate component position and less blood loss. Yet to date, the risk of developing prosthetic joint infection (PJI) associated with computer navigation (CN) or robotic assistance (RA) has not been thoroughly evaluated. This study used propensity score-matching (PSM) in a large cohort of primary TKA patients to compare the rate of PJI following conventional TKA (TKA) versus CN-TKA and RA-TKA.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 13,015 knees in 11,727 patients who underwent primary TKA at a single institution from 2018 to 2021. The cohort was stratified into TKA, CN-TKA, and RA-TKA groups. 1:1 PSM was applied to 11,834 patients. Propensity score-matching was performed using logistic regression accounting for age, sex, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, CCI components, and smoking status. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate differences in surgical time and PJI rate.
RESULTS: Significantly longer median operating times were noted in the RA-TKA group (14 minutes) compared to TKA (P < .001). The PJI rates among matched cohorts were similar among RA-TKA (0.3%), CN-TKA (0.3%), and conventional TKA (0.5%). Multivariable logistic regressions demonstrated that the use of robotic assistance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.5, P = .423) or computer navigation (OR = 0.61, P = .128) was not associated with increased risk of PJI when compared to conventional TKA.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of computer navigation and robotic assistance during primary TKA are associated with longer surgical times, but no difference in PJI frequency within 90 days of surgery."

pub.1167129557,Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Technology Provides a Repeatable and Reproducible Method of Assessing Soft Tissue Balance,"Soft-tissue balancing is an important factor in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), with 30 to 50% of TKA revisions attributed to technical operative factors including soft-tissue balancing. Robotic-assisted TKA (RATKA) offers opportunities for improved soft-tissue balancing methods. This study aimed to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of ligamentous laxity assessments during RATKA using a digital tensioner.Three experienced RATKA surgeons assessed preresection and trialing phases of 12 human cadaveric knees with varying degrees of arthritis. Ligamentous laxity was assessed with manual varus and valgus stresses in extension and flexion, with a digital tensioner providing feedback on the change of laxity displacement. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analyses were used to determine the repeatability within a single surgeon and reproducibility between the three surgeons.The results showed excellent repeatability and reproducibility in ligamentous laxity assessment during RATKA. Surgeons had excellent repeatability for preresection and trialing assessments, with median ICC values representing excellent reproducibility between surgeons. Surgeons were repeatable within 1 or 1.5 mm for preresection and trialing assessments. On average, the variation within a surgeon was 0.33 ± 0.26 mm during preresection and 0.29 ± 0.28 mm during trialing. When comparing surgeons to each other, they were reproducible within an average of 0.69 ± 0.33 mm for preresection and 0.65 ± 0.31 mm for trialing.This study demonstrated the reliability of robotic-assisted soft-tissue balancing techniques, providing control over ligamentous laxity assessments, and potentially leading to better patient outcomes. The digital tensioner used in this study provided excellent repeatability and reproducibility in ligamentous laxity assessment during RATKA, highlighting the potential benefits of incorporating robotics in TKA procedures."
pub.1173172471,A multicentre prospective assessment of the utility of robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty with virtual range of motion on intraoperative implant positioning,"BACKGROUND: The growing adoption of robotic-assistance during total hip arthroplasty (THA) has provided novel means through which a patient's anatomy and dynamic spinopelvic relationship can be incorporated into surgical planning. However, the impact of enhanced technologies on intraoperative decision-making and changes to component positioning has not yet been described.
METHODS: A multicentre, prospective study included 105 patients (52% women) patients who underwent robotic-assisted THA with the integration of software that incorporates a patient's pelvic tilt (PT) and virtual range-of-motion (VROM) for impingement modeling. The primary outcome of the study was the percentage of patients who underwent changes to the preoperative plan for cup position after incorporating the data from the software.
RESULTS: Utilising the intraoperative VROM information, the preoperative plan for cup position was changed from the default (40° inclination and 20° anteversion) in 82/105 (78%) cases. When stratifying by spinopelvic mobility, 64% were considered normal (change ⩾ 10° and ⩽30°), 27% were stiff (change < 10°), and 9% were hypermobile (change > 30°). For all cohorts, the majority of cases (78%) deviated from the 40° inclination and 20° version target. When evaluating the proportion of cases within the Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones based on spinopelvic mobility, 19% of cases within the normal group were planned outside of both zones compared to 39% of stiff cases and 10% of hypermobile cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilising the latest version of robotic-assisted THA software, the preoperative plan for cup position was changed in the vast majority (78%) of patients, causing substantial deviations from traditional, generic cup targets."
pub.1165462342,Intraincisional Pin Placement is Safe for Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: While robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has seen a major increase in its utilization, it requires bone array pins to be fixed into the femur and tibia, which intrinsically carries a risk. As it is currently off-label with some robotic platforms to place pins intraincisional, we aimed to evaluate the safety of intraincisional pin placement during RA-TKAs.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of 2,343 patients who underwent RA-TKA at a North American Healthcare System between January 2018 and March 2022 was included. Primary outcomes included periprosthetic fracture or infection (eg, superficial or deep). Secondary outcomes included 1-year reoperation rate due to any cause. Cases were retrospectively reviewed to determine whether complications could be attributed to metaphyseal intraincisional pin placement (4.0 mm pins; two tibial and two femoral). The 90-day follow-up was 100% and the 1-year follow-up rate was 70.6% (n = 1,655).
RESULTS: The pin-site related periprosthetic fracture incidence at 90 days was 0.09% (2 out of 2,343). The 90-day infection incidence was 1.4% (superficial: 22; deep: 13). The 1-year reoperation rate was 1.8% (29 out of 1,655). The most common causes of reoperation at 1-year were deep infection (n = 14; 0.83%), superficial infection (n = 3; 0.18%), periprosthetic fracture, mechanical symptoms, instability, and hematoma (n = 2; 0.12% for each).
CONCLUSIONS: One in 1,172 patients may experience a pin-related periprosthetic fracture after RA-TKA with intraincisional bone array pin placement. There was a low 90-day infection incidence and reoperations within 1-year after RA-TKA were rare."
pub.1165570277,Accuracy and safety of a new robotic arm for both femoral and acetabular side in total hip arthroplasty: a cadaveric study,"BackgroundTo investigate the accuracy and safety of a newly constructed robotic arm which can cover the whole process of THA, we performed a series of robot-assisted total hip replacement on the cadaver.MethodsFifteen frozen cadaveric specimens (30 hips) were used for this study. In this investigation, united hip system and Longwell robotic-assisted system were used. The entire lower limb was CT scanned prior to surgery. The 3D model was produced based on CT data; the site of the prosthesis, including acetabular anteversion, inclination angle, and the position of femoral prosthesis, was planned. With the assistance of a robotic arm, the surgeon changed the parameters based on the preoperative plan and the actual condition during surgery, and completed the whole procedure. Following surgery, we measured the acetabular anteversion angle, acetabular inclination angle, femur anteversion angle, combined anteversion angle, stem angulation, and canal fill ratio.ResultsThe parameters proved that the acetabular anteversion angle was 16.85 ± 3.00°, the acetabular inclination angle was 40.38 ± 5.37°, femur anteversion angle was 15.90 ± 9.01°, combined anteversion angle was 32.75 ± 9.03°, stem angulation was 1.84 ± 0.99°, and leg length discrepancy was 2.47 ± 1.43 mm. The canal fill ratio (CFR) of femoral prosthesis of osteotomy line in sagittal section is 99.72 ± 1.54% and  in coronal section is 62.94 ± 8.91%; below osteotomy line 2.5 cm in sagittal section is 100.00% and in coronal section is 81.48 ± 12.94%; below osteotomy line 7.5 cm in sagittal section is 59.51 ± 12.94% and in coronal section is 89.79 ± 11.13%; femoral shaft isthmus in sagittal section is 56.41 ± 13.80% and in coronal section is 84.95 ± 15.17%.ConclusionThe accuracy and safety of this novel robotic arm are suitable for preparing both the acetabular and femoral sides, providing evidence for clinical trial."
pub.1155427707,Robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty via a minimally invasive anterolateral approach in the supine position improves the precision of cup placement in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the accuracy of the cup alignment angles and spatial cup positioning on computed tomography (CT) images in patients with osteoarthritis secondary to developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a minimally invasive technique via an anterolateral approach in the supine position according to whether a robotic arm-assisted system or a CT-based navigation system was used.
METHODS: We reviewed 60 robotic arm-assisted (RA)-THA cases and 174 navigation-assisted (NA)-THA cases. After propensity score matching, there were 52 hips in each group. Postoperative cup alignment angles and position were assessed by superimposition of a three-dimensional cup template onto the actual implanted cup using postoperative CT images with pelvic coordinates matching the preoperative planning.
RESULTS: The mean absolute error of the inclination angle and the anteversion angle between the preoperative planning and the postoperative measurement was significantly smaller in the RA-THA group (inclination, 1.1° ± 0.9; anteversion, 1.3° ± 1.0) than in the NA-THA group (inclination, 2.2° ± 1.5; anteversion, 3.3° ± 2.5). For acetabular cup positioning, the mean discrepancy between the preoperative planning and the postoperative measurement was 1.3 ± 1.3 mm on the transverse axis, 2.0 ± 2.0 mm on the longitudinal axis, and 1.3 ± 1.7 mm on the sagittal axis in the RA-THA group and 1.6 ± 1.4 mm, 2.6 ± 2.3 mm, and 1.8 ± 1.3 mm, respectively, in the NA-THA group. High precision of cup positioning was observed in both groups with no statistically significant difference.
CONCLUSION: Robotic arm-assisted THA using a minimally invasive technique via an anterolateral approach in the supine position allows accurate cup placement in patients with DDH."
pub.1064454920,Robotic control in knee joint replacement surgery,"A brief history of robotic systems in knee arthroplasty is provided. The place of autonomous robots is then discussed and compared to more recent 'hands-on' robotic systems that can be more cost effective. The case is made for robotic systems to have a clear justification, with improved benefits compared to those from cheaper navigation systems. A number of more recent, smaller, robot systems for knee arthroplasty are also described. A specific example is given of an active constraint medical robot, the ACROBOT system, used in a prospective randomized controlled trial of unicondylar robotic knee arthroplasty in which the robot was compared to conventional surgery. The results of the trial are presented together with a discussion of the need for measures of accuracy to be introduced so that the efficacy of the robotic surgery can be immediately identified, rather than have to wait for a number of years before long-term clinical improvements can be demonstrated."
pub.1155257126,Alignment options and robotics in total knee arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty is one of the most widely performed surgical procedures today. Its widespread popularity has helped drive innovation and improvement in the field. Different schools of thought have developed regarding the best way to perform this operation. Specifically, there are controversaries regarding the best alignment philosophy for the femoral and tibial components to optimize implant stability and longevity. Traditionally, neutral mechanical alignment has been the preferred alignment target. More recently, some surgeons advocate for alignment matching the patient's pre-arthritic anatomic alignment (""physiologic"" varus or valgus), which has been described as kinematic alignment. Functional alignment is a hybrid technique that focuses on the coronal plane minimizing soft tissue releases. To date, there is no evidence demonstrating superiority of one method over another. There is growing popularity of robotic surgical techniques to improve accuracy of implant position and alignment. The choice of alignment philosophy is an important aspect of robotic assisted TKA surgery and has the potential to clarify the optimal alignment technique."
pub.1176274006,Accuracy of robotic arm-assisted versus computed tomography-based navigation in total hip arthroplasty using the direct anterior approach: a retrospective study,"BackgroundA robotic arm-assisted and a computed tomography (CT)- based navigation system have been reported to improve the accuracy of component positioning in total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, no study has compared robotic arm-assisted THA (rTHA) to CT-based navigated THA (nTHA) concerning accuracy of cup placement and acetabular fractures using the direct anterior approach (DAA). This study aimed to compare the accuracy of cup placement and the presence of intraoperative acetabular fractures between rTHA and nTHA using DAA in the supine position.MethodsWe retrospectively investigated 209 hips of 188 patients who underwent rTHA or nTHA using DAA (rTHA using the Mako system: 85 hips of 79 patients; nTHA: 124 hips of 109 patients). After propensity score matching for age and sex, each group consisted of 73 hips. We evaluated clinical and radiographic outcomes, comparing postoperative cup orientation and position, measured using a three-dimensional templating software, to preoperative CT planning. Additionally, we investigated the prevalence of occult acetabular fracture.ResultsClinical outcomes were not significantly different between the groups at 1 year postoperatively. The mean absolute error of cup orientation was significantly smaller in the rTHA group than in nTHA (inclination: 1.4° ± 1.2° vs. 2.7° ± 2.2°, respectively; p = 0.0001, anteversion: 1.5° ± 1.3° vs. 2.2° ± 1.7°, respectively; p = 0.007). The cases within an absolute error of 5 degrees in both RI and RA were significantly higher in the rTHA (97.3%) than in nTHA group (82.2%) (p = 0.003). The absolute error of the cup position was not significantly different between the two groups. The prevalence of occult acetabular fracture did not differ significantly between the two groups (rTHA: n = 0 [0%] vs. nTHA: n = 1 [1.4%]).ConclusionCup placement using DAA in the supine position in rTHA was more accurate with fewer outliers compared to nTHA. Therefore, rTHA performed via DAA in a supine position would be useful for accurate cup placement."
pub.1160760511,Early Postoperative Results in Robotic-Arm-Assisted Total Knee Replacement versus Conventional Technique: First Latin American Experience,"Early results with robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are encouraging; nevertheless, literature might be unrepresentative, as it comes mostly from American, European, and Asian countries. There is limited experience and no comparative clinical reports in Latin America, a region of mainly low- and middle-income countries with limited access to these promising technologies. This study aims to compare the early postoperative results of the first Latin American experience with robotic-arm-assisted TKA versus conventional TKA. A cohort study was performed, including 181 consecutive patients (195 knees) with advanced symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing primary TKA between March 2016 and October 2019. The cohort included 111 consecutive patients (123 knees) undergoing conventional TKA, followed by 70 consecutive patients (72 knees) undergoing robotic-arm-assisted TKA. The same surgical team (surgeon 1 and surgeon 2) performed all procedures. Patients with previous osteotomy, posttraumatic OA, and revision components were not considered. The same anesthetic and rehabilitation protocol was followed. The investigated clinical outcomes (for the first 60 postoperative days) were: surgical tourniquet time, time to home discharge, time to ambulation, postoperative daily pain (Visual Analog Scale), opioid use, range of motion, blood loss, complications, and postoperative mechanical axis. The early clinical postoperative results of this first Latin American comparative experience of robotic-arm-assisted TKA versus conventional technique showed lower opioids requirements and faster functional recovery of ambulation in those patients operated with the robotic system; nevertheless, surgical times were higher, without differences in total postoperative complications and other clinical outcomes."
pub.1170811046,Robotic-arm assisted versus manual total knee arthroplasty: Functional gait analysis from a randomised controlled trial,"The primary aim of this study was to assess whether measures of functional gait assessment were improved with robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) when compared to manual TKA (mTKA). Gait analysis was performed as part of a randomised controlled trial. Walking and relaxed standing assessments were performed using an instrumented mat system. Spatiotemporal variables included gait cycle parameters, anteroposterior and lateral sway, and plantar pressure ratios. Measurements were recorded at pre-operative baseline and 12 months post-operatively. 100 patients were randomised, 50 to each group. Complete gait cycle data were available for 26 rTKA and 23 mTKA patients. Cadence and walking velocity showed overall improvements following surgery, with no difference between the two groups. In the operated limb, overall step and stride times decreased, while step and stride lengths increased. Subgroup analysis showed reduced propulsion time with rTKA, and decreased foot flat and mid stance times with mTKA. Lateral sway was decreased in the rTKA group. Plantar pressure ratios showed an overall increase in hindfoot loading on the operated limb, with no difference between the two groups. No other significant differences were identified between rTKA and mTKA at 12 months, and limitations may include statistical error. A small sample of the study cohort was followed up; analysis may represent the results of satisfied patients with well-functioning TKA. Further study could incorporate proprioceptive and 3D gait analysis techniques to analyse knee kinetics and kinematics with robotic surgery. Pressure mapping could further subdivide the plantar surfaces to explore any nuances in differential loading."
pub.1149470023,Enhanced Mid-Resection Workflow Technique for Severe Varus Deformity Correction Using Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic technology in total knee arthroplasty has been proven to improve accuracy of component positioning, achieve alignment targets, and balance the knee objectively. However, the utility of robotics in correction of severe varus deformities of the knee has not been investigated in detail. The aim of this paper was to establish the utility and describe the technique of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) in achieving pre-balance in severe varus deformities of the knee.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among the existing Mako (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan) RA-TKA workflows, pre-resection workflow is limited to knees which can be pre-balanced by component positioning according to functional alignment. Mid-resection workflow (distal femur/tibia first) is reserved for complex cases, whereby the extension gap is balanced first. In our experience, both workflows could not achieve pre-balance in severe varus deformities, necessitating the need to develop a novel technique. The ability of the robot to execute precise bone cuts allows for a provisional postero-medial femoral bone cut in flexion, giving access to remove large inaccessible posterior osteophytes and the tight posterior capsule, thus balancing the knee in extension. The flexion gap is subsequently matched to the extension gap by alterations in axial component positioning.
CONCLUSION: This novel ""enhanced mid-resection workflow"" technique establishes the utility of the RA-TKA in balancing severe varus deformities of the knee. We also propose an algorithm which simplifies and helps surgeons choose between the three workflows to pre-balance knees irrespective of the severity of the varus deformity."
pub.1154256270,Comparative assessment of current robotic-assisted systems in primary total knee arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has proven higher accuracy, fewer alignment outliers, and improved short-term clinical outcomes when compared to conventional TKA. However, evidence of cost-effectiveness and individual superiority of one system over another is the subject of further research. Despite its growing adoption rate, published results are still limited and comparative studies are scarce. This review compares characteristics and performance of five currently available systems, focusing on the information and feedback each system provides to the surgeon, what the systems allow the surgeon to modify during the operation, and how each system then aids execution of the surgical plan.Cite this article: <i>Bone Jt Open</i> 2023;4(1):13-18."

pub.1100939340,Increased precision of coronal plane outcomes in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Inaccuracy of component alignment in total knee arthroplasty adversely impacts outcomes. Robotic systems improve translation of pre-operative planning to intra-operative steps, theoretically resulting in greater accuracy and precision. In this study we systematically review literature data of alignment outcomes and apply meta-analysis methods to assess whether robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty provides superior outcomes when compared to conventional knee prostheses.
METHODS: A PRISMA compliant search comparing alignment outcomes in robotic vs conventional knee arthroplasty was performed. Primary outcome measures were; number of three degree outliers and mean deviation from a neutral post-operative mechanical axis.
RESULTS: In total, from five studies reporting upon 402 knees, a post-operative mechanical axis malalignment of >3° occurred in 1/181 (0.006%) of robotic knees, and 42/159 (26.4%) of conventional knees with a meta-analysis odds ratio of 0.04 (95% CI 0.01-0.14), p < 0.00001 favouring robotic-assisted instrumentation. Meta-analysis also demonstrated weighted mean differences of post-operative mechanical axis alignment to be significantly more accurate in the robotic knee group: mean difference -0.63 (95% CI: -1.18,-0.08), z = 2.25, p = 0.02. Sensitivity analysis with inclusion of only Level 1 studies showed similar findings.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates clear evidence of increased accuracy of alignment in robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty with specific regard to reconstituting a neutral mechanical axis and minimising number of outliers in the coronal plane. Further studies and long term data is required in order to conclude on survivorship and functional outcomes."
pub.1175817436,Early implementation of MAK robotic device in total knee arthroplasty rehabilitation: A proof‐of‐concept study,"BACKGROUND: Effective rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial for enhancing both range of motion (ROM) and functional outcomes. While robotics has demonstrated its potential in various medical contexts, the evidence on its application in TKA rehabilitation is still scarce. The marsi active knee (MAK), a robotic device that has already proven to be safe and beneficial in people with neurological disease, has been tested to facilitate the rehabilitation of TKA patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the safety, patient satisfaction, and clinical impact of integrating the MAK into an early rehabilitation regimen for TKA patients.
METHODS: The intervention comprised 14 one-hour sessions administered thrice a week, utilizing the MAK within 48 h post-TKA surgery. The rehabilitation sessions incorporated exercises involving passive mobilizations, sit-to-stand transitions, and gait training. Comprehensive data encompassing safety parameters, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes were meticulously collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Six participants successfully completed the rehabilitation protocol with the MAK device. Notably, no significant adverse events were documented. Application of the device corresponded to perceptible reductions in self-reported pain levels. Vital signs remained within minimal variance pre- and post-rehabilitation. Participants proficiently engaged in all assisted exercises facilitated by the device, culminating in a high overall satisfaction rating of 4.6 ± 0.5 out of 5.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the MAK device exhibits a commendable level of safety while obtaining considerable patient satisfaction during the early rehabilitation phase following TKA, suggesting this device may be a reliable adjunct to TKA protocols."

Although multiple treatment options are available for addressing these lesions, uncertainty persists regarding the optimal approach.
Case Report: A 58-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented with several years of left knee pain. Evaluation showed severe left knee degenerative osteoarthritis complicated by the presence of a large lateral femoral condyle cyst. After failing conservative management, a robotic-assisted cementless cruciate-retaining TKA was indicated. The large bone cyst was managed with augmentation using synthetic bone grafting. 1 year postoperatively, he showed excellent clinical outcomes and radiographic evidence of osteointegration.
Conclusion: This case highlights the value of robotic-assisted technology to plan and execute bone grafting of a large femoral cystic lesion while performing TKA with primary components. A computed tomography-imaged robotic TKA offers the potential benefit of screening bone cysts and thus planning a surgical approach in which bone preservation can be maximized."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the rotational positioning of the femoral TKA implant using the ROSA Knee® robotic system. The hypothesis was that the accuracy of the rotation obtained by the ROSA Knee® robotic arm was comparable to that obtained by navigation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective comparative consecutive study involving 140 patients receiving first-line TKA, divided into two equal groups: Navigation, and Robot. Distal epiphyseal torsion of the femur (DETF) was analyzed by comparing preoperative (native DETF) and postoperative (prosthetic DETF) CT scans between groups.
RESULTS: The mean prosthetic DETF was 2.3° ± 1.3 for the Navigation group and 2.3° ± 1.4 for the Robot group (p = 0.96), with no significant difference in deviation from DETF target (p=0.07). Assuming ± 2° range of error, the Navigation group showed 88.6% and the Robot group 90% accuracy (p = 0.79).
CONCLUSION: The Rosa Knee® robotic system provided accuracy equivalent to navigation for rotational positioning of the femoral implant.

pub.1173844909,Why robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty aborted: Chinese experience of four hundred and twenty nine consecutive cases,"PurposeRobot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) helps with precise orientation of the prosthesis, but some RA-THA procedures are aborted intraoperatively and are converted to manual total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study aimed to analyse why RA-THA is sometimes aborted intraoperatively and to make recommendations accordingly.MethodsA total of 429 consecutive Mako THA cases in our prospective database from August 2018 to June 2021 were included in our study. All robotic procedures aborted intraoperatively for any reason were recorded. The patients’ demographics, diagnoses, and surgeons’ information were included in the statistical analysis to pinpoint the risk factors for intraoperative robot to manual conversion.ResultsIntraoperative RA-THA abortions occurred in 17 cases (3.96%) and the patients had to be converted to manual THA. The adverse events leading to intraoperative abortions included pelvic array loosening or malposition (5, 1.17%), inaccurate bone mapping or construction (6, 1.40%), inaccurate initial registration (4, 0.93%), and other reasons (2, 0.47%).ConclusionRobot-related adverse events could be found in all perioperative steps of RA-THA, and some of these events might result in intraoperative abortion. Complex hip disease was a statistically significant factor for an increased risk of intraoperative abortion of RA-THA. Standardized surgical procedures and preoperative assessments can be helpful in reducing the rate of RA-THA abortions."
pub.1152157749,The Cost Effectiveness of Unicompartmental versus Total Knee Arthroplasty,"This study examines the potential cost savings for the health system and the community in a broadly accessible model through the increased utilization of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) using robotic arm-assisted UKA (raUKA) versus conventional total knee arthroplasty (cTKA). We retrospectively reviewed 240 patients where the first 120 consecutive raUKA performed during this period were matched to 120 cTKAs. Clinical data from the medical records and costs for procedure for each component were collected. Bivariate analyses were performed on the data to determine if there were statistically significant differences by surgery type in clinical outcomes and financial costs. There was a significantly lower cost incurred for raUKA versus cTKA with an average saving of AU$7,179 per case. The operating time (86.0 vs. 75.9 minutes; <i>p</i> = 0.004) was significantly higher for raUKA, but the length of stay was significantly lower (1.8 vs. 4.8 days; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was a significant difference in the use of opioids between raUKA and cTKA (125.0 morphine equivalent [ME] vs. 522.1 ME, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). This study demonstrated that the use of raUKA rather than cTKA in suitably indicated patients may realize significant cost savings."
pub.1136875101,The current state of robotics in total knee arthroplasty,"Robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has demonstrated improved component positioning and a reduction of alignment outliers with regard to pre-operative planning.Early robotic TKA technologies were mainly active systems associated with significant technical and surgical complications.Current robotic TKA systems are predominantly semi-active with additional haptic feedback which minimizes iatrogenic soft tissue injury compared to conventional arthroplasty and older systems.Semi-active systems demonstrate advantages in terms of early functional recovery and hospital discharge compared to conventional arthroplasty.Limitations with current robotic technology include high upfront costs, learning curves and lack of long-term outcomes.The short-term gains and greater technical reliability associated with current systems may justify the ongoing investment in robotic technology.Further long-term data are required to fully ascertain the cost-effectiveness of newer robotic systems.

pub.1170340659,Accuracy of Femoral Component External Rotation with all Burr Robotic Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Introduction: External rotation of femoral component is controversial in Total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of our study is to assess the precision of femoral component external rotation in Robotic Assisted All Burr TKA.
Materials and methods: This is a prospective study of 30 cases who underwent All Burr Robotic Assisted TKA at our institute, RNH hospital. Inclusion criteria were primary and secondary osteoarthritis of the knee and exclusion criteria were revision and partial knee replacement. On Navio robotic system femoral external rotation was planned as per medio-lateral flexion gap balancing and executed with burr. Post-operative CT scan was done in all patients to assess intra-operative planned femoral external rotation.
Results: Out of 30 cases, 20 were female and 10 were male. Mean age was 66.06±7.43 years. On Navio the planned external rotation of femoral component was 2.86±1.16. Average of femoral component external rotation on postoperative CT scan was 3.11±1.16. The mean deviation of achieved femoral component external rotation from planned external rotation was -0.24 to ±0.28. Only 37% patients required 3° external rotation. Correlation between planned and achieved femoral component external rotation was significant, positive and very strong as indicated by r=0.97 and p=0.0001.
Conclusion: All Burr Robotic Assisted TKA provides near accurate femoral component external rotation as planned on Navio with deviation of less than 0.3° between planned and achieved external rotation."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients in the Premier billing Healthcare Database undergoing elective rTKA or mTKA (""index') in the in- or outpatient setting for knee osteoarthritis between Oct 1<sup>st</sup>, 2015, to September 30th, 2021, were identified. Variables included patient demographics and comorbidities and hospital characteristics. Matched rTKA vs. mTKA cohorts were created using direct (on provider characteristics, age, gender, race and Elixhauser index) and propensity score matching (fixation type, comorbidities). Index and 90-day inflation-adjusted costs and healthcare utilization (HCU) were analyzed for both cohorts, using generalized linear models.
RESULTS: 16,714 rTKA patients were matched to 51,199 mTKA patients. Average 90-day hospital cost reached $17,932 and were equivalent for both cohorts (rTKA vs. mTKA: $132 (95% confidence interval; -$19 to $284). There was a 2.7% (95%CI: 2.2%-3.3%) increase in home or home health discharge, and a 0.4% (95%CI: 0%-0.8%) decrease in 90-day hospital knee related re-visit in the rTKA vs. mTKA group.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-neutrality of rTKA vs. mTKA was observed, with a potential for lowered immediate post-operative HCU in the rTKA vs. mTKA cohorts."
pub.1018358347,Tibial baseplate positioning in robotic-assisted and conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Abstract
This study compared tibial baseplate alignment (TBA) between robotic-arm-assisted (RAA) and conventional (CONV) unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKAs). We hypothesized that RAA would increase the percentage of implants within a predetermined safe zone (SZ). We identified 177 CONV and 87 RAA UKAs through our center’s patient registry. Two individuals reviewed postoperative knee radiographs and determined TBA. Coronal baseplate positioning was more accurate (i.e., within the SZ) for RAA (2.6° ± 1.5° vs. 3.9° ± 2.4°, p < 0. 0001). Conversely, sagittal alignment was more accurate for CONV (4.9° ± 2.8° vs. 2.4° ± 1.6°, p < 0.0001). RAA was more precise in both planes (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in the percentage of implants within the SZ between the two groups (p = 1.0)."
pub.1077881456,Modular bicompartmental knee arthroplasty with robotic arm assistance.,"Modular bicompartmental arthroplasty is an emerging knee-resurfacing approach that provides a conservative alternative to total knee arthroplasty. Isolated bicompartmental arthritis involving the medial or lateral and patellofemoral compartments, but with no significant deformity or bone deficiency, preserved motion, and intact cruciate ligaments, can be effectively managed with this treatment method. For the many young and active patients with isolated bicompartmental arthritis, given the potential durability of the procedure and the prosthesis, it is appropriate to use an approach that is more conservative than total knee arthroplasty. Robotic arm assistance for modular bicompartmental arthroplasty optimizes component position and alignment, which may improve system performance and long-term durability. In addition, a percentage of patients who undergo isolated unicompartmental or patellofemoral arthroplasty may later develop progressive arthritis in an unresurfaced compartment. Their cases may be effectively managed with a staged modular approach to resurfacing the degenerating compartment, but additional study is needed."
pub.1144366742,Robotic‐arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty system has a learning curve of 11 cases and increased operating time,"PURPOSE: UKA has higher revision risk, particularly for lower volume surgeons. While robotic-arm assisted systems allow for increased accuracy, introduction of new systems has been associated with learning curves. The aim of this study was to determine the learning curve of a UKA robotic-arm assisted system. The hypothesis was that this may affect operative times, patient outcomes, limb alignment, and component placement.
METHODS: Between 2017 and 2021, five surgeons performed 152 consecutive robotic-arm assisted primary medial UKA, and measurements of interest were recorded. Patient outcomes were measured with Oxford Knee Score, EuroQol-5D, and Forgotten Joint Score at 6 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years. Surgeons were grouped into 'low' and 'high' usage groups based on total UKA (manual and robotic) performed per year.
RESULTS: A learning curve of 11 cases was found with operative time (p < 0.01), femoral rotation (p = 0.02), and insert sizing (p = 0.03), which highlighted areas that require care during the learning phase. Despite decreased 6-week EQ-5D-5L VAS in the proficiency group (77 cf. 85, p < 0.01), no difference was found with implant survival (98.2%) between phases (p = 0.15), or between 'high' and 'low' usage surgeons (p = 0.23) at 36 months. This suggested that the learning curve did not lead to early adverse effects in this patient cohort.
CONCLUSION: Introduction of a UKA robotic-arm assisted system showed learning curves for operative times and insert sizing but not for implant survival at early follow-up. The short learning curve regardless of UKA usage indicated that robotic-arm assisted UKA may be particularly useful for low-usage surgeons.

pub.1163880144,Surgical accuracy of image‐free versus image‐based robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the accuracy in achieving proper lower limb alignment and component positions after total knee replacement (TKR) with image-free and image-based robotic-assisted TKR.
METHODS: A total of 129 patients (166 knees) suffering from end-stage knee arthritis who underwent TKA operated by robotic-assisted surgery between the years 2018 and mid-2021 were recruited. Radiological outcomes were compared between image-free and image-based robotic-assisted surgical systems.
RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two robotic systems when comparing the mean planned component alignment and the mean measured alignment on radiographs, in which the image-free robotic-assisted system was more varus, whereas the image-based robotic-assisted system was more valgus for both the mean femoral and tibial component coronal alignment (p < 0.001). For tibial component sagittal alignment, the image-based group had a larger deviation from the planned posterior slope (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Image-free and image-based robotic assisted TKR had differing accuracy in femoral and tibial alignment."
pub.1132036214,The Impact of Author Financial Conflicts on Robotic-Assisted Joint Arthroplasty Research,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested clinical superiority with robotic-assisted arthroplasty compared to traditional techniques. However, concerns exist regarding the author's financial conflicts of interest (COI), which may influence research outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether COI relating to robotic-assisted arthroplasty influences the results of published outcomes following total hip (THA), total knee (TKA), and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA).
METHODS: We performed a systematic review to identify all studies evaluating the use of robotics in THA, TKA, and UKA. An author's financial COI was identified if they reported a relevant disclosure through the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons or within the study article. We then queried the Open Payments website to record all payments made from a robotic company in the year prior to publication. Each study was categorized as either favoring robotics (n = 42), neutral (n = 10), or favoring traditional techniques (n = 2). We then compared the number of conflicted authors, journal impact factor, level of evidence, and mean annual industry payment to each author.
RESULTS: Of the 54 studies meeting inclusion criteria, 49 (91%) had an author financial COI. Conflicted studies were more likely to report favorable results of robotics than nonconflicted studies. When compared to studies favoring conventional techniques, those demonstrating favorable robotics outcomes had a higher number of conflicted authors and a higher mean industry payment per author. There was no difference in the level of evidence or journal impact factor.
DISCUSSION: Nearly all studies comparing robotic THA, TKA, and UKA to conventional techniques involve financially conflicted authors. Further studies without COI may provide unbiased results."
pub.1110028142,Robotic versus conventional primary total knee arthroplasty: clinical and radiological long-term results with a minimum follow-up of ten years,"PurposeThe aim of this study was (1) to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of robotic and conventional total knee arthroplasty with a minimum follow-up of ten years, (2) to evaluate the survival rate, (3) and to estimate the accuracy of the two techniques by analyzing the outliers of the total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients.MethodsWe evaluated 351 patients (390 knees), 155 patients undergoing robotic TKA, and 196 patients treated with conventional TKA with a mean follow-up of 11.0 years. HSS, KSS, WOMAC, and SF-12 questionnaires were used for clinical evaluation. Mechanical alignment, implant radiological measurements, and outliers were analyzed for radiological results. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for survival rate.ResultsAll clinical assessments showed excellent improvements in both groups (all p < 0.05), without any significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). The conventional TKA group showed a significantly higher number of outliers compared with the robotic TKA group (0 < 0.05). The cumulative survival rate was 98.8% in the robotic TKA group and 98.5% in the conventional TKA group with excellent survival (p = 0.563).ConclusionOur study showed excellent survival with both robotic and conventional TKA and similar clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up. And, in terms of radiological outcome, robotic TKA showed better accuracy and consistency with fewer outliers compared with conventional TKA. With longer follow-up and larger cohort, the accuracy and effectiveness of robotic TKA on implant survival rate can be elucidated in the future."
pub.1164823725,Robotic Versus Conventional Unicompartmental Knee Surgery: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Robotic-assisted surgery is a computer-controlled technique that may improve the accuracy and outcomes of unicompartmental total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a partial knee replacement surgery. The purpose of a meta-analysis about robotic-assisted versus conventional surgery for unicompartmental TKA is to compare the effectiveness of these two methods based on the current evidence. Our meta-analysis can help inform clinical decisions and guidelines for surgeons and patients who are considering unicompartmental TKA as a treatment option. We searched four online databases for studies that compared the two methods until March 2023. We used RevMan software to combine the data from the studies. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome, which are statistical measures of the difference and the uncertainty between the two methods. We included 16 studies in our analysis. We found that robotic-assisted surgery had a better hip-knee-ankle angle, which is a measure of how well the knee is aligned, than conventional surgery (MD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.16-1.56). We also found that robotic-assisted surgery had a better Oxford Knee score, which is a measure of how well the knee functions, than conventional surgery (MD = 3.03, 95% CI = 0.96-5.110). This study compared the results of conventional and robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in 12 studies. We concluded that robotic-assisted surgery may have some benefits over conventional surgery in terms of alignment and function of the knee. However, we did not find any significant difference between the two methods in terms of other outcomes, such as pain, range of motion, health status, and joint awareness. Therefore, we suggest that more research is needed to confirm these results and evaluate the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted surgery."
pub.1052869027,Lateral Robotic Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is accurate and repeatable. Lateral UKA is still considered a challenge, as the lateral side of the knee has different anatomy and kinematics compared with the medial side. The lateral compartment of the knee is less constrained than the medial compartment and is therefore less tolerant for mobile-bearing implants and ACL deficiency. However, the long-term outcomes of lateral UKA are scarce. Moreover, the impact of patellofemoral joint degeneration on the outcome of lateral UKA is unknown. We report our preliminary results with fixed bearing robotic-assisted lateral UKA, which are encouraging in the short term. "

Robotic-assisted THA is an alternative to conventional THA procedures and utilizes preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and intraoperative mapping for accurate component positioning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of robotic-assisted DA THA without fluoroscopy on surgical efficiency parameters when compared to conventional DA THA with fluoroscopy.
Methods: There were six cadaver specimens evenly distributed between two orthopaedic surgeons, both with previous experience in conventional and robotic-assisted THA. For each cadaver, conventional DA THA with fluoroscopy was performed on the first hip, and robotic-assisted DA THA without fluoroscopy was performed on the contralateral hip. Total surgical time from skin to trials, acetabular and femoral workflow time, and the number of reamers and broaches used, were recorded for all cases. There were two-sample <i>t</i>-tests performed to assess statistical differences between conventional and robotic-assisted THA data.
Results: Acetabular reaming took longer, on average, for conventional DA THA with fluoroscopy than robotic-assisted DA THA without fluoroscopy (2.4 ± 0.6 versus 0.4 ± 0.2 min; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Surgeons using conventional THA required more acetabular reamers when compared to a single reamer used with robotic-assisted THA (2.67 ± 0.5 versus 1 ± 0; <i>p</i> = 0.001). Total operative time (26.1 ± 7.0 versus 23.2 ± 5.6 min; <i>p</i> = 0.452), acetabular workflow time (6.4 ± 3.1 versus 3.3 ± 1.7 min; <i>p</i> = 0.07), femoral workflow time (6.5 ± 4.8 versus 5.0 ± 1.7 min; <i>p</i> = 0.495), and number of femoral broaches (5.0 ± 1.8 versus 4.3 ± 2.3; <i>p</i> = 0.593) were higher during conventional THA than during robotic-assisted THA.
Discussion: Amidst the changing healthcare environment and focus on identifying and implementing efficiencies, these findings have important consequences for the continued and accelerated use of robotic-assisted THA in primary settings."
pub.1053522100,Preoperative Mapping in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Using Computed Tomography Scans Is Associated with Radiation Exposure and Carries High Cost,"Robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty with some systems requires the use of computed tomography (CT) scans. The associated radiation dose has not been studied. The effective dose (ED, mSv) of radiation was calculated for 236 preoperative CT scans used for planning of robotic assisted surgery. The mean ED was 4.8±3.0 mSv. There was a 3-fold difference in ED between institutions. One or more additional CT scans were obtained in 25% of patients, amounting to a cumulative ED per patient up to 103 mSv. Preoperative CT is a disadvantage of some robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty systems due to additional cost and radiation exposure. Newer image-free robotic technologies are an alternative to CT-dependent surgery if accuracy and safety are not compromised."
pub.1170124070,Robotic-arm-assisted conversion of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty to total knee arthroplasty,"Introduction: The purpose of this study was to describe a novel robotic-arm-assisted UKA to TKA conversion technique and evaluate the patient reported and clinical outcomes in these patients.
Methods: A retrospective review between 2017 and 2022 was conducted of patients that underwent robotic-arm-assisted UKA to TKA conversion. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, indications for conversion from UKA to TKA, operative technique, implants used, postoperative complications, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The surgical technique resembles that of primary TKA, with the major exception of registering the robotic arm with retained UKA implants and removing the implants only when verification is complete. There were 44 robotic-arm-assisted UKAs in 41 patients were included in the study. Indications for UKA conversion to TKA included: 33 patients who had osteoarthritis progression (75%), 7 aseptic loosening (16%), 2 unspecified pain (4.5%), 1 polyethylene wear (2.3%), and 1 prosthetic joint infection (2.3%). Uncemented cruciate-retaining (CR) implants were used in 38 of the 44 robotic-arm-assisted TKAs (86.5%). The other six utilized cemented implants: four CR femurs (9.1%), six tibial baseplates (13.6%), four tibial stems (9.1%), and four medial tibial augments (9.1%).
Results: The PROMs significantly improved at 1-year follow-up, with the average KOOS JR score increasing from 48.1 to 68.7 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and the r-WOMAC score decreasing from 25.7 to 10.6 (<i>P</i> = 0.003). Two patients developed prosthetic joint infections (4.5%), one developed aseptic loosening of the femoral component (2.3%), and one developed a superficial surgical site infection requiring superficial irrigation and debridement (2.3%). Overall survivorship was 93.18% at 1.8 years, and aseptic survivorship was 97.73%.
Conclusion: Robotic-arm-assisted UKA to TKA conversion exhibited improved patient-reported outcomes and low revision and complication rates. Improved implant placement achieved with robotic-arm-assistance may improve the functional and clinical outcomes following these surgeries."

The aim of this paper is to summarize past and present developments foot and ankle robotics and describe outcomes associated with these interventions, with specific emphasis on the following topics: translational and preclinical utilization of robotics, deep learning and artificial intelligence modeling in foot and ankle, current applications for robotics in foot and ankle surgery, and therapeutic and orthotic-related utilizations of robotics related to the foot and ankle. Herein, we describe numerous recent robotic advancements across foot and ankle surgery, geared towards optimizing intra-operative performance, improving detection of foot and ankle pathology, understanding ankle kinematics, and rehabilitating post-surgically. Future research should work to incorporate robotics specifically into surgical procedures as other specialties within orthopaedics have done, and to further individualize machinery to patients, with the ultimate goal to improve perioperative and post-operative outcomes."
pub.1077881452,Robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: preoperative planning and surgical technique.,"The goals of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) are to be patient-specific, minimally invasive, and quantitative. CAS can involve preoperative imaging and planning, intraoperative execution, and postoperative evaluation. Ideally, these components are integrated such that sophisticated diagnostic technologies are used to inform a patient-specific surgical plan. A recently developed CAS/robotic system has the potential to improve alignment in and results of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. This new robot is ""semiactive""; that is, the surgeon retains ultimate control of the procedure while benefiting from robotic guidance within target zones and boundaries. Surgeons who use the robotic arm-assisted technique described in this article can prepare and then precisely execute a patient-specific computed-tomography-based operative plan. The surgical field is predefined, and the active constraints used by the robotic arm eliminate inadvertent deviation outside this field, thus minimizing iatrogenic morbidity and maximizing bone preservation. In this article, we detail the preoperative planning and intraoperative technique for robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty."

METHODS: 120 patients underwent primary THA at 4 different medical centres. A preoperative pelvic CT protocol was used to plan socket placement followed by robotic-arm assisted acetabular preparation and cup insertion. Intraoperative cup position was recorded and postoperative placement measured using Martell suite analysis software.
RESULTS: Using a 95% predictive intervals, robotic-arm cup placement was within +/-4 degrees of planned position in 95% of cases. Applying these data to the so-called safe zone, 96% of sockets were within the defined safe zone. Our data confirms that intraoperative robotic assistance improves the precision of preparation and position of the acetabular cup during total hip arthroplasty."
pub.1050556043,Robotic-assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"In recent years, development of computer graphics and haptic feedback technology enabled the use of virtual reality. Virtual reality provides the opportunity to combine 3D visual imagery with interactivity, visual, and tactile realism. Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery is defined as the use of computers and robotic technology to assist the orthopedist in providing musculoskeletal care, in which machine has the capability of precision and accuracy. Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery is used in simulating diagnosis, preoperative and intraoperative planning, and actual surgery. One of the main areas for computer-assisted surgical applications is unicompartmental or bicompartmental knee arthroplasty, in which the clinical efficacy is improved by providing enhanced component positioning with dynamic ligament balancing.

pub.1157454167,"Comparison of postoperative pain, anxiety, and sleep quality in robotic-assisted and manual total knee replacement surgery","This study aimed to comparatively evaluate postoperative pain, anxiety, and sleep quality in patients after robotic-assisted and manual total knee replacement surgery. Patients who underwent either robotic or manual total knee replacement (TKR) surgery were analyzed in this cross-sectional observational study. Volunteers who were conscious, mentally healthy, without primary sleep disorders, without chronic uncontrolled diseases, 18 years of age or older, able to understand verbal warnings, and who agreed to participate in the study after being informed about the purpose of the study were included in the study. A total of 80 patients who underwent robotic-assisted TKR and 87 patients who underwent manual TKR were participated in the study. Data were collected using the “Patient Description Form” Visual Analog Scale, Richards-Campbell Sleep Scale, and State Anxiety Scale. All patients were operated on by the same physicians and received standard perioperative care. In the study, a statistically significant difference was found between the education level of the patients and the type of surgery (p = 0.007). According to the average scores, it was observed that the patients in the robotic group had higher pain levels, better sleep quality, and higher anxiety levels compared to the manual group. There was a significant correlation between the level of pain felt on the 1st and 2nd day (p =  < 0.001) and state anxiety levels with gender (p = 0.010) in the robotic group. For the robotic group, pain on day 2 was mostly affected by pain on day 1 and state anxiety. For the manual group, pain on day 2 was mostly affected by pain on day 1. According to our results, patients who underwent robotic-assisted TKR had higher pain levels, better sleep quality, and higher anxiety levels than patients who underwent manual TKR."
pub.1155141923,How does the use of quantified gap-balancing affect component positioning and limb alignment in robotic total knee arthroplasty using functional alignment philosophy? A comparison of two robotic platforms,"PurposeThis study aimed to compare the effect of an image-based (MAKO) system using a gap-balancing technique with an imageless (OMNIbot) robotic tool utilising a femur-first measured resection technique.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was performed on patients undergoing primary TKA with a functional alignment philosophy performed by a single surgeon using either the MAKO or OMNIbot robotic systems. In all cases, the surgeon’s goal was to create a balanced knee and correct sagittal deformity (eliminate any fixed flexion deformity). Intra-operative data and patient-reported outcomes (PROMS) were compared.ResultsA total of 207 MAKO TKA and 298 OMNIbot TKAs were analysed. MAKO TKA patients were younger (67 vs 69, p=0.002) than OMNIbot patients. There were no other demographic or pre-operative alignment differences. Regarding implant positioning, in MAKO TKAs the femoral component was more externally rotated in relation to the posterior condylar axis (2.3° vs 0.1°, p<0.001), had less valgus femoral cuts (1.6° vs 2.7° valgus, p<0.001) and more varus tibial cuts (2.4° vs 1.9° varus, p<0.001), and had more bone resected compared to OMNIbot TKAs. OMNIbot cases were more likely to require tibial re-cuts than MAKO (15% vs 2%, p<0.001). There were no differences in femur recut rates, soft tissue releases, or rate of achieving target coronal and sagittal leg alignment between robotic systems. A subgroup analysis of 100 MAKO and 100 OMNIbot propensity-matched TKAs with 12-month follow-up showed no significant difference in OKS (42 vs 43, p=0.7) or OKS PASS scores (83% vs 91%, p=0.1). MAKO TKAs reported significantly better symptoms according to their KOOS symptoms score than patients that had OMNIbot TKAs (87 vs 82, p=0.02) with a higher proportion of KOOS PASS rates, at a slightly longer follow-up time (20 months vs 14 months, p<0.001). There were no other differences in PROMS.ConclusionA gap-balanced technique with an image-based robotic system (MAKO) results in different implant positioning and bone resection and reduces tibial recuts compared to a femur-first measured resection technique with an imageless robotic system (OMNIbot). Both systems achieve equal coronal and sagittal deformity correction and good patient outcomes at short-term follow-ups irrespective of these differences."
pub.1171533816,Robot-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty Demonstrates Improved 90-Day Clinical and Patient-Reported Outcomes,"Background: The utilization of technology, including robotics and computer navigation, in total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been steadily increasing; however, conflicting data exists regarding its effect on short-term clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Therefore, this study sought to explore the association between different surgical technologies and postoperative outcomes following THA.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 9892 primary THA cases performed by 62 surgeons from a single institution from September 2017 to November 2022. Three cohorts were created based on the utilization of technology: conventional (no technology), navigation, or robotics. Patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and patient-reported outcome measures were collected over the first 90 days following surgery. This data was compared using analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regressions. In total, 4275 conventional, 4510 navigation, and 1107 robotic cases were included in our analyses.
Results: The robotic cohort achieved a perfect Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) score earliest (0.1 days, <i>P</i> &lt; .001). After adjusting for potential confounding variables, use of robotic assistance was associated with greater odds of achieving a perfect AM-PAC score on postoperative day 0 (odds ratio 1.6, <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and greater odds of having length of stay shorter than 24 hours (odds ratio 2.3, <i>P</i> &lt; .001) compared to no technology use in THA. Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference scores showed the greatest improvement in the robotic cohort at both 6 weeks and 3 months following surgery.
Conclusions: The present study demonstrates favorable clinical and patient-reported outcomes in the first 90 days following surgery for patients undergoing robot-assisted THA compared to conventional and navigation-assisted THA."
pub.1142247786,Imageless robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA,"Background and objectiveIt is evident from the national joint registries that numbers of revision knee arthroplasty operations are rising. The aim of this article is to introduce a new robotic-assisted approach in UKA to TKA revision arthroplasty and investigate the alignment accuracy, implant component use and surgery time and to compare it to primary robotic-assisted TKA arthroplasty.MethodsThis retrospective, case-control study included patients undergoing image-less robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA (n = 20) and patients undergoing image-less robotic-assisted primary TKA (control group, n = 20) from 11/2018 to 07/2020. The control group was matched based on the BMI and natural alignment. Comparison of groups was based on postoperative alignment, outlier rate, tibial insert size, lateral bone resection depth, incision-to-wound closure time. All surgeries were performed by a single senior surgeon using the same bi-cruciate stabilizing TKA system. Statistical analysis consisted of parametric t‑testing and Fisher’s exact test with a level of significance of p < 0.05.ResultsThe two groups showed no differences in mean BMI, natural alignment (p > 0.05) and mean overall limb alignment. No outlier was found for OLA and slope analysis. The smallest insert size (9 mm) was used in 70% of the cases in the revision group (n = 14) and in 90% of the cases in the primary group (n = 18, p = 0.24), distal femoral and tibial resection depth showed no statistical difference (p > 0.05). The incision to wound closure time was longer in the revision group but showed no significant difference.ConclusionImage-less robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA showed a comparable surgery time, and alignment accuracy in comparison to primary robotic-assisted TKA. Comparable bone preservation and subsequent tibial insert size use was observed for both groups."
pub.1164623216,Using Software to Implant Orthopaedic Hardware: Surgeon Intraoperative Confidence Increased with Latest Technological Updates.,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been associated with improved accuracy and precision of implant placement, protection of soft tissue, and improved patient-reported postoperative outcomes when compared to manual TKA techniques. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of surgical confidence throughout the learning curve when adopting robotic-assisted platforms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the confidence and efficiencies of surgeons when utilizing computed tomography (CT)-based robotic TKA technology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted with 20 arthroplasty-trained surgeons with prior experience in both manual TKA and robotic-assisted TKA techniques. The surgeons completed an initial learning period, with new software, during various stages of their experience. The new TKA software upgrade builds on the prior software version with new features. A Net Promoter Score (NPS), the measurement of a respondent's likelihood to recommend a product or service to others, was used during the analysis of survey questions. A NPS over 50 indicates a positive score.
RESULTS: When compared to manual TKA techniques, 95% of surgeons reported that their overall intraoperative confidence increased with the new software upgrade for CT-based robotic technology and had an average rating of 8.9 out of 10 for their intraoperative confidence with the new software upgrade. Additionally, 100% of surgeons reported that they were more confident when performing intraoperative implant adjustments with the new software upgrade when compared to manual TKA. Surgeons determined that the overall use of the new software upgrade was intuitive (8.4 of 10 average rating) and were satisfied with the overall use of the new software upgrade (9 of 10 average rating). Also, surgeons reported that they would recommend the new software upgrade for CT-based robotic technology to colleagues (NPS of 85), as well as being used as a research tool (NPS of 85) or for a training and education tool in a fellowship program (NPS of 90).
CONCLUSION: As new technology continues to enter the field of orthopedics, it is important to ensure upgrades and advancements continue to serve surgeons and provide efficiencies in the operating room. For established robotic surgeons, the new robotic technology assessed in this study provided increased confidence when compared to manual TKA. Based on these results, the new software upgrade demonstrated value during various stages of a TKA procedure and is highly recommended for use by others in the field of orthopedics."
pub.1079382511,Robotic Technology Produces More Conservative Tibial Resection Than Conventional Techniques in UKA.,"Conversion of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may be relatively simple when tibial resection is conservative during the index UKA. However, with greater tibial resection, conversion to TKA may be complicated by osseous insufficiency, requiring stems and augments, and potentially compromising patient outcomes and TKA durability. Robotic assistance in UKA is shown to enhance the bone preparation accuracy. In our retrospective comparison of polyethylene insert sizes, 8-mm or 9-mm polyethylene inserts were used in 93.6% and 84.5% of robotic (N = 8421) and conventional (N = 27,989) UKAs, respectively. Aggressive tibial resection, requiring tibial inserts ≥10 mm, was performed in 6.4% of robotic-assisted cases and 15.5% of conventional cases. Robotic-assisted UKA more reproducibly achieved accurate and precise conservative resection."
pub.1172415673,Robotic-assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty and Spinopelvic Parameters: A Review,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis, and the popularity of the direct anterior approach has increased due to more rapid recovery and increased stability. Instability, commonly caused by component malposition, remains a significant concern. The dynamic relationship between the pelvis and lumbar spine, deemed spinopelvic motion, is considered an important factor in stability. Various parameters are used in evaluating spinopelvic motion. Understanding spinopelvic motion is critical, and executing a precise plan for positioning the implant can be difficult with manual instrumentation. Robotic and/or navigation systems have been developed in the effort to enhance THA outcomes and for implementing spinopelvic parameters. These systems can be classified into three categories: X-ray/fluoroscopy-based, imageless, and computed tomography (CT)-based. Each system has advantages and limitations. When using CT-based systems, preoperative CT scans are used to assist with preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, providing feedback on implant position and restoration of hip biomechanics within a functional safe zone developed according to each patient's specific spinopelvic parameters. Several studies have demonstrated the accuracy and reproducibility of robotic systems with regard to implant positioning and leg length discrepancy. Some studies have reported better radiographic and clinical outcomes with use of robotic-assisted THA. However, clinical outcomes comparable to those for manual THA have also been reported. Robotic systems offer advantages in terms of accuracy, precision, and potentially reduced rates of dislocation. Additional research, including conduct of randomized controlled trials, will be required in order to evaluate the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted THA."

pub.1168003421,The use of a modern robotic system for the treatment of severe knee deformities,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have shown promising results in recent years with improved clinical outcomes using standard primary implants.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the experience of a single center in correcting severe coronal deformities with the use of a robotic-assisted TKA system and an increased constrained implant.
METHODS: Between July 2020 and December 2022, 30 knees in 28 patients with a major deformity and an associated ligament laxity requiring an increased constrained implant treated using an imageless robotic-assisted TKA were prospectively enrolled. Patients included in the study showed a minimum 15 degrees varus or 10 degrees valgus deviation.
RESULTS: 20 cases were varus knees and 10 cases were valgus knees. Postoperative neutral alignment was defined as 0∘± 2.5∘. A CCK implant was used in 20 cases while a Constrained Posterior Stabilized implant was used in 10 cases. A neutral alignment was achieved in all patients. At a minimum 6 months follow up (f-u 6-30 months) clinical outcomes including ROM, KSS, HSS, OKS and WOMAC showed significant improvement and no major complications were registered.
CONCLUSIONS: The robotic system showed the achievement of a mechanical alignment with reliable radiographic outcomes and clinical results in the treatment of major deformities of the lower limb with the use of higher constrained implants at short term follow up. Further follow up and studies are necessary to confirm and verify these promising outcomes."
pub.1172287585,Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty: An Update,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a gold standard surgical procedure to improve pain and restore function in patients affected by moderate-to-severe severe gonarthrosis refractory to conservative treatments. Indeed, millions of these procedures are conducted yearly worldwide, with their number expected to increase in an ageing and more demanding population. Despite the progress that has been made in optimizing surgical techniques, prosthetic designs, and durability, up to 20% of patients are dissatisfied by the procedure or still report knee pain. From this perspective, the introduction of robotic TKA (R-TKA) in the late 1990s represented a valuable instrument in performing more accurate bone cuts and improving clinical outcomes. On the other hand, prolonged operative time, increased complications, and high costs of the devices slow down the diffusion of R-TKA. The advent of newer technological devices, including those using navigation systems, has made robotic surgery in the operatory room more common since the last decade. At present, many different robots are available, representing promising solutions to avoid persistent knee pain after TKA. We hereby describe their functionality, analyze potential benefits, and hint at future perspectives in this promising field."
pub.1172855900,Defining Distinct Stress Curve Morphologies for Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee Phenotypes Using an Imageless Navigation Robotic Platform in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) classification system divides coronal knee anatomy into 9 phenotypes, suggesting different soft tissue balancing is needed for optimal outcomes. We investigated the interplay between CPAK phenotypes and gap stress curves throughout the knee's range of motion, aiming to understand their impact on total knee arthroplasty balancing.
METHODS: There were 1,112 total knee arthroplasty cases from 2 imageless robotic assisted navigation systems using posterior stabilized implants that were classified into CPAK phenotypes. Medial and lateral initial gap values were measured throughout the knee flexion-extension arc, gap curve morphologies were generated, and mediolateral (ML) gap balance was calculated for each phenotype. The most common phenotypes were included in this study, CPAK I to VI.
RESULTS: Each phenotype exhibited a distinct gap curve morphology. Type I maintained the largest ML gap difference (-3.6 to -2.1), with the medial compartment tightest in extension. Type II showed relative laxity in the lateral compartment compared to the medial gap (-1.0 to -1.9), with the medial compartment tightening through flexion. Type III had a looser medial and tighter lateral compartment in extension that inverts to a tighter medial compartment in deep flexion (2.1 to -0.8), while Type IV showed a decreasing compartment difference with increased flexion (-3.7 to 0.6). Type V had fluctuating tightness (-0.6 to 1.8), and Type VI had the medial compartment tightening more with flexion (0.6 to 1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The distinct stress curves and ML gap behavior provide a ""fingerprint"" for each corresponding CPAK phenotype. Investigating these morphologies can help determine the best phenotype-specific treatments, including alignment strategy, implant selection, and gap balance, for optimal functional and patient outcomes."

The system utilizes three elements: (1) Pre-op 3D CT based planning and image based intra-op navigation. (2) Pre-resection implant modifications with integrated alignment, implant position and gap data, and (3) A semi-constrained robotic arm assisted execution of bone resection with “haptic” boundaries, and cemented implants.Materials and methodsThis paper evaluates variable pre-op implant placement, and anatomic reference positioning; data entry with incorporation of alignment, implant congruency through range of motion, and gaps; bone resection with “haptic” boundaries, and final implant evaluation with kinetic sensors.ResultsThe Mako system allowed for improved implant placement utilizing CT guidance, bone resection accuracy, flexibility for functional implant placement with gap balancing. When combined with kinetic sensors, there was improved rotation and soft tissue balance.ConclusionThe MAKO robotic system can assist the surgeon with anatomic landmarks, provides the flexibility for independent gap balance through implant and alignment refinement, and three-dimensional soft tissue balancing data to achieve functional stability. Registry data has shown improved outcome survivorship irrespective of the surgeons’ volumes and learning curves."
pub.1181931149,Universal non-circular cone beam CT orbits for metal artifact reduction imaging during image-guided procedures,"Innovation in image-guided procedures has been driven by advances in robotic Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) systems. A fundamental challenge for CBCT imaging is metal artifacts arising from surgical tools and implanted hardware. Here, we outline how two universal non-circular imaging orbits, optimized for metal artifact reduction, can be implemented in real-time on clinical robotic CBCT systems. Demonstrating potential clinical utility, the universal orbits were implemented during a pedicle screw cervical spine fixation and hip arthroplasty performed on a porcine and ovine cadaver respectively. In both procedures, the universal non-circular orbits noticeably reduced the metal artifacts surrounding the implanted orthopedic hardware, revealing anatomy and soft tissue obscured in current conventional CBCT imaging. This work represents a key step in clinically translating universal orbits, unlocking high quality in-room procedural verification to increase broader use of robotic CBCT systems and reduce the occurrence of secondary corrective surgeries."

PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Embase were searched according to PRISMA guidelines in June 2024. Search terms included “robot-assisted”, “manual” and “total knee arthroplasty”. Outcome indicators included American Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), range of motion (ROM), Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), operation duration (min), intraoperative blood loss (ml), pain score, patient’s satisfaction scores, hip–knee–ankle (HKA) angle, frontal femoral component angle, frontal tibia component angle, lateral femoral component angle and lateral tibia component angle. A total of 1,033 articles were obtained after removing duplicates, and 12 studies involving 2,863 patients (1,449 RA-TKAs and 1,414 M-TKAs) were finally meta-analyzed (22–32). The baseline data of both groups were similar in all results. Meta-analysis suggested a better performance of the RA-TKA group than the M-TKA group regarding the HKA angle. The manual TKA reduced the operation time and significantly improved the range of motion. The results of > 6 months follow-up showed that M-TKA was better than RA-TKA in terms of KSS score and WOMAC. Compared with M-TKA, RA-TKA can produce more accurate prosthetic alignment, but it does not lead to better clinical results. Orthopedic surgeons should choose between two surgical procedures according to their own experience and patients’ characteristics."

Nonetheless, there is substantial concern about the higher revision rates and lower survivorship in UKA compared to those in total knee arthroplasty. Robotic assistance has been advanced to improve the precision of bone preparation, component alignment, and quantified ligament balance in UKA, with the ultimate goal of improving kinematics and implant survivorship. Two currently available semiautonomous robotic platforms have demonstrated improved accuracy, and emerging short-term follow-up has demonstrated satisfactory functional outcomes. Further studies will be needed to determine if these technologies indeed have a meaningful impact on patient outcomes and survivorship in the mid- to long term."
pub.1181771097,MAKO robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty: a comprehensive meta-analysis of efficacy and safety outcomes,"BackgroundIntroduction: Robotic surgery in total hip arthroplasty (THA) has emerged as a promising approach for improving precision and reducing errors. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of robot-assisted MAKO total hip arthroplasty.MethodsStudies were searched using four databases. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4. Efficacy was assessed radiologically, and functional scores and complications were recorded.ResultsTwelve studies (1224 hips) were analyzed. The MAKO group achieved greater cup anteversion (MD 1.53, 95%CI 1.04–2.03) and a higher percentage of components within safe inclination and anteversion ranges (p > 0.05). Harris Hip Scores did not differ significantly (MD 0.61, 95%CI -0.22–1.45) but the forgotten joint scores favored MAKO (MD 5.99, 95% CI 4.10–7.88), although not exceeding the minimally clinically significant difference. No differences in intraoperative complications emerged (OR 0.96, 95%CI 0.51–1.79) but preoperative plans significantly mismatched the final cup placement after MAKO (p < 0.05).ConclusionsThe use of the MAKO robot in THA improves radiological outcomes by enhancing safe prosthesis placement. However, no significant differences were observed in terms of complications. Longer follow-up studies are required to assess the clinical impact of improved radiological results.Level of evidenceLevel IV metaanalysis of nonrandomized clinical trials.RegistrationCRD42023433733"
pub.1168681498,Robotics and Navigation Do Not Affect the Risk of Periprosthetic Joint Infection Following Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The use of computer navigation or robotic assistance during primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) has yielded numerous benefits due to more accurate component positioning. The utilization of these tools is generally associated with longer operative times and also necessitates additional surgical equipment and personnel in the operating room. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of technology assistance on periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after primary THA.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records for 12,726 patients who had undergone primary THA at a single high-volume institution between 2018 and 2021. Patients were stratified by surgical technique (conventional THA, computer-navigated THA [CN-THA], or robotic-assisted THA [RA-THA]) and were matched 1:1 with use of propensity score matching. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to compare the rates of PJI within 90 days postoperatively between the cohorts.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, there were 4,006 patients in the THA versus RA-THA analysis (2,003 in each group) and 5,288 patients in the THA versus CN-THA analysis (2,644 in each group). CN-THA (p < 0.001) and RA-THA (p < 0.001) were associated with longer operative times compared with conventional THA by 3 and 11 minutes, respectively. The rates of PJI after conventional THA (0.2% to 0.4%) were similar to those after CN-THA (0.4%) and RA-THA (0.4%). On the basis of logistic regression, the development of PJI was not associated with the use of computer navigation (odds ratio [OR], 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7 to 5.3]; p = 0.232) or robotic assistance (OR, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.3 to 2.3]; p = 0.808).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite longer operative times associated with the use of computer navigation and robotic assistance, the use of these tools was not associated with an increased risk of PJI within 90 days after surgery.

pub.1165057924,A novel robot-assisted knee arthroplasty system (ROSA) and 1-year outcome: A single center experience,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty is a successful procedure in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Searches in surgical technique have focused surgeons in particular on implant alignment. For this purpose, the use of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty has become increasingly common in the last 10 years.
METHODS: A total of 46 patients (66 knees) who were operated for knee osteoarthritis with Robotic Surgical Assistant (ROSA, Zimmer-Biomet, Warshaw, Indiana, USA) between 2021 and 2023 were included in the study. Preoperative planning and intraoperative incision time, total surgical time, range of motion and follow-up time recorded. Oxford knee scores and knee society scores (KSS) of the patients were compared before and after surgery. At the last follow-up Forgotten Joint Score and the sagittal and coronal plane alignments were evaluated.
RESULTS: Preoperative mean Oxford score of the right knee of the patients was 18.5 ± 3.2, post-surgery mean Oxford score progressed to 43.5 ± 2.2. While the preoperative left knee Oxford score of the patients was 16.9 ± 2.3, the mean left knee Oxford score improved to 43.4 ± 2.2 postoperatively. The mean KSS score of the patients' right knee preoperatively was 49.7 ± 3.5, and progressed to 89.2 ± 4.7 postoperatively. While the preoperative mean left knee KSS score of the patients was 46.5 ± 4.3, the mean KSS score improved to 89.8 ± 3.2 postoperatively. The mean Forgotten Joint Score of the left knee at the last follow-up of the patients was 77.4 ± 3.8, while the mean Forgotten Joint Score of the right knee was 75.4 ± 5.9.
CONCLUSION: The results of ROSA-supported knee arthroplasty found to be functionally successful."

One hundred seventy-five consecutive patients who underwent MAKO® (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan) robotic-guidance THA were included in the study. The study population had a mean age of 57.9 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 30.41. Forty-eight percent of the population was male and 74% of the procedures were performed through an anterior approach. Robotic guidance in THA was effective in correcting native femoral version toward a target of 15°. This can be achieved using both the anterior and posterior approach; it is not affected by BMI."
pub.1165063279,UK robotic arthroplasty clinical and cost effectiveness randomised controlled trial for hips (RACER-Hip): a study protocol,"INTRODUCTION: The number of robotic-assisted hip replacement procedures has expanded globally with the intended aim of improving outcomes. Intraoperative robotic-arm systems add additional costs to total hip replacement (THR) surgery but may improve surgical precision and could contribute to diminished pain and improved function. Additionally, these systems may reduce the need for expensive revision surgery. Surgery with conventional instruments may be just as successful, quick and affordable. There is timely demand for a robust evaluation of this technology.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Robotic Arthroplasty Clinical and cost Effectiveness Randomised controlled trial for Hips (RACER-Hip) is a multicentre (minimum of six UK sites), participant-assessor blinded, randomised controlled trial. 378 participants with hip osteoarthritis requiring THR will be randomised (1:1) to receive robotic-assisted THR, or THR using conventional surgical instruments. The primary outcome is the Forgotten Joint Score at 12 months post-randomisation; a patient-reported outcome measure assessing participants' awareness of their joint when undertaking daily activities. Secondary outcomes will be collected post-operatively (pain, blood loss and opioid usage) and at 3, 6, 12, 24 months, then 5 and 10 years postrandomisation (including function, pain, health-related quality of life, reoperations and satisfaction). Allocation concealment will be accomplished using a computer-based randomisation procedure on the day of surgery. Blinding methods include the use of sham incisions for marker clusters and blinded operation notes. The primary analysis will adhere to the intention-to-treat principle. Results will adhere to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statements.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was approved by an ethics committee (Solihull Research Ethics Committee, 30 June 2021, IRAS: 295831). Participants will provide informed consent before agreeing to participate. Results will be disseminated using peer-reviewed journal publications, presentations at international conferences and through the use of social media. We will develop plans to disseminate to patients and public with our patient partners.

pub.1079288647,The Evolution of Image-Free Robotic Assistance in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.,"Semiautonomous robotic technology has been introduced to optimize accuracy of bone preparation, implant positioning, and soft tissue balance in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), with the expectation that there will be a resultant improvement in implant durability and survivorship. Currently, roughly one-fifth of UKAs in the US are being performed with robotic assistance, and it is anticipated that there will be substantial growth in market penetration of robotics over the next decade. First-generation robotic technology improved substantially implant position compared to conventional methods; however, high capital costs, uncertainty regarding the value of advanced technologies, and the need for preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were barriers to broader adoption. Newer image-free semiautonomous robotic technology optimizes both implant position and soft tissue balance, without the need for preoperative CT scans and with pricing and portability that make it suitable for use in an ambulatory surgery center setting, where approximately 40% of these systems are currently being utilized. This article will review the robotic experience for UKA, including rationale, system descriptions, and outcomes. "
pub.1135285567,Contemporary Robotic Systems in Total Knee Arthroplasty A Review of Accuracy and Outcomes,"The success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) depends on restoration of the stability and biomechanical efficiency of the native knee. The emergence of robotic surgical technologies has greatly increased the precision and reproducibility. We discuss contemporary robotic TKA systems by reviewing the features of the individual platforms, their accuracy, and the clinical outcomes. While early results suggest significant gains in patient outcomes, long-term evidence is still awaited from multicenter prospective clinical trials. Moreover, advances in this technology are needed to address knee laxity while individualizing the functional performance of each patient's new joint."
pub.1165811827,"No Difference in Range of Motion, Components, or Complications Following Conversion of Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Compared to Manual TKA After Undergoing Manual or Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty","Background: Conversion surgery from unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains a challenge due to scarring, implant/cement removal, and loss of bony landmarks. Robotic-assisted (RA) TKA may assist in challenges seen in manual conversion TKA. The aim of this study is to identify if there are differences in components and functional outcomes dependent on manual/RA primary UKA and conversion TKA.
Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients undergoing conversion from UKA to TKA over a 10-year period at a single institution. Data extracted included surgical technique, reason for UKA failure, range of motion at 1 year, need for augments, and utilization of revision components.
Results: Forty-nine patients (50 knees) with a UKA converted to a TKA were divided into 4 groups based on primary and conversion surgery: manual-to-manual (n = 11), manual-to-robot (n = 11), robot-to-manual (n = 11), and robot-to-robot (n = 17). There was no difference in need for augments (<i>P</i> = .376), size of poly (<i>P</i> = .23), postoperative flexion (<i>P</i> = .52), or extension (<i>P</i> = .76) at 1 year between the 4 groups. However, patients with primary manual UKA did require significantly more augments during revision (<i>P</i> = .032).
Conclusions: Our study did not show any statistically significant differences of primary RA or manual UKA to RA or manual TKA in terms of range of motion at 1 year, complications, or differences in components. RA conversion from UKA to TKA is a new but equivalent technique to manual conversion. Primary surgery may impact the requirement for augments during conversion surgery."
pub.1155592790,Clinical and radiological outcomes of robotic-assisted versus conventional total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) is an alternative surgical treatment method to conventional total knee arthroplasty (COTKA) that may deliver better surgical accuracy. However, its impact on patient outcomes is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is to evaluate whether RATKA could improve functional and radiological outcomes compared with COTKA in adult patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee.
METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library to identify published RCTs comparing RATKA with COTKA. 2 reviewers independently screened eligible studies, reviewed the full texts, assessed risk of bias using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and extracted data. Outcomes were patient-reported outcomes, range of motion, and mechanical alignment (MA) deviation and outliers, and complications.
RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs involving 2,200 patients. RATKA probably results in little to no effect on patient-reported outcomes (mean difference (MD) in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score of -0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.78 to 0.07) and range of motion (MD -0.73°; CI -7.5° to 6.0°) compared with COTKA. However, RATKA likely results in a lower degree of MA outliers (risk ratio 0.43; CI 0.27 to 0.67) and less deviation from neutral MA (MD -0.94°; CI -1.1° to -0.73°). There were no differences in revision rate or major adverse effects associated with RATKA.
CONCLUSION: Although RATKA likely results in higher radiologic accuracy than COTKA, this may not be clinically meaningful. Also, there is probably no clinically important difference in clinical outcomes between RATKA and COTKA, while it is as yet inconclusive regarding the revision and complication rates due to insufficient evidence."
pub.1172775916,Early Clinical and Economic Outcomes for the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution Compared with Manual Instrumentation for Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been developed to improve functional outcomes after TKA by increasing surgical precision of bone cuts and soft tissue balancing, thereby reducing outliers. The DePuy Synthes VELYS robotic-assisted solution (VRAS) is one of the latest entrants in the robotic TKA market. Currently, there is limited evidence investigating early patient and economic outcomes associated with the use of VRAS. The Premier Healthcare Database was analyzed to identify patients undergoing manual TKA with any implant system compared with a cohort of robotic-assisted TKAs using VRAS between September 1, 2021 and February 28, 2023. The primary outcome was all-cause and knee-related all-setting revisits within 90-day post-TKA. Secondary outcomes included number of inpatient revisits (readmission), operating room time, discharge status, and hospital costs. Baseline covariate differences between the two cohorts were balanced using fine stratification methodology and analyzed using generalized linear models. The cohorts included 866 VRAS and 128,643 manual TKAs that had 90-day follow-up data. The rates of both all-cause and knee-related all-setting follow-up visits (revisits) were significantly lower in the VRAS TKA cohort compared with the manual TKA cohort (13.86 vs. 17.19%; mean difference [MD]: -3.34 [95% confidence interval: -5.65 to -1.03] and 2.66 vs. 4.81%; MD: -2.15 [-3.23 to -1.08], respectively, <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.01) at 90-day follow-up. The incidence of knee-related inpatient readmission was also significantly lower (53%) for VRAS compared with manual TKA. There was no significant difference between total cost of care at 90-day follow-up between VRAS and manual TKA cases. On average, the operating room time was higher for VRAS compared with manual TKA (138 vs. 134 minutes). In addition, the discharge status and revision rates were similar between the cohorts. The use of VRAS for TKA is associated with lower follow-up visits and knee-related readmission rates in the first 90-day postoperatively. The total hospital cost was similar for both VRAS and manual TKA cohort while not accounting for the purchase of the robot."
pub.1168363211,Does Approach Matter in Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty? A Comparison of Early Reoperations Between Direct Anterior and Postero-Lateral Approach,"BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on whether direct anterior approach (DAA) or postero-lateral approach (PLA) total hip arthroplasty (THA) confers a lower risk of postoperative complications. Robotic assistance in THA results in a more consistently accurate component position compared to manual THA. The objective of this study was to compare rates of dislocation, reoperation, revision, and patient-reported outcome measures between patients undergoing DAA and PLA robotic-assisted primary THA.
METHODS: We identified 2,040 consecutive robotic-assisted primary THAs performed for primary osteoarthritis, using DAA (n = 497) or PLA (n = 1,542) between 2017 and 2020. The mean follow-up was 18 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated survivorship free of dislocation, reoperation, and revision. Achievement of patient acceptable symptom state and minimum clinically important difference were used to compare changes in the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement (HOOS JR) and Visual Analog Scale.
RESULTS: Dislocation was rare in this series (14 in 2,040, 0.7%), including 1 of 497 (0.2%) in the DAA cohort and 13 of 1,542 (0.8%) in the PLA cohort (P = .210). There was no difference in 2-year reoperation-free survivorship (97.8 versus 98.6%, P = .59) or revision-free survivorship (98.8 versus 99.0%, P = .87) at any time point. After controlling for age, sex, and body mass index, there was no difference in dislocation, reoperation, or revision. At 6-week follow-up, after controlling for age, sex, and body mass index, patients in the DAA cohort had higher odds of achieving HOOS JR minimum clinically important difference (odds ratio = 2.01, P = .012) and HOOS JR patient acceptable symptom state (odds ratio = 1.72, P = .028). There were no differences in patient-reported outcome measures by 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: For robotic-assisted primary THA, DAA may confer enhanced early (<6 weeks) functional recovery compared to the PLA, but there was no significant difference in postoperative dislocation, reoperation, or revision rates."
pub.1157693141,Arthrofibrosis in Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty: An Investigation Into How Robotic Assistance May Contribute to a Tight Knee,"INTRODUCTION: Arthrofibrosis after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can lead to pain and restricted range of motion. Matching native knee kinematics is crucial in avoiding arthrofibrosis postoperatively. However, manual jig-based instruments have demonstrated variability and inaccuracy during primary TKA. Robotic-arm-assisted surgery was developed to increase the precision and accuracy of bone cuts and component alignment. In the literature, limited information on arthrofibrosis after robotic-assisted TKA (RATKA) exists. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of arthrofibrosis after manual TKA (mTKA) with RATKA by examining the need for manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) postoperatively and evaluating preoperative and postoperative radiographic parameters.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent primary TKA from 2019 to 2021 was conducted. Rates of MUA were evaluated and perioperative radiographs were analyzed to determine posterior condylar offset ratio, Insall-Salvati Index, and posterior tibial slope (PTS) in patients who underwent mTKA versus RATKA. Range of motion was recorded for patients who required MUA.
RESULTS: A total of 1234 patients were included, of which 644 underwent mTKA, and 590 underwent RATKA. Thirty-seven RATKA patients compared with 12 mTKA patients required MUA postoperatively (P < 0.0001). A significant decrease in PTS postoperatively was seen in the RATKA (7.10° ± 2.4° preoperatively versus 2.46° ± 1.2° postoperatively), with a mean decrease of the tibial slope of -4.6° ± 2.5° (P < 0.0001). In patients requiring MUA, a larger decrease was seen in the RATKA group when compared with the mTKA group (mean -5.5 ± 2.0 versus -5.3 ± 0.78, P = 0.6585). No significant difference was seen in the posterior condylar offset ratio and Insall-Salvati Index in both groups.
DISCUSSION: When conducting RATKA, it is important to match PTS close to the native tibial slope to decrease the incidence of arthrofibrosis postoperatively, as a decrease in PTS can lead to decreased postoperative knee flexion and poor functional outcomes."
pub.1164990833,Functional positioning principles for image‐based robotic‐assisted TKA achieved a higher Forgotten Joint Score at 1 year compared to conventional TKA with restricted kinematic alignment,"PURPOSE: Few comparative studies assessed the current concept of individualised alignment for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and their outcomes at mid-term. This study aimed to evaluate the functional outcomes at 1 year of primary TKA performed with a functional positioning technique based on an image-based robotic-assisted system, compared to conventional TKA performed with a restricted kinematic alignment technique.
METHODS: This retrospective comparative study included 100 primary TKAs performed with functional positioning principles using an image-based robotic-assisted system. A control group included 100 primary TKAs with the same posterior-stabilised implant as the robotic group but performed with manual instrumentation and restricted kinematic alignment technique. In the robotic group, the mean age was 69.2 years old ± 7.9; the mean body mass index was 29.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ± 4.6. The demographic characteristics were similar between both groups. Kujala score, Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), Knee Society Score (KSS) knee and KSS function were collected 12 months postoperatively. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared using the Student t test. For non-normally distributed continuous variables, the Mann-Whitney test was used.
RESULTS: FJS was significantly higher in the robotic group (76.3 ± 13 vs. 68.6 ± 16.9 in the conventional group; p = 0.026). At a 1-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in the KSS knee and KSS function scores and the Kujala score between both groups. The mean KSS knee score was 90.8 ± 11.4 in the robotic group versus 89.4 ± 9.6 in the conventional group (p = 0.082). The mean KSS function score was 91.4 ± 12.3 versus 91.3 ± 12.6, respectively (p = 0.778).
CONCLUSION: Functional positioning principles using an image-based robotic-assisted system achieved a higher Forgotten Joint Score 1 year after TKA compared to restricted kinematic alignment. Personalised alignment and implant positioning are interesting paths to improve the functional outcomes after TKA.

pub.1155132455,Postoperative limb alignment in total knee replacement. Conventional versus navigated versus robotic techniques,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to compare the coronal mechanical axis after total knee replacement (TKR) obtained in three groups of patients subjected to conventional, navigated, and robotic surgery.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis.
RESULTS: 124 knees were included (36 conventional, 41 navigated, 47 robotic). No statistically significant differences were found between the postOp tibiofemoral angle of the conventional, navigated and robotic groups (p = 0.396). A repeated-measure analysis of preOp-to-postOp also found no significant differences (p = 0.387). There were no differences in the proportion of outliers (3-degree) found (p = 0.211). Nevertheless, a higher proportion of patients in the robotic group improved their mechanical alignment, as compared with conventional surgery (p = 0.023), although no differences were found when comparing with navigation (p = 0.121).
CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences were found with respect to the postOp alignment achieved. However, statistically significant differences were detected between robotic and conventional surgery when considering the percentage of patients with improved limb alignment."
pub.1173425013,Robot-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty is Associated With an Increased Risk of Periprosthetic Fracture,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) aims to restore joint function and relieve pain. New technology, such as robot assistance, offers the potential to reduce human error, improve precision, and improve postoperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between conventional and robot-assisted THA.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing a national database from 2016 to 2019. Patients undergoing THA, conventional or robot-assisted, were identified via the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code. Multivariate regressions were performed to assess outcomes between groups. Negative binomial regressions were performed to assess discharge disposition, readmission, and reoperation. Gamma regressions with log-link were used to assess total charges and lengths of hospital stays. Patient demographics and comorbidities, measured via the Elixhauser comorbidity index, were controlled for in our analyses. A total of 1,216,395 patients undergoing THA, 18,417 (1.51%) with robotic assistance, were identified.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing robot-assisted procedures had increased surgical complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.31 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 1.53]; P < .001), including periprosthetic fracture (OR 1.63 [95% CI 1.35 to 1.98]; P < .001). Notably, these patients also had significantly greater total charges (OR 1.20 [95% CI 1.11 to 1.30]; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic assistance in THA is associated with an increased risk of surgical complications, including periprosthetic fracture, while incurring greater charges.

pub.1155302781,Coronal alignment classes after robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty are not associated with variation in patient-reported outcome measurements: A single-center cohort study,"BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were (1) to use three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) measurements to determine whether patients undergoing imageless robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) develop a variety of postoperative distal femoral mechanical angle (FMA), proximal tibial mechanical angle (TMA), and hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) phenotypes as described by Hirschmann et al, and (2) to compare postoperative patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs) between these phenotypes.
METHOD: Fifty patients with knee osteoarthritis underwent RA-TKA. All surgeries were performed using bicruciate-stabilized TKA. In each case, the postoperative HKA, FMA and TMA were classified into one of Hirschmann's five FMA, five TMA, and seven HKA phenotype categories. We investigated how these phenotypes affected patient satisfaction, 2011 Knee Society Score (KSS) subscale scores, the Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) score, and patella scores with anterior knee pain at a mean of 15.1 months after RA-TKA.
RESULTS: Coronal alignment angles were assigned to three FMA, four TMA, and five HKA phenotypes. The most common FMA, TMA, and HKA phenotypes were valgus FMA 3° (58%), valgus TMA 3° (60%), and varus HKA 3° (38%). The FMA, TMA, and HKA phenotypes showed no significant differences in any PROMs.
CONCLUSIONS: RA-TKA led to various HKA, FMA and TMA phenotypes in the coronal plane, none of which affected PROMs."
pub.1169895465,Outcomes of Image-Free Robotic Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients Who Have Valgus Knee Deformities,"BACKGROUND: Valgus knee deformities pose a unique challenge in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to the complexity of achieving ligamentous balance and satisfactory alignment compared to varus or neutral deformities. Robotic-assisted (RA) TKA could aid in achieving improved component alignment and balance.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a matched cohort of patients to compare image-free RA-TKA (n = 44) versus conventional manual (CM) TKA (n = 30) techniques in patients who have valgus deformity of 5 to 15 degrees, including radiographic and patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) over a 3-year period. The patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) studied to determine outcomes were: Western Ontario McMaster University Arthritis Index, Knee Society Score-Function Score, and Short Form 12-item Survey.
RESULTS: Overall, the RA-TKA cohort showed faster improvement in PROMs (37.16 ± 1 8.8 versus 25.74 ± 17.7, P = .02), shorter length of stay (1.41 versus 2.29 days, P = .02), and shorter operating room times (120.79 versus 123.67 minutes, P = .02) than CM-TK). Additionally, there was no difference in the use of primary versus varus-valgus constrained polyethylene liners between the cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: In this investigation, RA-TKA yielded a slightly faster patient recovery, more objective measurements of ligamentous balance, and proved noninferior PROMs compared to CM-TKA for preoperative valgus knee deformities."
pub.1154417049,Trends in Computer-Assisted Surgery for Total Knee Arthroplasty in Germany: An Analysis Based on the Operative Procedure Classification System between 2010 to 2021,"Alignment strategies for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have changed significantly over time with a shift towards a more individualized alignment goal. At the same time, computer-assisted surgery (CAS) has gained interest for intraoperative control and accuracy in implant positioning and limb alignment. Despite the often discussed benefits and drawbacks of robotics and navigation for TKA, the routine use of these new devices on a day-to-day basis remains obscure. Therefore, nationwide hospital billing data based on the Operation Procedure Classification System (OPS) were retrieved from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany for the period from 2010 to 2021. OPS codes for primary total knee arthroplasty (OPS code: 5-822*) were further analyzed regarding the usage of computer navigation (additional OPS code: 5-988) or robotic devices (additional OPS code: 5-987). Gender and age at the time of surgery were also assessed. The results show a total of 2,226,559 primary TKAs were implanted between 2010 and 2021, of which 2,044,914 were performed conventionally (91.84% of all TKAs). A total of 170,276 TKAs were performed using navigation technique (7.65% of all TKAs) and another 11,369 TKAs were performed using robotics (0.51% of all TKAs). For the period from 2018 to 2021, a substantial increase in robot-assisted TKA (R-TKA) was observed, with an average increase rate of 84.74% per year, while the number of navigated TKAs declined (-3.67% per year). Computer-assisted surgery, and particularly robotics for TKA, are seeing growing popularity and stepwise translation into routine clinical use in Germany, with a steep increase rate of more than 80% per year since 2018. Nevertheless, the majority of TKAs are still performed using manual instrumentation, rendering conventional TKA the currently unchanged gold standard."
pub.1149380000,Semiactive robotic-arm system versus patient-specific instrumentation in primary total knee arthroplasty: Efficacy and accuracy,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in efficacy and accuracy during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) among robotic-arm system, patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) and conventional TKA (COTKA).
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 90 advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients in our hospital between June 2019 and December 2020 was conducted. Patients were divided into robotic arm-assisted (RA)TKA (group A), PSITKA (group B) and COTKA (group C), 30 cases in each group. The operation time, intraoperative bleeding, and length of hospital stay were counted. Imaging data of hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), posterior condylar angle (PCA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and sagittal tibial component angle (sTCA) were statistically analyzed. The postoperative recovery of the patients was evaluated by Knee Society Score (KSS) and the Western Ontario Mac Master University Index Score (WOMAC).
RESULTS: Group A had the least intraoperative bleeding. For operation time, group A was the longest compared with group B and group C (P < 0.05), while group B was longer than group C (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in HKA, LDFA, and MPTA among the three groups, and the lower limb alignments were all restored to the neutral position. PCA of group A and B were both smaller than that of group C and closer to 0° (P < 0.05), but the difference between group A and B was not statistically significant. The sTCA in group A was significantly better than group B, and group B was significantly better than group C (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in function scores among the three groups.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the PSI and CO, RA is more minimally invasive and more accurate in radiographic results."
pub.1150025976,The Ability of Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty in Matching the Efficiency of Its Conventional Counterpart at an Orthopaedic Specialty Hospital,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has become a popular technology. Studies have investigated the learning curve for surgeons incorporating RA-TKA into practice, but less is known regarding the change in operative efficiency when introducing RA-TKA into a facility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of RA-TKA on operative and turnover time at an orthopaedic specialty hospital.
METHODS: A total of 148 cases (74 RA-TKA and 74 conventional TKA [C-TKA]) performed by 2 surgeons with previous robotic experience were identified following the introduction of RA-TKA at our facility. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and operative times (ie, wheels-in to incision, incision to closure, closure to wheels-out, and turnover time) were recorded. Cumulative summation analyses were used to investigate learning curves of factors extraneous to surgeon proficiency with RA-TKA.
RESULTS: While RA-TKA had a slightly longer set up (3 minutes; range, 12-45), surgical (5 minutes; range, 33-118), and breakdown time (3 minutes; range, 2-7), there was no difference in turnover time between the groups. The learning curve for surgeon A was 6 robotic cases, whereas surgeon B demonstrated no learning curve. There was no identifiable learning curve for turnover time.
CONCLUSION: There was a mean of 8 minutes of increased time required to perform a RA-TKA compared to C-TKA. However, these small increases for the RA-TKA group for set-up, surgical, and breakdown times are not likely to be clinically relevant compared to the C-TKA. It appears that the RA-TKA technology was able to be incorporated into this specialty hospital with minimal changes to surgical efficiency."
pub.1152720506,Similar survivorship at the 5‐year follow‐up comparing robotic‐assisted and conventional lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: This retrospective study aims to analyse the survivorship and functional outcomes of two samples with similar preoperative clinical and demographic data of lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) performed with robotic and conventional surgery at a minimum 5-year follow-up.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical records of two cohorts for 95 lateral UKA implants were analysed. The first cohort consisted of 43 patients with cemented lateral UKA performed with the conventional procedure (Conventional group). The second cohort consisted of 52 patients who received robot-assisted cemented lateral UKA (Robotic group). Clinical evaluation of the two samples entailed evaluating the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score divided into subscales (symptoms and stiffness, pain, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation and quality of life) for each patient. Revision was defined as the failure of the implant (periprosthetic joint infection, periprosthetic fracture or aseptic loosening), and survival was based on implant revision.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 90.3 ± 9.1 months for the Conventional Group and 95.4 ± 11.0 months for the Robotic Group (n.s.). Each patient was clinically evaluated on the day before surgery (T<sub>0</sub>), at a minimum 1-year follow-up (T<sub>1</sub>) and at a minimum 5-year follow-up (T<sub>2</sub>). In both groups, all clinical scores improved between T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> and between T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> (p &lt; 0.05); for both groups, no differences were noted in any clinical scores between T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> (n.s.). No significant differences in any clinical score were found between the two groups at each follow-up (n.s.). Survival analysis reported no differences between the two groups at the final 1-year follow-up, with three failures (2 aseptic loosening and 1 periprosthetic fracture) in the Conventional group and two failures (1 patellofemoral osteoarthritis and 1 inexplicable pain) in the Robotic group (n.s.).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows excellent clinical outcomes and revision rates in robotic arm-assisted and manual techniques for lateral UKA, with no clinical differences at medium- to long-term follow-up.

However, there is a paucity of literature on lateral compartment RA-UKA. The purpose of our study was to assess the midterm clinical outcomes and survivorship of lateral RA-UKA.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of a single-center prospectively maintained cohort of 33 patients (36 knees) indicated for lateral UKA. Perioperative, and postoperative two- and five-year Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Score (WOMAC), and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) patient reported outcome measures were collected. Five-year follow-up was recorded in 29 patients (32 knees).
RESULTS: Mean follow up was 5.1 ± 0.1 years. Mean age and BMI was 70.9 ± 7.2 years and 29.0 ± 4.2 kg/m2, respectively. At discharge, mean distance walked was 273.4 ± 70.4 feet, and mean pain score was 2.0 ± 2.5. At 2-year follow up, mean KOOS, WOMAC, and FJS were 75.1 ± 13.5, 15.0 ± 7.2, and 81.0 ± 23.3, respectively. At 5-year follow up, mean KOOS, WOMAC, and FJS were 75.3 ± 14.6, 14.9 ± 5.0, and 75.8 ± 27.4, respectively. Mean change in KOOS and WOMAC were 35.6 ± 27.1 and 11.7 ± 13.4 (<i>p</i>&lt; .001 and <i>p</i>&lt; .001). 94% of patients were very satisfied/satisfied, 3% neutral, and 3% dissatisfied. 91% met activity expectations, and 59% were more active than before. Survivorship was 100% at 5 years.
DISCUSSION: In this study, lateral RA-UKA demonstrated significantly improved clinical outcomes, high patient satisfaction, met expectations, and excellent functional recovery at midterm follow up. Comparative studies are needed to determine differences between robotic-assisted and conventional lateral UKA, as well as TKA."
pub.1181462845,Patient Satisfaction Following Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: Current Concepts,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has gained progressive popularity in recent decades, currently comprising approximately 10% of knee arthroplasties in the United States. Nonetheless, UKA has not yet solidified its position as the superior treatment for isolated compartment osteoarthritis, as initial reported implant survivorship was subpar, leading to hesitation in its utilization and stricter patient indications compared to total knee arthroplasty. Patient satisfaction following knee arthroplasty has emerged as a critical metric to gauge patient acceptance and contentment with surgical interventions. Currently, a variety of UKA types exist, differing in bearing design, fixation techniques such as cementless or cemented fixation, and robotic-assisted systems, each with its own merits and drawbacks. Multiple studies have demonstrated the contributions of these innovations to improve clinical outcomes and implant survivorship. However, the abundance of studies has made it challenging to establish a clear overview. This paper provides an overview of the current concepts of UKA, evaluating various aspects of UKA referencing to patient satisfaction and providing a recap of its historical development. Available research demonstrated no significantly universal superior variant of UKA."
pub.1154510970,Comparative efficacy of the different cutting guides in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: A systematic-review and network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Several cutting guides including conventional, navigation, patient specific instrumentation (PSI) and robotic are currently used in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). A network meta-analysis was conducted to compare the most widely used cutting guides regarding the improvement of radiological, functional outcomes and the rate of complications.
METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing UKA cutting guides were searched in electronic databases, major orthopaedics journals, and oral communications in major orthopaedics meetings, until May 1st, 2022. The primary outcomes were the rate of outliers for the tibial and femoral components in the frontal plane, KSS score and the complication rate.
RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs involving 1562 patients with 1564 UKA were included Regarding the prosthetic components' positions, we found a significant increase of the outliers rate using PSI for the femoral component, compared to robotic surgery (risk ratio 0.00 [95% CI 0.00 to 0.55]) and navigated surgery (risk ratio 305.1 [95% CI 1.50 to 1,27e + 07]). We didn't emphasize any difference regarding the tibial component's position, the KSS value at 24 months postoperatively, and the complication rate. Regarding secondary outcomes, robotics provided a better precision in bone cuts in the sagittal plane for the tibial component and the lower limb alignment. No other differences were observed.
CONCLUSION: In the light of these results, the robot seems to be the most precise cutting instrument to perform UKA. However, this did not demonstrate any difference in functional or clinical outcome. The cost of this technology can be a major economic brake, especially in surgical centers that do not have an exclusive prosthetic activity. Further outcome and survivorship data is needed to recommend one cutting instrument over the other."

pub.1167429030,Robotic‐assisted burring in total hip replacement: A new surgical technique to optimise acetabular preparation,"BACKGROUND: In Total Hip replacement (THR) surgery, a critical step is to cut an accurate hemisphere into the acetabulum so that the component can be fitted accurately and obtain early stability. This study aims to determine whether burring rather than reaming the acetabulum can achieve greater accuracy in the creation of this hemisphere.
METHODS: A preliminary robotic system was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of burring the acetabulum using the Universal Robot (UR10). The study will describe mechanical design, robot trajectory optimisation, control algorithm development, and results from phantom experiments compared with both robotic reaming and conventional reaming. The system was also tested in a cadaver experiment.
RESULTS: The proposed robotic burring system can produce a surface in 2 min with an average error of 0.1 and 0.18 mm, when cutting polyurethane bone block #15 and #30, respectively. The performance was better than robotic reaming and conventional hand reaming.
CONCLUSION: The proposed robotic burring system outperformed robotic and conventional reaming methods to produce an accurate acetabular cavity. The findings show the potential usage of a robotic-assisted burring in THR for acetabular preparation."
pub.1145604944,HURWA robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty improves component positioning and alignment – A prospective randomized and multicenter study,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the radiologic and clinical outcomes of HURWA robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to those of conventional TKA.
METHODS: A total of 150 patients were randomized into two groups - 73 and 77 patients underwent robotic-assisted TKA and conventional TKA, respectively. Preoperative and postoperative Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) score, Knee Society Score (KSS) and range of motion (ROM) were obtained and compared between these two groups. The preoperative and postoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle and the rate of HKA≤3° in the two groups were also compared.
RESULTS: The postoperative mean HKA angle was 1.801° ​± ​1.608° of varus for the robotic-assisted TKA group and 3.017° ​± ​2.735° of varus for the conventional TKA group; these values were significantly different. The alignment rate for mechanical axis lower than 3° in the robotic-assisted TKA group and the conventional TKA group were 81.2% and 63.5%, respectively. Patients undergone robotic-assisted TKA or conventional TKA had similarly improved knee flexion and functional recovery reflected by WOMAC score, HSS score, SF-36 score and KSS.
CONCLUSION: HURWA robotic-assisted TKA is a safe and effective, resulting in better alignment for mechanical axis than conventional TKA. The improvement in knee flexion and functional recovery after HURWA robotic-assisted TKA were similar to those after conventional TKA. However, longer follow-up is needed to determine whether the improved alignment of mechanical axis will produce better long-term clinical outcomes.
THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: Recently, the robotic-assisted TKA system has been introduced to clinical practice for TKA. Several robotic-assisted TKA systems, including CASPAR, Tsolution, ROSA, ROBODOC and Mako, have been implemented into clinical application.However, the clinical application of these robotic systems was limited due to their technical complexity, insufficient versatility and increased operative time. Until now, there are still no robotic-assisted TKA systems approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China. Therefore, more robotic-assisted TKA systems need to be designed and improved, particularly in China. Through our randomized, multicenter, single blind and parallel controlled trial, we showed that HURWA robot-assisted TKA system is a safe and effective system for TKA, which had improved knee flexion."
pub.1167809685,"CT-based, robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (Mako) through anterior approach provides improved cup placement accuracy but no difference in clinical outcomes when compared to conventional technique","BACKGROUND: With the restoration of the natural hip biomechanics, a successful total hip arthroplasty (THA) and long-term survival is pursued. Although robotic THA (rTHA) has been developed to increase accuracy of implant positioning, leg lengths and offsets, discussions about its radiological and clinical advantages over conventional THA (cTHA) continues.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of robotic and conventional THA.
METHODS: This retrospective study compares functional and radiological outcomes of 82 rTHA with a matched group of 82 cTHA in terms of age, sex, body mass index and preoperative functional scores. The minimum follow up was 12 months for all patients. Functional outcomes were Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) evaluated pre- and postoperatively. Radiological evaluations included position of cup placement according to Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones, Canal Fill Ratio (CFR), Leg Length Discrepancy (LLD), Lateral offset (LO) and Femoral Component Alignment (FCA). Complications were also evaluated.
RESULTS: In the rTHA group, 91.5% (75 out of 82) of the acetabular cups were positioned within the safe zone whereas it was 63.4% (52 out of 82) for the cTHA group (p< 0.001). According to Callanan, they were 84.1% and 50%, respectively (p< 0.001). Between the groups, no statistically significant difference was found in CFR, LLD, HO, FCA, AI, AA, WOMAC, HHS and major complication rates.
CONCLUSION: rTHA is superior to cTHA in terms of accuracy and reproducibility of the cup placement, however no apparent clinical benefit was found in short term follow."
pub.1163845541,Referencing the center of the femoral head during robotic or computer-navigated primary total knee arthroplasty results in less femoral component flexion than the traditional intramedullary axis,"BACKGROUND: During robotic and computer-navigated primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the center of the femoral head is utilized as the proximal reference point for femoral component position rather than the intramedullary axis. We sought to analyze the effect on femoral component flexion-extension position between these two reference points.
METHODS: We obtained CT 3D-reconstructions of 50 cadaveric intact femurs. We defined the navigation axis as the line from center of the femoral head to center of the knee (lowest point of the trochlear groove) and the intramedullary axis as the line from center of the knee to center of the canal at the isthmus. Differences between these axes in the sagittal plane were measured. Degree of femoral bow and femoral neck anteversion were correlated with the differences between the two femoral axes.
RESULTS: On average, the navigated axis was 1.4° (range, -1.4° to 4.1°) posterior to the intramedullary axis. As such, the femoral component would have on average 1.4° less flexion compared with techniques referencing the intramedullary canal. A more anterior intramedullary compared with navigated axis (i.e., less femoral flexion) was associated with more femoral bow (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.7, P &lt; 0.001) and less femoral neck anteversion (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5, P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Computer-navigated or robotic TKA in which the center of the femoral head is utilized as a reference point, results in 1.4° less femoral component flexion than would be achieved by referencing the intramedullary canal. Surgeons should be aware of these differences as they may ultimately influence knee kinematics."
pub.1090374871,Technology in Arthroplasty: Are We Improving Value?,"Purpose of ReviewTotal joint arthroplasty is regarded as a highly successful procedure. Patient outcomes and implant longevity, however, are related to proper alignment and position of the prostehses. In an attempt to reduce outliers and improve accuracy and precision of component position, navigation and robotics have been introduced. These technologies, however, come at a price. The goals of this review are to evaluate these technologies in total joint arthroplasty and determine if they add value.Recent FindingsRecent studies have demonstrated that navigation and robotics in total joint arthroplasty can decrease outliers while improving accuracy in component positioning. While some studies have demonstrated improved patient reported outcomes, not all studies have shown this to be true. Most studies cite increased cost of equipment and longer operating room times as the major downsides of the technologies at present. Long-term studies are just becoming available and are promising, as some studies have shown decreased revision rates when navigation is used. Finally, there are relatively few studies evaluating the direct cost and value of these technologies.SummaryNavigation and robotics have been shown to improve component position in total joint arthroplasty, which can improve patient outcomes and implant longevity. These technologies offer a promising future for total joint arthroplasty."
pub.1154909066,"Mid-Term Survivorship, Radiographic and Functional Outcomes of Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.","INTRODUCTION: The use of robotic-arm assistance for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RAUKA) has become an area of interest to overcome technical challenges, improve accuracy, and optimize patient outcomes. Due to the rise in osteoarthritis (OA) and robotic assistance, well-powered long-term studies are warranted. The aim of this study was to analyze midterm survivorship, radiographic changes, range of motion (ROM), and patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs) of RAUKA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent RAUKA for medial compartmental OA were identified from April 2009 to May 2014. The query yielded 162 knees with a mean follow up of 6.5 years. Primary endpoints were to compare survivorship, final mechanical axis alignment, radiographic changes, mean ROM, and changes to the following PROMs: Knee Society Score (KSS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Statistical analyses were primarily descriptive. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: There were no revisions of the primary implant, one case required exchange of polyethylene bearing and debridement for deep infection, and five cases required additional surgical intervention with implant retention. Overall survivorship was 100%. Radiographic assessment demonstrated no mechanical loosening or osteolysis surrounding the implant. Mean ROM was 3 to 121.9º. Patients demonstrated a mean functional KSS of 78.55, IKDC of 78.22, and OKS of 43.94.
CONCLUSIONS: The study supports excellent mid-term outcomes in patients undergoing RAUKA for medial compartment OA. Longer term follow-up studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of this technology for patients undergoing RAUKA for medial compartment OA."

CASE PRESENTATION: This case study presented three cases in which the Mako robotic device was used to help accurately implement the surgical plan. The operations went smoothly. The position and angle of the acetabular shells were placed as planned without any complications related to the operation. Postoperative Harris Hip Scores were good in two patients and poor in the patient with ankylosing spondylitis.

A Comparison Study,"Obese populations present challenges for acetabular cup placement during total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study examines the accuracy of acetabular cup inclination and version in the obese patient with robotic-assisted computer navigation. A total of 105 patients underwent robotic-assisted computer navigation THA with a posterior approach. Groups were divided on body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) of <30, 30-35, and >35. There was no statistical difference between the BMI <30 (n=59), BMI 30-35 (n=34) and BMI >35 (n=12) groups for acetabular inclination (P=0.43) or version (P=0.95). Robotic-assisted computer navigation provided accurate and reproducible placement of the acetabular cup within safe zones for inclination and version in the obese patient. "
pub.1084383399,Navigation and Robotics in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"   ➢ Navigation provides information about patient anatomy and the relative positioning of the implants to guide the surgeon.   ➢ Some systems use a robotic arm that assists with specific parts of the procedure on the basis of anatomical information provided to the navigation system. Currently, all total hip arthroplasty robotic systems require preoperative imaging.   ➢ Imageless systems rely only on intraoperative landmarks identified by the surgeon and provide feedback about limb alignment and component positioning.   ➢ The primary benefits of navigation are a reduction in outliers during acetabular cup positioning and improved accuracy when quantifying limb-length and offset measurements. It remains to be seen whether these benefits translate into meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes.   "
pub.1112399873,Efficacy and reliability of active robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty compared with conventional total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: In the field of prosthetics, the ultimate goal is to improve the clinical outcome by using a technique that prolongs the longevity of prosthesis. Active robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one such technique that is capable of providing accurate implant position and restoring mechanical alignment. Although relevant studies have been carried out, the differences in the efficacy and reliability between active robotic-assisted TKA and conventional arthroplasty have not yet been adequately discussed.
METHODS: We referenced articles, including randomised controlled trials and comparative retrospective research, from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, in order to compare active robotic-assisted TKA with the conventional technique. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted for each study. Statistical analysis was performed using Revman V. 5.3.
RESULTS: Seven studies with a total of 517 knees undergoing TKA were included. Compared with conventional surgery, active robotic TKA showed better outcomes in precise mechanical alignment (mean difference, MD: - 0.82, 95% CI: -1.15 to - 0.49, p < 0.05) and implant position, with lower outliers (p < 0.05), better functional score (Western Ontario and McMaster University, Knee Society Score functional score) and less drainage (MD: - 293.28, 95% CI: - 417.77 to - 168.79, p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed when comparing the operation time, range of motion and complication rates.
CONCLUSION: The current research demonstrates that active robotic-assisted TKA surgeries are more capable of improving mechanical alignment and prosthesis implantation when compared with conventional surgery. Further studies are required to investigate the potential benefits and long-term clinical outcomes of active robotic-assisted TKA."
pub.1133123749,"Blood transfusion, hospital stay and learning curve in robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty.","Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) has been defined the surgical procedure of the century considering its outcome and cost-benefit ratio (1). Both standard and robotic assisted procedures are increasing, thus, comparison between standard and robotic surgery become useful to understand the cost-benefit of the latter. The prerequisites of the robotic assisted arthroplasty are precision, accuracy, limitation of errors and safety but, on the other hand, its cost is the main drawback. The primary endpoint of our research was to evaluate differences in terms of blood transfusion rates between standard manual and robotic arm assisted THA. All the robotic procedures have been managed using semi active Robotic Arm interactive orthopaedic System (RIO® MAKO Stryker surgical corporation) in a group of patients who underwent primary uncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) for osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis. Secondary endpoints were the evaluation of length of hospital stay (LOS), age category, gender and the impact of the learning curve on surgical time in the robotic surgery sample. Our retrospective cohort study was conducted between July 2014 and December 2018. Data have been collected from the Tuscany regional hospital discharge register, extracting the relative Hospital Discharge Forms (SDO). During the period of the study, 1537 patients underwent uncemented total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis. The sample was divided in two subgroups: 1142 patients (74.3%) operated on with standard manual technique and 395 patients (25.7%) operated on with Mako- Stryker Robotic System. In the descriptive analysis, the average values of age and days of hospitalization with 95% CI were calculated. Mean significance was assessed by the T student test. The association between surgical modality and gender was assessed with the chi-square test. The multivariate logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk of transfusion (outcome variable), between conventional and robotic surgical techniques. The significance threshold was set up at p <0.05. During the period of the study we observed a decrease in standard surgery and an increase in robotic surgery; an increasing number of women per year underwent total uncemented total hip arthroplasty. We found a statistical significance in favor of robotic procedures in terms of transfusion percentage (OR 6.10, 95% CI 2.96-12.59, p<0,001), highlighting the greatest risk in women (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.30-2.78, p=0.001 ), length of hospital stay (Mr=4.24, SD=2.04, 95% CI 4.04-4.44) (Ms=8.04, SD=2.84, 95%CI 7.88-8.21), (p<0.01). Operative time in the robotic sample decreased substantially with the rise of surgical experience (106.75±13.4 mins in 2014; 82.79±15.95 mins in 2018) (p<0.01). Since the Robotic procedure is a technologically demanding process, an adequate surgical learning curve is mandatory.

pub.1172767183,Conventionally instrumented inverse kinematic alignment for total knee arthroplasty: How is it done?,"Purpose: For primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there is an increasing trend towards patient-specific alignment strategies such as kinematic alignment (KA) and inverse kinematic alignment (iKA), which by restoring native joint mechanics may yield higher patient satisfaction rates. Second, the most recent Australian joint registry report describes favourable revision rates for conventionally instrumented TKA compared to technology-assisted techniques such as those using navigation, robotics or custom-cutting blocks. The aim of this technique article is to describe in detail a surgical technique for TKA that: (1) utilises the principles of iKA and (2) uses conventionally instrumented guided resections thereby avoiding the use of navigation, robotics or custom blocks.
Methods: A TKA technique is described, whereby inverse kinematic principles are utilised and patient-specific alignment is achieved. Additionally, the patellofemoral compartment of the knee is restored to the native patellofemoral joint line. The sequenced technical note provided may be utilised for cemented or cementless components; cruciate retaining or sacrificing designs and for fixed or rotating platforms.
Results: An uncomplicated, robust and reproducible technique for TKA is described.
Discussion: Knee arthroplasty surgeons may wish to harness the emerging benefits of both a conventionally instrumented technique and a patient-specific alignment strategy.

pub.1158611873,Biomechanical considerations for an easily-restricted robot-assisted kinematic alignment: a surgical technique note,"BackgroundIn total knee arthroplasty, the normal kinematics of the knee may not be restored solely based on preoperative gait, fluoroscopic-based, and dynamic radiostereometric analyses.Surgical technique case presentationThis note introduced a 69-year-old male patient who sustained post-traumatic osteoarthritis of his right knee. He underwent robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty based on anatomical reproduction of knee stability during the swing phase of gait. The kinematic alignment was simply achieved within an easy-to-identified range after preoperative radiographic assessment, intraoperative landmarking and pre-validated osteotomy, and intraoperative range of motion testing.ConclusionsThis novel technique allows personalized and imageless total knee arthroplasty. It provides a preliminary path in reproducing the anatomy alignment, natural collateral ligament laxity, and accurate component placement within safe-to-identified alignment boundaries."
pub.1112469302,Robotics in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly successful operation that improves patients' quality of life and functionality. Yet, up to 20% of TKA patients remain unsatisfied with their clinical result. Robotic TKA has gained increased attention and popularity as a means of improving patient satisfaction. The promise of robotic-assisted TKA is that it provides a surgeon with a tool that accurately executes bone cuts according to presurgical planning, as well as provides the surgeon with intraoperative feedback helpful for restoring knee kinematics and soft tissue balance. Several systems are now available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Evidence that the use of robotics will lead to improved implant survival, function, and patient-reported outcomes is slowly being accumulated, but this has not been clearly proven to date. Recent literature does show that the use of robotics during TKA is not associated with increased surgical time or complications. The goal of this review is to provide an objective assessment of the evidence surrounding robotic technology for TKA."
pub.1144819602,MAKO robotic assisted total hip replacement (THR) for patients with fused hips,"BACKGROUND: Previous articles about MAKO robotic-assisted total hip replacement (THR) were mainly in patients with comparatively normal anatomy.
METHODS: From July 2020 to June 2021, we performed MAKO robotic-assisted THR in three hip-fused patients. We assessed the accuracy of prostheses implantation, collected clinical data, and discussed the value of this technique in this kind of patients.
RESULT: All three patients achieved good leg length and prostheses position. A patient got femoral artery injury during the surgery. Moreover, she developed a thrombus. All three patients got acceptable Visual Analogue Scale scores and function recovery 6 months later.
CONCLUSION: MAKO robotic-assisted THR achieved excellent prosthesis position in hip fused patients. More cases are needed to confirm this advantage. The function recovery was acceptable. Caution should be paid to protect the surrounding abnormal arteries, especially in a limited surgical field."
pub.1092905890,A Robotic Flexible Drill and Its Navigation System for Total Hip Arthroplasty,"This paper presents a robotic flexible drill and its navigation system for total hip arthroplasty (THA). The new robotic system provides an unprecedented and unique capability to perform curved femoral milling under the guidance of a multimodality navigation system. The robotic system consists of three components. Firstly, a flexible drill manipulator comprises multiple rigid segments that act as a sheath to a flexible shaft with a drill/burr attached to the end. The second part of the robotic system is a hybrid tracking system that consists of an optical tracking system and a position tracking system. Optical tracking units are used to track the surgical objects and tools outside the drilling area, while a rotary encoder placed at each joint of the sheath is synchronized to provide the position information for the flexible manipulator with its virtual object. Finally, the flexible drill is integrated into a computer-aided navigation system. The navigation system provides real time guidance to a surgeon during the procedure. The flexible drill system is then able to implement THA by bone milling. The final section of this paper is an evaluation of the flexible and steerable drill and its navigation system for femoral bone milling in sawbones."
pub.1141273328,Implementation of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty in the public health system: a comparative cost analysis,"Abstract
PurposeRobotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may improve the precision of bone preparation and component alignment when compared to the conventional surgical approach; however, the detailed cost analysis of robotic-assisted TKA is lacking. This study aims to compare in-hospital costs between robotic-assisted and computer-navigated TKA.MethodsPatients undergoing primary TKA at a public hospital in Sydney between October 2018 and June 2019 were included. Patient demographics, surgical outcomes and in-hospital cost variables including, staff, critical care, emergency department, diagnostic, prosthesis, operating room, ward and other related costs until the discharge to the community were collected. Differences across in-hospital costs between robotic-assisted and computer-navigated TKA were compared using independent Student’s t-tests.ResultsOf the 258 primary TKAs, 181 (70.2%) were computer-navigated and 77 (29.8%) robotic-assisted. Surgical time (p < 0.001) and operating time (p < 0.001) were both significantly shorter in computer-navigated TKA, while robotic-assisted TKA cases were more likely to be discharged directly home without extended in-patient rehabilitation (p = 0.014). When removing the capital costs of surgical equipment and maintenance, there was no difference in total in-hospital cost between computer-navigated ($19,512.3) and robotic-assisted TKA ($18,347.1; p = 0.179). When these capital costs were included, the mean in-hospital cost of robotic-assisted surgery was $21,507.6 compared to $19,659.7 for computer-navigated TKA (p = 0.034).ConclusionsThe total in-hospital cost, during the implementation period of robotic-assisted TKA, is comparable with computer-navigated TKA. Robotic-assisted TKA was significantly more expensive when the upfront cost of the robotic system and maintenance costs were included. Longer term cost benefit of robotic-assisted TKA should be investigated in future studies."
pub.1164942181,Short- to medium-term outcomes and future direction of reverse shoulder arthroplasty: Current concepts,"Reverse shoulder arthroplasty is typically indicated for patients with severe shoulder osteoarthritis, rotator cuff tear arthropathy, or proximal humerus fractures that have failed to heal properly. The primary goal of reverse shoulder arthroplasty is to improve shoulder function and reduce pain, while also restoring the ability to perform daily activities. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of reverse shoulder arthroplasty in improving shoulder function and reducing pain in patients with severe shoulder osteoarthritis or rotator cuff tear arthropathy. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty is associated with significant improvements in shoulder function and pain reduction compared to non-surgical treatments. This paper aims to summarize current knowledge, practices and present a summary of the long-term effects of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) on patient outcomes, including how these outcomes are defined and what measures are typically used to assess them. It will also cover newer definitions of outcomes for RSA that have been developed in recent years in order to better understand the long-term effects of the procedure on patient-reported outcomes and functional ability, as well as information on revision surgery and implant survivorship, and the future of RSA (3D-navigation, patient-specific instrumentation, robotics and artificial intelligence) and its effects on outcomes."
pub.1164994072,Mid-resection Workflow for Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty in a Stiff Knee,"Introduction: With the growing prevalence of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA), the significance of effectively addressing complex deformities using this approach is gaining widespread recognition. This article underscores the importance of a novel mid-resection workflow specifically tailored for RATKA in cases with complex deformities.
Case Report: A 58-year-old female patient diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis in both knees and a stiff left knee underwent RATKA utilizing a mid-resection workflow. The surgery resulted in favorable intraoperative stability and achieved a satisfactory range of motion. Follow-up at the 1-year post-operative mark demonstrated a range of movement of 110° and a positive functional outcome for the patient.
Conclusion: Severe knee arthritis with flexion deformity represents a common condition encountered in surgical practice. The advent of RATKA has provided us with an opportunity to assess and establish the effectiveness of mid-resection workflow in managing such cases."
pub.1171581917,Enhancing soft tissue balance: Evaluating robotic‐assisted functional positioning in varus knees across flexion and extension with quantitative sensor‐guided technology,"PURPOSE: Functional implant positioning (FIP) for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an evolution of kinematic alignment based on preoperative CT scan and robotic-assisted technology. This study aimed to assess the ligament balancing of image-based robotic-assisted TKA in extension, mid-flexion and flexion with an FIP using intraoperative sensor-guided technology. The hypothesis was that image-based robotic-assisted TKA performed by FIP would achieve ligament balancing all along the arc of knee flexion.
METHODS: This prospective monocentric study included 47 consecutive patients with varus knees undergoing image-based robotic-assisted TKA performed with FIP. After robotic-assisted bone cuts, trial components were inserted, and soft tissue balance was assessed using sensor-guided technology at 10°, 45° and 90° of knee flexion. A mediolateral balanced knee was defined by an intercompartmental pressure difference (ICPD) ≤ 15 lbf and medial and lateral compartment pressure ≤60 lbf. The mean age was 71.6 years old ±6.7, the mean BMI was 29.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ± 4.9 and the mean preoperative HKA was 174° ± 5 [159; 183].
RESULTS: The mean postoperative knee alignment was 177.0° ± 2.2° [172; 181]. There were 93.6% of balanced knees (n = 44) at 10 and 90° of knee flexion versus 76.6% (n = 36) at 45° of knee flexion with a significant difference (p = 0.014). Median ICPD at 10, 45 and 90° of knee flexion were, respectively, 7.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 9), 11.0 (IQR: 9.5) and 8.0 (IQR: 9.0). Pairwise analyses revealed differences for ICPD at 45° versus ICPD at 10° (p = 0.003) and ICPD at 90° versus ICPD at 45° (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: FIP with an image-based robotic-assisted system allowed the restoration of a well-balanced knee at 10° and 90° of flexion in varus knees. Nevertheless, some discrepancies occurred in midflexion, and more work is needed to understand ligament behaviour all along the arc of knee flexion.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II."
pub.1137043812,Better precision of a new robotically assisted system for total knee arthroplasty compared to conventional techniques: A sawbone model study,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of this new HURWA robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) technique to the accuracy of the conventional technique in a sawbone model.
METHODS: The HURWA robotic-assisted TKA system was applied in the robotic group. After bone resection, all of these sawbones were scanned by the use of a structured light scanning system. Measurements of bone resections, femoral coronal and sagittal measurements, and tibial coronal and sagittal measurements were recorded.
RESULTS: Compared to the conventional technique, the HURWA robotic-assisted system significantly improved the accuracy of the bone resection levels and angles. In the robotic group, the accuracy of all of the bone resection levels was below 0.6 mm (with standard deviation [SD] below 0.6 mm), and all of the bone resection angles were below 0.6° (with SD below 0.4°).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that this novel HURWA robotic-assisted system can significantly improve the accuracy of bone resection levels and angles."
pub.1140434430,Imageless robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty accurately restores the radiological alignment with a short learning curve: a randomized controlled trial,"PurposeThe study compared a novel imageless robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) and conventional TKA by considering (1) radiological outcomes, (2) outliers of radiological outcomes, and (3) learning curve.MethodsThis prospective randomized controlled study performed by a single surgeon evaluated 152 patients (152 knees): 75 patients undergoing RATKA and 77 patients undergoing conventional TKA. Mechanical alignment, radiological implant positioning, and outliers were analyzed for radiological outcomes. Cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis was used to assess the learning curve for operative time in RATKA.ResultsThe RATKA had significantly better accuracy of knee alignment and component positioning than conventional TKA. The hip-knee-ankle axis and implant position outliers were significantly lower in the RATKA, with 94.7% of patients had achieved an overall mechanical alignment within 3° of a neutral mechanical axis. Changes in posterior condylar offset and joint line were significantly lower in the RATKA. A learning curve of seven cases for operative time was obtained for the RATKA.ConclusionThe imageless RATKA has better alignment accuracy with a short learning curve; thus, it presents an attractive option for TKA."
pub.1010417855,Current state of computer navigation and robotics in unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review with meta‐analysis,"Recently, there is a growing interest in surgical variables that are intraoperatively controlled by orthopaedic surgeons, including lower leg alignment, component positioning and soft tissues balancing. Since more tight control over these factors is associated with improved outcomes of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), several computer navigation and robotic-assisted systems have been developed. Although mechanical axis accuracy and component positioning have been shown to improve with computer navigation, no superiority in functional outcomes has yet been shown. This could be explained by the fact that many differences exist between the number and type of surgical variables these systems control. Most systems control lower leg alignment and component positioning, while some in addition control soft tissue balancing. Finally, robotic-assisted systems have the additional advantage of improving surgical precision. A systematic search in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library resulted in 40 comparative studies and three registries on computer navigation reporting outcomes of 474,197 patients, and 21 basic science and clinical studies on robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty. Twenty-eight of these comparative computer navigation studies reported Knee Society Total scores in 3504 patients. Stratifying by type of surgical variables, no significant differences were noted in outcomes between surgery with computer-navigated TKA controlling for alignment and component positioning versus conventional TKA (p = 0.63). However, significantly better outcomes were noted following computer-navigated TKA that also controlled for soft tissue balancing versus conventional TKA (mean difference 4.84, 95 % Confidence Interval 1.61, 8.07, p = 0.003). A literature review of robotic systems showed that these systems can, similarly to computer navigation, reliably improve lower leg alignment, component positioning and soft tissues balancing. Furthermore, two studies comparing robotic-assisted with computer-navigated surgery reported superiority of robotic-assisted surgery in controlling these factors. Manually controlling all these surgical variables can be difficult for the orthopaedic surgeon. Findings in this study suggest that computer navigation or robotic assistance may help managing these multiple variables and could improve outcomes. Future studies assessing the role of soft tissue balancing in knee arthroplasty and long-term follow-up studies assessing the role of computer-navigated and robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty are needed."
pub.1164229192,Increased Femoral Component Flexion and No Difference in Slope in Robotic- versus Computer-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty When Targeting Mechanical Alignment,"Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is becoming popular due to better precision, when compared with other instrumentation. Although RAS has been validated in comparison with computer-assisted surgery (CAS), data from clinical settings comparing these two techniques are lacking. This is especially the case for sagittal alignment. Whereas pure mechanical alignment (MA) aims for 0 to 3 degrees of flexion of the femoral component and 3° of posterior slope for the tibial component, adjusted MA (aMA) mostly used with RAS allows for flexing of the femoral component for downsizing and increase of slope for an increase of the flexion gap. In the present study, we compared sagittal alignment after TKA using RAS with aMA and CAS targeting MA, which has been the standard in the center for more than 10 years. We analyzed a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing TKA in a single center. Femoral component flexion and tibial slope were compared for both techniques. In 140 patients, 68 CAS and 72 RAS, we found no difference in tibial slope (<i>p</i> = 0.661), 1° median femoral component flexion (<i>p</i> = 0.023), and no difference in outliers (femur, <i>p</i> = 0.276, tibia, <i>p</i> = 0.289). RAS slightly increases femoral component flexion, but has no influence on tibial slope, when compared with CAS in TKA. If MA is the target, RAS provides no benefit over CAS for achieving the targeted sagittal alignment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:  Level III retrospective study."
pub.1156255109,The Effect of Minor Adjustments to Tibial and Femoral Component Position on Soft Tissue Balance in Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Ideal goals for alignment and balance in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain controversial. We aimed to compare initial alignment and balance using mechanical alignment (MA) and kinematic alignment (KA) techniques and to analyze the percentage of knees that could achieve balance using limited adjustments to component position.
METHODS: Prospective data on 331 primary robotic TKAs (115 MAs and 216 KAs) were analyzed. Medial and lateral virtual gaps were recorded in both flexion and extension. A computer algorithm was used to calculate potential (theoretical) implant alignment solutions to achieve balance within 1 millimeter (mm) without soft tissue release given an alignment philosophy (MA or KA), angular boundaries (±1, ±2, or ±3°), and gap targets (equal gaps or lateral laxity allowed). The percentage of knees that could theoretically achieve balance was compared.
RESULTS: Less than 5% of TKAs were initially balanced. Limited adjustments to component position increased the percentage of TKAs that could be balanced in a graduated manner, with no difference between MA and KA start points: adjustments of ±1 (10% versus 6%, P = .17), ±2 (42% versus 39%, P = .61), or of ±3 (54% versus 51%, P = .66). A higher percentage of TKAs could be balanced when a greater range for lateral gap laxity was allowed. Balancing from KA resulted in increased joint line obliquity in the final implant alignment.
CONCLUSION: A high percentage of TKAs can be balanced without soft tissue release using minor adjustments to component position. Surgeons should consider the relationship between alignment and balance goals when optimizing component positioning in TKA."
pub.1173390042,No evidence of mid-flexion instability after robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty as assessed by intraoperative pressure sensors,"PurposeMid-flexion instability has been identified as a cause for dissatisfaction following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Robotic-assisted surgery using the Mako robot only allows for assessment of stability at 10° and 90°. This study aimed to investigate any evidence of mid-flexion instability in Mako-assisted TKA.MethodsData from 72 TKA in 59 patients from 2018 to 2022 were collected. All patients underwent an RA (Mako, Stryker, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA), single-radius design, cruciate-retaining TKA. Intraoperatively, medial, and lateral pressures were measured at 10°, 45° and 90° of flexion using a pressure sensor (Verasense, OrthoSensor, 59 Inc., Dania Beach, FL, USA). The knee was considered balanced if the difference in pressures between compartments was less than 15 pounds-force (lbf).ResultsThere was no significant difference between the pressures measured in the medial compartment at 10°, 45° and 90° of flexion (P = 0.696). A statistically significant difference was found between the pressures measured in the lateral compartment at 10°, 45° and 90° of flexion, with the 10° value being significantly higher (P < 0.001), but this did not exceed the threshold of 15 lbf. None of the patients had a pressure difference of more than 15 lbf when pressures at 45° were compared to that at 10° and 90°, medially or laterally.ConclusionThis study showed no evidence of mid-flexion instability in Mako-assisted TKA, using a single radius, cruciate-retaining prosthesis whilst maintaining the joint height.Level of evidenceLevel III retrospective cohort study."
pub.1126024644,How should we evaluate robotics in the operating theatre?,"The application of robotics in the operating theatre for knee arthroplasty remains controversial. As with all new technology, the introduction of new systems might be associated with a learning curve. However, guidelines on how to assess the introduction of robotics in the operating theatre are lacking. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current evidence on the learning curve of robot-assisted knee arthroplasty. An extensive literature search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted. Randomized controlled trials, comparative studies, and cohort studies were included. Outcomes assessed included: time required for surgery, stress levels of the surgical team, complications in regard to surgical experience level or time needed for surgery, size prediction of preoperative templating, and alignment according to the number of knee arthroplasties performed. A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most were of medium to low quality. The operating time of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is associated with a learning curve of between six to 20 cases and six to 36 cases respectively. Surgical team stress levels show a learning curve of seven cases in TKA and six cases for UKA. Experience with the robotic systems did not influence implant positioning, preoperative planning, and postoperative complications. Robot-assisted TKA and UKA is associated with a learning curve regarding operating time and surgical team stress levels. Future evaluation of robotics in the operating theatre should include detailed measurement of the various aspects of the total operating time, including total robotic time and time needed for preoperative planning. The prior experience of the surgical team should also be evaluated and reported. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2020;102-B(4):407-413."
pub.1168486079,Interpreting the Current Literature on Outcomes of Robotic-Assisted Versus Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty Using Fragility Analysis: A Systematic Review and Cross-Sectional Study of Randomized Controlled Trials,"BACKGROUND: Fragility analysis is a method of further characterizing outcomes in terms of the stability of statistical findings. This study assesses the statistical fragility of recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating robotic-assisted versus conventional total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA versus C-TKA).
METHODS: We queried PubMed for RCTs comparing alignment, function, and outcomes between RA-TKA and C-TKA. Fragility index (FI) and reverse fragility index (RFI) (collectively, ""FI"") were calculated for dichotomous outcomes as the number of outcome reversals needed to change statistical significance. Fragility quotient (FQ) was calculated by dividing the FI by the sample size for that outcome event. Median FI and FQ were calculated for all outcomes collectively as well as for each individual outcome. Subanalyses were performed to assess FI and FQ based on outcome event type and statistical significance, as well as study loss to follow-up and year of publication.
RESULTS: The overall median FI was 3.0 (interquartile range, [IQR] 1.0 to 6.3) and the median reverse fragility index was 3.0 (IQR 2.0 to 4.0). The overall median FQ was 0.027 (IQR 0.012 to 0.050). Loss to follow-up was greater than FI for 23 of the 38 outcomes assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: A small number of alternative outcomes is often enough to reverse the statistical significance of findings in RCTs evaluating dichotomous outcomes in RA-TKA versus C-TKA. We recommend reporting FI and FQ alongside P values to improve the interpretability of RCT results."
pub.1181786622,Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty is Associated with Thinner and Less Constrained Polyethylene Inserts.,"INTRODUCTION: Accurate pre-resection assessment of gap measurements during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may reduce the need for thicker polyethylene inserts or those with higher constraint by allowing the surgeon to address potential imbalance through guiding bony resections and implant position. This study aimed to determine whether robotic assistance with pre-planning allowed for the use of thinner and less-constrained polyethylene inserts compared to conventional methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records were retrospectively reviewed for 408 patients who underwent primary TKA. Patients were divided into cohorts based on the technique utilized-conventional, manual methods with a jig-based system (CM-TKA, 169 knees) versus robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA, 237 knees). Operative notes were reviewed for implant brand, thickness of the polyethylene insert, degree of constraint of the polyethylene insert, and whether robotic assistance was used to complete the operation. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square tests for categorical and t-tests for continuous variables.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between the RA-TKA and CM-TKA groups. Statistically significant differences were observed between cohorts in mean polyethylene insert thickness (11.0mm ± 1.3mm vs. 11.7mm ± 1.7mm, p<0.0001), rate of use of the thinnest 10mm insert (43% vs. 34%, p=0.048), rate of ""outlier"" insert sizes ≥14mm (5% vs. 18%, p<0.0001), and rate of constrained insert use (4% vs. 18% of knees, p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: In a review of 408 consecutive TKA patients, use of robotic-assisted techniques allowed for the use of thinner polyethylene inserts, fewer ""outlier"" polyethylene sizes, and reduced need for constrained inserts compared to conventional, manual methods."
pub.1165701634,Comparison of Pelvic Landmarks for Leg Length Discrepancy Measurement With Robotic Arm-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Background: Leg length discrepancy (LLD) is a common complication after total hip arthroplasty (THA) leading to significant morbidity and dissatisfaction for patients. A popular system for robotic arm-assisted THA utilizes preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans for surgical planning. Accurate measurement of leg length is crucial for restoring appropriate patient anatomy during the procedure. This study investigates the interobserver and interlandmark reliability of 3 different pelvic landmarks for measuring preoperative LLD.
Methods: We compiled preoperative pelvic CT scans from 99 robotic arm-assisted THAs for osteoarthritis. Radiologic leg length measurement was performed using the robotic arm-assisted THA application by 2 orthopaedic residents using reference lines bisecting the following pelvic landmarks: the anterior superior iliac spines, acetabular teardrops, and most inferior aspect of the ischial rami.
Results: On multivariate analysis, there was no significant difference found (<i>P</i> value = .924) for leg length measurement based on the 3 different pelvic anatomical landmarks. Leg length measurements showed interobserver reliability with significant Pearson correlation coefficients (r = 1.0, 0.94, 0.96, respectively) and nonsignificant differences in LLD means between subjects on paired sample (<i>P</i> value = .158, .085, 0.125, respectively) as well as between landmarks on pairwise comparison.
Conclusions: The 3 pelvic landmarks used in this study can be used interchangeably with the lesser trochanter as the femoral reference point to evaluate preoperative LLD on pelvic CT in patients undergoing robotic-arm assisted THA. This study is the first of its kind to evaluate the interobserver and interlandmark reliability of anatomical landmarks on pelvic CT scans and suggests interchangeability of 3 pelvic landmarks for comparing leg length differences."
pub.1146805837,Functional Alignment Philosophy in Total Knee Arthroplasty – Rationale and technique for the varus morphotype using a CT based robotic platform and individualized planning,"INTRODUCTION: Alignment techniques in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) continue to evolve. Functional alignment (FA) is a novel technique that utilizes robotic tools to deliver TKA with the aim of respecting individual anatomical variations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the rationale and technique of FA in the varus morphotype with the use of a robotic platform.
RATIONALE: FA reproduces constitutional knee anatomy within quantifiable target ranges. The principles are founded on a comprehensive assessment and understanding of individual anatomical variations with the aim of delivering personalized TKA. The principles are functional pre-operative planning, reconstitution of native coronal alignment, restoration of dynamic sagittal alignment within 5° of neutral, maintenance of joint-line-obliquity and height, implant sizing to match anatomy and a joint that is balanced in flexion and extension through manipulation of implant positioning rather than soft tissue releases.
TECHNIQUE: An individualized plan is created from pre-operative imaging. Next, a reproducible and quantifiable method of soft tissue laxity assessment is performed in extension and flexion that accounts for individual variation in soft tissue laxity. A dynamic virtual 3D model of the joint and implant position that can be manipulated in all three planes is modified to achieve target gap measurements while maintaining the joint line phenotype and a final limb position within a defined coronal and sagittal range.
CONCLUSION: Functional alignment is a novel knee arthroplasty technique that aims to restore constitutional bony alignment and balance the laxity of the soft tissues by placing and sizing implants in a manner that it respects the variations in individual anatomy. This paper presents the approach for the varus morphotype."
pub.1166596171,Varus/valgus stability in imageless robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty applying three-dimensional assessment of varus/valgus stress X-rays,"BACKGROUND: The postoperative varus/valgus stability assessment in stress X-rays has been established as an evaluation index. However, it is performed by the two-dimensional (2D) method rather than the three-dimensional (3D) method.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the precision and reproducibility of measuring varus/valgus stress X-rays three-dimensionally and to examine varus/valgus stability under anesthesia in imageless robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA).
METHODS: This prospective study analyzed 52 consecutive rTKAs (five males, 67 ± 5.3 years; 47 females, 74 ± 5.9 years). Postoperative varus/valgus stress X-rays in knee extension under anesthesia at manual maximum stress were three-dimensionally assessed by 2D-3D image matching technique using the 3D bone and component models. Varus/valgus angle between components (VV angle) in no stress, valgus stress, varus stress, medial joint opening (MJO), and lateral joint opening (LJO) were evaluated, clarifying this method's precision and reproducibility and valgus/varus stability.
RESULTS: All parameters' precision and reproducibility had <1° mean differences and high intra- and inter-class correlation coefficients. Bland-Altman plots showed no fixed and proportional bias. Non-stress VV angle, valgus VV angle, varus VV angle, MJO, and LJO were 3.6 ± 1.2°, 1.0 ± 1.4°, 7.1 ± 1.9°, 1.5 ± 1.0 mm, and 2.8 ± 2.7 mm, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This prospective study demonstrated that (1) the three-dimensional measurement method provided sufficient precision and reproducibility, and (2) the rTKAs could achieve good postoperative varus/valgus stability with a small standard deviation."
pub.1164210760,Safe Zones and Trajectory of Femoral Pin Placement in Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty may result in array pin-related complications. Lack of knowledge on ideal pin placement results in varied insertion sites and trajectory, with unknown risks to surrounding neurovascular structures.
Methods: This study included 10 lower-extremity magnetic resonance images. Images were subdivided into 6 zones of study. Zones consisted of a correlating axial image with femoral pin placement replicated by drawing a line angled 45° from the anterior to posterior reference in the anteromedial to posterolateral femoral quadrants. The distances from the pin paths to the neurovascular structures were measured.
Results: Zone 2C demonstrated femoral pin trajectory an average of 14 mm from the femoral artery/vein. In Zone 2B, proximity increased to an average of 30 mm to the femoral artery and 29 mm to the femoral vein. At Zone 1A, the popliteal artery and vein were on average 22 mm from the femoral pin, while the common peroneal nerve was an average of 21 mm. Placing pins in Zone 1A poses a high risk of injury to the genicular arteries. Women demonstrated greater proximity to neurovascular structures than men in 66% of the sites (<i>P</i> &lt; .05).
Conclusions: This classification system for safe zones and trajectory of femoral pin placement in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty demonstrates that proximally, the profunda femoris and femoral artery/vein are at risk of injury, while distally, the genicular arteries, common peroneal nerve, and popliteal artery/vein are at risk. Caution should be exercised if femoral pins are inserted with an angle less than 45°, especially in women."
pub.1137684070,Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a review,"PurposePresented here is an up-to-date review concerning robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (rUKA), including its rationale, operative system, pros and cons.MethodsWe did a systematic research in electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase up to March 30, 2020 to retrieve literature pertaining to rUKA. The search strategies “(robotic* AND knee arthroplasty OR knee replacement)” and “(knee arthroplasty OR knee replacement NOT total)” were used. Studies describing rUKA and clinical trials, dry bone or cadaveric researches regarding technologies, positioning, alignment, function, or survivorship of implants were included in this review. All retrieved studies were first browsed for eligibility on the basis of title and abstract, and the selected studies were further evaluated by reading full text for final inclusion.ResultsRobotic-assisted technology has been found to increase the accuracy of bone preparation and implant placement, reduce technical variability and outliers, and enhance reproduction of limb alignment. Additionally, early clinical outcomes were excellent, but mid-term follow-up showed no superiority in component survivorship. The potential drawbacks of the robotic-assisted technology include relatively-low time- and cost-effectiveness, development of some rUKA-related complications, and lack of support by high-quality literature.ConclusionThis review shows that rUKA can decrease the number of outliers concerning the optimal implant positioning and limb alignment. However, due to absence of extensive studies on clinical outcomes and long-term results, it remains unclear whether the improved component positioning translates to better clinical outcomes or long-term survivorship of the implant. Nevertheless, since an accurate implant position is presumably beneficial, robotic-assisted technology is worth recommendation in UKA."
pub.1181452817,Same same but different—Image‐based versus imageless robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty!,"Abstract   Robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) has gained widespread acceptance due to its demonstrated ability to improve surgical accuracy compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty (CTKA). While the precise impact of RTKA on postoperative patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) remains inconclusive, the increased accuracy in alignment and joint kinematics suggests potential improvements in patient satisfaction and functional outcomes. Two primary RTKA systems exist: image‐based, which uses preoperative CT scans for detailed 3D modeling, and image‐less, which relies on intra‐operative digitization of anatomical landmarks. Both systems aim to achieve accurate implant placement and soft‐tissue balancing, yet they differ in methodology and reliance on preoperative data. Despite RTKA's theoretical advantages, there is ongoing debate about whether accuracy alone is sufficient to achieve optimal postoperative outcomes, particularly concerning joint kinematics and alignment strategies. Literature reveals no significant difference in coronal plane alignment between image‐based and image‐less systems, though image‐less systems may be more prone to varus errors due to the reliance on intra‐articular landmarks. Additionally, image‐free systems may face challenges in replicating native knee anatomy, especially in the sagittal plane, leading to potential limitations in achieving ideal tibial slope reconstruction. The future of RTKA may lie in refining implant positioning strategies that minimize postoperative alterations to pre‐arthritic knee kinematics, particularly with standardized off‐the‐shelf implants. As robotic technology evolves, there is potential to enhance surgical outcomes by combining accuracy with personalized alignment approaches that better address individual patient anatomy. Further research is needed to assess the long‐term clinical benefits of RTKA and its capacity to improve patient‐specific functional outcomes.   Level of evidence level 5 "
pub.1172150423,Comparing a robotic imageless second-generation system to traditional instrumentation in total knee arthroplasty: A matched cohort analysis,"Introduction: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) has gained interest from patients and surgeons alike. Robotic systems assist with gap balancing and bone cut accuracy, which can theoretically minimize post-operative pain by decreasing soft tissue damage. This study compared perioperative results, 30- and 90-day complications, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and survivorship to all-cause revisions between patients undergoing traditional versus rTKA.
Methods: A total of 430 TKAs (215 rTKA, 215 traditional) by two fellowship trained arthroplasty surgeons were retrospectively reviewed from 2017 to 2022. All rTKAs were performed using the CORI Surgical System (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, Tennessee). Cohorts were propensity score matched by age, sex, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologist classification. Blood loss, surgical times, length of stays, 30- and 90-day complications, pain scores and PROs were compared with univariable analyses. Cox regression analyses evaluated survival to all-cause revisions.
Results: Patients undergoing rTKA had a higher incidence of discharge home (86.5 %-60.0 %) (p < 0.01). There was no difference in blood loss or surgical time. rTKA pain scores were lower in-hospital mean 2 (range, 0 to 9) vs 3 (range, 0 to 9) (p = 0.02) as well as at one-year post-operatively, mean 1 (range, 0 to 7) vs 2 (range, 0 to 10) (p = 0.02). Cox hazard ratio demonstrated no difference in survival to all-cause revisions (HR 1.3; CI 0.5 to 3.7) (p = 0.64).
Conclusion: This matched cohort analysis demonstrated potential short-term benefits associated with imageless second generation rTKA including improved early post-operative pain, without compromising survivorship to all-cause revisions."
pub.1170073045,Is 80% satisfaction still the expectation in modern TKA mechanically aligned with robot assist? We think not,"Several studies reported that20% of patients were unhappy with the outcome of their total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Having commenced robot assist TKA whilst maintaining the goal of implanting the prosthesis to a neutral mechanical axis, we reviewed our patients to find out if we also have a 20% rate of patients being unhappy with the outcome of their knee replacement surgery. We hypothesized that rate of patient satisfaction would be higher than 90% with robot-surgical assistant (ROSA) technique. The first 175 patients who underwent ROSA TKA were reviewed at a minimum of 1 year postoperatively. All TKAs were performed using ROSA technique with Persona cementless prosthesis aiming to restore neutral mechanical coronal alignment with flexion gap balancing. We investigated whether or not the patients were happy they had their knee replacement surgery and whether they were happy with the outcome. 165 (94%) of 175 patients, were contactable with 1 deceased and 9 uncontactable. From the 165 patients who participated in the study, 95% of patients were happy they had the surgery done and 93% were happy with the outcome of their knee replacement. A sub analysis showed that patients who had simultaneous bilateral TKA were significantly less likely to be happy than staged procedures (p < 0.05). Total knee replacement utilising robot technique with modern implants and aiming for mechanical coronal alignment of the implants to restore the mechanical axis with flexion gap balancing may result in > 90% of patients being happy with the outcome of their surgery."
pub.1155061968,Ligament Tension and Balance before and after Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty — Dynamic Changes with Increasing Applied Force,"The optimal force applied during ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is not well understood. We quantified the effect of increasing distraction force on medial and lateral gaps throughout the range of knee motion, both prior to and after femoral resections in tibial-first gap-balancing TKA. Twenty-five consecutive knees in 21 patients underwent robotic-assisted TKA. The posterior cruciate ligament was resected, and the tibia was cut neutral to the mechanical axis. A digital ligament tensioning tool recorded gaps and applied equal mediolateral loads of 70 N (baseline), 90 N, and 110 N from 90 degrees to full extension. A gap-balancing algorithm planned the femoral implant position to achieve a balanced knee throughout flexion. After femoral resections, gap measurements were repeated under the same conditions. Paired <i>t</i>-tests identified gap differences between load levels, medial/lateral compartments, and flexion angle. Gaps increased from 0 to 20 degrees in flexion, then remain consistent through 90 degrees of flexion. Baseline medial gap was significantly smaller than lateral gap throughout flexion (<i>p</i> &lt;0.05). Increasing load had a larger effect on the lateral versus medial gaps (<i>p</i> &lt;0.05) and on flexion versus extension gaps. Increasing distraction force resulted in non-linear and asymmetric gap changes mediolaterally and from flexion to extension. Digital ligament tensioning devices can give better understanding of the relationship between joint distraction, ligament tension, and knee stiffness throughout the range of flexion. This can aid in informed surgical decision making and optimal soft tissue tensioning during TKA."
pub.1154505905,Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the fully automated active robotic system in robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty,"Background: Use of semi-active and active robotic system for performing Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is increasing. The novel fully automated active robotic system performs milling of the bone surfaces with a high speed burr. The aim of the current study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the system in robotic assisted TKA (RA-TKA).
Materials and methods: A single center clinical trial was conducted following 30 knees undergoing active RA-TKA for 6 months. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing RA-TKA for end stage arthritis. Patients undergoing conventional TKA and revision TKA were excluded from the study. Sample size was estimated to be 28 patients with α error of 0.05 and β error of 0.2 with power of study being 80. A pre-defined list of RA-TKA adverse events was employed to study the safety of the system. Efficacy was judged by comparing the planned versus achieved Implant size, alignment and limb alignment on post-operative radiographs. The post-operative clinical evaluation was done by an independent observer who was not part of the operating team. The primary safety and efficacy hypothesis was tested using a one sided Exact binomial test. The p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: Pre-defined adverse events did not occur in any of the 30 RA-TKA (statistically significant p value < 0.001). The implant size accuracy was 100% (30 out of 30 knees) for femoral component and 96.67% (29 out of 30 knees) for tibial component (statistically significant, Chi-squared test, p value 0.0105 and 0.0461 respectively). The implant position and limb alignment was accurate in 100% of patients (p value < 0.001).
Conclusion: Early experience of the use of fully automated active robotic system in TKA shows that it is safe and also is effective in achieving accurate implant size and implant/limb alignment."
pub.1041693000,Comparison Between Hand Rasping and Robotic Milling for Stem Implantation in Cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty,"We evaluated the effects of conventional hand rasping and robotic milling on the clinical and radiographic results of cementless total hip arthroplasty, with the same computed tomography (CT)-based 3-dimensional preoperative planning using a ROBODOC workstation (Integrated Surgical Systems, Davis, Calif). The robotic milling group consisted of 78 hips, and the hand-rasping group 78 hips. The radiographic findings from the preoperative planning and postoperative CT data were evaluated using the most accurate CT images reconstructed by the ROBODOC workstation. The robotic milling group showed significant superior Merle D'Aubigne hip score at 2 years. In the robotic milling group, there were no intraoperative femoral fractures, and a radiographically superior implant fit was obtained. Hand rasping had the potential to cause intraoperative femoral fractures, undersizing of the stem, unexpectedly higher vertical seating, and unexpected femoral anteversion causing inferior implant fit."
pub.1106289696,Value proposition of robotic total knee arthroplasty: what can robotic technology deliver in 2018 and beyond?,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has undergone marked development and increasingly gained interest with multiple studies demonstrating excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes. However, a value assessment that encompasses other aspects related to the adoption of this technology is necessary to fully appreciate the cost/benefit ratio and potential present and future returns. Due to the relative paucity of evidence, this review was conducted to compare newer generation robotic TKA systems vs. historic ones and we evaluated: 1) clinical outcomes; 2) radiographic outcomes; 3) safety; 4) learning curve; 5) operating room efficiency; 6) effect on ergonomic health; and 7) cost analysis of robotic - assisted TKA to understand their value proposition.
AREAS COVERED: Comprehensive and detailed discussion of past and contemporary robotic-arm assisted TKA systems. What are the clinical and radiological outcomes and how robotic systems have evolved to offer potential advantages in 2018.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Robotic systems for TKA have undergone substantial development with proven excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes. However, there are still limitations to overcome. Overall, recent robotic technology is on a steep curve of adoption and expected only to grow, backed by the demonstrated clinical success and cost - benefit value that is projected to favor further growth."
pub.1030382394,Accuracy of Dynamic Tactile-Guided Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) can achieve excellent clinical and functional results for patients having single-compartment osteoarthritis. However, UKA is considered to be technically challenging to perform, and malalignment of implant components significantly contributes to UKA failures. It has been shown that surgical navigation and tactile robotics could be used to provide very accurate component placement when the bones were rigidly fixed in a stereotactic frame during preparation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the clinically realized accuracy of UKA component placement using surgical navigation and tactile robotics when the bones are free to move. A group of 20 knees receiving medial UKA with dynamically referenced tactile-robotic assistance was studied. Implant placement errors were comparable with those achieved using tactile robotics with rigid stereotactic fixation."
pub.1009227672,Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"Precise and accurate biomechanical reconstruction during total hip arthroplasty (THA) is essential for durable long-term survivorship. Accurate fit of cementless hip implants is also crucial to reduce micromotion between the bone-implant interfaces to allow for stable osseointegration. Robotic technology aims to minimize potential human errors and improve implant alignment and fit, and address persisting concerns with modern-day cementless THA. Although robotic THA dates back to the early 1990s, concerns with increased operating times, costs, and complications led to its withdrawal. However, semi-active systems have renewed interest in robot-assisted joint arthroplasty. We reviewed the current technology, its potential benefits, and the reported clinical and radiographic outcomes. Early evidence suggests that robotic use may lead to more accurate reconstruction of radiographic parameters, such as implant positioning, fit, center-of-rotation, and leg-length discrepancy. Further research is needed to determine if these will translate into better outcomes and improved implant longevity to justify increased costs. "

The combination of severe osteoarthritis with extra-articular deformities made the RATKA method the best surgical treatment option taking into account altered kinematics of the native joint which conventional jig-based total knee arthroplasty would not have prioritized during bony cuts and implant positioning. The patient underwent successful knee arthroplasty with robotic arm-assisted technology with restoration of the mechanical axis."

pub.1128748434,Robotic-Assisted Versus Manual Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a feasible alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for selected patients with severe single-compartment knee osteoarthritis. Robotic-assisted UKA (rUKA) has recently emerged as a complementary tool to ameliorate previous difficulties with manual UKA (mUKA). However, the influence of rUKA compared to mUKA on patient outcomes are still largely unknown.
PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of the manual technique and a single robotic-assisted system in patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed-Medline was searched using terms: ""robotic,"" ""unicompartmental,"" ""knee,"" and ""arthroplasty"" to identify all studies comparing outcomes of mUKA and rUKA. Data pertaining to the following outcomes were extracted: (1) studies comparing robotic-assisted UKA to manual UKA; (2) reports which only included the Mako UKA system (Mako Surgical Corporation, Fort Lauderdale, Florida) as the robotic-assisted system; and (3) studies which discussed implant survivorship, complications, early postoperative parameters, functional outcomes, or implant positioning. Review articles were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of eight publications with 337 patients who underwent rUKA and 481 who underwent mUKA were included in our analysis. Two studies reported that early postoperative pain was decreased with rUKA compared to mUKA. In one study, pain levels in the first eight postoperative weeks were 54% lower in the rUKA group and in the other, pain scores based on the numeric rating scale were significantly lower in rUKA (2.5) compared to mUKA (4.2) upon discharge (p<0.001). Furthermore, mean time to hospital discharge in this study was reduced with rUKA (42.5 ± 5.9 hours) compared to mUKA (71.1 ± 14.6 hours) (p<0.001). One study demonstrated a significant improvement in range of motion at two-year follow up in the rUKA group (15°, range, 5° to 25°) compared to the mUKA group (10°, range 0° to 20°; p=0.04). One study reported that at three-month follow up, mean Knee Society scores were significantly better in the rUKA group (164; interquartile range [IQR] 131 to 178) compared the mUKA group (143; IQR 132 to 166; p=0.04). Three studies reported more accurate implant positioning with rUKA compared to mUKA. Among the five studies that reported implant survivorship, four studies (including a randomized control trial) found no difference between techniques in implant survival rate, while one retrospective analysis reported improved survivorship with mUKA.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty implants demonstrated comparable survivorship rates whether performed manually or with robotic assistance. However, compared to the manually performed procedure, robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty were found to offer benefits including shorter lengths of hospital stays, decreased postoperative pain scores, and improved functional outcomes."

pub.1152643535,What are the perceived benefits and barriers to the use of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty? A survey of members of the European Knee Society,"PurposeMembers of the European Knee Society (EKS) recently took part in an online questionnaire on robot-assisted TKA. The purpose of this study was to report and analyse the questionnaire results on the demographics of users versus non-users, the drivers for users of the technology, and the barriers or limitations that hinder the uptake of robot-assisted TKA.MethodsThe questionnaire was composed of 16 questions covering surgeon demographics and drivers for or barriers to the use of robotics. Responses on four- or five-point Likert scales were trichotomised depending on the type of question (“not important” – “moderately important” – “important/very important” or “fully disagree/disagree” – “neutral” – “agree/fully agree”). Consensus on a statement was defined as at least 75% agreement.ResultsThere was a 67% response rate. Forty-five surgeons performed conventional TKA, of which 78% aimed for systematic alignment, while 22 performed robot-assisted TKA, of which 82% aimed for individualised alignment, and 16 performed technology-assisted TKA, of which 56% aimed for systematic alignment. Respondents agreed that robotics significantly impact accuracy of bone cuts (51/62, 82%), intra-operative feedback on ligament balancing (56/62, 90%) as well as bone cut orientation and implant positioning (57/ 62, 92%), and assistance to customise alignment (56/62, 90%). Respondents agreed that associated costs (14/18, 78%) are an important aspect for not using or to stop using robotics.ConclusionThe majority of respondents still perform conventional TKA (54%), while only a small portion perform robot-assisted TKA (27%) or other technology-assisted TKA (19%). Most robot users aim for individualised lower limb alignment, whereas most other surgeons aimed for systematic lower limb alignment. There is consensus that robotic assistance has a positive impact on accuracy of bone cuts and alignment, but no consensus on its impact on other peri- or post-operative outcomes. Finally, the associated cost of robot-assisted TKA remains the main barrier to its uptake.Level of evidence: V"

METHODS: All patients who underwent knee arthroplasty from 2009 to 2013 in NYS SPARCS were reviewed. raKAs and non-raKAs were compared for utilization and institutional trends.
RESULTS: Robotic-assistance increased by 500%. 80% of raKAs were performed in teaching hospitals. The trend increase was greater in teaching hospitals. Blood transfusion rates differed between raKA and non-raKA (6.6% vs. 10.9%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: raKA utilization increased in NYS, moreso within teaching hospitals. raKA transfusion rates were lower but higher in teaching hospitals, potentially related to learning curve."
pub.1142938430,Utilization of Robotic Arm Assistance for Revision of Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Case Report,"INTRODUCTION: With increasing numbers of knee arthroplasty procedures being performed, revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains a challenge to orthopedic surgeons. The use of robotics in primary joint arthroplasty is also increasing due to better technology and surgeon familiarity. Robotic arms have the ability to execute bone cuts within 1 mm of a preoperative plan, can measure soft tissue gap tension, and can plan femoral and tibial augments and rotation. The use of robotic arm assistance for revision TKA, however, has not been documented in the literature.
CASE REPORT: We present a case describing a novel technique in which the Mako robot (Stryker, Ft. Lauderdale, FL) was utilized for revision of a failed primary TKA secondary to aseptic loosening. The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who underwent right revision TKA with robotic assistance. Stryker Triathlon TS implants were utilized with the use of both femoral and tibial cones and medial and lateral posterior femoral augments. He had satisfactory component alignment based on postoperative radiographs, and excellent clinical outcomes 6 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: The use of robotic arm assistance in revision TKA for failed primary TKA is a novel technique and resulted in excellent operative outcomes in this case. Further study should be done to confirm its use in revision TKA."

pub.1163225922,Publishing on Topical Subjects in Total Joint Arthroplasty Is Associated With Increased Social Media Attention,"BACKGROUND: Social media platforms are often used for research dissemination and collaboration. Given the increased prevalence of online-only publications, understanding what drives research dissemination is important. Here, we analyzed factors associated with increased social media attention among peer-reviewed publications in total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: We analyzed publications about total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty from 2010 to 2022 using a national database. We analyzed a weighted count of social media mentions, using negative binomial regressions adjusting for days since publication. Publications on ""hot topics"" in arthroplasty were examined including navigation/robotics, COVID-19, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and reimbursement. There were 9,542 publications included, 4,216 (44%) were open access (OA), 338 (3.5%) included navigation, 32 (0.34%) discussed race/ethnicity, 20 (0.2%) discussed COVID-19, 3,840 (40%) were randomized studies, 30 (0.3%) discussed reimbursement, and 2,867 (30%) were in top-10 orthopaedic journals.
RESULTS: Factors associated with higher weighted score included studies about COVID-19 (50 versus 6.0, P < .001), race/ethnicity (15.8 versus 6.0, P < .001), OA status (6.3 versus 5.8, P = .001), and randomized studies (6.5 versus 5.7, P < .001). Studies from top-10 journals had a lower score (5.8 versus 6.2, P = .025), as did studies about body mass index (3.4 versus 6.1, P = .001). Studies about navigation and reimbursement did not have significantly different scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies on COVID-19, race/ethnicity, randomized studies, and OA publication were associated with increased social media while those in top-10 orthopaedic journals had lower scores.

pub.1015290665,No functional impairment after Robodoc total hip arthroplasty,"The Robodoc total hip replacement procedure requires a wider exposure of the proximal femur, especially of the greater trochanter, than the standard procedure. Moreover, the leg must be placed in a rigid leg-holder apparatus to obtain fixation in maximal hip adduction and external rotation. This may impair the hip abductors and reduce hip abduction in the mid- and terminal stance phase of the cycle. In this study we compared patients after Robodoc and conventional total hip arthroplasty with three-dimensional gait analysis (VICON System, Oxford Metrics, Oxford, U.K.) to assess the kinematics of the pelvis and hip. 25 patients underwent total hip replacement by means of the Robodoc total hip arthroplasty system, 25 patients were treated with conventional total hip replacement, and 40 healthy volunteers served as controls. None of the patients undergoing total hip replacement, robotic or conventional, obtained normal kinematic gait patterns 6 months after surgery. However, the reduction in hip abduction did not differ significantly in patients undergoing robotic or conventional total hip arthroplasty, which suggests that the robotic procedure did not impair hip abductor function more than the conventional method."

The purpose of this study was to compare alignment accuracy and early clinical outcomes between a CT-based, saw cutting robotic system (MAKO) and a CT-free, jig-guided robotic system (ROSA) for total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: A total of 20 MAKO TKAs and 20 ROSA TKAs from June 2021 to June 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Differences in the postoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), posterior tibial slope (PTS) and 3° outlier frequency of the HKA, LDFA, MPTA and PTS were studied at 3 months and 1 year of follow-up. The operative time and total blood loss (TBL) were compared between these two groups. Clinical outcomes at 1 year after surgery, including range of motion (ROM), Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and Knee Society Score-2011 (KSS-2011), were also compared between these two groups.
RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. There were no significant differences in the mean deviations of postoperative HKA, LDFA, MPTA or PTS between the two groups at 3 months or 1 year (all ps > 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the percentage of 3° outliers for HKA, LDFA, MPTA, or PTS between the two groups at 3-month or 1-year follow-up (all ps > 0.05). The mean operation time of MAKO was longer than that of ROSA (112.7 ± 12.8 min vs 94.8 ± 23.0 min, p = 0.001), but the mean TBL (1356.7 ± 648.5 mL vs 1384.5 ± 676.3 mL) and transfusion rate (15.0% vs 5.0%) were not significantly different between the two groups (all ps > 0.05). No significant differences were found in postoperative ROM, WOMAC score or KSS score at 1 year (all ps > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The MAKO and ROSA had similar accuracy and precision in TKA alignment. The clinical outcomes at 1 year after surgery were also comparable."
pub.1084383400,Navigation and Robotics in Knee Arthroplasty,"   ➢ Computer-assisted surgery for total knee arthroplasty can be performed with use of computer-assisted navigation, handheld navigation, partially or fully robot-assisted technology, and patient-specific instrumentation.   ➢ Computer-assisted navigation leads to improved component alignment and a reduction in the likelihood of mechanical axis outliers after total knee arthroplasty, but it is not known whether these differences have any long-term benefit on clinical or functional outcomes.   ➢ Handheld navigation is a form of computer-assisted navigation that includes accelerometer and sensor-based technology. While largely unproven in the clinical literature, it offers many potential advantages over traditional navigation.   ➢ Robot-assisted surgery has not been extensively studied in the context of unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasty, and, although initial reports have been promising in terms of accuracy and precision, this method is associated with substantial cost and a steep learning curve.   ➢ Patient-specific instrumentation was designed to overcome many of the intraoperative challenges associated with navigation or robotic surgery, but early reports have demonstrated only minor improvements in surgical accuracy, and no change in outcomes, compared with conventional total knee arthroplasty.

The coronal femoral component alignment (FCA), coronal tibial component alignment (TCA), and the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle were compared between groups. Intraoperative soft tissue balance, including the joint component gap and varus/valgus balance assessed by an offset-type tensor, were also compared between groups. One year postoperatively, the clinical outcomes, including the range of motion and 2011 Knee Society Score (KSS), were compared between groups.ResultsThe HKA angle and FCA were 0.1° varus and 0.1° varus, respectively, in the robot group and 1.3° varus and 1.3° varus, respectively, in the control group. The difference in the HKA angle and the FCA, but not the TCA, between groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The intraoperative soft tissue balance showed more stable joint component gaps and varus/valgus balances throughout the range of motion in the robot group than in the control group. Clinical outcomes of the robot group showed superior 2011 KSS subscales compared to those of the control group.ConclusionThe accuracy of the implantations and stable soft tissue balance in the robot group were superior to those of the control group. The robot group also had superior patient-reported scores for early clinical outcomes."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  A cohort of consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis by a single fellowship trained orthopaedic surgeon over a 39-month period was identified. Patients who underwent TKA during the year that this surgeon transitioned his entire knee arthroplasty practice to robotic assistance were excluded to eliminate selection bias and control for the learning curve. All patients received the same prosthesis and postoperative pain protocol. Patients that required intubation for failed spinal anesthetic were excluded. A final population of 492 TKAs was identified. Of these, 290 underwent TKA without robotic assistance and 202 underwent robotic arm-assisted TKA. Patient demographic characteristics and short-term clinical data were analyzed.
RESULTS:  Robotic arm-assisted TKA was associated with shorter length of stay (2.3 vs. 2.6 days, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), a 50% reduction in morphine milligram equivalent utilization (from 214 to 103, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and a mean increase in procedure time of 9.3 minutes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was one superficial infection in the nonrobotic cohort and there were no deep postoperative infections in either cohort. There were no manipulations under anesthesia in the robotic cohort while there were six in the nonrobotic cohort. Additionally, there were no significant differences in emergency department visits, readmissions, or return to the operating room.
CONCLUSION:  This analysis corroborates existing literature suggesting that robotic arm-assisted TKA can be correlated with improved short-term clinical outcomes. This study reports on a single surgeon's experience with regard to analgesic requirements, length of stay, pain scores, and procedure time following a complete transition to robotic arm-assisted TKA. These results underscore the importance of continued evaluation of clinical outcomes as robotic arthroplasty technology continues to grow."
pub.1173428030,Robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty reduces postoperative complications and length of stay without increased cost compared to navigation‐guided techniques: A national analysis,"INTRODUCTION: This study compares postoperative outcomes of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) versus navigation-guided total knee arthroplasty (NG-TKA). Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data, it provides an analysis of postoperative complications, mortality, hospital costs and duration of stay.
METHODS: The study analysed 217,715 patients (81,830 RA-TKA; 135,885 NG-TKA) using NIS data from 2016 to 2019. Elective TKA patients were identified through the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes. Statistical analyses, including logistic regression modelling, were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and MATLAB.
RESULTS: RA-TKA patients were younger (66.1 vs. 67.1 years, p < 0.0001) and had similar mortality rates (0.024% vs. 0.018%, p = 0.342) but shorter length of stay (LOS) (1.89 vs. 2.1 days, p < 0.0001). Mean total charges were comparable between RA-TKA ($66,180) and NG-TKA ($66,251, p = 0.669). RA-TKA demonstrated lower incidences of blood-related complications (11.67% vs. 14.19%, p < 0.0001), pulmonary oedema (0.0306% vs. 0.066%, p < 0.0001), deep vein thrombosis (0.196% vs. 0.254%, p = 0.006) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (1.356% vs. 1.483%, p = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: RA-TKA reduces postoperative complications and LOS without increasing costs, highlighting the relevance of this technology in patient care.

pub.1148354224,Tibial component rotation alters soft tissue balance in a cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty,"Our aim was to understand whether using different landmarks for tibial component rotation influenced articular contact pressures in a balanced total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Twelve patients underwent TKA (Triathlon CR, Stryker Inc., Mahwah, NJ) and contact pressures were assessed using a wireless sensor. Robotic arm assisted TKA using a functional alignment technique was performed, with balanced gaps between medial and lateral compartments. Compartment pressures were measured with the trial tibial component rotated to Akagi's line and to Insall's axis respectively. Rotating the tibial component to Akagi's line resulted in a significantly greater proportion of knees being balanced and lower contact pressures than when the tibial component was rotated to Insall's axis at 10°, 45° and 90° of flexion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Medial compartment pressures were significantly increased in 10° of flexion, as were lateral compartment pressures in all positions when the tibial component was aligned to Insall's axis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The mean difference in rotation observed with the two landmarks was 6.9° (range 4.1-9.1°). Rotational alignment of the tibial component using Akagi's line reduced contact pressures, improved balance and reduced the need for soft tissue release when compared with Insall's axis in robotic arm assisted TKA."
pub.1152361510,Funding has no effect on clinical outcomes of total joint arthroplasty emerging technologies: a systematic review of bibliometrics and conflicts of interest,"BackgroundThe use of new total joint arthroplasty technologies, including patient-specific implants/instrumentation (PSI), computer-assisted (CA), and robotic-assisted (RA) techniques, is increasing. There is an ongoing debate regarding the value provided and potential concerns about conflicts of interest (COI).MethodsPRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases were searched for total hip and knee arthroplasties, unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKA), PSI, CA, and RA. Bibliometric data, financial COI, clinical/functional scores, and patient-reported outcomes were assessed.ResultsEighty-seven studies were evaluated, with 35 (40.2%) including at least one author reporting COI, and 13 (14.9%) disclosing industry funding. COI and industry funding had no significant effects on outcomes (P = 0.682, P = 0.447), and there were no significant effects of conflicts or funding on level of evidence (P = 0.508, P = 0.826). Studies in which author(s) disclosed COI had significantly higher relative citation ratio (RCR) and impact factor (IF) than those without (P < 0.001, P = 0.032). Subanalysis demonstrated RA and PSI studies were more likely to report COI or industry funding (P = 0.045). RA (OR = 6.31, 95% CI: 1.61–24.68) and UKA (OR = 9.14, 95% CI: 1.43–58.53) had higher odds of reporting favorable outcomes than PSI.ConclusionsAuthor COIs (about 40%) may be lower than previously reported in orthopedic technologies/techniques reviews. Studies utilizing RA and PSI were more likely to report COI, while RA and UKA studies were more likely to report favorable outcomes than PSI. No statistically significant association between the presence of COIs and/or industry funding and the frequency of favorable outcomes or study level of evidence was found.Level of evidenceLevel V Systematic Review"
pub.1154256226,Avoiding Lateral Laxity in Robotic Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty-A Surgical Technique Describing a New Method of Gap Capture and Balancing Strategy.,"INTRODUCTION: Optimal flexion-extension gap balancing is an important factor in outcomes after total knee arthroplasty. Knees with varus deformities are commonly associated with a greater degree of lateral laxity both in extension and flexion. Residual lateral laxity could be encountered by surgeons during component trialling after robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA), necessitating additional medial soft tissue release for a thicker insert. This study describes a new technique of gap assessment during RATKA and we propose a functional alignment based balancing strategy to avoid residual lateral laxity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This surgical technique was prospectively employed in 105 patients undergoing primary MAKO® (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan) RATKA for osteoarthritis of the knee with varus deformity, between January 2021 and July 2021. Patients included had an initial lateral extension laxity of more than 24mm. Surgical data points collected consisted of characterization of the laxity profile of the knee using the medial and lateral extension and flexion initial gap captures, final gap captures after dynamic balancing with a functional alignment strategy, and residual lateral extension gap laxity in millimeters at the end of implantation.
RESULTS: The mean initial lateral extension gap was 25.76mm (standard deviation [SD]=1.47) and the mean lateral flexion gap was 24.4mm (SD=1.94). Balance was achieved in all the patients with a 9 or 11mm insert, with a mean residual lateral laxity of 0.51mm (SD=0.73, range 0-2mm). The majority of patients (n=66, 62.85%) had zero lateral laxity at the end of final implantation while 24 patients (22.8%) had 1mm of residual lateral laxity.
CONCLUSION: Residual lateral joint laxity can be avoided consistently and predictably in RATKA cases with initial gap capture of up to 30mm in lateral extension and flexion with this new technique of gap capture and employing various steps of balancing strategy described."
pub.1155487147,Cost-Effectiveness of Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Markov Decision Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) may improve clinical outcomes for patients who have end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. However, the costs of rTKA are high, and there is a paucity of data evaluating the cost-effectiveness of rTKA. We aimed to analyze the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of rTKA relative to manual TKA.
METHODS: A Markov decision analysis was performed using known parameters for costs, outcomes, implant survivorships, and mortalities. The cost-effectiveness of rTKA relative to manual TKA was assessed for end-stage knee osteoarthritis patients who had a mean age of 65 years (range, 27 to 94 years). The rTKA costs were calculated for a pay-per-use contract robot.
RESULTS: Using the Markov Model with an annual case volume of 500 patients and a mean age of 65 years, the overall health gain per patient was 13.34 QALYs after rTKA and 13.31 QALYs after manual TKA. This resulted in an overall gain in QALYs of 0.03 for each patient undergoing an rTKA compared with manual TKA and an incremental cost of $128,526 Singapore Dollars per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Robotic TKA is not a cost-effective alternative to conventional TKA using a pay-per-use contract robot."
pub.1133579753,Total knee arthroplasty: Latest robotics implantation techniques,"The recent introduction of new robotic systems for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has created somewhat of a craze. Nevertheless, we can ask ourselves whether it is justified to use these new but very costly technologies. The results and limitations of these robotic tools must be analyzed systematically before confirming their benefits. Most of the newest robotic systems are interactive ones. These systems can accurately restore the mechanical axis and can improve the ligament balance and implant positioning. Theoretically, this can lead to better survival, function and outcomes. Recent studies have shown that use of robotics for TKA implantation does not increase the surgery time and does not cause more complications. Nevertheless, the long-term advantages of robotics use in this context remains to be proven. This task will be more difficult since there is currently no consensus as to the ideal positioning of TKA implants for a given patient. The aim of this study is to summarize this topic by answering the following questions: What are the different types of robots that can be used for TKA implantation? Which steps of the TKA surgical procedure are done with robotic arm assistance? What are the outcomes of these new implantation techniques? What are the limitations of these new implantation techniques? LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V; expert opinion."
pub.1139690907,Active robotic technologies for total knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionWhen active robotic technologies for Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) were introduced over 20 years ago, broad usage of robotic technology was not felt to be needed as early data suggested no clear improvement in clinical outcomes compared to conventional techniques of implantation. Only recently has there been renewed enthusiasm for use of robotic technologies for implantation.Materials and methodsActive robotic technology specifically refers to the use of a robot for planning and executing the surgical procedure—with surgeon guidance and control. The physical work of bone preparation is performed by a milling tool, following a cut path defined by a CT-based preoperative plan. This manuscript describes the IDE experience of the only active robotic system (ARoS) available in the US, which took place from February 2017 through December 2018.Results115 patients were enrolled in an IDE study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an ARoS for TKA. No previously described safety issues for TKA occurred. Three-dimensional accuracy of component placement used the preoperative CT plan compared to the 3-months postoperative CT scan to demonstrate accuracy of all autonomous resections to within 1.5 mm and/or 1.5 degrees. Surgical planning and execution to restore alignment along kinematic principles were used in 40 procedures and to achieve mechanical alignment in 75 procedures.ConclusionsThis FDA study of an active robotic approach for TKA represented the first multicenter trial and first US experience with this technology. Results demonstrated an excellent safety profile and high degree of accuracy. Advantages of this approach relate to standardization of the technique, multiple device options in the implant library, an excellent safety and accuracy profile, and consistency of results. Active robotics for TKA represents a viable and safe technique for primary TKA."

PurposeTo evaluate the feasibility of using a smartphone-based care management platform (sbCMP) and robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (raTKA) to collect data throughout the episode-of-care and assess if intra-operative measures of soft tissue laxity in raTKA were associated with post-operative outcomes.MethodsA secondary data analysis of 131 patients in a commercial database who underwent raTKA was performed. Pre-operative through six week post-operative step counts and KOOS JR scores were collected and cross-referenced with intra-operative laxity measures. A Kruskal–Wallis test or a Wilcoxon sign-rank was used to assess outcomes.ResultsThere were higher step counts at six weeks post-operatively in knees with increased laxity in both the lateral compartment in extension and medial compartment in flexion (p < 0.05). Knees balanced in flexion within < 0.5 mm had higher KOOS JR scores at six weeks post-operative (p = 0.034) compared to knees balanced within 0.5–1.5 mm.ConclusionA smartphone-based care management platform can be integrated with raTKA to passively collect data throughout the episode-of-care. Associations between intra-operative decisions regarding laxity and post-operative outcomes were identified. However, more robust analysis is needed to evaluate these associations and ensure clinical relevance to guide machine learning algorithms."

However, the expected gap may change owing to the soft-tissue release effect of unreachable osteophytes. This study evaluated the effect of unreachable osteophytes of the posterior medial femoral condyle on gap changes following bony resection. We retrospectively analysed 129 robotic arm-assisted TKAs performed for varus knee osteoarthritis. Knees were classified according to the size of osteophytes on the posterior medial femoral condyle using preoperative computed tomography measurement. After the removal of reachable osteophytes, the robotic system measured pre- and post-resection medial extension (ME), lateral extension (LE), medial flexion (MF), and lateral flexion (LF) gaps. No extension gap changes were observed for 25 (19.4%), and no flexion gap changes were observed 41 (31.8%) knees, following bone cuts. ME, LE, MF, and LF gaps increased with the osteophyte size (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). For osteophytes &lt;10 mm, all the gaps increased symmetrically. However, for osteophytes &gt;10 mm, the ME gap increased asymmetrically more than LE, MF, and LF gaps (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The gap changes due to bony resection were correlated to the osteophyte sizes of the posterior medial femoral condyle. Surgeons should plan a slightly tight medial extension gap to attain the desired gaps for &gt;10 mm osteophytes."

Although historically associated with the posterolateral approach, HO has been noted in 10% to 40% of patients having direct anterior or anterior-based muscle sparing approaches. The available data are uncertain whether robotic arm-assisted procedures are associated with this complication. Current prophylaxis for patients considered high risk of this complication includes postoperative, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory medication for several weeks or low-dose perioperative irradiation. The surgical treatment of symptomatic HO associated with severely restricted motion or ankylosis of the hip should be individualized but may include wide excision of bone, acetabular revision to prevent instability, and prophylaxis to prevent recurrence."

Neck osteotomy and acetabular component placement are technically demanding and often require fluoroscopic guidance. Robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty enhances accuracy of preoperative planning and provides navigated guidance for neck osteotomy and haptic guidance on acetabular reaming and cup implantation. Fluoroscopic guidance is replaced by real-time navigation and on-screen data. This article describes how robotic arm assistance can simplify this complex operation.

METHODS: A total of 239 patients (247 knees), who underwent medial robotic-arm assisted (RA)-UKA at a single center between April 2011 and June 2013, were assessed. The mean age at surgery was 67.0 years (SD 8.4). Post-operatively, patients were administered the Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) and asked about their satisfaction (from 1 to 5). Post-operative complications were recorded. Failure mechanisms, revisions and reoperations were collected. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated, considering revision as the event of interest.
RESULTS: A total of 188 patients (196 knees) were assessed at a mean follow-up of 11.1 years (SD 0.5, range 10.0-11.9), resulting in a 79.4% follow-up rate. Seven RA-UKA underwent revision, resulting in a survivorship rate of 96.4% (CI 94.6%-99.2%). Causes of revision included aseptic loosening (2 cases), infection (1 case), post-traumatic (1 case), and unexplained pain (3 cases). The mean FJS-12 and satisfaction were 82.2 (SD 23.9) and 4.4 (SD 0.9), respectively. Majority of cases (174/196, 88.8%) attained the Patient Acceptable Symptoms State (PASS, FJS-12 > 40.63). Male subjects had a higher probability of attaining a ""forgotten joint"" (p < 0.001) and high satisfaction (equal to 5, p < 0.05), when compared to females.
CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional image-based RA-UKA demonstrated high implant survivorship and good-to-excellent clinical outcomes at minimum 10 years follow-up. Pain of unknown origin represented the most common reason for RA-UKA revision.

pub.1071722824,Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty: Surgical Assistant for a Customized Normal Kinematic Knee.,"Although current total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered a highly successful surgical procedure, patients undergoing TKA can still experience substantial functional impairment and increased revision rates as compared with those undergoing total hip arthroplasty. Robotic-assisted surgery has been available clinically for almost 15 years and was developed, in part, to address these concerns. Robotic-assisted surgery aims to improve TKA by enhancing the surgeon's ability to optimize soft tissue balancing, reproduce alignment, and restore normal knee kinematics. Current systems include a robotic arm with a variety of different navigation systems with active, semi-active, or passive control. Semi-active systems have become the dominant strategy, providing a haptic window through which the surgeon consistently prepares a TKA based on preoperative planning. A review of previous designs and clinical studies demonstrates that these robotic systems decrease variability and increase precision, primarily with the mechanical axis and restoration of the joint line. Future design objectives include precise planning and consistent intraoperative execution. Preoperative planning, intraoperative sensors, augmenting surgical instrumentation, and biomimetic surfaces will be used to re-create the 4-bar linkage system in the knee. Implants will be placed so that the knee functions with a medial pivot, lateral rollback, screw home mechanism, and patellar femoral tracking. Soft tissue balancing will become more than equalizing the flexion and extension gaps and will match the kinematics to a normal knee. Together, coupled with advanced knee designs, they may be the key to a patient stating, ""My knee feels like my natural knee."" [Orthopedics. 2016; 39(5):e822-e827.]. "

The procedures were conducted at a single facility, with a uniform method and implant design. The Cuvis system, a fully automated robot, was utilized for the study. The precise removal of bone at both the tibial and femur sites, the positioning of the implant, and the release of soft tissue were documented and then compared to the preoperative plan.ResultsThe distal (medial and lateral) femoral cuts had a mean absolute deviation from the plan of 0.23 mm, while the posterior (medial and lateral) femoral cuts had a mean absolute difference of 1 mm and 1.4 mm, respectively. The absolute discrepancies in the medial and lateral tibial cuts are 0.93 mm and − 0.06 mm, respectively. Out of 1000 bone resections, 980 (98%) were within < 1 mm from the preoperative plan. The predictions for the sizes of the tibial and femoral components had accuracies of 100% and 98.9%, respectively.ConclusionThese findings collectively underscore the effectiveness of the fully automated Cuvis robotic system in achieving consistent and accurate results in bone resections and implant sizing, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool in orthopedic surgery."
pub.1164209107,Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Can Increase Frequency of Achieving Target Limb Alignment in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty for Preoperative Valgus Deformity,"Background: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) has been shown to reduce the number of alignment outliers and to improve component positioning compared to manual TKA (mTKA). The primary purpose of this investigation was to compare the frequency of achieving target postoperative limb alignment and component positioning for rTKA vs mTKA.
Methods: A retrospective comparative study was performed on 250 patients undergoing primary TKA by 2 fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons. Surgeon A performed predominantly rTKA (103 cases) with the ROSA system (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) and less frequently mTKA (44 cases) with conventional instrumentation. Surgeon B performed only mTKA (103 cases). Target limb alignment for surgeon A was 0° for all cases and for surgeon B was 2° varus for varus knees and 0° for valgus knees. Radiographic measurements were determined by 2 reviewers. Target zone was set at ± 2 degrees from the predefined target.
Results: When comparing rTKA to mTKA performed by different surgeons, there were no differences in the percentage within the target zone (57.28% vs 53.40%, <i>P</i> = .575), but rTKA did result in a greater percentage for cases with preoperative valgus (71.42% vs 44.12%, <i>P</i> = .031). Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global-10 physical scores were statistically higher at both 3 (<i>P</i> = .016) and 6 months (<i>P</i> = .001) postoperatively for rTKA compared to mTKA performed by different surgeons.
Conclusions: Although experienced surgeons can achieve target limb alignment correction with similar frequency when comparing rTKA to mTKA for all cases, rTKA may achieve target limb alignment with more accuracy for preoperative valgus deformity.

pub.1147593911,Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: Cost Savings Demonstrated at One Year,"Purpose: Robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has the potential to enhance radiographic, clinical, and patient-reported outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare resource utilization, episode-of-care (EOC) costs, readmissions, and complications of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) and manual TKA (MTKA).
Methods: TKA procedures were identified from a private payer claims database. RATKA procedures required both a robotic arm-assisted procedure code and a 60-day pre-operative computed tomography scan. Propensity score matching (1:5 RATKA to MTKA) was performed, based on various patient characteristics and comorbidities. After matching, 4452 patients (742 RATKA and 3710 MTKA) were analyzed for 90-day and one-year EOC costs, index TKA costs, lengths of stay (LOS), discharge statuses, rehabilitation utilizations, as well as 90-day and one-year readmissions- and knee-related complications.
Results: RATKA patients had shorter LOS (mean 1.56 versus 1.91 days; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), lower index costs by $1762 ($32,747 versus $34,509; <i>p</i> = 0.003), and higher discharges to home rates (51.8 versus 47.8%; <i>p</i> = 0.049) than MTKA patients. RATKA patients had less 90-day (68.5 versus 72.0%; <i>p</i> = 0.048) and one-year (70.8 versus 75.0%; <i>p</i> = 0.016) home health utilizations. The RATKA cohort had lower 90-day ($39,260 versus $41,458; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and one-year ($51,462 versus $54,171; <i>p</i> = 0.011) EOC costs. No significant differences in readmission and overall complication rates were observed (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05).
Conclusion: RATKA was associated with lower index costs and EOC costs at both 90 days and one year. These patients had shorter LOS, were discharged home more frequently, and used less home health services. Cost savings were demonstrated for RATKA beyond the 90-day period with an increase in savings between 90-day and one-year time points. These data may be of importance to payers and providers interested in the longer-term value of RATKA."
pub.1170511352,"Lower Intraoperative and Immediate Postoperative Complications in Robotic Versus Conventional Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis of Over 360,000 Patients","PURPOSE: Although a trend of an improved alignment with robotic total hip arthroplasty (THA) over conventional methods has surfaced from recent series, it is unknown whether these results translate into meaningful enhancements in postoperative outcomes. To address this lack in the literature, we compared the perioperative morbidity and mortality with robotic and conventional THA in a large national cohort of 367,894 patients. We hypothesized that no significant differences would exist in the outcomes between the two groups.
METHODS: Records were extracted from 2016-2019 from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project which is the largest in-patient database in the United States. From 367,894 THAs, robotics were employed for 7,863 patients. The remaining 360,031 conventional THAs served as controls. The two groups were compared for demographics, admission, and hospital stay details including costs, and mortality and morbidity data including medical and surgical complications. Descriptive statistics were used for demographic data while analytical statistics including t-tests, chi-squared tests, Fischer exact test, and Pearson chi-squared tests were used for perioperative outcomes. Statistical significance was set at p<0.005.
RESULTS: Demographic distributions between robotic and conventional THA groups displayed similar age and sex characteristics. Shorter mean lengths of stay (1.87 days) were seen in robotic THA versus conventional THA (2.33 days) while higher costs were noted for the former (mean $68,686.71 vs $66,840.39) (p<0.005). Low overall mortality (0.03% robotic, 0.09% conventional) was seen in both groups (p>0.005). Higher comparative incidences of anemia, acute renal failure, and pneumonia were seen in conventional THA (p<0.005) while no significant differences were noted for other complications including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiac arrest (p>0.005). Among others, lower dislocation rates, mechanical complications, periprosthetic joint infection, and periprosthetic fractures were seen with robotic THA (p<0.005). Wound complications and superficial infection rates did not differ between the two groups (p>0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence has emerged from our results to support more routine adaptation of the robotic option of performing a THA. These can be based on lower local, systemic, and mechanical complications as demonstrated by the present study. Further evaluation of these results in follow-up would help establish the foothold of robotic surgery in total hip replacement in the modern context."

Seventy consecutive patients underwent primary TKA at our institution using a handheld robot-assisted system. Full‐length standing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were obtained 2 weeks after surgery for assessment of 2D component alignments. Pre- and postoperative computed tomography (CT) images were obtained to assess 3D component alignment. The reference points defined on preoperative CT images were transferred to the postoperative CT images. The absolute errors in the 2D and 3D component alignments from the planned, validated cutting, and validated implantation angles were calculated. Outliers of >  ± 3° of femoral and tibial component alignments in the coronal and sagittal planes were also investigated. All absolute errors in the 2D and 3D component alignments were < 1°, except for the planned and validated cutting angles of the femoral sagittal alignment. No outliers were observed in the femoral or tibial component in the coronal plane. Significant differences between the 2D and 3D measurements were observed for the mean absolute value from the planned and validated cutting angles in the femoral sagittal plane and from the validated implantation angle in the tibial coronal plane. The handheld robot-assisted system demonstrated a high accuracy for component alignment using 2D and 3D evaluations."
pub.1147828841,Intraoperative technology increases operating room times in primary total knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionOptimization of patient outcomes and identification of factors to improve the surgical workflow are increasingly important. Operating room time is one modifiable factor that leads to greater hospital efficiency as well as improved outcomes such as shorter length of stay and fewer infections and readmissions. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with operative time disparities in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).MethodsA retrospective review of 7659 consecutive primary TKA cases was conducted. Patient demographic data, discrete operating room (OR) times, use of technology (i.e. robotic-assisted surgery, computer navigation), surgeon experience and the level of training of the first assistant were collected. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of hospital characteristics on operative times. Operative times of five minutes or greater were considered to be clinically significant.ResultsWhile the use of technology (182.64 ± 39.85 vs 158.70 ± 37.45 min; B = 26.09; p < 0.0001) and greater surgeon experience (162.14 ± 39.87 vs 158.69 ± 33.18 min, B = 3.15, p = 0.002) were found to increase OR times, level of training of the first assist (161.65 vs 156.4 min; Β = − 0.264; p = 0.487) did not. Of the discrete OR times examined, incision time and total time under anesthesia were negatively impacted by the use of technology.ConclusionUse of technology was the only study variable found to significantly increase OR times. With increased operative times and limited evidence that technology improves long-term patient outcomes, surgeons should carefully consider the benefits and cost of technology in TKA."
pub.1169531615,Functional alignment maximises advantages of robotic arm‐assisted total knee arthroplasty with better patient‐reported outcomes compared to mechanical alignment,"PURPOSE: Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) enables adjustment of implant position to achieve the surgeon's preferred alignment. However, the alignment concept that most effectively enhances patient satisfaction remains unclear. This study compares the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent functionally aligned RTKA (FA-RTKA), mechanically aligned conventional TKA (MA-CTKA) and mechanically aligned RTKA (MA-RTKA).
METHODS: A prospectively collected database was retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent primary TKA for knee osteoarthritis. One hundred and forty-seven knees were performed with MA-CTKA, followed by 72 consecutive knees performed with MA-RTKA, and subsequently, 70 consecutive knees performed with FA-RTKA were enrolled. After 1:1 propensity score matching of patient demographics, 70 knees were finally included in each group. The extent of additional soft tissue release during surgery was identified, and the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee classification was utilised to categorise the alignment. At the 1-year follow-up, patient-reported outcomes, including the pain Visual Analogue Scale, Knee Society Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and Forgotten Joint Score-12, were also compared among the groups.
RESULTS: The FA-RTKA group showed significantly less additional soft tissue release than the MA-CTKA and MA-RTKA groups (15.7%, 38.6% and 35.7%, respectively; p = 0.006). Statistically significant differences in functional scores were observed in the postoperative 1-year clinical outcomes in favour of the FA-RTKA group, which had a significantly larger percentage of knees that maintained constitutional alignment and joint line obliquity than those of the other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Functionally aligned TKA showed superior 1-year postoperative patient-reported outcomes compared with those of conventional and robotic arm-assisted mechanically aligned TKA. Therefore, the advantage of RTKA is maximised when the implant positioning is based on functional alignment. The application of RTKA with mechanical alignment has been proven ineffective in improving the clinical outcomes of patients.

pub.1134315000,Accuracy in the Execution of Pre-operative Plan for Limb Alignment and Implant Positioning in Robotic-arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty and Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Prospective Observational Study,"AimThe objective of the study is to compare the accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment achieved in robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty(RATKA) and manual total knee arthroplasty(MTKA) to their respective preoperative plan.Patients and methodsThis was a prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care centre between August 2018 and January 2020. 143 consecutive RATKA(105 patients) and 151 consecutive MTKA(111 patients) performed by two experienced arthroplasty surgeons were included. Two independent observers evaluated the accuracy of implant positioning by measuring the radiological parameters according to the Knee-Society-Roentgenographic-Evaluation-System and limb alignment from postoperative weight-bearing scanogram. Outcomes were defined, based on the degree of deviation of measurements from the planned position and alignment, as excellent(0–1.99°), acceptable(2.00–2.99°) and outlier(≥ 3.00°).ResultsThere were no systematic differences in the demographic and baseline characteristics between RATKA and MTKA. Statistically significant outcomes were observed favouring robotic group for postoperative mechanical axis (p < .001), coronal inclination of the femoral component (p < 0.001), coronal inclination of tibial component (p < 0.001), and sagittal inclination of tibial component (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the sagittal inclination of the femoral component (p = 0.566). The percentage of knees in the 'excellent' group were higher in RATKA compared to MTKA. There was absolutely no outlier in terms of limb alignment in the RATKA group versus 23.8% (p < 0.001) in the MTKA group. All the measurements showed high interobserver and intraobserver reliability.ConclusionRobotic-arm assisted TKA executed the preoperative plan more accurately with respect to limb alignment and implant positioning compared to manual TKA, even when the surgeons were more experienced in the latter.Graphic abstract"
pub.1092914867,The Learning Curve Associated with Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty,"As with most new surgical technologies, there is an associated learning curve with robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) before surgeons can expect ease of use to be similar to that of manual cases. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to (1) assess robotic-assisted versus manual operative times of two joint reconstructive surgeons separately as well as (2) find an overall learning curve. A total of 240 robotic-assisted TKAs performed by two board-certified surgeons were analyzed. The cases were sequentially grouped into 20 cases and a learning curve was created based on mean operative times. For each surgeon, mean operative times for their first 20 and last 20 robotic-assisted cases were compared with 20 randomly selected manual cases performed by that surgeon as controls prior to the initiation of the robotic-assisted cases. Each of the surgeons first 20 robotic assisted, last 20 robotic assisted, and 20 controls were then combined to create 3 cohorts of 40 cases for analysis. <i>Surgeon 1</i>: First and last robotic cohort operative times were 81 and 70 minutes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mean operative times for the first 20 robotic-assisted cases and manual cases were 81 versus 68 minutes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mean operative times for the last 20 robotic-assisted cases and manual cases were 70 versus 68 minutes (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). <i>Surgeon 2</i>: First and last robotic cohort operative times were 117 and 98 minutes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mean operative times for the first 20 robotic-assisted cases and manual cases were 117 versus 95 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mean operative times for the last 20 robotic-cohort cases and manual cases were 98 versus 95 (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). A similar trend occurred when the times of two surgeons were combined. The data from this study effectively create a learning curve for the use of robotic-assisted TKA. As both surgeons completed their total cases numbers within similar time frames, these data imply that within a few months, a board-certified orthopaedic joint arthroplasty surgeon should be able to adequately perform robotic TKA without adding any operative times."
pub.1141916013,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty with the OMNIBot platform: a review of the principles of use and outcomes,"IntroductionTechnology that enables the orthopaedic surgeon to deliver a surgical plan with precision and reproducibility continues to evolve. Robotic TKA represents the next phase of technological development in knee arthroplasty. Multiple propriety robotic platforms are now available for use in TKA, and one such system is the OMNIBotics platform. We conducted a review of this system, reporting its history and principles of use, published outcomes and our own personal experience performing OMNI robotic-assisted TKAs.Materials and methodsA literature review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. Thirteen papers were included for the final review.ResultsThe OMNIBot is an accurate and consistent delivery tool in TKA surgery and compares favourably to instrumented, navigation-assisted and patient-specific cutting guides. The OMNIBot has been shown to be a reliable tool for delivering different alignment philosophies as well as planning and achieving tibio-femoral coronal balancing. The utility of the system is increased when the robot is used in conjunction with a soft-tissue tensioning device—the BalanceBot. Data regarding PROM’s are limited, however results to date show reliable outcomes. Survival analysis of RATKA using the OMNIBot is limited to one study which reported 99.26% survivorship at 3 years. We report our own outcomes using the OMNIBot, having performed 766 TKA’s using the OMNIBot, since 2014 with 99.48% survivorship at 6 year follow-up.ConclusionThe OMNIBot platform is an imageless, passive robotic system available since 2007, with over 30,000 TKA’s being performed with its assistance. It has a small physical footprint, is relatively inexpensive and time efficient. Our review demonstrates a high level of precision of the surgical planning, with a modestly improved accuracy compared to conventional and navigation technology. Published outcomes are limited, however demonstrate good short-term PROM’s and survivorship data that compare favourably to other robotic TKA cohorts."
pub.1139662989,Concepts and techniques of a new robotically assisted technique for total knee arthroplasty: the ROSA knee system,"IntroductionThe ROSA (Robotic Surgical Assistant) Knee system (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be considered as collaborative robotics, where the surgeon remains in charge of the procedure and collaborates with a smart robotic tool, to perform the surgery with a high accuracy and reproducibility. The aim was to describe: (1) its concept and surgical technique; (2) its advantages and potential limits; (3) the early experience with this system.Materials and methodsThe goal during its development phase was to keep the surgeon active and at the center of the operation: the surgeon handles the saw and performs the cuts while the robotic arm places and holds the guide at the right place. The ROSA knee platform assists the surgeon for the distal femoral cut, the femoral component sizing and positioning, the tibial cut and the ligament balance. This robotic system has two options: image-based with 3D virtual model; or image-less, based on intraoperative landmarks acquisition. All the classic surgical techniques can be used: measured resection, gap balancing, functional alignment, kinematic alignment. Some techniques recently developed are more ROSA-specific: Robotic personalized TKA, ROSA-FuZion technique.ResultsIts advantages as compared to other available systems include: radiographs in standing position, collaborative robotic system where the robot completes the surgeon skills, “off-the-shelf” implants, predictive robotic with concept of machine learning incorporated into the system. Two cadaveric studies have reported the high accuracy and reproducibility of this device. This robotic system is recent and currently no clinical series has enough follow-up to report clinical outcomes.ConclusionThe ROSA knee system is a robotically assisted semi-autonomous surgical system with some specific characteristics. The aim of this collaborative robotic system is to improve the accuracy and reliability of the bone resections and the ligament balancing, without replacing the steps well performed by the surgeon."
pub.1091777297,Improved joint-line restitution in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty using a robotic-assisted surgical technique,"PurposeJoint-line restitution is one objective of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). However, the joint line is often lowered when resurfacing femoral implants are used. The aim of this study was to compare the joint-line height in UKA performed by robotic-assisted and conventional techniques.MethodsThis retrospective case–control study compared two matched groups of patients receiving a resurfacing UKA between 2013 and 2016 by either a robotic-assisted (n = 40) or conventional (n = 40) technique. Each group comprised 27 women and 13 menm wuth a mean age of 69 and 68 years, respectively. Indications for surgery were osteoarthritis (n = 35) and condylar osteonecrosis (n = 5). Two validated radiologic measurement methods were used to assess joint-line height.ResultsForty UKA (23 medial and 17 lateral) were analysed in each group. Restitution of joint-line height was significantly improved in the robotic-assisted group compared than the control group: +1.4 mm ±2.6 vs +4.7 mm ± 2.4 (p < 0.05) as assessed using method 1, and +1.5 mm ±2.3 vs +4.6 mm ±2.5 (p < 0.05) as assessed using method 2.ConclusionsRestitution of joint-line height in resurfacing UKA can be improved with robotic-assisted surgery. Improvement in clinical outcome measures must be demonstrated with long-term studies."
pub.1130924893,Comparison of robotic‐assisted versus conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for the treatment of single compartment knee osteoarthritis: A meta‐analysis,"BACKGROUND: The robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is proposed to improve the accuracy of component positioning.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search in Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library until April 2020.
RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 10 articles, involving 1231 knees. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the robotic group had significantly better results in outliers of limb alignment (p < 0.001) and outliers of tibial alignment (p < 0.001). No statistical differences were found in the American Knee Society Score (p = 0.63), range of motion (p = 0.93), pain (p = 0.27), rate of revisions (p = 0.73) and rate of complications (p = 0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted UKA has better component position accuracy compared with conventional UKA. But there was no significant difference in clinical results. In order to further evaluate the utility of robotic-assisted UKA, long-term follow-up randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed, as well as studies to evaluate the correlation between postoperative alignment and long-term clinical results."
pub.1145137968,Robotic Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty in the Setting of Severely Deficient Distal Femoral Bone Stock,"CASE: A 26-year-old woman with a complex sequelae of open distal femoral fracture at 4 years of age presented to the office with severe knee pain from posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) with the elevation of previous free-flap was performed because of the following: (1) anatomic deformity, (2) small femoral size, and (3) compromised soft-tissue envelope.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the complexity of planning and performing TKA in a young patient with these unique considerations. The successful outcome demonstrates the viability of RA-TKA techniques."
pub.1157945572,A comparison of robotic‐assisted and manual techniques in restricted kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty: coronal alignment improvement with no significant clinical differences,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare radiographic and clinical outcomes of robotic-assisted and conventional manual techniques in restricted kinematically aligned TKA.
METHODS: Patients who underwent either manual or robotic-assisted restricted kinematically aligned TKA between 2019 and 2020 were included in this retrospective comparative study. Radiographic outcomes comprised coronal plane measurements performed through standing full-length anteroposterior radiographs. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Oxford score, Visual Analog Scale pain and satisfaction score, and Forgotten Joint Score were used to determine the clinical outcome. The continuous data were compared by Student's t test according to the Kolmogorov‒Smirnov normality test.
RESULTS: The manual group consisted of 46 patients (38 females, eight males) with a mean age of 68.1 years, and the robotic group consisted of 70 patients (58 females, 12 males) with a mean age of 65.7 years (n.s.). Preoperatively, no significant difference was observed between groups concerning demographic characteristics, radiographic measurements, and clinical scores except for the symptom and pain domains of the KOOS score, which was significantly worse in the manual group (p = 0.011 and 0.035, respectively). At the postoperative 2-year follow-up, we observed significant differences between groups with respect to the mean HKA angle, mMPTA, and mLDFA (p = 0.034, 0.041, and 0.005, respectively). A comparison of clinical scores at the postoperative 2-year follow-up demonstrated no significant differences between groups.
CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that using robotic-assisted technique for restricted kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA) resulted in significantly better outcomes compared to the conventional manual technique in achieving normal ranges of lower extremity coronal alignment measurements. While the robotic-assisted group demonstrated better clinical scores, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes between the robotic-assisted group and the control group at the two-year follow-up. Concerning clinical relevance, the restoration of original anatomy and coronal alignment, a crucial concern in restricted kinematically aligned TKA, may be better achieved by the robotic-assisted technique.

pub.1150868285,Inflammatory Response in Robotic-Arm-Assisted Versus Conventional Jig-Based TKA and the Correlation with Early Functional Outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Although the exact etiology of patient dissatisfaction in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is unclear, the inflammatory response precipitated by surgery may be implicated. Robotic TKA has been shown to result in reduced bone and soft-tissue trauma. The objectives of this study were to compare the inflammatory response in conventional jig-based TKA versus robotic-arm-assisted TKA and to examine the relationship with early functional outcomes.
METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial included 15 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis undergoing conventional TKA and 15 undergoing robotic-arm-assisted TKA. Blood samples were collected for up to 28 days postoperatively, and predefined markers of systemic inflammation were measured in serum. The local inflammatory response was assessed by analyzing samples from the intra-articular drain fluid at 6 and 24 hours. Relationships with early functional outcomes were evaluated using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Patients in the robotic TKA group demonstrated lower levels of interleukin (IL)-6 in the drain fluid at 6 hours (798.54 pg/mL versus 5,699.2 pg/mL, p = 0.026) and 24 hours and IL-8 at 6 hours. Robotic TKA was associated with lower pain scores on postoperative days 1, 2, and 7. Patient-reported outcome measures were comparable between the 2 groups at 2 years. Significant correlations were observed between all serum markers except IL-1b and self-reported pain on postoperative day 7; between drain IL-8 levels and pain on postoperative days 1 (r = 0.458), 2, and 7; and between drain IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels at 6 hours and knee flexion or extension.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-arm-assisted TKA was associated with a reduction in the early postoperative local inflammatory response. We also found a moderate relationship between the inflammatory responses and self-reported pain, knee flexion, and knee extension. Further validation of these findings on a larger scale and using longer-term outcomes will be key to developing the optimal TKA procedure.

pub.1139366977,Do bicortical diaphyseal array pins create the risk of periprosthetic fracture in robotic-assisted knee arthroplasties?,"BackgroundOptical array placement for robotic-assisted knee replacement introduces the rare, but real risk of periprosthetic fracture. The purpose of this retrospective study was to review the incidence of fracture with the conventional technique of bicortical diaphyseal pin placement. We also evaluated a modified method of unicortical periarticular pin placement to mitigate this risk.MethodsWe reviewed 2603 knee arthroplasties that were performed between June 2017 and December 2019. The conventional bicortical diaphyseal technique was used in 1571 knees (bicortical diaphyseal group) and the unicortical periarticular technique was used in 1032 knees (unicortical periarticular group).ResultsA more than 1-year follow-up revealed that 3 femoral shaft fractures (0.19%) occurred in the bicortical diaphyseal group and no fracture took place in the unicortical periarticular group. There was no array loosening in either group.ConclusionsThe modified unicortical periarticular pin placement is a reliable technique for computer-navigated and robotic-assisted knee arthroplasties. It may be associated with a lower incidence of postoperative femoral shaft fractures, compared to conventional bicortical diaphyseal pinning."
pub.1050308401,Validating a Modified Circle Theorem Method for the Measurement of Acetabular Cup Anteversion on Plain Radiography with Intra-Operative Data from Robotic Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty,This study aims to validate a modified circle theorem method for the calculation of true version of the acetabular component on anteroposterior x-rays with intra-operative version data derived from robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA). Planar anteversion measurements recorded intraoperatively in 80 THAs were correlated to measurements on anteroposterior radiographs. The mean anteversion of the cohort measured by the robotic system and on plain radiography was 21.2° ± 2.0° and 19.9° ± 3.4° respectively and 97.5% of cases were in a 30% relative error. The correlation between the true and planar measurements of anteversion on plain radiographs was strong (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9422). We conclude that the circle theorem method can be validated with data from robotic guided THA. 
pub.1144262448,Clinical and radiological outcomes of robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: Early lessons from the first 100 consecutive knees in 85 patients,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is associated with improved component positioning and comparable short- and mid-term implant survivorship with manual UKA. This study aims to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes following robotic-assisted UKA as well as any potential learning-curves associated with the introduction of such new technology.
METHODS: Prospective study of patients undergoing robotic-assisted UKA. Outcome measures were patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) including Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee Society Score (KSS) and Oxford Knee Score (OKS), complications, implant survivorship, component positioning and learning curve.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients comprising 100 knees were recruited and followed up for 21.0 ± 4.3 months. At two years, there were significant and sustained improvements in PROMs and 100% implant survivorship rate. A high degree of implant accuracy was achieved with the robotic system. A cumulative learning curve of 20 cases was noted.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted UKA achieves excellent implant accuracy and clinical outcomes in the short-term. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate this relationship."
pub.1077881450,Indications for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and rationale for robotic arm-assisted technology.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an effective surgical treatment for focal arthritis when appropriate selection criteria are followed. Although results can be optimized with careful patient selection and use of a sound implant design, two of the most important determinants of UKA performance and durability are how well the bone is prepared and components aligned. Study results have shown that component malalignment by as little as 2 degrees may predispose to implant failure after UKA. Conventional cutting guides have been relatively inaccurate in determining alignment and preparing the bone surfaces for unicompartmental implants. Computer navigation has improved component alignment to an extent, but outliers still exist. The introduction of robotics capitalizes on the virtues of computer navigation but couples the planning and mapping of navigation with robotic techniques for bone preparation. Robotic technology is fostering substantially improved precision and component alignment in UKA, even when using minimally invasive soft-tissue approaches."
pub.1092914865,Difficult Cases in Robotic Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Case Series,"Sagittal deformity of the knee is commonly corrected to neutral biomechanical axis (±3 degrees) during total knee arthroplasty (TKA), which is a widely accepted goal. Recent advances in surgical technology have made it possible to accurately plan and fulfill these goals. One of these is robotic-assisted TKA, which has been noted to help increase accuracy and precision of restoring a neutral mechanical axis. While there are data confirming the ability of robotic devices to better correct knee alignment than the manual technique, there is a lack of data concerning the use of the robotic devices in more complex cases, such as those in patients with severe varus or valgus deformity, as well as in flexion contractures. Therefore, the purpose of this case study is to present three cases in which the robotic-assisted TKA device was used to correct a severe varus and severe valgus deformities. Based on this case series, it should be noted that the robotic device can also help correct severe varus/valgus deformities and flexion contractures."
pub.1006375785,Assessment of accuracy of robotically assisted unicompartmental arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyse the accuracy of component placement during unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) using a robotic-assisted system.
METHODS: Two hundred and six patients (232 knees) who underwent medial robotic-assisted UKA were retrospectively studied. Femoral and tibial sagittal and coronal alignments were measured in the post-operative radiographs and were compared with the equivalent measurements collected during the intra-operative period by the robotic system. Mismatch between pre-planning and post-operative radiography was assessed against accuracy of the prosthesis insertion.
RESULTS: Robotic-assisted surgery for medial UKA resulted in an average difference of 2.2° ± 1.7° to 3.6° ± 3.3° depending on the component and radiographic view between the intra-operatively planned and post-operative measurements. Mismatch between pre-planning and post-operative radiography (inaccuracy) was related to improper cementing technique of the prosthesis in all measurements (except for tibial sagittal axis) rather than wrong bony cuts performed by the robotic arm.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted medial UKA results in accurate prosthesis position. Inaccuracy may be attributed to suboptimal cementing technique."
pub.1139010548,The successful implementation of the Navio robotic technology required 29 cases,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has potential benefits of improved restoration of mechanical alignment, accuracy of bony resection, and balancing. The purpose of this study was to determine the number of cases necessary for a single surgeon to achieve a constant, steady-state surgical time. The secondary purpose was to identify which steps demonstrated the most time reduced. This was a prospective study assessing intraoperative time for 60 RA-TKA with the Navio surgical system. Overall arthroplasty time and duration for each step were recorded. Statistical analysis included a nonlinear regression and survival regression. Successful implementation required 29 cases to achieve a steady-state. The average time decreased from 41.8 min for the first cohort to 31.1 min for the last cohort, a 26% decrease. The step with the greatest reduction was the “Review of Intraoperative Plan” with a reduction of 2.1 min. This study demonstrates surgical times averaging below 60 min and a learning curve that is complete in 29 cases with the surgeon reporting a high level of confidence with the system at 10 cases. Though Navio assisted TKA showed a significantly slower operative time, we are hopeful that future generations of robotic technology will be more efficiently implemented by surgeons."
pub.1141026853,Distal Femoral Pin Tracker Placement Prevents Pin Tract-induced Fracture in Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the placement of pin trackers in the medial sagittal plane of the distal femur in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) over a minimum follow-up period of 3 months. From August 2020 to October 2020, a consecutive series of 81 TKAs were performed in 59 patients using the Triathlon posterior-stabilized total knee prosthesis with a robotic-assisted system (Mako) at our hospital. Patient charts were reviewed for complications associated with the pin sites, including fracture, infection, thigh pain, and the need for reoperation. No patients had any minor or major complications associated with distal femoral pins. This technique, which used pin trackers in the medial sagittal plane of the distal femur, could be a useful option for surgeons performing robotic-assisted TKA. This is a Level IV study."

pub.1100744263,Midterm Survivorship and Patient Satisfaction of Robotic-Arm-Assisted Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Multicenter Study,"BACKGROUND: Studies have showed improved accuracy of lower leg alignment, precise component position, and soft-tissue balance with robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). No studies, however, have assessed the effect on midterm survivorship. Therefore, the purpose of this prospective, multicenter study was to determine midtem survivorship, modes of failure, and satisfaction of robotic-assisted medial UKA.
METHODS: A total of 473 consecutive patients (528 knees) underwent robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA surgery at 4 separate institutions between March 2009 and December 2011. All patients received a fixed-bearing, metal-backed onlay tibial component. Each patient was contacted at minimum 5-year follow-up and asked a series of questions to determine survival and satisfaction. Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine survivorship.
RESULTS: Data were collected for 384 patients (432 knees) with a mean follow-up of 5.7 years (5.0-7.7). The follow-up rate was 81.2%. In total, 13 revisions were performed, of which 11 knees were converted to total knee arthroplasty and in 2 cases 1 UKA component was revised, resulting in 97% survivorship. The mean time to revision was 2.27 years. The most common failure mode was aseptic loosening (7/13). Fourteen reoperations were reported. Of all unrevised patients, 91% was either very satisfied or satisfied with their knee function.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA showed high survivorship and satisfaction at midterm follow-up in this prospective, multicenter study. However, in spite of the robotic technique, early fixation failure remains the primary cause for revision with cemented implants. Comparative studies are necessary to confirm these findings and compare to conventional implanted UKA and total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1153831375,"Caliper-Verified Kinematically Aligned Total Knee Arthroplasty: Rationale, Targets, Accuracy, Balancing, Implant Survival, and Outcomes.","Peer-reviewed studies published up to May 2022 are used to provide a comprehensive understanding of unrestricted kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty. The intent is to cultivate the curiosity of those interested in this method of personalized alignment. The rationale of unrestricted kinematic alignment is to set the femoral and tibial components coincident with the patient's prearthritic joint lines, restore the femoral and tibial phenotypes, and coalign the three kinematic axes of the components with those of the knee. The surgical technique, learning curve, and accuracy of performing kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty with a caliper and company manufactured manual instrumentation should be explored and compared with robotic instrumentation. Kinematic alignment restores the native knee's medial and lateral tibial compartment forces, which mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty cannot do even after ligament release. In addition, insert conformity plays a role in restoring native tibiofemoral kinematics. A literature review of clinical outcomes, long-term durability, and the risk of varus tibial component failure and patellofemoral instability shows unrestricted kinematic alignment has comparable if not superior results when compared with mechanical alignment."
pub.1148782552,More work is needed on cost‐utility analyses of robotic‐assisted surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively analyze the cost-utility of robotic surgery in clinical practice and to investigate the reporting and methodological quality of the related evidence.
METHODS: Data on cost-utility analyses (CUAs) of robotic surgery were collected in seven electronic databases from the inception to July 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the CHEERs and QHES checklists. A systematic review was performed with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as the outcome of interest.
RESULTS: Thirty-one CUAs of robotic surgery were eligible. Overall, the identified CUAs were fair to high quality, and 63% of the CUAs ranked the cost-utility of robotic surgery as ""favored,"" 32% categorized as ""reject,"" and the remaining 5% ranked as ""unclear."" Although a high heterogeneity was present in terms of the study design among the included CUAs, most studies (81.25%) consistently found that robotic surgery was more cost-utility than open surgery for prostatectomy (ICER: $6905.31/QALY to $26240.75/QALY; time horizon: 10 years or lifetime), colectomy (dominated by robotic surgery; time horizon: 1 year), knee arthroplasty (ICER: $1134.22/QALY to $1232.27/QALY; time horizon: lifetime), gastrectomy (dominated by robotic surgery; time horizon: 1 year), spine surgery (ICER: $17707.27/QALY; time horizon: 1 year), and cystectomy (ICER: $3154.46/QALY; time horizon: 3 months). However, inconsistent evidence was found for the cost-utility of robotic surgery versus laparoscopic surgery and (chemo)radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Fair or high-quality evidence indicated that robotic surgery is more cost-utility than open surgery, while it remains inconclusive whether robotic surgery is more cost-utility than laparoscopic surgery and (chemo)radiotherapy. Thus, an additional evaluation is required."
pub.1137540678,Conversion of Hip Arthrodesis Using Robotic Arm Technology,Recent advancements in computer-assisted surgery have led to a renewed interest in robotic-assisted hip arthroplasty. This technology assists with component position which is especially useful in prior trauma or dysplasia cases. We present a case of a surgical hip fusion conversion to total hip arthroplasty with the use of robotic-assisted technology. Enhanced preoperative planning with the ability to manipulate implant position before execution can be invaluable during complex procedures. Further research is warranted before revision cases using computerized navigation systems becomes more prevalent.
pub.1003009109,Comparison of Robotic-Assisted and Conventional Manual Implantation of a Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty,"This study was aimed to compare robotic-assisted implantation of a total knee arthroplasty with conventional manual implantation. We controlled, randomized, and reviewed 72 patients for total knee arthroplasty assigned to undergo either conventional manual implantation (excluding navigation-assisted implantation cases) of a Zimmer LPS prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, Ind) (30 patients: group 1) or robotic-assisted implantation of such a prosthesis (32 patients: group 2). The femoral flexion angle (gamma angle) and tibial angle (delta angle) in the lateral x-ray of group 1 were 4.19 +/- 3.28 degrees and 89.7 +/- 1.7 degrees, and those of group 2 were 0.17 +/- 0.65 degrees and 85.5 +/- 0.92 degrees. The major complications were from improper small skin incision during a constraint attempt of minimally invasive surgery and during bulk fixation frame pins insertion. Robotic-assisted technology had definite advantages in terms of preoperative planning, accuracy of the intraoperative procedure, and postoperative follow-up, especially in the femoral flexion angle (gamma angle) and tibial flexion angle (delta angle) in the lateral x-ray, and in the femoral flexion angle (alpha angle) in the anteroposterior x-ray. But a disadvantage was the high complication rate in early stage."
pub.1112098271,A novel handheld robotic-assisted system for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: surgical technique and early survivorship,"Technology, including robotics, has been developed for use in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to improve accuracy and precision of bone preparation, implant positioning, and soft tissue balance. The NAVIO™ System (Smith and Nephew, Pittsburgh, PA, United States) is a handheld robotic system that assists surgeons in planning implant positioning based on an individual patient’s anatomy and then preparing the bone surface to accurately achieve the plan. The surgical technique is presented herein. In addition, initial results are presented for 128 patients (mean age 64.7 years; 57.8% male) undergoing UKA with NAVIO. After a mean of follow-up period of 2.3 years, overall survivorship of the knee implant was 99.2% (95% confidence interval 94.6–99.9%). There was one revision encountered during the study, which was due to persistent soft tissue pain, without evidence of loosening, subsidence, malposition or infection. These initial results suggest a greater survivorship than achieved in the same follow-up time intervals in national registries and cohort studies, though further follow-up is needed to confirm whether this difference is maintained at longer durations."
pub.1149622292,A prospective randomised controlled trial of mechanical axis with soft tissue release balancing vs functional alignment with bony resection balancing in total knee replacement—a study using Stryker Mako robotic arm-assisted technology,"BackgroundImproving the functional outcome following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by using different alignment techniques remains controversial. The surgical techniques and technologies used so far to obtain these alignments have all suffered from inaccuracies. The use of robotic technology to plan and execute the bony resection provides increased accuracy for these various alignment techniques and may determine which will deliver superior function. Functional alignment (FA) is a newer surgical technique that aims to position the prosthesis with respect to each patients’ specific bony anatomy whilst minimising disruption to the soft tissue envelope. This trial aims to compare the patient and surgical outcomes of FA to the current gold standard surgical technique, mechanical alignment (MA), under randomised and blinded conditions.MethodsPatients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be prospectively recruited. Following informed consent, 240 patients will be randomised to either a MA surgical technique (the control group) or a FA surgical technique (the intervention group) at a ratio of 4:1 using a random number generator. All patients will undergo computer tomography (CT) based robotic arm-assisted surgery to execute planned implant positioning and alignment with high levels of accuracy. The primary outcome is the forgotten joint score (FJS) at 2 years post-operation. Secondary outcome measures include patient reported outcome measures of post-operative rehabilitation, pain, function and satisfaction, as well as limb alignment, implant revisions and adverse events. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol population analysis will also be conducted. Standardisation of the surgical system and care pathways will minimise variation and assist in both patient and physiotherapist blinding. Ethical approval was obtained from the Northern B Health and Disability Ethics Committee (20/NTB/10).DiscussionCurrently, MA remains the gold standard in knee replacement due to proven outcomes and excellent long-term survivorship. There are many alternative alignment techniques in the literature, all with the goal of improving patient outcomes. This study is unique in that it leverages an advanced analytics tool to assist the surgeon in achieving balance. Both alignment techniques will be executed with high precision using the CT-based robotic arm-assisted surgery system which will minimise surgical variation. This trial design will help determine if FA delivers superior outcomes for patients.Trial registrationAustralia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN12620000009910.

Spinopelvic obliquity is a less-recognized cause of limb length differences in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The robotic arm has recently been introduced to enhance implant positioning during surgery and to achieve more predictable leg length and offset goals. In this article, we illustrate the case of a patient who presented with a leg length discrepancy associated with significant spinopelvic obliquity. We show the use of the robotic arm total hip application to improve her pelvic obliquity and limb length discrepancy. This approach helped with the patient's symptoms and gait as well as her radiographic pelvic alignment."
pub.1170324396,Robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty is not associated with improved accuracy in implant position and alignment compared to conventional instrumentation in the execution of a preoperative digital plan,"Purpose: The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate if robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RO-TKA) results in improved accuracy compared to conventional TKA (CO-TKA) with respect to alignment and component positioning executing a preoperative digital plan. The secondary objective was to compare patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between the two groups at 6 months of follow-up (FU).
Methods: Patients who underwent primary TKA using the concept of constitutional alignment were identified from the database. Each patient underwent preoperative digital planning as well as postoperative evaluation of the preoperative plan (alignment and component position) using mediCAD® software (Hectec GmbH). Two groups were formed: (i) The RO-TKA group (<i>n</i> = 30) consisted of patients who underwent TKA with a robotic surgical system (ROSA®, Zimmer Biomet) and (ii) the CO-TKA group (<i>n</i> = 67) consisted of patients who underwent TKA with conventional instrumentation. To assess accuracy, all qualitative variables were analysed using the <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> test. Tegner activity scale, Oxford Knee Score and visual analogue scale were assessed preop and at 6-month FU. To assess differences between the two groups, a 2 × 2 repeated measures analysis of variance was performed.
Results: There was no significant (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05) difference in the accuracy of alignment as well as tibial and femoral component position between the two groups. At the 6-month FU, there was no significant (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05) difference in PROMs between the two groups.
Conclusion: While robotic TKA may have some potential advantages, no significant difference was found between robotic and conventional TKA with respect to limb alignment, clinical outcomes and component positioning.

pub.1104119612,Robotic-assisted compared with conventional total hip arthroplasty: systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) allows for accurate preoperative planning and component positioning, potentially enhancing implant survival and long-term outcomes. The relative efficacy and safety of robotic-assisted and conventional THA, however, are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted and conventional THA.
METHODS: Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched in September 2017 to identify studies comparing the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted and conventional THA. Seven studies were included. Data of interest were extracted and analysed using Review Manager 5.3.
RESULTS: The seven included studies involved 1516 patients, with 522 undergoing robotic-assisted and 994 undergoing conventional THA. Compared with conventional THA, robotic-assisted THA was associated with longer surgical time (not significant); lower intraoperative complication rates (OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.34, p&lt;0.0001 I<sup>2</sup>); better cup placement, stem placement and global offset and a higher rate of heterotopic ossifications. Functional scores, limb length discrepancy and rates of revision and stress shielding were similar in the two groups. The relative amount of blood loss was unclear.
CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that robotic-assisted THA has certain advantages over conventional THA, including the results of component positioning and rates of intraoperative complications. Additional comparative studies are required to determine the long-term clinical outcomes of robotic-assisted THA."
pub.1165943632,Robotic-assisted TKA is Not Associated With Decreased Odds of Early Revision: An Analysis of the American Joint Replacement Registry,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted TKA continues to see wider clinical use, despite limited knowledge of its impact on patient satisfaction and implant survival. Most studies to date have presented small cohorts and came from single-surgeon or single-center experiences. Therefore, a population-level comparison of revision rates between robotic-assisted and conventional TKA in the registry setting may help arthroplasty surgeons better define whether robotic assistance provides a meaningful advantage compared with the conventional technique.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) After controlling for confounding variables, such as surgeon, location of surgery, and patient comorbidity profile, were robotic-assisted TKAs less likely than conventional TKAs to result in revision for any reason at 2 years? (2) After again controlling for confounding variables, were robotic-assisted TKAs less likely to result in any specific reasons for revision than the conventional technique at 2 years?
METHODS: The American Joint Replacement Registry was used to identify patients 65 years or older who underwent TKA between January 2017 and March 2020 with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. Patients were limited to age 65 yeas or older to link TKAs to Medicare claims data. Two retrospective cohorts were created: robotic-assisted TKA and conventional TKA. Patient demographic variables included in the analysis were age, gender, BMI, and race. Additional characteristics included the Charlson comorbidity index, anesthesia type, year of the index procedure, and length of stay. A total of 10% (14,216 of 142,550) of TKAs performed during this study period used robotics. Patients with robotic-assisted TKA and those with conventional TKA were similar regarding age (73 ± 6 years versus 73 ± 6 years; p = 0.31) and gender (62% [8736 of 14,126] versus 62% [79,399 of 128,334] women; p = 0.34). A multivariable, mixed-effects logistic regression model was created to analyze the odds of all-cause revision as a factor of robot use, and a logistic regression model was created to investigate specific revision diagnoses.
RESULTS: After controlling for potentially confounding variables, such as surgeon, location of surgery, and Charlson comorbidity index, we found no difference between the robotic-assisted and conventional TKAs in terms of the odds of revision at 2 years (OR of robotic-assisted versus conventional TKA 1.0 [95% CI 0.8 to 1.3]; p = 0.92). The reasons for revision of robotic-assisted TKA did not differ from those of conventional TKA, except for an increased odds of instability (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.0 to 2.4]; p = 0.04) and pain (OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.4 to 3.0]; p < 0.001) in the robotic-assisted cohort.
CONCLUSION: In light of these findings, surgeons should not assume that robotic assistance in TKA will lead to improved early implant survival. Our findings do not support an improvement over conventional TKA with robotic assistance with regards to common causes of early revisions such malalignment, malpos"
pub.1174692787,Early Radiographic and Clinical Outcomes of Robotic‐arm‐assisted versus Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE: A robotic system was recently introduced to improve prosthetic alignment during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to determine whether robotic-arm-assisted TKA improves clinical and radiological outcomes when compared to conventional TKA.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients who underwent primary TKA were enrolled in this prospective, randomized controlled trial, which was conducted at three hospitals. Five patients were lost to follow-up 6 weeks after surgery. Therefore, 125 participants (63 in the intervention group and 62 in the control group) remained in the final analysis. The primary outcome was the rate at which the mechanical axis of the femur deviated by less than 3° from the mechanical axis of the tibia. This was evaluated by full-length weight-bearing X-rays of the lower limb 6 weeks postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included operation times, 6-week postoperative functional outcomes evaluated by the American Knee Society score (KSS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), short form-36 (SF-36) health survey results, and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).
RESULTS: At 6 weeks postoperatively, we found that the rate of radiographic inliers was significantly higher in the intervention group (78.7% vs 51.6%; p = 0.00; 95% confidence interval, 10.9% to 43.2%). The operation was significantly longer in the intervention group than in the control group (119.5 vs 85.0 min; p = 0.00). There were no significant differences in the 6-week postoperative functional outcomes, SF-36, AEs, and SAEs between the two groups. There were no AEs or SAEs that were determined to be ""positively related"" to the robotic system.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-arm-assisted TKA is safe and effective, as demonstrated in this trial."
pub.1174922732,Does Robotic Assisted Technique Improve Patient Utility in Total Knee Arthroplasty? A Comparative Retrospective Cohort Study,"BACKGROUND: Even if robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) is a widely used technique, there is still a gap of knowledge about whether this technology is effective in improving the patient utility. This measure is of paramount importance for conducting cost effectiveness analysis. The aim of this study was to compare the utility measure derived from self-reported outcomes questionnaires in patients who underwent RATKA compared to patients who underwent the manual surgery.
METHODS: We compared 72 patients operated with a robotic technique with 70 operated with traditional technique. The utility data were collected with the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis index) self-administrated questionnaire that investigates pain, stiffness and functionality of the patients, an then mapped to a utility value through a validated transforming function. We performed three surveys: the first one before the intervention (t0), the second one 1 year after the surgery (t1) and the third one at the 2 year follow up (t2).
RESULTS: we observed higher utility values in both groups. In detail, the mean utility score in the RATKA group increased from 0.37 to 0.71 (t1) and 0.78 (t2), while in the conventional group it increased from 0.41 to 0.78 (t1) and 0.78 (t2). The fixed effect coefficients of t1 and t2 were found to be 0.37 and 0.363 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for both). The coefficient of the robotic technique, along with its interaction with the t1 and t2 time effect was non-significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Even if at t1 the utility of patient who underwent RATKA were lower, at longer follow up (t2) we found no significant difference compared to traditional technique, leaving the superiority of robotic assisted technique yet to be proved. Our results may be useful for calculating the gained or lost Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), so that the health care system (or an insurance company) could make an appropriate decision whether to fund the robotic approach or not, after a careful assessment of the incremental costs incurred."
pub.1132508160,Robotic-Assisted versus Manually Implanted Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Clinical and Radiographic Comparison.,"INTRODUCTION: Component positioning during THA is one of the more critical surgeon-controlled factors as malposition has been associated with higher rates of hip dislocations, poor biomechanics, accelerated wear rates, leg length discrepancies (LLDs), and revision surgeries. In order to reduce the rates of component malposition and improve surgical accuracy, robotic-assisted THA has developed increased interest. The primary objective of this study was to compare patient outcomes following THA using the Mako Stryker robotic system (Stryker Orthopaedics, Mahwah, New Jersey) to outcomes in patients who underwent conventional instrumented THA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing THA with a direct-lateral surgical approach from a single surgeon were reviewed. Patients were treated with either a robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (RTHA) or a conventional-instrumented total hip arthroplasty (CTHA). Minimum follow up was 16 months.
RESULTS: Robotic-assisted THA significantly improved patient outcomes compared to conventional THA. No significant differences were observed in postoperative radiographic outcomes between the RTHA and CTHA cohorts. In our analysis, patients in the RTHA cohort compared to the CTHA cohort had significantly higher Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) (P<0.001) and Harris Hip Scores (P<0.05) at final follow up. There were no significant differences between the RTHA cohort and CTHA cohorts in regard to cup inclination (°) (P=0.10), hip length difference (mm) (P=0.80), hip length discrepancy (mm) (P=0.10), and global offset difference (mm) (P=0.20).
CONCLUSION: Further studies, particularly prospective randomized studies, are necessary to investigate the short- and long-term clinical outcomes, possible long-term complications, and cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted THA in regard to improving outcomes and accuracy."
pub.1172571593,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty reduces soft-tissue releases which improves functional outcomes: A retrospective study,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing use of Robotic-Assisted (RA) and personalized alignment techniques in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of this study was that RA TKA would result in fewer soft-tissue releases, and that fewer soft-tissue releases would be associated with improved clinical outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective review of an internal company registry was conducted for all primary TKAs performed from Jan 1, 2014, through a database extract date of Nov 4, 2022. These were grouped by whether there was an intentional soft-tissue release performed (STR) during the surgery or not (NSTR) and whether RA was utilized. The incidence of STR was compared between RA-TKAs and those performed with manual instrumentation. Knee Society Score (KSS) and Knee Society Function Scores (KSFS) were collected at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Kaplan-Meier survivorship was performed.
RESULTS: The incidence of STR was significantly lower for RA vs. Manual (43.81% Vs 86.62%, p < 0.0001). The TKAs with NSTR had higher KSFS compared to those with STR at 6 months (84.73 Vs. 77.51, p < 0.0001), 1 year (89.87 Vs. 83.54, p < 0.0001) and 2 years (90.09 Vs. 82.65, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in survivorship, or KSS at any time point. However, the NSTR group had improved KSS pain sub score at 2 years.
CONCLUSION: The results of this observational, retrospective analysis found that the incidence of soft-tissue release was lower with RA-TKA. Further, regardless of if RA was used, avoiding releases was associated with improved KSFS and KSS pain scores through 2 years post-operatively."
pub.1170310389,Identifying subgroups of patients that may benefit from robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty: Secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The aims were to assess whether a specific subgroup(s) of patients had a clinically significant benefit in their knee specific outcome or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) when undergoing robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) when compared to manually performed TKA (mTKA).
METHODS: One hundred patients were randomised to either rTKA or mTKA, 50 to each group, of which 46 and 41 were available for functional review at 6-months, respectively. Subgroup analysis was undertaken for sex, age (<67-years versus ≥ 67-years), preoperative WOMAC score (<40 versus ≥ 40) and EQ-5D utility (<0.604 versus ≥ 0.604).
RESULTS: Male patients undergoing rTKA had a clinically and statistically significant greater improvement in WOMAC pain (mean difference (MD) 16.3, p = 0.011) at 2-months, function (MD 12.6, p = 0.032) and total score (MD 12.7, p = 0.030), and OKS (MD 6.0, p = 0.030) at 6-months. Patients < 67-years old undergoing rTKA had a clinically and statistically significant greater improvement in WOMAC pain (MD 10.3, p = 0.039) at 2-months, and function (MD 12.9, p = 0.040) and total (MD 13.1, p = 0.038) scores at 6-months. Patients with a preoperative WOMAC total score of < 40 points undergoing rTKA had a clinically and statistically significant greater improvement in WOMAC pain (MD 14.6, p = 0.044) at 6-months. Patients with a preoperative EQ-5D utility of <0.604 undergoing rTKA had a clinically and statistically significant greater improvement in WOMAC pain (MD 15.5, p = 0.011) at 2-months.
CONCLUSION: Patients of male sex, younger age, worse preoperative knee specific function and HRQoL had a clinically significantly better early functional outcome with rTKA when compared to mTKA."
pub.1174004919,"Robotic Arm–Assisted System Improved Accuracy of Cup Position and Orientation in Cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty for Dysplastic Hips: A Comparison Among Groups With Manual Placement, Computed Tomography–Based Navigation, and Robotic Surgery","Background: Accurate cup placement in total hip arthroplasty (THA) for patients with dysplasia is challenging due to the distinctive bone deformities. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of cup placement position and orientation across robotic arm-assisted systems (R-THA), computed tomography-based navigation (N-THA), and manual procedure (M-THA) in THA for osteoarthritis secondary to dysplasia.
Methods: A total of 167 patients (197 hips), including 88 R-THAs, 45 N-THAs, and 46 M-THAs, were analyzed. Propensity score matching was performed to align the patient backgrounds. Horizontal and vertical centers of rotation were measured for cup position, whereas radiographic inclination and anteversion were measured for cup orientation. The proportion of cases with cup placement within 3 mm and 5° from the target was compared.
Results: R-THA had a significantly higher percentage of cup placement within 3 mm of the target compared to N-THA (78% vs 49%; <i>P</i> = .0041) and M-THA (78% vs 53%; <i>P</i> = .013). Similarly, R-THA was significantly more successful in placing the cup within 5° of the target compared to N-THA (84% vs 58%; <i>P</i> = .0049) and M-THA (91% vs 20%; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001). Moreover, N-THA was significantly better at placing the cup within 5° of the target compared to M-THA (62% vs 14%; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001), whereas there was no significant difference in the percentage of cup placement within 3 mm of the target (51% vs 51%; <i>P</i> = 1.0).
Conclusions: Robotic arm-assisted system and computed tomography-based navigation improved accuracy in cup orientation compared to the manual procedure. Additionally, the robotic arm-assisted system further improved cup position accuracy."
pub.1145879153,A Cost‐Utility Analysis of Robotic Arm‐Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: Using Robotic Data from the Private Sector and Manual Data from the National Health Service,"Purpose: The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) compared with manual total hip arthroplasty (mTHA) and to assess the influence of annual volume on the relative cost-effectiveness of rTHA.
Methods: A database of both rTHA (<i>n</i> = 48 performed in a private centre) and mTHA (<i>n</i> = 512 performed in the National Health Service) was used. Patient demographics, preoperative Oxford hip score, forgotten joint score, EuroQol 5-dimensional 3-level (EQ-5D), and postoperative EQ-5D were recorded. Two models for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for rTHA were calculated based on a unit performing 100 rTHAs per year: 10-year follow-up and a lifetime time horizon (remaining life expectancy of a 69-year-old patient).
Results: When adjusting for confounding factors, rTHA was independently associated with a 0.091 (<i>p</i>=0.029) greater improvement in the EQ-5D compared to mTHA. This resulted in a 10-year time horizon cost per QALY for rTHA of £1,910 relative to mTHA, which increased to £2,349 per QALY when discounted (5%/year). When using the 10-year time horizon cost per QALY was approximately £3,000 for a centre undertaking 50 rTHAs per year and decreased to £1,000 for centre undertaking 200 rTHAs per year. Using a lifetime horizon, the incremental unadjusted cost per QALY gained was £980 and £1432 when discounted (5%/year) for rTHA compared with mTHA.
Conclusions: Despite the increased cost associated with rTHA, it was a cost-effective intervention relative to mTHA due to the associated greater health-related quality of health gain, according to the EQ-5D outcome measure."
pub.1174931322,Reduction in rate of implant waste associated with robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"Aims: Implant waste during total hip arthroplasty (THA) represents a significant cost to the USA healthcare system. While studies have explored methods to improve THA cost-effectiveness, the literature comparing the proportions of implant waste by intraoperative technology used during THA is limited. The aims of this study were to: 1) examine whether the use of enabling technologies during THA results in a smaller proportion of wasted implants compared to navigation-guided and conventional manual THA; 2) determine the proportion of wasted implants by implant type; and 3) examine the effects of surgeon experience on rates of implant waste by technology used.
Methods: We identified 104,420 implants either implanted or wasted during 18,329 primary THAs performed on 16,724 patients between January 2018 and June 2022 at our institution. THAs were separated by technology used: robotic-assisted (n = 4,171), imageless navigation (n = 6,887), and manual (n = 7,721). The primary outcome of interest was the rate of implant waste during primary THA.
Results: Robotic-assisted THA resulted in a lower proportion (1.5%) of implant waste compared to navigation-guided THA (2.0%) and manual THA (1.9%) (all p < 0.001). Both navigated and manual THA were more likely to waste acetabular shells (odds ratio (OR) 4.5 vs 3.1) and polyethylene liners (OR 2.2 vs 2.0) compared to robotic-assisted THA after adjusting for demographic and perioperative factors, such as surgeon experience (p < 0.001). While implant waste decreased with increasing experience for procedures performed manually (p < 0.001) or with navigation (p < 0.001), waste rates for robotic-assisted THA did not differ based on surgical experience.
Conclusion: Robotic-assisted THAs wasted a smaller proportion of acetabular shells and polyethylene liners than navigation-guided and manual THAs. Individual implant waste rates vary depending on the type of technology used intraoperatively. Future studies on implant waste during THA should examine reasons for non-implantation in order to better understand and develop methods for cost-saving."
pub.1123173251,Radiographic and Clinical Outcomes Following Robotic-Assisted Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Much advancement has been made in the treatment of knee arthritis. A special area of interest has been the treatment of medial unicompartmental disease. However, patients with isolated lateral compartment arthritis represent a significant subset of the population. Lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is performed much less frequently than in the medial compartment and is known to be more technically demanding and less reproducible. Robotic-assisted arthroplasty provides a tool to improve component placement and reproducibility. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review radiographic and clinical outcomes following robotic-assisted lateral UKA. We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients who underwent robotic-assisted lateral UKA by a single surgeon. Indications consisted of isolated lateral compartment arthritis with correctable valgus deformity and an intact anterior cruciate ligament. Eighteen patients met all inclusion criteria, resulting in 20 lateral UKA. Radiographic and clinical outcomes were evaluated and we found that robotic assistance during lateral UKA provided accurate and reproducible results. Native alignment of the tibia and femur were well maintained in the coronal and sagittal planes, and no overcorrection occurred. The standard deviation of tibial components was 1.8°, indicating strong accuracy and reproducibility. Operative times were increased, but this did not lead to intraoperative complications or slowed progression of postoperative rehabilitation. Robotic-assisted lateral UKA provides a tool for accurate and reproducible component placement with excellent short-term clinical outcomes."
pub.1113011963,Outcomes of robotic-arm-assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: minimum 3-year follow-up,"The purpose of this study was to determine implant survivorship, complications, and re-operation rates, after robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) at intermediate follow-up. Patient satisfaction and clinical outcome were further investigated, in addition to an analysis of restoration of knee alignment. Fifty-one patients, who received a robotic arm-assisted medial UKA, were prospectively studied, and followed for a minimum of 3 years (mean 51.4 ± 4.5 months). Survival of implants, complications, reoperations, and patients’ overall satisfaction were evaluated. WOMAC scores, as well as knee flexion, varus deformity and flexion contracture were further analyzed, before and after surgery. No implant failure or implant-related complication was recorded, and no revision surgery was performed at the last follow-up in any patient. Overall satisfaction was excellent; 96.1% of patients, at the latest follow-up, was satisfied or very satisfied, while none was dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. Total WOMAC score and each score’s component was significantly improved after surgery. Knee alignment was significantly improved, as flexion increased, varus decreased, and flexion contracture also decreased. In conclusion, robotic-arm-assisted UKA, through accurate implant positioning, significantly improves range of motion and coronal plane alignment, in appropriately selected patients. Excellent overall satisfaction rates and clinical outcomes can be expected, at intermediate follow-up, along with excellent survival of implants and minimal to none surgery-related morbidity."
pub.1162896913,Is it worth the risk? Frailty transition and complications following robotic total knee arthroplasty: A retrospective observational study,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is an underutilized prognostic parameter in the geriatric population. Our study aimed to analyse the frailty incidence, its transition over 1 year and its influence on complication rate in patients undergoing elective robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: This was a retrospective study wherein an accumulation of deficits model was used to evaluate frailty of 435 consecutive patients undergoing primary unilateral Mako-assisted cemented TKA between January 2020 and July 2021. Based upon the preoperative values, participants were divided into three groups; non-frail (FI < 0.11), vulnerable (0.11-0.20) and frail (FI > 0.20) states and were followed up for 1 year for change in frailty class, complications, re-admissions and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 435 patients were divided into three groups, non-frail (178), vulnerable (208) and frail (49). Improvement in mean frailty scores was seen in all three groups (P < 0.0001); 21.63% of the vulnerable and 48.97% of the frail participants improved by one frailty class. Multivariate analysis showed the co-relation of change in frailty index (ΔFI) with preoperative FI (r = 0.083) and Knee Society Score (KSS) (r = 0.742). The frail group had a significantly higher re-admission rate over 1 year. When compared with the vulnerable group, the frail group had a higher hazard ratio for readmission (3.12 vs. 0.96) and complications (1.62 vs. 1.26).
CONCLUSION: Although frail individuals are at a higher risk for readmissions and perioperative complications, TKA significantly improves the mobility and frailty status of elderly individuals. With explained higher risk of complications, surgeons should not refrain from offering TKA to elderly frail individuals disabled with knee pain."
pub.1145236364,Robotic Assistance for Posterior Approach Total Hip Arthroplasty Is Associated With Lower Risk of Revision for Dislocation When Compared to Manual Techniques,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assistance total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) and computer navigation THA (CN-THA) have been shown to improve accuracy of component positioning compared to manual techniques; however, controversy exists regarding clinical benefit. Moreover, these technologies may expose patients to risks. The purpose of this study is to compare rates of intraoperative fracture and complications requiring reoperation within 1 year for posterior approach RA-THA, CN-THA, and THA with no technology (Manual-THA).
METHODS: In total, 13,802 primary, unilateral, elective, posterior approach THAs (1770 RA-THAs, 3155 CN-THAs, and 8877 Manual-THAs) were performed at a single institution between 2016 and 2020. Intraoperative fractures and reoperations within 1 year of the index procedure were identified. Cohorts were balanced using inverse probability of treatment weight based on age, gender, body mass index, femoral cementation, history of spine fusion, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Logistic regression was performed to create odds ratios for complications. Additional regression analysis for dislocation was performed, adjusting for dual mobility and femoral head size.
RESULTS: There were no differences in intraoperative fracture and postoperative complication rates between the groups (P = .521). RA-THA had a 0.3 odds ratio (95% confidence interval 0.1-0.9, P = .046) compared to Manual-THA for reoperation due to dislocation. CN-THA had an odds ratio of 3.0 for reoperation due to dislocation (95% confidence interval 0.8-11.3, P = .114) compared to RA-THA. The remaining complication odds ratios, including those for infection, loosening, dehiscence, and ""other"" were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSION: RA-THA is associated with lower risk of revision for dislocation within 1 year of index surgery, when compared to Manual-THA performed through the posterior approach."
pub.1160235589,High degree of alignment precision associated with total knee arthroplasty performed using a surgical robot or handheld navigation,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the precision of bony resections during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed using different computer-assisted technologies.
METHODS: Patients who underwent a primary TKA using an imageless accelerometer-based handheld navigation system (KneeAlign2®, OrthAlign Inc.) or computed tomography-based large-console surgical robot (Mako®, Stryker Corp.) from 2017 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Templated alignment targets and demographic data were collected. Coronal plane alignment of the femoral and tibial components and tibial slope were measured on postoperative radiographs. Patients with excessive flexion or rotation preventing accurate measurement were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 240 patients who underwent TKA using either a handheld (n = 120) or robotic (n = 120) system were included. There were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, and BMI between groups. A small but statistically significant difference in the precision of the distal femoral resection was observed between the handheld and robotic cohorts (1.5° vs. 1.1° difference between templated and measured alignments, p = 0.024), though this is likely clinically insignificant. There were no significant differences in the precision of the tibial resection between the handheld and robotic groups (coronal plane 0.9° vs. 1.0°, n.s.; sagittal plane 1.2° vs. 1.1°, n.s.). There were no significant differences in the rate of overall precision between cohorts (n.s.).
CONCLUSIONS: A high degree of component alignment precision was observed for both imageless handheld navigation and CT-based robotic cohorts. Surgeons considering options for computer-assisted TKA should take other important factors, including surgical principles, templating software, ligament balancing, intraoperative adjustability, equipment logistics, and cost, into account.

pub.1139662990,Versatility and accuracy of a novel image-free robotic-assisted system for total knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionTechnological advances alongside increased demand for knee replacement surgery have led to the development of a novel image-free bed rail-mounted robotic-assisted system for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The device is capable of real-time tracking to accommodate for leg motion during bone resection allowing for precise control and positioning of the bone saw in the planned resection plane. The purpose of this study is to discuss the versatility and accuracy of this novel image-free robotic-assisted technology in TKA.Methods and materialsThe novel robotic-assisted system underwent a stepwise assessment to verify its versatility and accuracy. First, functional accuracy was bench tested to evaluate predetermined surgical plans independent of user variability and anatomic variability compared to conventional instrumentation. This was followed by assessments utilizing cadaveric specimens for resection accuracy, implant positioning, and soft tissue involvement.ResultsTest bench accuracy revealed overall pooled linear positional accuracy of 0.326 ± 0.249 mm and pooled angular positional accuracy of 0.365 ± 0.611°. Resection errors for both robotic and conventional cohorts ranged between 0.6° and 1.9°. Concerning coronal alignment, 33/40 robotic specimen were within ± 1° and 38/40 within ± 3° of the femoral varus–valgus target, compared with 17/40 and 37/40 with conventional instrumentation, respectively. Twenty-four of the 40 robotic specimens were within ± 1° and 40/40 within ± 3° of the tibial varus–valgus target compared with 15/40 and 32/40 with conventional instrumentation, respectively. Soft tissue structures were uncompromised in all robotic-assisted cases. Conventional instruments revealed two cases of partial cleavage of the posterior cruciate ligament and two instances of a compromised posterior medial capsule. There were no significant differences between the two techniques concerning the samples that were uncompromised and fully functional (40/40 vs. 38/40, p = 0.49).ConclusionThe novel image-free robotic-assisted surgical system demonstrates excellent benchtop accuracy to aid bony resection in cadaveric specimens. It offers notable improvement in coronal implant alignment compared to conventional instrumentation."
pub.1172671650,Robotic-assisted differential total knee arthroplasty with patient-specific implants: surgical techniques and preliminary results,"ObjectiveIn total knee arthroplasty (TKA), achieving soft-tissue balance while retaining acceptable lower limb alignment is sometimes difficult and may lead to patient dissatisfaction. Theoretically, patient-specific implants can bring great benefits, while the lack of precise surgical tools may hinder the improvement of outcomes. The objective of this study was to illustrate surgical techniques and evaluate kinematics and early clinical outcomes of robotic-assisted TKA using patient-specific implants.MethodsBased on preoperative CT scan, femoral and tibial components were 3D printed. Medial and lateral tibial liners were separate with different thicknesses, posterior slopes and conformity. TiRobot Recon Robot was used for surgery, and was armed with smart tools that quantify gap, force and femoral-tibial track. We collected data on demographics, intraoperative gap balance and femoral-tibial motion. In the follow-up, we evaluated the range of motion, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), forgotten joint score (FJS), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR) score. Radiological data were also harvested.ResultsFifteen patients (17 knees) were enrolled with a mean age of 64.6 ± 6.4 (53–76) years. In 5 knees, we used symmetric tibial liners, the rest were asymmetric. After surgery, the average alignment was 1.6 ± 2.0 (-3–5) degrees varus. The average follow-up lasted 6.7 ± 4.2 (1–14) months. The mean visual analogue scale was 0.8 ± 0.7 (0–2), FJS was 62.4 ± 25.3 (0–87), KOOS was 86.5 ± 9.4 (57–97). 11 patients were “very satisfied”, 3 were “satisfied"" with the result, and one patient was neutral due to restricted extension and unsatisfactory rehabilitation at five months’ follow-up.ConclusionsWith patient-specific implants and robotics, TKA could be performed by a mathematical way, which was dubbed a “differential” TKA. Intraoperative kinematics was excellent in terms of gap-force balancing and femoral-tibial relative motion. Preliminary clinical outcomes were overall satisfactory."
pub.1160801739,A robotic‐assisted simulation of kinematic alignment in TKA leads to excessive valgus and internal rotation in valgus knees,"PURPOSE: Strategies to further improve patient satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty include the introduction of new alignment philosophies and more precise instruments such as navigation and robotics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a combination of image-based robotic assistance and the use of modern alignment strategies on the resulting joint line obliquity as well as femoral component rotation and to compare this between varus, neutral and valgus knees.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 200 patients who received a robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (MAKO<sup>®</sup>, Stryker) using functional alignment between 2018 and 2020. The patients were divided into a varus (103 patients), neutral (57 patients) and valgus (40 patients) group. The intraoperatively recorded bone cuts and resulting joint line obliquity were identified and compared to values obtained with a robotic computer simulation of kinematic alignment.
RESULTS: The mean femoral coronal alignment of the varus, neutral and valgus group, respectively, equalled 0.5° (± 1.1°), 1.1° (± 0.8°) and 1.6° (± 0.7°) of valgus with functional alignment and 2.1° (± 2.1°), 4.1° (± 1.7°) and 6.2° (± 1.7°) of valgus with kinematic alignment. The mean femoral axial alignment of the valgus group resulted in 0.8° (± 2.0°) of internal rotation with functional alignment and 3.9° (± 2.8°) of internal rotation with kinematic alignment. Overall, 186 knees (93%) could be balanced while respecting certain safe zones by using functional alignment as opposed to 54 knees (27% and none in the valgus group) when applying kinematic alignment. Kinematic alignment led to a combination of femoral component valgus and internal rotation of more than 3° in 22 valgus knees (55%), 10 neutral knees (18%) and 3 varus knees (3%) compared to none in each group when applying functional alignment with safe zones.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted kinematic alignment leads to a combination of excessive valgus and internal rotation of the femoral component in valgus and to a lesser extent also in neutral knees when compared with functional alignment.

pub.1139696201,Imageless robotic handpiece-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a learning curve analysis of surgical time and alignment accuracy,"IntroductionRobotic-assisted surgery techniques are increasing in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). One crucial point is the prolonged time of surgery. The primary objective of this study was to determine the learning curve necessary to minimize the time of surgery. The secondary objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the implant alignment when using an imageless robotic system for TKA.Materials and methodsIn a case–control study, the first 70 consecutive robotic-assisted TKA procedures performed by a single senior surgeon were analyzed with regard to surgery time and implant alignment by comparing the intraoperative plan with the postoperative alignment. The evaluation of the learning curve with respect to surgery time was conducted using cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis. The joint line height was measured with a new technique. Surgery time and joint line reconstruction were compared to 70 consecutive conventional TKA procedures.ResultsThe learning curve for robotic TKA was completed after 11 cases. The learning curve did not influence the accuracy of joint line obliquity, joint line height, or limb alignment. The intraoperative plan designed for the robotic system was precisely implemented. The mean skin-to-skin time in the robotic group after the learning curve was completed did not differ from that in the manual group. A significant positive correlation was observed between the preoperative hip–knee–ankle angle and the postoperative distalization of the joint line in the robotic-assisted TKA group.ConclusionAfter completing the initial learning curve of 11 cases, the surgery time required to perform imageless robotic handpiece-assisted TKA was similar to that for the conventional technique. However, no learning curve was observed for the implant positioning when using the imageless robotic system. The implementation of the intraoperative plan was accurate up to < 2°. The precision of the system allows the implementation of different joint balancing approaches between valgus and varus morphotypes."
pub.1181286368,Robotic assistance improves success of cementless component fixation in one total knee arthroplasty system,"INTRODUCTION: New cementless implant designs in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have begun to shift the longstanding practice of cemented fixation. With aseptic loosening a leading cause for revision of cementless implants, initial osteointegration is critical for component survivorship. Robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) has shown promising results in recent literature at improving component accuracy. The current study aims to evaluate if robotic assistance affects the success of cementless fixation in primary TKA.
METHODS: 445 cementless primary TKA components from one manufacturer implanted by five surgeons between June 2018 and October 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Those with minimum one-year follow-up were analyzed. Femoral and tibial components were reviewed separately and grouped based on whether manual or RA-TKA from the same manufacturer was performed. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze if aseptic loosening rates were different between the two techniques.
RESULTS: 373 (82%) cementless components from a single knee system were included. 146 femoral and 103 tibial components were implanted using RA-TKA, while 63 femoral and 61 tibial components were implanted manually. At a mean follow-up of 18 months (range, 12 to 51 months), successful fixation was achieved in 96.2% of all components. No femoral components from either group were revised due to aseptic loosening. Four manually implanted vs. no robotically assisted tibial components were revised due to aseptic loosening (6.6% vs 0.0%; P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: The performance of modern cementless femoral components was excellent with or without robotic assistance, however RA-TKA improved the survivorship of the same system's cementless tibial component.

pub.1147731432,Predicting robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty operating time : benefits of machine-learning and 3D patient-specific data.,"AIMS: No predictive model has been published to forecast operating time for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aims of this study were to design and validate a predictive model to estimate operating time for robotic-assisted TKA based on demographic data, and evaluate the added predictive power of CT scan-based predictors and their impact on the accuracy of the predictive model.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 1,061 TKAs performed from January 2016 to December 2019 with an image-based robotic-assisted system. Demographic data included age, sex, height, and weight. The femoral and tibial mechanical axis and the osteophyte volume were calculated from CT scans. These inputs were used to develop a predictive model aimed to predict operating time based on demographic data only, and demographic and 3D patient anatomy data.
RESULTS: The key factors for predicting operating time were the surgeon and patient weight, followed by 12 anatomical parameters derived from CT scans. The predictive model based only on demographic data showed that 90% of predictions were within 15 minutes of actual operating time, with 73% within ten minutes. The predictive model including demographic data and CT scans showed that 94% of predictions were within 15 minutes of actual operating time and 88% within ten minutes.
CONCLUSION: The primary factors for predicting robotic-assisted TKA operating time were surgeon, patient weight, and osteophyte volume. This study demonstrates that incorporating 3D patient-specific data can improve operating time predictions models, which may lead to improved operating room planning and efficiency.

pub.1148804757,Computer-Navigated and Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: Increasing in Popularity Without Increasing Complications,"BACKGROUND: Data on the clinical impact of computer navigation (CN) and robotic assistance (RA) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are mixed. This study aims to describe modern utilization trends in CN-TKA, RA-TKA, and traditionally-instrumented (TD) TKA and to assess for differences in postoperative complications and opioid consumption by procedure type.
METHODS: A national database was queried to identify primary, elective TKA patients from 2015 to 2020. Trends in procedural utilization rates were assessed. Differences in 90-day postoperative complications and inpatient opioid consumption were assessed. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to account for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of the 847,496 patients included, 49,317 (5.82%) and 24,460 (2.89%) underwent CN-TKA and RA-TKA, respectively. CN-TKA utilization increased from 5.64% (2015) to 6.41% (2020) and RA-TKA utilization increased from 0.84% (2015) to 5.89% (2020). After adjusting for confounders, CN-TKA was associated with lower periprosthetic joint infection (P = .001), pulmonary embolism (P < .001), and acute respiratory failure (P = .015) risk compared to traditional (TD) TKA. RA-TKA was associated with lower deep vein thrombosis (P < .001), myocardial infarction (P = .013), and pulmonary embolism (P = .001) risk than TD-TKA. Lower postoperative day 1 opioid usage was seen with CN-TKA and RA-TKA than TD-TKA (P < .001). Lower postoperative day 0 opioid consumption was also seen in RA-TKA (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: From 2015 to 2020, there was a relative 13.7% and 601.2% increase in CN-TKAs and RA-TKAs, respectively. This trend was associated with reductions in hospitalization duration, postoperative complications, and opioid consumption. These data support the safety of RA-TKA and CN-TKA compared to TD-TKA. Further investigation into the specific indications for these technology-assisted TKAs is warranted."

This prospective comparative cohort study aimed to compare early postoperative outcomes, satisfaction, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) between patients undergoing mTKA and ROSA raTKA (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) performed by one surgeon.MethodsThirty ROSA raTKAs and 30 mTKAs performed by one surgeon during 2020-2021 were prospectively evaluated. Groups were matched for age, sex, and body mass index. All procedures were primary unilateral TKAs using the same posterior-stabilized prosthesis (Nexgen Legacy, Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN). Length of hospital stay (LOS) and blood transfusion rate were recorded. Complications, visual analogue scale score (VAS), and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) were assessed preoperatively and for six postoperative months. The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) and patient satisfaction were evaluated 6 months postoperatively.ResultsNo complications and similar blood transfusion rate were recorded between groups (p = 0.228). The LOS was non-significantly shorter in raTKA than in the mTKA group (p = 0.120). Mean preoperative and third-month OKS and VAS scores were comparable between groups. However, the mean 6-month OKS (p = 0.006) and VAS score (p = 0.025) were significantly better for the raTKA group. The 6-month FJS was significantly greater for raTKA than the mTKA group (p < 0.001). One patient was unhappy in raTKA, and three in the mTKA group (p = 0.301). Significantly more raTKA patients answered that they would undergo surgery again (p = 0.038).ConclusionraTKA was associated with the same complication risk, less pain level, better patient satisfaction, and PROMs on 6-month follow-up than the mTKA group."
pub.1103278645,Reliability of Intraoperative Knee Range of Motion Measurements by Goniometer Compared with Robot-Assisted Arthroplasty,"Accurate measurement of knee range of motion (ROM) is critical to predict the outcomes of knee surgery and prognosis. We investigated the reliability of knee ROM measurements by goniometer compared with robotic system. Fifty-three patients with medial osteoarthritis who were planning to undergo unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) with robotic UKA were prospectively enrolled. During the operation, knee ROM measurement was performed in both flexion and extension before and after insertion of the implant using both a goniometer and robotic system. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of extension measured by the goniometer and robotic system showed good agreement; however, the ICC of flexion did not show good agreement. During passive flexion, the mean values measured before insertion of the implant were significantly lower by goniometer (134.6 ± 6.43) than by robot (145.4 ± 6.80; <i>p</i> = 0.017); likewise, the mean values after insertion of the implant were significantly lower by goniometer (138.6 ± 6.07) than by robotic system (147.0 ± 6.60; <i>p</i> = 0.045). A goniometer can underestimate knee ROM measurements compared with robotic system, especially in flexion. Orthopaedic surgeons should be cautious when measuring the flexion angle with a goniometer."
pub.1170442211,Does inverse kinematic alignment coupled with robot-assisted TKA optimize patellofemoral clinical and radiological results?,"INTRODUCTION: With a satisfaction rate of 80%, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery has seen significant improvements in recent decades. The 20% of poor results may be explained by the alignment technique used for implant placement, which can influence patellofemoral kinematics. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that the use of inverse kinematic alignment makes it possible to obtain satisfactory clinical and radiological patellar scores in robotic TKA.
HYPOTHESIS: The inverse kinematic alignment technique coupled with robotic surgery makes it possible to restore the native kinematics of the patella.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study including 100 TKAs with a primary TKA performed using the Stryker Mako™ robotic surgery system, and the inverse kinematic alignment technique. Patients who underwent patella resurfacing were excluded. Clinical and radiological scores were recorded preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively.
RESULTS: At one year, the specific patellar clinical scores were excellent with an average Kujala score of 85.69 and an average HSS Patellar score 88.15. The average patellar lateralization index was 0.15 and the average patellar tilt was 5.1°, showing no significant difference compared to preoperation (p=0.45 and p=0.18). The average external rotation of the femoral implant was 0.47±0.6° [-1.9; 2.1].
DISCUSSION: The patellofemoral clinical results were excellent. The use of the robotic arm coupled with this alignment technique makes it possible to obtain a controlled external rotation of the femoral implant as well as an optimized orientation of the tibial component, favoring good restitution of the alignment of the extensor apparatus. This study did not demonstrate any radiological correction of patellar tilt and lateralization.
CONCLUSION: The combined use of robotic surgery with the inverse kinematic alignment technique seems effective on specific clinical results of the patellofemoral joint.

pub.1182024288,"Comparison of Implant Placement Accuracy Between Manual, Robot-Assisted, Computer-Navigated, Augmented Reality Navigated, Patient-Specific Instrumentation, and Accelerometer Navigated Total Hip Arthroplasty","BACKGROUND: Malpositioning of the acetabular cup during total hip arthroplasty (THA) can lead to complications. Robotic surgery and navigation techniques aim to address this issue, but there is limited evidence regarding which method can achieve better clinical outcomes. Therefore, this network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to compare the efficacy of various navigation methods.
METHODS: This NMA of prospective randomized controlled trials compared robot-assisted systems (RAS), computer-assisted navigation systems (CAS), augmented reality-based portable navigation (AR), patient-specific instrumentation (PSI), portable accelerometer-based navigation (PN), and conventional methods (C) for THA procedures. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Clinical Trials Platform Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. databases. The primary outcomes included revision surgery and postoperative clinical scores, and the secondary outcomes encompassed cup placement accuracy, acetabular cup placement outliers from the Lewinnek safe zone, surgical time, and complications. We used a Bayesian random-effects NMA, and confidence of evidence was assessed using confidence in NMA.
RESULTS: We identified 45 studies including 2,122 patients. We did not find large differences in revision surgery, clinical outcome scores, cup inclination, or anteversion angle accuracy among the modalities. AR, CAS, and PSI exhibited a lower risk of outliers from safe zones than C. In addition, RAS and CAS had a longer surgical time than C.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic and navigation tools did not reduce the revision risk or enhance clinical outcomes. AR, CAS, PSI, and PN may decrease the risk of cup placement outliers in safe zones. However, the cup placement accuracy was equivalent, and the surgical time may be longer in RAS and CAS than in C.

pub.1175832519,Determinants of pivot kinematics in posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Restoring medial knee pivot kinematics post-total knee arthroplasty is widely recognized to enhance patient satisfaction. Our study investigates the kinematics of patients who received posterior stabilized implants via robotic-arm assisted surgery, specifically analyzing effects of implant alignment and soft tissue balance on pivot location.
METHODS: Twelve high-functioning patients with unilateral posterior stabilizing knee implants underwent CT-guided robotic-arm assisted surgery. We then evaluated their knee kinematics using stereo radiography during gait, stair descent, lunge, seated knee extension and leg press. Femoral low-point condylar kinematics were used to calculate the transverse center of rotation, or pivot, using principal component analysis. Linear mixed effects regression was used to identify surgical parameters that influence pivot location across a flexion range.
FINDINGS: Across all five activities a central pivot pattern emerged as the primary pivot location (40 %) followed by medial (25 %), no pivot (22 %) and lateral (14 %). Tibial medial resection depth and Tibial implant flexion-extension placement were significantly associated with shifting the pivot location laterally prior to cam-post engagement. Femoral implant external-internal implant placement, and medial compartment laxity in extension were significantly associated with shifting the pivot location laterally during the cam-post engagement, while femoral distal-lateral resection depth was associated with a medial shift.
INTERPRETATION: Central and medial pivot locations are predominant in patients with posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty, facilitated by robotic-arm assisted surgery. Despite significant associations between surgical parameters such as tibial medial resection depth and lateral compartment laxity with medial pivot, these variables explained a small portion of the variability in pivot location. This suggests that while surgical precision influences pivot kinematics, individual patient factors may play a more critical role, suggesting a need for further research into patient-specific biomechanics to optimize post-surgical outcomes."
pub.1169602185,"The ROSA robotic-arm system reliably restores joint line height, patella height and posterior condylar offset in total knee arthroplasty","INTRODUCTION: There is growing interest in the use of robotic TKA to improve accuracy of component positioning in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of implant component position using the ROSA® knee system with specific reference to Joint Line Height, Patella Height and Posterior Condylar Offset (PCO).
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of a prospectively-maintained database of the initial 100 consecutive TKAs performed by a high volume surgeon using the ROSA® knee system. Both the image-based and imageless workflow were used and two prosthesis types were implanted. To determine the accuracy of component positioning, the immediate post-operative radiograph was reviewed and compared with the immediate pre-operative radiograph with regards to Joint Line Height, Patella Height and Posterior Condylar Offset.
RESULTS: 100 consecutive patients undergoing TKA using the ROSA system were included; mean age 70 years (range 49-95 years). Mean change in joint line height was 0.2 mm, patella height (Insall-Salvati ratio) 0.01 and posterior condylar offset 0.02 mm; there was no statistically significant difference between the pre and post-operative values. No difference was demonstrated between image-based or imageless workflows, or between implant design (Persona versus Vanguard) regarding joint line height, patella height and PCO.
CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the ROSA® knee system in accurately restoring Joint Line Height, Patella Height and Posterior Condylar Offset in TKA surgery. No significant differences were found between imageless and image-based groups, or between implant designs (Persona versus Vanguard)."
pub.1157021121,Global research status and trends in orthopaedic surgical robotics: a bibliometric and visualisation analysis study,"This study aimed to investigate and summarise the current state of research and trends in orthopaedic surgical robots. Data on publicly available publications related to orthopaedic surgical robots were extracted by abstract searches of the Web of Science Core Collection database. A bibliometric analysis and detailed reading of the publications were then carried out and the information was visualised using co-authorship analysis, coupling analysis, co-citation analysis and co-occurrence analysis in VOSviewer. With 436 publications included in the study from 1993 to 2022, the overall contribution of publications to the world showed an increasing trend year by year, with a particularly pronounced after 2017, and a geographical trend of predominantly East Asia, North America, and Western Europe. Of these, China was the largest contributor (n = 128). Overall, the UK affiliates and their scholars were leaders in the field, with a high number of publications, total citations, average citations per article and H-index. The most published institutions and authors were Imperial College London (n = 21) and Professor Fares Sahi Haddad of University College London (n = 12), respectively. Journals with a high overall impact on robotic orthopaedic surgery were the Journal of Arthroplasty, Bone Joint Journal, International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. Keyword co-occurrence network analysis revealed four main clusters: robot-assisted knee, hip arthroplasty, spine surgery, and robotic technology research and development. The top three most common sites for robot-assisted surgery use were the knee, hip and spine. The most used robot types were the knee and spine, with Mako and Arobot being the most used robots for the knee and TiRobot for the spine. This study comprehensively reveals the current status and trends of global research on orthopaedic surgical robots, covering countries, institutions, authors, journals, research hotspots, robot types and surgical sites, providing directional guidance and research ideas for further research on the technological development and clinical evaluation of orthopaedic surgical robots."
pub.1173118556,Epidemiological Trends and Outcomes of Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Among 104 Million Patients in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for localized osteoarthritis. Recent advancements in UKA implant design and expanding patient criteria may have increased its utilization. However, few studies have examined the use of UKA in the United States. Thus, this study assessed the current and projected future trends of UKA and robotic UKA in the United States through 2035, along with postoperative outcomes.
METHODS: A collaborative healthcare research network was queried to identify patients who had undergone UKA. Primary outcomes measured included prevalence (P), incidence proportion (IP), and incidence rate (IR) from 2012 to 2022. Chi-squared analyses were done to compare outcomes across categorical data. Regression modeling was performed to project UKA to the year 2035. Statistical significance was held at P < .05 for all analyses.
RESULTS: In 2022, 1,662 UKAs were performed within the network, a 590% increase from 2012 (241 performed). The IP increased on an average annual basis by 41.8%, the IR by 50%, and the P by 51.3%. A year following UKA, conversion to TKA was the most common orthopaedic complication (39.9%). As of 2022, there were 68 robotic UKAs performed, a 518% increase from the 11 performed in 2012. Regression analysis for UKA through 2035 showed that IP will be 0.04%, IR will be 1.75 × 10<sup>-6</sup> cases/person-day, and P will be 0.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with prior studies indicating a higher utilization of UKA over the past decade. Reported complications were not uncommon, as nearly 40% of patients required a conversion to a TKA. Further research is needed to optimally identify criteria for appropriate patients and determine the benefits robotic UKA may provide, specifically reducing the risk of conversion to a TKA."
pub.1155821098,CT required to perform robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty can identify previously undiagnosed osteoporosis and guide femoral fixation strategy,"Osteoporosis can determine surgical strategy for total hip arthroplasty (THA), and perioperative fracture risk. The aims of this study were to use hip CT to measure femoral bone mineral density (BMD) using CT X-ray absorptiometry (CTXA), determine if systematic evaluation of preoperative femoral BMD with CTXA would improve identification of osteopenia and osteoporosis compared with available preoperative dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) analysis, and determine if improved recognition of low BMD would affect the use of cemented stem fixation. Retrospective chart review of a single-surgeon database identified 78 patients with CTXA performed prior to robotic-assisted THA (raTHA) (Group 1). Group 1 was age- and sex-matched to 78 raTHAs that had a preoperative hip CT but did not have CTXA analysis (Group 2). Clinical demographics, femoral fixation method, CTXA, and DXA data were recorded. Demographic data were similar for both groups. Preoperative femoral BMD was available for 100% of Group 1 patients (CTXA) and 43.6% of Group 2 patients (DXA). CTXA analysis for all Group 1 patients preoperatively identified 13 osteopenic and eight osteoporotic patients for whom there were no available preoperative DXA data. Cemented stem fixation was used with higher frequency in Group 1 versus Group 2 (28.2% vs 14.3%, respectively; p = 0.030), and in all cases where osteoporosis was diagnosed, irrespective of technique (DXA or CTXA). Preoperative hip CT scans which are routinely obtained prior to raTHA can determine bone health, and thus guide femoral fixation strategy. Systematic preoperative evaluation with CTXA resulted in increased recognition of osteopenia and osteoporosis, and contributed to increased use of cemented femoral fixation compared with routine clinical care; in this small study, however, it did not impact short-term periprosthetic fracture risk."
pub.1128478955,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty is comparable to conventional total knee arthroplasty: a meta-analysis and systematic review,"BackgroundTotal knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a successful procedure in managing end-stage arthritis when non-operative treatments fail. New technologies such as robotic TKA (rTKA) have been developed to improve the accuracy of prosthesis implantation. While short-term cohort studies on rTKA have shown excellent results, the evidence comparing between rTKA and conventional TKA (cTKA) is not yet well established. This meta-analysis aims to compare the efficacy and safety of rTKA versus cTKA in terms of clinical outcomes, radiographic results, complications, peri-operative parameters and costs.MethodsA multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies comparing between rTKA and cTKA were extracted and analyzed.ResultsEighteen studies were included in this review, consisting of 2234 rTKA and 4300 cTKA. Robotic TKA led to a more precise prosthesis implantation with significantly fewer outliers in the mechanical axis (p < 0.001), femoral coronal (p = 0.002) and tibial sagittal (p = 0.01) alignments. Only the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) (p < 0.001) score at final follow-up was significantly better in rTKA than cTKA. rTKA also had a lower mean blood loss (p < 0.001) despite a longer mean operation time (p = 0.006). There were no statistically significant difference in terms of other clinical outcome measures, range of motion and complications.ConclusionBoth rTKA and cTKA are reliable and safe to perform. However, rTKA is capable of achieving superior alignment in several axes, lower mean blood loss and this may lead to marginally better clinical outcomes than cTKA.Evidence levelLevel II, Meta-analysis of non-homogeneous studies"
pub.1137608392,Impact of Robotic Assisted Surgery on Outcomes in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of robotic technologies into the field of arthroplasty ushered in promises of increased precision and superior outcomes over conventional methods. However, the effect on outcomes in total hip arthroplasty (THA) remains debatable, particularly when considering the additional financial burden created by the addition of robotics. The purpose of this study is to examine total cost of care, length of stay (LOS), and postoperative complications in robotic-assisted vs conventional THA recipients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the Mariner database was performed within PearlDiver Technologies for patients undergoing THA from 2010 to 2018 (n = 714,859). Patients with robotic-assisted procedures were matched with patients undergoing conventional THA at a 1:1 ratio based on age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, smoking, and obesity status (n = 4630). LOS, total cost of care, readmission rates, and medical and surgical outcomes were examined.
RESULTS: Robotic-assisted patients had shorter average LOS (3.4 vs 3.7 days, <i>P</i> = .001). The mean cost for robotic-assisted patients was $1684 and $1759 less at 90 days and 1 year, respectively (both <i>P</i> = .001). Readmission rates were higher for robotic-assisted patients at 1 year (7.8 vs 6.6%; <i>P</i> = .001), while surgical outcomes were not significantly different at all timepoints (all <i>P</i> &gt; .498). Robotic-assisted patients demonstrated significantly higher blood transfusion rates (4.4 vs 3.2%; <i>P</i> = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted THA was associated with minimal decreases in LOS and costs as compared to conventional methods. However, robotics was associated with slightly higher readmissions and blood transfusions."
pub.1063888670,Haptically guided robotic technology in total hip arthroplasty: A cadaveric investigation,"The longevity of total hip arthroplasty (THA) continues to improve with advancements in design and bearing materials. However, the incidence of dislocation and impingement-related failures continue to rise, with the inability of the surgeon to achieve optimal component orientation cited as a cause. Computer-assistance has been shown to increase the accuracy of component orientation and robotic-assistance has been developed to translate this advantage into precise surgical execution. We sought to validate a haptically-guided robotic arm system in performing THA with the aim of comparing the accuracy of robotic-assisted acetabular cup placement to manual placement. We implanted 12 acetabular components in 6 cadaveric pelvises comparing robotic-assistance on one side with manual implantation on the other. We measured planned and actual center of rotation (COR), cup position, leg-length equalization and offset for each THA using computed tomography and the robotic platform. The root-mean-square (RMS) error for the robotic-assisted system was within 3 degrees for cup placement and within 1 mm for leg-length equalization and offset when compared to computed tomography. The robotic-assisted system was significantly more accurate than manual implantation in reproducing the COR and cup orientation, as determined by a preoperative plan. The RMS error for manual implantation compared to robotic-assistance was 5 times higher for cup inclination and 3.4 times higher for cup anteversion (p < 0.01). Robotic-assistance is more accurate than manual implantation in achieving optimal cup orientation. It has the ability to eliminate human error from THA and should be considered in light of THA failures due to component malposition."
pub.1134201297,A prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the systemic inflammatory response in conventional jig-based total knee arthroplasty versus robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty.,"AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to compare the postoperative systemic inflammatory response in conventional jig-based total knee arthroplasty (conventional TKA) versus robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (robotic TKA). Secondary aims were to compare the macroscopic soft tissue injury, femoral and tibial bone trauma, localized thermal response, and the accuracy of component positioning between the two treatment groups.
METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial included 30 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee undergoing conventional TKA versus robotic TKA. Predefined serum markers of inflammation and localized knee temperature were collected preoperatively and postoperatively at six hours, day 1, day 2, day 7, and day 28 following TKA. Blinded observers used the Macroscopic Soft Tissue Injury (MASTI) classification system to grade intraoperative periarticular soft tissue injury and bone trauma. Plain radiographs were used to assess the accuracy of achieving the planned postioning of the components in both groups.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing conventional TKA and robotic TKA had comparable changes in the postoperative systemic inflammatory and localized thermal response at six hours, day 1, day 2, and day 28 after surgery. Robotic TKA had significantly reduced levels of interleukin-6 (p < 0.001), tumour necrosis factor-α (p = 0.021), ESR (p = 0.001), CRP (p = 0.004), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.007), and creatine kinase (p = 0.004) at day 7 after surgery compared with conventional TKA. Robotic TKA was associated with significantly improved preservation of the periarticular soft tissue envelope (p < 0.001), and reduced femoral (p = 0.012) and tibial (p = 0.023) bone trauma compared with conventional TKA. Robotic TKA significantly improved the accuracy of achieving the planned limb alignment (p < 0.001), femoral component positioning (p < 0.001), and tibial component positioning (p < 0.001) compared with conventional TKA.
CONCLUSION: Robotic TKA was associated with a transient reduction in the early (day 7) postoperative inflammatory response but there was no difference in the immediate (&lt; 48 hours) or late (day 28) postoperative systemic inflammatory response compared with conventional TKA. Robotic TKA was associated with decreased iatrogenic periarticular soft tissue injury, reduced femoral and tibial bone trauma, and improved accuracy of component positioning compared with conventional TKA.

pub.1172152510,Preoperative evaluation of femoral and tibial sagittal alignment in robotic-assisted and conventional total knee arthroplasty and consequences for practice,"PurposeRobot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was developed to improve the precision and accuracy of implant placement in conventional TKA. However, the angular differences between referenced axes in robot-assisted TKA and conventional TKA remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the angular differences in sagittal alignment between robot-assisted TKA and conventional TKA for both the femur and the tibia and to discuss their clinical implications.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 100 patients (97 patients) who underwent computed tomography (CT) for Mako TKA. We measured the angle between the robot femoral axis (RFA) and conventional femoral axis (CFA) in the sagittal plane and the angle between the robot tibial axis (RTA) and the conventional tibial axis (CTA). Angles were compared between the sexes. Correlation analysis was conducted between the angles and height.ResultsIn the sagittal plane, the mean RFA-CFA angle was 2.2° ± 1.6°, and the mean RTA-CTA angle was 2.3° ± 1.6°. There were no significant differences between the two angles among males and females (p > 0.05). There was a correlation between the RFA-CFA angle and RTA-CTA angle (p < 0.001, r = 0.33), and there was a correlation between height and the combination of the RFA-CFA angle and RTA-CTA angle (p = 0.03, r = 0.22).ConclusionThere are angular differences between the axes referenced by robot-assisted TKA and those referenced by conventional TKA, which may be influenced by patient height. Correctly understanding these differences is crucial when evaluating the implant position and surgical outcomes after robot-assisted TKA. Furthermore, caution should be taken when assessing the flexion–extension angle of the knee since the angles displayed in the Mako system are different from the angles measured with intramedullary anatomical axes. After all, sagittal alignment principles differ between robot-assisted and conventional TKA; however, further studies are required to determine which principle is more appropriate or to modify these principles."
pub.1171613922,Strong Correlation Between Standing Long-Leg Radiographs and CT Scans in Measuring Coronal Knee Alignment,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation in measurements of the lower-limb coronal alignment between long-leg radiographs (LLRs) and computed tomography (CT) scanograms that were made during preoperative planning for robotic-arm-assisted knee arthroplasty. On the basis of published evidence demonstrating a good correlation between these imaging modalities in measuring the lower-limb mechanical axis, we hypothesized that there would be no significant differences between the 2 in the present study.
METHODS: This multicenter cohort study across 3 tertiary centers included 300 patients undergoing primary robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for whom LLRs and CT scanograms were available preoperatively. The study involved measuring the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), joint line obliquity (JLO), joint-line convergence angle (JLCA), and arithmetic HKA (aHKA). The aHKA represents a method for estimating constitutional alignment using angles that are unaffected by joint-space narrowing.
RESULTS: Strong correlations (p < 0.001) between the imaging modalities were found for the HKA (correlation coefficient, 0.912), aHKA (0.883), MPTA (0.820), LDFA (0.871), and JLO (0.778). A weaker correlation was observed for the JLCA in valgus knees as compared with varus knees (Spearman coefficients, 0.412 and 0.518, respectively). Regression models demonstrated that the degree of agreement was associated with the preoperative intra-articular deformity and the positioning of the lower limb during the CT scan (i.e., the lower-limb rotational angle). An initial JLCA within ±5° was associated with higher agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a strong correlation between LLRs and CT scanograms that were made during the preoperative planning stage of robotic-arm-assisted knee arthroplasty, implying that CT scanograms can reliably be utilized to estimate the coronal alignment of the knee, potentially replacing the need for LLRs. Nevertheless, to attain a higher degree of agreement, it is crucial to ensure appropriate radiographic positioning of the lower limb. Additionally, surgeons must remain vigilant regarding potential discrepancies in cases involving substantial deformities.

pub.1170107652,No Difference in Limb Alignment Between Kinematic and Mechanical Alignment Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Individualized alignment techniques have gained major interest in an effort to increase satisfaction among total knee arthroplasty patients. This study aimed to compare postoperative alignment between kinematic alignment (KA) and mechanical alignment (MA) and assess whether KA significantly deviates from the principle of aligning the limb as close to neutral alignment as possible.
METHODS: There were 234 patients who underwent robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty using an unrestricted KA and a strict MA technique (KA: 145, MA: 89). The lateral distal femoral angle, medial proximal tibia angle, and the resultant arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA) were measured. The aHKA < 0 indicated varus alignment, while the aHKA > 0 indicated valgus knee alignment. The primary outcome was the frequency of cases that resulted in an aHKA of ± 4° of neutral (0°), as assessed on full-leg standing radiographs obtained at 6 weeks postoperatively. The secondary outcome was the change in coronal plane alignment of the knee classification type from preoperative to postoperative between the MA and KA groups.
RESULTS: The mean preoperative aHKA was similar between the 2 groups (P = .19). The KA group had a mean postoperative aHKA of -1.4 ± 2.4°, while the MA group had a mean postoperative aHKA of -0.5 ± 2.1°. No significant difference in limb alignment was identified between KA and MA cases that resulted in hip-knee-ankle angle of ± 4° being neutral (91.7 versus 96.6%, P = .14). There were 97.2% of cases in the KA group that fell within the ± 5° range. The MA group was associated with a significantly higher rate of coronal plane alignment of the knee classification type change from preoperatively to postoperatively (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Kinematic alignment achieved similar postoperative aHKA compared to MA, and thus did not significantly deviate from the principle of aligning the limb as close to neutral alignment as possible. Surgeons should feel comfortable starting to introduce individualized alignment techniques. Without being restricted by boundaries, postoperative alignment will be within 5 degrees of neutral 97% of the time."
pub.1173825934,Robotics in Joint Replacement Surgery,"Today, the total knee replacement (TKR) is considered as one of the most successful orthopedics surgeries. The effective long-term pain relief, deformity correction, and restoration of function that it provides have resulted in a large number of these procedures being performed worldwide. It has been observed that 15-20% of patients are not satisfied even after successful TKR surgery. Various attempts such as careful patient selection, pre-operative education, optimization of patients before the surgery, expeditious and precise surgery, aggressive pain control, early return to home, and rehabilitation have been made to improve outcomes and satisfaction among patients. There are also attempts at designing newer implants and introducing smart technology like navigation and Robotics to improve the precision of surgery. In this letter, we look at the pros and cons of the rapid introduction of Robotics in the practice of total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1028275915,Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: Is robotic technology more accurate than conventional technique?,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) with rigid bone fixation ""can significantly improve implant placement and leg alignment. The aim of this cadaveric study was to determine whether the use of robotic systems with dynamic bone tracking would provide more accurate UKA implant positioning compared to the conventional manual technique.
METHODS: Three-dimensional CT-based preoperative plans were created to determine the desired position and orientation for the tibial and femoral components. For each pair of cadaver knees, UKA was performed using traditional instrumentation on the left side and using a haptic robotic system on the right side. Postoperative CT scans were obtained and 3D-to-3D iterative closest point registration was performed. Implant position and orientation were compared to the preoperative plan.
RESULTS: Surgical RMS errors for femoral component placement were within 1.9 mm and 3.7° in all directions of the planned implant position for the robotic group, while RMS errors for the manual group were within 5.4mm and 10.2°. Average RMS errors for tibial component placement were within 1.4mm and 5.0° in all directions for the robotic group; while, for the manual group, RMS errors were within 5.7 mm and 19.2°.
CONCLUSIONS: UKA was more precise using a semiactive robotic system with dynamic bone tracking technology compared to the manual technique."
pub.1174831129,A novel robotic surgical assistant for total knee arthroplasty has a learning curve ranging from 6 to 14 cases and exhibits high accuracy in tibial bone cuts,"BackgroundThe adoption of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) aims to enhance the precision of implant positioning and limb alignment. Despite its benefits, the adoption of such technology is often accompanied by an initial learning curve, which may result in increased operative times. This study sought to determine the learning curve for the ROSA (Robotic Surgical Assistant) Knee System (Zimmer Biomet) in performing TKA and to evaluate the accuracy of the system in executing bone cuts and angles as planned. The hypothesis of this study was that cumulative experience with this robotic system would lead to reduced operative times. Additionally, the ROSA system demonstrated reliability in terms of the accuracy and reproducibility of bone cuts.MethodsIn this retrospective observational study, we examined 110 medical records from 95 patients who underwent ROSA-assisted TKA performed by three surgeons. We employed the cumulative summation methodology to assess the learning curves related to operative time. Furthermore, we evaluated the accuracy of the ROSA Knee System in performing TKA by comparing planned versus validated values for femoral and tibial bone cuts and angles.ResultsThe learning curve for the ROSA Knee System spanned 14, 14, and 6 cases for the respective surgeons, with operative times decreasing by 22 min upon reaching proficiency (70.8 vs. 48.9 min; p < 0.001). Significant discrepancies were observed between the average planned and validated cuts and angles for femoral bone cuts (0.4 degree ± 2.4 for femoral flexion, 0.1 degree ± 0.6 for femoral coronal alignment, 0.3 mm ± 1.2 for distal medial femoral resection, 1.4 mm ± 8.8 for distal lateral femoral resection) and hip–knee–ankle axis alignment (0.3 degree ± 1.9 )(p < 0.05) but not for tibial bone cuts. Differences between planned and validated measurements during the learning and proficiency phases were nonsignificant across all parameters, except for the femoral flexion angle (0.42 degree ± 0.8 vs. 0.44 degree ± 2.7) (p = 0.49).ConclusionThe ROSA Knee System can be integrated into surgical workflows after a modest learning curve of 6 to 14 cases. The system demonstrated high accuracy and reproducibility, particularly for tibial bone cuts. Acknowledging the learning curve associated with new robot-assisted TKA technologies is vital for their effective implementation."
pub.1077503209,The impact of smart tools on total knee arthroplasty.,"Smart tools and robotic surgery are helping us take a step into the operating room of the future. As this technology develops, it can potentially help surgeons perform total knee arthroplasty (TKA) faster and with increased accuracy. In addition, this technology will reduce the number of instruments needed for the procedure, thus improving efficiency. As technology advances, smart tools may become commonplace in the operating room and may fulfill their potential to transform the way TKA is performed. Such potential is important, as there has been an exponential rise in the number of TKAs performed annually. The resulting demand on surgeons and hospital systems will necessitate improving technology so that it can be used to treat more patients while maintaining quality of care. Smart tools and robotic surgery may represent one answer to this demand."
pub.1172009178,Is Immediate Postoperative Radiograph Necessary Following Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty?,"The necessity of immediate postoperative radiographs following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has long been debated. With the increasing use of robotic-assisted TKA (RTKA), and thus more precise implant placement, the need for immediate postoperative radiographs to determine implant positioning may be unnecessary. We sought to evaluate implant position on the immediate postoperative radiographs following RTKA to determine their necessity. A retrospective review of 150 RTKAs was performed. The posterior slopes for all TKAs were recorded based on the preoperative three-dimensional template. Additionally, two independent trained researchers (J.G./L.B.) each measured the posterior slope of the postoperative day 0 (POD0) radiograph and postoperative week 2 radiograph. The difference in posterior slope measurement between template and POD0, between template and postoperative week 2, and between POD0 and postoperative week 2 was calculated. Of the 150 TKAs performed, there were no periprosthetic fractures found on the POD0 radiograph. The mean difference between the templated posterior slope and measured posterior slope on POD0 was 0.04 degrees (standard deviation [SD], 1.01; <i>p</i> = 0.615). There was a weak correlation between the two values (<i>rs</i> [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.38 [0.21, 0.53]). When comparing the template to the postoperative week 2 radiographs, there was a mean difference of 0.02 degrees (SD, 0.48; <i>p</i> = 0.556).  However, a moderate to strong correlation was noted (<i>rs</i> [95% CI], 0.71 [0.61, 0.79]). Comparison of the mean posterior slope from POD0 radiograph to that of postoperative week 2 radiograph showed a mean difference of 0.06 degrees (SD, 1.0; <i>p</i> = 0.427). A weak correlation was found between these two values (<i>rs</i> [95% CI], 0.43 [0.26, 0.56]). Given the accuracy and precision of RTKA, along with the ability to decrease cost and radiation, immediate postoperative radiograph may be unnecessary, when pertaining to the uncomplicated RTKA. However, if there is concern for intraoperative fracture, long stems placed in a revision arthroplasty, or other intraoperative complications, then postoperative radiographs are encouraged."

The savings associated with RATHA were driven by reduced utilization and cost of post-index rehabilitation services."
pub.1101146035,Robotic-Arm–Assisted vs Conventional Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty. The 2-Year Clinical Outcomes of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis has potential benefits over total knee arthroplasty but UKA has a higher revision rate. Robotic-assisted UKA is increasingly common and offers more accurate implant positioning and limb alignment, lower early postoperative pain but evidence of functional outcome is lacking. The aim was to assess the clinical outcomes of a single-centre, prospective, randomised controlled trial, comparing robotic-arm-assisted UKA with conventional surgery.
METHODS: A total of 139 participants were recruited and underwent robotic-arm-assisted (fixed bearing) or conventional (mobile bearing) UKA. Fifty-eight patients in the robotic-arm-assisted group and 54 in the manual group at 2 years. The main outcome measures were the Oxford Knee Score, American Knee Society Score and revision rate.
RESULTS: At 2 years, there were no significant differences for any of the outcome measures. Sub-group analysis (n = 35) of participants with a preoperative University of California Los Angeles Activity Scale >5 (more active) was performed. In this sub-group, the median Oxford Knee Score at 2 years was 46 (IQR 42.0-48.0) for robotic-arm-assisted and 41 (IQR 38.5-44.0) for the manual group (P = .036). The median American Knee Society Score was 193.5 (IQR 184.0-198.0) for the robotic-arm-assisted group and 174.0 (IQR 166.0-188.5) for the manual group (P = .017). Survivorship was 100% in robotic-arm-assisted group and 96.3% in the manual group.
CONCLUSION: Overall, participants achieved an outcome equivalent to the most widely implanted UKA in the United Kingdom. Sub-group analysis suggests that more active patients may benefit from robotic-arm- assisted surgery. Long term follow-up is required to evaluate differences in survivorship."
pub.1083695994,Survivorship and patient satisfaction of robotic-assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty at a minimum two-year follow-up,"BACKGROUND: Successful clinical outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) depend on lower limb alignment, soft tissue balance and component positioning, which can be difficult to control using manual instrumentation. Although robotic-assisted surgery more reliably controls these surgical factors, studies assessing outcomes of robotic-assisted UKA are lacking. Therefore, a prospective multicenter study was performed to assess outcomes of robotic-assisted UKA.
METHODS: A total of 1007 consecutive patients (1135 knees) underwent robotic-assisted medial UKA surgery from six surgeons at separate institutions between March 2009 and December 2011. All patients received a fixed-bearing metal-backed onlay implant as tibial component. Each patient was contacted at minimum two-year follow-up and asked a series of five questions to determine survivorship and patient satisfaction. Worst-case scenario analysis was performed whereby all patients were considered as revision when they declined participation in the study.
RESULTS: Data was collected for 797 patients (909 knees) with average follow-up of 29.6months (range: 22-52months). At 2.5-years of follow-up, 11 knees were reported as revised, which resulted in a survivorship of 98.8%. Thirty-five patients declined participation in the study yielding a worst-case survivorship of 96.0%. Of all patients without revision, 92% was either very satisfied or satisfied with their knee function.
CONCLUSION: In this multicenter study, robotic-assisted UKA was found to have high survivorship and satisfaction rate at short-term follow-up. Prospective comparison studies with longer follow-up are necessary in order to compare survivorship and satisfaction rates of robotic-assisted UKA to conventional UKA and total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1144316444,The journey to preventing dislocation after total hip arthroplasty : how did we get here?,"Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a well-known and potentially devastating complication. Clinicians have used many strategies in attempts to prevent dislocation since the introduction of THA. While the importance of postoperative care cannot be ignored, particular emphasis has been placed on preoperative planning in the prevention of dislocation. The strategies have progressed from more traditional approaches, including modular implants, the size of the femoral head, and augmentation of the offset, to newer concepts, including patient-specific component positioning combined with computer navigation, robotics, and the use of dual-mobility implants. As clinicians continue to pursue improved outcomes and reduced complications, these concepts will lay the foundation for future innovation in THA and ultimately improved outcomes.

Advances in TKA include the development of robotic-assisted systems. Training in raTKA entails a learning curve to achieve proficiency comparable to conventional manual TKA (maTKA). <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a prospective study of the learning curve in raTKA using the Robotic Surgical Assistant (ROSA) Knee System. The study included 180 patients (90 raTKAs; 90 maTKAs) and three surgeons (one with &gt;15 years of experience in maTKA). The cumulative sum control chart method (CUSUM) was used to define the transition from the learning phase to the mastered phase in raTKA. <b>Results:</b> The learning curves were 43 cases (experienced surgeons) and 61 cases (all surgeons). Mean operative times for both phases in raTKA were longer than in maTKA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In raTKA, operative times in the learning phase were longer compared to those in the mastered phase (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Operative times in the learning and mastered phases for all surgeons in raTKA were significantly longer compared to those in maTKA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); however, operative times of the experienced surgeon in the mastered phase of raTKA and in maTKA showed no differences. <b>Conclusions:</b> The learning curve in raTKA is dependent upon the surgeon's previous experience in maTKA."
pub.1009396079,MBARS: mini bone‐attached robotic system for joint arthroplasty,"A report on a new active, miniature bone-attached, robotic system including its design, high level and low level control, is given together with a description of the system implementation and first experimental use. The system is capable of preparing the bone cavity for an implant during joint arthroplasty procedures. Without loss of generality, the report describes the implementation of the system for a Patellofemoral Joint Replacement procedure. The system is image-free and all planning is performed intra-operatively in the robot coordinate system, eliminating the need for external tracking systems in the operating room. Experiments were conducted using the first robot prototype and the results supported the feasibility of the concept. The methodology which is presented can be modified to other orthopaedic procedures and could improve the results in terms of accuracy and operational time. Moreover, it enables minimally invasive procedures and use of the next generation of more anatomically shaped implants."
pub.1138897207,Comparison of Outcomes After Robotic-Assisted or Conventional Total Hip Arthroplasty at a Minimum 2-Year Follow-up,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed to present an updated analysis of the evidence comparing outcomes between robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (robotic THA) and conventional manual total hip arthroplasty (manual THA).
METHODS: A PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) systematic review was performed using the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase. Controlled studies comparing primary robotic THA and manual THA utilizing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at a minimum follow-up of 2 years were included. We also compared radiographic outcomes, dislocation rates, and revision surgical procedures between groups. The ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions) and Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tools were used to assess study quality and risk of bias.
RESULTS: Of 765 studies identified, 7 articles comparing robotic THA with manual THA met inclusion criteria. A total of 658 patients were assessed, 335 of whom underwent robotic THA. The majority of studies found no significant differences (p > 0.05) in PROMs between the 2 techniques. Two low-quality studies (Level III) found significantly better postoperative PROMs favoring robotic THA at 2 years. When assessing radiographic outcomes, 6 studies showed that robotic THA resulted in more consistent and accurate component placement. No differences in postoperative dislocations, complications, or revision rates were found between groups except in 1 study, which found significantly more dislocations and revisions in the robotic THA cohort. Reported operative times were a mean of 12 to 25 minutes longer when using robotic THA.
CONCLUSIONS: The existing literature comparing robotic THA and manual THA is scarce and low-quality, with findings limited by methodological flaws in study design. Although evidence exists to support increased accuracy and reproducibility of THA component placement with robotic THA, this has not been shown to reduce postoperative dislocation and revision rates. Based on the available evidence, functional outcomes are comparable between techniques, and robotic THA appears to be associated with longer operative times. To fully evaluate the utility of robotic THA, additional well-designed, prospective controlled studies with continuous long-term monitoring are required.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."
pub.1142231932,Improved accuracy and fewer outliers with a novel CT-free robotic THA system in matched-pair analysis with manual THA,"Accurate component orientation and restoration of hip biomechanics remains a continuing challenge in total hip arthroplasty (THA). The goal of this study was to analyze the accuracy/reproducibility of a novel CT-free and pin-less robotic-assisted THA (RA-THA) platform compared to manual THA (mTHA). This matched-pair cadaveric study compared this RA-THA system to mTHA (n = 33/arm), both using the assistance of fluoroscopic imaging, in a group of 14 high-volume arthroplasty surgeons. In both groups, surgeons were asked to aim for 40°/15° for cup inclination/version, and 0 mm of leg length discrepancy (LLD). A validated and accurate method using radio-opaque markers measured cup inclination/version and LLD. The accuracy and reproducibility (fewer outliers) of cup inclination was significantly improved in the robotic group (1.8° ± 1.3° vs 6.4° ± 4.9°, respectively, robotic vs manual; p < 0.001), with no significant difference between groups for version. The reproducibility of LLD was significantly improved in the robotic group (p = 0.003). For all parameters studied, the robotic group had an improved accuracy and lower variance (fewer outliers). The percentage of cases within the more restrictive Callanan safe zone was 100% for RA-THA vs 73% for mTHA (p = 0.002). The CT-free RA-THA platform, using only fluoroscopic imaging, demonstrated more accurate acetabular cup positioning, when compared to the mTHA procedures performed by high-volume hip surgeons (naive to this RA-THA platform), with respect to cup inclination and placement within the Lewinnek/Callanan safe zones. Future study must incorporate economic factors, lower volume surgeons, clinical and patient-centric outcomes, and other radiographic parameters in controlled studies in large sample sizes."
pub.1167740863,Prediction of knee biomechanics with different tibial component malrotations after total knee arthroplasty: conventional machine learning vs. deep learning,"The precise alignment of tibiofemoral components in total knee arthroplasty is a crucial factor in enhancing the longevity and functionality of the knee. However, it is a substantial challenge to quickly predict the biomechanical response to malrotation of tibiofemoral components after total knee arthroplasty using musculoskeletal multibody dynamics models. The objective of the present study was to conduct a comparative analysis between a deep learning method and four conventional machine learning methods for predicting knee biomechanics with different tibial component malrotation during a walking gait after total knee arthroplasty. First, the knee contact forces and kinematics with different tibial component malrotation in the range of ±5° in the three directions of anterior/posterior slope, internal/external rotation, and varus/valgus rotation during a walking gait after total knee arthroplasty were calculated based on the developed musculoskeletal multibody dynamics model. Subsequently, deep learning and four conventional machine learning methods were developed using the above 343 sets of biomechanical data as the dataset. Finally, the results predicted by the deep learning method were compared to the results predicted by four conventional machine learning methods. The findings indicated that the deep learning method was more accurate than four conventional machine learning methods in predicting knee contact forces and kinematics with different tibial component malrotation during a walking gait after total knee arthroplasty. The deep learning method developed in this study enabled quickly determine the biomechanical response with different tibial component malrotation during a walking gait after total knee arthroplasty. The proposed method offered surgeons and surgical robots the ability to establish a calibration safety zone, which was essential for achieving precise alignment in both preoperative surgical planning and intraoperative robotic-assisted surgical navigation."
pub.1020705223,"Simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty with robotic and conventional techniques: a prospective, randomized study","PURPOSE: The authors performed this study to compare the outcomes of robotic-assisted and conventional TKA in same patient simultaneously. It was hypothesized that the robotic-assisted procedure would produce better leg alignment and component orientation, and thus, improve patient satisfaction and clinical and radiological outcomes.
METHODS: Thirty patients underwent bilateral sequential total knee replacement. One knee was replaced by robotic-assisted implantation and the other by conventional implantation.
RESULTS: Radiographic results showed significantly more postoperative leg alignment outliers of conventional sides than robotic-assisted sides (mechanical axis, coronal inclination of the femoral prosthesis, and sagittal inclination of the tibial prosthesis). Robotic-assisted sides had non-significantly better postoperative knee scores and ROMs. Robotic-assisted sides needed longer operation times (25 min, SD ± 18) and longer skin incisions. Nevertheless, postoperative bleeding was significantly less for robotic-assisted sides.
CONCLUSION: The better alignment accuracy of robotic TKA and the good clinical results achieved may favorably influence clinical and radiological outcomes."
pub.1071722311,Predictive value of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty.,"Acetabular cup positioning, leg-length discrepancy, and global offset are important parameters associated with outcomes following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Deviation from an accepted range of values can lead to significant complications, including dislocation, leg-length discrepancy, impingement, accelerated bearing surface wear, and revisions. The purpose of this study was to assess whether robotic-assisted THA was reliable in predicting radiographic measurements of cup inclination and anteversion, leg-length change, and global offset change. All 61 robotic-assisted THAs that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were performed by a single surgeon through a mini-posterior approach. Data provided by the robot were collected prospectively, and radiographic data were collected retrospectively by 2 blinded independent reviewers. The cohort in this study consisted of 27 male and 34 female patients, with an average age of 60.5 years. A strong inter- and intraobserver correlation was found for the radiographic measurements of cup inclination, cup anteversion, leg-length discrepancy, and global offset (r>0.8 with P<.001 for all). Ninety-six point seven percent of robotic-measured inclination angles and 98.4% of robotic-measured anteversion angles were within 10° of radiographic measurements. One hundred percent of robotic-measured leg-length change and 91.8% of robotic-measured global offset change were within 10 mm of radiographic measurements. Robotic-assisted THA showed good predictive value for cup inclination and anteversion angles and measurements of leg-length change and global offset change done postoperatively on plain radiographs. Further refinement of the robotic system would make it more accurate in predicting the postoperative parameters mentioned."

A total of 1980 THAs met inclusion criteria. Robotic- and navigation-guided techniques were more consistent than other techniques in placing the acetabular cup into Lewinnek's safe zone (P<0.005 and P<0.05, respectively). Robotic-guided surgery was more consistent than other techniques in placing the acetabular component within Callanan's safe zone (P<0.005). No statistically significant differences were found between groups in the frequency of patients with excessive LLD. Clinically significant differences between groups were not found in the frequency of patients with excessive GOD. Level of Evidence: IV."
pub.1167018133,Short term outcomes following robotic arm-assisted lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Introduction: Robotic-arm assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RA-UKA) is associated with improved accuracy of implant positioning and excellent early functional outcomes. However, there is paucity of evidence regarding outcomes following RA-UKA for isolated lateral compartment osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study was to assess the short-term clinical and patient reported outcomes of lateral compartment UKA, utilising robotic-arm assistance.
Methods: This was a retrospective study of prospectively collected data of 21 consecutive patients who underwent lateral RA-UKA. The study included 9 (42.9%) males and 12 (57.1%) females with a mean age of 63.4 ± 9.2 years. The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) was measured pre-operatively and at 1-year post-operatively, while range of motion (ROM) and complications were also recorded.
Results: There was significant improvement of OKS at 1 year's follow up compared with the baseline score (21.8 ± 5.6 vs. 45.2 ± 2.8 respectively; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was also an improvement in pre-operative ROM when compared to ROM at 1 year's follow up (123.5° ± 8° vs. 131.5° ± 6.3° respectively; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). None of the study patients underwent revision surgery within 1 year's follow-up.
Conclusion: In our study, lateral RA-UKA resulted in significant improvements in clinical and patient reported outcomes with low complications rates. Further long-term comparative studies are needed to assess the utility of lateral RA-UKA vs. conventional UKA."
pub.1071720995,Robotic guidance in total hip arthroplasty: the shape of things to come.,"Surgeons want to perform a perfect total hip arthroplasty (THA) with every operation. Human performance has limitations, especially when performing a mechanical operation in a biological environment. Recent suggested changes to improve outcomes have been large femoral heads and anterior incisions, but unfortunately, neither has resulted in any scientific data that change has been effected. The scientific data tell us that poor component positions and impingement are the source of increasing mechanical complications. Therefore, attempts have been made to improve the surgeon's performance by precise quantitative knowledge in the operating room. Robotic-guided navigation provides numerical data for cup inclination plus anteversion and center of rotation; femoral leg length and offset; and combined anteversion of the cup and stem. The acetabular bone preparation is done with a reamer connected to a robotic arm, which prevents human error by the surgeon of reaming off line or too deep. This technology provides predictable and reproducible results."
pub.1023380532,The Learning Curve Associated With Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty,"There are no reports examining the learning curve during the adoption of robotic assisted THA. The purpose of this study was to examine the learning curve of robotic assisted THA as measured by component position, operative time, and complications. The first 105 robotic-assisted THAs performed by a single surgeon were divided into three groups based on the order of surgery. Component position, operative time, intra-operative technical problems, and intra-operative complications were recorded. There was a decreased risk of acetabular component malpositioning with experience (P<0.05). Operative time appeared to decrease with increasing surgical experience (P<0.05). A learning curve was observed, as a decreased incidence of acetabular component outliers and decreased operative time were noted with increased experience."
pub.1077881453,Perioperative management of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty using the MAKO robotic arm system (MAKOplasty).,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a popular treatment for unicompartmental knee arthritis. Indications for UKA include mechanical axis of less than 10 degrees varus and less than 5 degrees valgus, intact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and absence of femorotibial subluxation. Appropriately selected patients can expect UKA to last at least 10 years. UKA failures are not common and involve technical errors that are thought to be corrected with use of newly developed robotic technology. The surgeon using this technology may be able to arrive at a set target, enhance surgical precision, and avoid outliers. Whether improved precision will result in improved long-term clinical outcome remains a subject of research. In this article, we describe the perioperative management of patients who undergo UKA whether with conventional techniques or robotic arm assistance. We also describe the distinct aspects of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative pain management and of intraoperative anesthesia and blood management."
pub.1147615240,Comparison of serum inflammatory indicators and radiographic results in MAKO robotic-assisted versus conventional total knee arthroplasty for knee osteoarthritis: a retrospective study of Chinese patients,"BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to compare the serum inflammatory indicators and radiographic results of conventional manual total knee arthroplasty (CM-TKA) with those of MAKO-robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty (MA-TKA).MethodsWe retrospectively analysed 65 patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent unilateral TKA from December 2020 to November 2021 in our department, which included 34 patients who underwent MA-TKA and 31 patients who underwent CM-TKA. The tourniquet time and estimated blood loss (EBL) were compared between the two groups. Knee function was evaluated using range of motion (ROM), functional score and pain score. Leukocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), creatine kinase (CK), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were recorded at 3 time points (preoperative, and on the first and third postoperative days). The hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) and the femoral and tibial component angles in the coronal and sagittal planes were used for postoperative radiographic evaluation.ResultsThe postoperative MA-TKA group had less EBL (496.9 ± 257.8 vs. 773.0 ± 301.3 ml, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in knee function scores at 6 weeks postoperatively (p > 0.05). IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the MA-TKA group on the 1st postoperative day (11.4 (5.2, 21.0) vs. 24.6 (86.3, 170.8), p = 0.031). This difference in inflammatory indices became more pronounced at 72 hours after the operation because CRP, ESR, IL-6, and CK values were significantly lower in the MA-TKA group on the 3rd postoperative day (72 h) (p < 0.05). Postoperative radiographic examinations performed 2 days after the MA-TKA group suggested that only 2 cases of HKA had outlier values, which was remarkably better than the 12 cases found in the CM-TKA group (5.9% vs. 38.7%, p < 0.001). The frontal femoral component was significantly closer to the expected value of 90° in the MA-TKA group (90.9 (90.5, 92.3) vs. 92.4 (91.3, 93.7), p = 0.031). The remaining imaging evaluation parameters were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05).ConclusionsIn Chinese patients with OA, there was a milder systemic inflammatory response in the early postoperative period after MA-TKA compared to that of CM-TKA, as well as better radiographic outcomes. However, the tourniquet time was prolonged, and no advantages were observed in terms of functional score or pain score in the short-term follow-up."
pub.1125088550,Expanding Robotic Arm‐Assisted Knee Surgery: The First Attempt to Use the System for Knee Revision Arthroplasty,"Robotic arm-assisted arthroplasty was introduced in 2006 and has expanded its applications into unicompartmental knee, total knee, and total hip replacement. The first case of a revision surgery from conventional unicompartmental to total knee arthroplasty with the utilization of the robotic arm-assisted MAKO system is presented. An 87-year-old female presented with deteriorating left knee pain due to failure of medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty at the outpatient clinic. The patient was advised to undergo revision surgery. Through medial parapatellar arthrotomy, the joint was exposed. With the use of the MAKO system, the estimated depth of the medial plateau according to CT planning was found to be 10 mm more distal than the lateral. The resection line of the remaining plateau was placed deliberately 2 mm more distal in order to achieve satisfactory replacement of the bony gap of the medial tibial condyle by a 10 mm augment. The patient had an uneventful recovery. A plethora of additional applications in the future, such as total shoulder or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, megaprosthesis placement in oncological patients, and total hip or knee revision surgeries, may improve patient-related outcomes."
pub.1170527626,Length of Stay and Discharge Disposition After Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Large Multicenter Propensity Matched Comparison of Robotic-Assisted and Manual Techniques,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-arm assistance continues to gain popularity in total hip arthroplasty (THA) for its potential to improve component placement accuracy and patient outcomes. Nonetheless, there is limited data on the impact of robotic-assisted THA (RA-THA) on hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge location. This study thus aimed to compare LOS, discharge location, and readmission rate for propensity-matched cohorts of RA-THA versus manual THA (M-THA).
METHODS: A retrospective review of a multi-hospital database was performed to identify patients who underwent THA between January 2016 and December 2021 from surgeons who performed both RA-THA and M-THA at 77 geographically diverse hospitals. The RA-THA and M-THA cohorts were 1-to-1 matched based on patient sex, age, and body mass index, resulting in 8,536 patients per cohort. Insurance type, LOS, same-day discharge, discharge disposition, and 90-day all-cause readmission rate were compared using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests.
RESULTS: Average LOS was significantly shorter for RA-THA patients (1.39 ± 0.85 days) than for M-THA patients (1.48 ± 0.91 days, P < .001). Compared to 5.6% of M-THA patients, 5.3% of RA-THA patients underwent same-day discharge (P = .38). There were statistically significant differences in discharge disposition between cohorts, with more RA-THA cases discharged home without home healthcare compared to M-THA (47.9 versus 45.5%, P = .001) and fewer RA-THA cases discharged to a skilled nursing facility compared to M-THA (5.6 versus 6.9%, P = .001). The 90-day all-cause readmission rate for RA-THA cases was 3.0%, compared to 3.4% for M-THA cases (P = .26).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to M-THA, RA-THA had a shorter average LOS, a similar percentage of patients with same-day discharge, fewer patients who had skilled nursing facility discharge, and a similar all-cause 90-day readmission rate. These results may be of interest to surgeons participating in bundled payment programs and engaging in cost savings."
pub.1140745477,Comparing early and mid-term outcomes between robotic-arm assisted and manual total hip arthroplasty: a systematic review,"The projected increase in utilization rates of total hip arthroplasty (THA) has created an emphasis on novel technologies that can aid providers in maintaining historically positive outcomes. Widespread utilization of robotic assisted THA (RA-THA) is contingent upon achieving favorable outcomes compared to its traditional manual counterpart (mTHA). Therefore, the purpose of our systematic review was to compare RA-THA and mTHA in terms of the following: (1) functional outcomes and (2) complication rates. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched for articles published October 1994 and May 2021 comparing functional outcomes and complication rates between RA-THA and mTHA cohorts. When three or more studies evaluated certain PROMs and complications, a pooled analysis utilizing Mantel–Haenszel (M–H) models was conducted utilizing data from final follow-up. Our final analysis included 18 studies which reported on a total of 2811 patients [RA-THA: n = 1194 (42.48%); mTHA: n = 1617 (57.52%)]. No significant differences were demonstrated for a majority of pooled analyses and when segregating by robotic system. Only WOMAC scores were significantly lower among RA-THA patients (p = 0.0006). For outcomes without sufficient data for a pooled analysis, there were no significant differences reported among included studies. The growing utilization of RA-THA motivates comparisons to its manual counterpart. Collectively, we found comparable functional outcomes and complication profiles between RA-THA and mTHA cohorts. More randomized controlled trials of higher quality and larger sample sizes are necessary to further strengthen these findings."
pub.1164572472,"Cost‐effectiveness of a novel, fluoroscopy‐based robotic‐assisted total hip arthroplasty system: A Markov analysis","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a novel, fluoroscopy-based robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) system compared to a manual unassisted technique (mTHA) up to 5 years post-operatively.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of RA-THA and mTHA. Cost-effectiveness was defined as an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) <$50 000 or $100 000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY).
RESULTS: RA-THA patients experienced lower costs compared to mTHA patients at 1 year ($20 865.12 ± 9897.52 vs. $21 660.86 ± 9909.15; p < 0.001) and 5 years ($23 124.57 ± 10 045.48 vs. $25 756.42 ± 10 091.84; p < 0.001) post-operatively. RA-THA patients also accrued more QALYs (1-year: 0.901 ± 0.117 vs. 0.888 ± 0.114; p < 0.001; 5-years: 4.455 ± 0.563 vs. 4.384 ± 0.537 p < 0.001). Overall, RA-THA was cost-effective (1-year ICER: $-61 210.77; 5-year ICER: $-37 068.31).
CONCLUSIONS: The novel, fluoroscopy-based RA-THA system demonstrated cost-effectiveness when compared to manual unassisted THA."
pub.1140276906,ICD-10 Coding Mismatch in Computer and Robotic Assisted Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The International Statistical Classification of Disease, 10<sup>th</sup> Revision Procedural Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) is a granular procedural classification system with the ability to precisely classify types of technology utilized in total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, coding nuances and the rapidly evolving nature of technology may lead to coding inaccuracies. The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of ICD-10-PCS coding in computer-navigated and robotic THA and discuss its implications on clinical data.
METHODS: The arthroplasty database at a single institution was retrospectively reviewed for all primary computer and robotic assisted THAs performed between October 2015 to November 2020. The type of technology utilized was determined from the surgical record and compared with the ICD-10-PCS codes applied to each procedure.
RESULTS: A total of 3721 technology-assisted THAs were identified and reviewed. 87.5% of technology-assisted THAs were coded with the correct type of technology. The most common error in computer navigated THA was the omission of the technology code, while the most common error in robotic assisted THA was the designation of codes for both computer navigation and robotic assistance.
CONCLUSION: The granular nature of ICD-10-PCS allows for precise distinction between types of technology-assisted THA. However, rates of coding inaccuracy bring concern for the integrity of this data. The inaccuracy of ICD-10-PCS data is not insignificant and should bring concern for the validity of collective data sets that use it exclusively for its procedural granularity."
pub.1092191598,Utilization of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty for soft tissue protection,"Despite the well-established success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), iatrogenic ligamentous and soft tissue injuries are infrequent, but potential complications that can have devastating impact on clinical outcomes. These injuries are often related to technical errors and excessive soft tissue manipulation, particularly during bony resections. Recently, robotic-arm assisted TKA was introduced and demonstrated promising results with potential technical advantages over manual surgery in implant positioning and mechanical accuracy. Furthermore, soft tissue protection is an additional potential advantage offered by these systems that can reduce inadvertent human technical errors encountered during standard manual resections. Therefore, due to the relative paucity of literature, we attempted to answer the following questions: 1) does robotic-arm assisted TKA offer a technical advantage that allows enhanced soft tissue protection? 2) What is the available evidence about soft tissue protection? Recently introduced models of robotic-arm assisted TKA systems with advanced technology showed promising clinical outcomes and soft tissue protection in the short- and mid-term follow-up with results comparable or superior to manual TKA. In this review, we attempted to explore this dimension of robotics in TKA and investigate the soft tissue related complications currently reported in the literature."
pub.1085749164,Optimization of sagittal and coronal planes with robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: One of the anatomic goals of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is optimizing in the coronal and sagittal plane. Accurate alignments of both planes have been correlated to functional outcome and range of motion. There is a paucity of evidence on the accuracy of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in balancing biplanar knee alignment - specifically sagittal plane alignment. Because robotic assisted UKA has an advantage of more accurately manipulating sagittal plane for optimal alignment and kinematics based on pre-operative and intraoperative CT planning we assessed the accuracy.
METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and radiographic information of 94 robotic assisted UKA surgeries for balancing of sagittal and coronal knee anatomy using radiographic parameters, such as posterior condylar offset ratio (PCOR), posterior tibial slope (PTS), femoral-tibial angle, and joint line.
RESULTS: In the sagittal plane, we found no significant difference between pre and postoperative PCOR values. As planned, PTS was significantly lower after UKA compared to the native knee (4.91° vs 2.28°; p<0.0001). In the coronal plane, there was no significant difference in the joint line however pre and post-operative mechanical axis were significantly different (5.43°±2.58 of varus vs. 2.76°±2.14 of varus; p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This study attempts to quantify sagittal and coronal plane alignment after robotic assisted UKA. More attention should be paid to the role of sagittal plane alignment after UKA. We believe modifying posterior tibial slope, while maintaining PCOR is fundamental in achieving native kinematics and optimizing range of motion in the sagittal plane. This may be best-accomplished using robotic techniques for UKA."
pub.1003713774,High Degree of Accuracy of a Novel Image-free Handheld Robot for Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty in a Cadaveric Study,"BackgroundSurgical robotics has been shown to improve the accuracy of bone preparation and soft tissue balance in unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA). However, although extensive data have emerged with regard to a CT scan-based haptically constrained robotic arm, little is known about the accuracy of a newer alternative, an imageless robotic system.Questions/purposesWe assessed the accuracy of a novel imageless semiautonomous freehand robotic sculpting system in performing bone resection and preparation in UKA using cadaveric specimens.MethodsIn this controlled study, we compared the planned and final implant placement in 25 cadaveric specimens undergoing UKA using the new tool. A quantitative analysis was performed to determine the translational, angular, and rotational differences between the planned and achieved positions of the implants.ResultsThe femoral implant rotational mean error was 1.04° to 1.88° and mean translational error was 0.72 to 1.29 mm across the three planes. The tibial implant rotational mean error was 1.48° to 1.98° and the mean translational error was 0.79 to 1.27 mm across the three planes.ConclusionsThe image-free robotic sculpting tool achieved accurate implementation of the surgical plan with small errors in implant placement. The next step will be to determine whether accurate implant placement translates into a clinical and functional benefit for the patient."
pub.1139783610,Health economic value of CT scan based robotic assisted UKA: a systematic review of comparative studies,"PurposeThe aim of this systematic review was to compare relevant health economic consequences of the CT-based robotic-arm-assisted system versus conventional Uni-compartmental Knee Arthroplasty (UKA).MethodsIn November 2020, A PRISMA systematic review was conducted using four databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane and Google Scholar) to identify all comparative studies reporting health economic assessments, such as robotic system costs, consumable costs, surgical revision rate, operating time, length of stay, and inpatient care costs.ResultsA total of nine comparative studies published between 2014 and 2020 were included in this systematic review. There was a moderate risk of bias as assessed using the ROBINS-I Tool. The CT-based robotic-arm-assisted system seemed to be associated with a lower risk of revision, decreased analgesia requirements during hospitalization, a shorter length of stay, and lower inpatient care costs compared to a conventional technique.ConclusionCT-based robotic-arm-assisted system for UKA appears to be an economically viable solution with a positive health economic impact as it tends to decrease revision rate compared to conventional UKA, improve post-operative rehabilitation and analgesia management. Post-operative inpatient care costs seem lower with the robotic-assisted system but depend on institutional case volume and differ among health systems. More studies are needed to confirm cost-effectiveness of CT-based robotic-arm-assisted system based on different health systems.Level of evidenceSystematic review, Level IV"
pub.1085423980,Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty with a Cruciate-Retaining Implant: A 10-Year Follow-up Study,"BACKGROUND: This study compared clinical and radiological results between robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and conventional TKA with a cruciate-retaining implant at 10-year follow-up. The hypothesis was that robotic TKA would allow for more accurate leg alignment and component placement, and thus enhance clinical and radiological results and long-term survival rates.
METHODS: A total of 113 primary TKAs performed using a cruciate-retaining implant in 102 patients from 2004 to 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 113 TKAs, 71 were robotic TKAs and 42 were conventional TKAs. Clinical outcomes (visual analogue scale pain score, Hospital for Special Surgery score, Western Ontario and McMaster University score, range of motion, and complications), radiological outcomes, and long-term survival rates were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 10 years.
RESULTS: Clinical outcomes and long-term survival rates were similar between the two groups. Regarding the radiological outcomes, the robotic TKA group had significantly fewer postoperative leg alignment outliers (femoral coronal inclination, tibial coronal inclination, femoral sagittal inclination, tibial sagittal inclination, and mechanical axis) and fewer radiolucent lines than the conventional TKA group.
CONCLUSIONS: Both robotic and conventional TKAs resulted in good clinical outcomes and postoperative leg alignments. Robotic TKA appeared to reduce the incidence of leg alignment outliers and radiolucent lines compared to conventional TKA."
pub.1175894730,A comprehensive predictive model for postoperative joint function in robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty patients: combining radiomics and clinical indicators,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) effectively treats various end-stage hip conditions, offering pain relief and improved joint function. However, surgical outcomes are influenced by multifaceted factors. This research aims to create a predictive model, incorporating radiomic and clinical information, to forecast post-surgery joint function in robot-assisted THA (RA-THA) patients. The study set comprised 136 patients who underwent unilateral RA-THA, which were subsequently partitioned into a training set (n = 95) and a test set (n = 41) for analysis. Preoperative CT imaging was employed to derive 851 radiomic characteristics, selecting those with an intra-class correlation coefficient > 0.75 for analysis. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression reduced redundancy to six significant radiomic features. Clinical data including preoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Harris Hip Score (HHS), and Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score were collected. Logistic regression identified significant predictors, and three models were developed. Receiver operating characteristic and decision curves evaluated the models. Preoperative VAS, HHS, WOMAC score, and radiomics feature scores were significant predictors. In the training set, the AUCs were 0.835 (clinical model), 0.757 (radiomic model), and 0.891 (combined model). In the test set, the AUCs were 0.777 (clinical model), 0.824 (radiomic model), and 0.881 (combined model). The constructed nomogram prediction model combines radiological features with relevant clinical data to accurately predict functional outcomes 3 years after RA-THA. This model has significant prediction accuracy and broad clinical application prospects and can provide a valuable reference for formulating personalized treatment plans and optimizing patient management strategies."

The questionnaire was administered to all the physicians of the Chinese Association of Orthopedic Surgeons (CAOS).ResultA total of 372 qualified questionnaires were generated, among which 28% (n = 104) of the respondents had performed RA-TJA, among those who had performed RA-TJA. When asked how helpful the joint replacement robot was actually/expected to be, there was no significant difference between the expected and actual experience of nonusers and users (p ≥ 0.05); the biggest disadvantage of the current development of RA-TJA was perceived as additional charges to the patient by those who had used it, while those who had not used it perceived it as a limitation of their hospital, both of which were significant differences. Most respondents in both groups (used: 94.2%; not used: 91.4%) were confident in the clinical development of the joint replacement robot.ConclusionThis survey provides cross-sectional data on the current status of Chinese joint surgeons using or not using robots in their daily clinical practice. Improving surgical precision was the consensus of most respondents, while high surgical costs and limitations of hospital conditions were barriers to its development in China."
pub.1149585842,Return to Work and Driving After Robotic Arm–Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has demonstrated improved patient-reported outcome measures. Less evidence has been reported on how frequently patients return to complex activities of daily living. Our purposes were to investigate (1) hospital lengths of stay (LOSs) (2) discharge dispositions and (3) the rates and postoperative time intervals at which patients returned to driving and working.
Methods: A total of 50 RATKA patients who were employed prior to surgery were included. Outcomes included hospital LOS, discharge dispositions, return to driving, and return to work.
Results: A total of 48 patients (96%) were discharged home with self-care or health aid discharge after a mean LOS of 1.2 ± 0.6 days. Twelve patients (24%) returned to driving within 3 weeks of surgery. In our study, 100% of patients who underwent RATKA returned to driving after a mean of 29 days (range, 4 to 62 days). Forty-five patients (90%) returned to their preoperative level of work after a mean of 46 days (range, 2 to 96 days). Nineteen patients (38%) returned to work within 3 weeks.
Conclusions: This study showed fast recovery after RATKA, with >90% returning to driving and working at full capacity within 2 months. Many (38%) returned to work within 3 weeks. Further studies to demonstrate the value of RATKA with respect to recovery of complex activities are needed. Compared to controls from previously published literature on manual total knee arthroplasties, it appears that patients who undergo RATKA have similar or better outcomes in reference to return to driving."
pub.1134144772,Robotic-Arm Assisted Direct Anterior Total Hip Arthroplasty; Improving Implant Accuracy.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of implant position of robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) via the direct anterior approach (DAA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent robotic-arm assisted DAA THA (MAKO Surgical Corp., Ft. Lauderdale, Florida) from November 2018 to January 2020 were prospectively followed up. Pelvis indices (limb length discrepancy, femoral and hip offset, implant inclination, and anteversion), surgical duration, length of stay, and complications were recorded. To further evaluate the accuracy of robotic-arm assisted THA, patients who underwent manual DAA THA by the same surgeon were match-paired with the study group.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients underwent robotic-arm assisted DAA THR. Limb length discrepancy was restored to 0.1mm (±3.4mm) from 10.0mm (±6.4mm) postoperatively. Preoperatively, the difference in femoral offset was 5.1mm (±5.1mm), and this was corrected to 1.9mm (±6.5mm) postoperatively. Nine cases had target inclination of 40° and mean inclination achieved was 40.7° (±0.9°). Sixteen cases had target inclination of 45° and mean inclination achieved was 45.3° (±1.0°). Mean anteversion was 19.5° (±2.4°). Propensity matched analysis showed that the root mean square errors for manual cup implantation compared to the robotic-arm assisted group was 2.3 times higher for anteversion and 6.3 times higher for inclination. Fourteen (56%) of the cups were within Callanan safe-zone and 18 (72%) within Lewinnek safe-zone in the manual group compared to 18 (72%) and 25 (100%), respectively, in the robotic-arm assisted group.
CONCLUSION: Combining the muscle-sparing technique of DAA with the improved implant placement with the robotic-arm assisted platform is a promising solution to improving THA outcomes."
pub.1139150509,Clinical outcomes associated with robotic and computer-navigated total knee arthroplasty: a machine learning-augmented systematic review,"BackgroundRobotic (RTKA) and computer-navigated total knee arthroplasty (CNTKA) are increasingly replacing manual techniques in orthopaedic surgery. This systematic review compared clinical outcomes associated with RTKA and CNTKA and investigated the utility of natural language processing (NLP) for the literature synthesis.MethodsA comprehensive search strategy was implemented. Results of included studies were combined and analysed. A transfer learning approach was applied to train deep NLP classifiers (BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet), with cross-validation, to partially automate the systematic review process.Results52 studies were included, comprising 5,067 RTKA and 2,108 CNTKA. Complication rates were 0–22% and 0–16% and surgical time was 70–116 and 77–102 min for RTKA and CNTKA, respectively. Technical failures were more commonly associated with RTKA (8%) than CNTKA (2–4%). Patient satisfaction was equivalent (94%). RTKA was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving target alignment, less femoral notching, shorter operative time and shorter length of stay. NLP models demonstrated moderate performance (AUC = 0.65–0.68).ConclusionsRTKA and CNTKA appear to be associated with similarly positive clinical outcomes. Further work is required to determine whether the two techniques differ significantly with regard to specific outcome measures. NLP shows promise for facilitating the systematic review process."
pub.1071722697,Accuracy of Component Placement in Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a recent platform introduced to decrease the risk of malpositioned components. The goals of this study were to determine whether intraoperative data on robotic-assisted THA acetabular component position accurately predict postoperative radiographic acetabular component position and to determine whether intraoperative data on robotic-assisted THA leg length and offset accurately predict postoperative radiographic leg length and offset data. In 146 patients, pre- and postoperative radiographs and intraoperative component measurements were reported for acetabular inclination, anteversion, leg length change, and offset change. Component position obtained by the robotic system and radiographic data were compared with subgroup analysis for the posterior and direct anterior approaches. The average difference between groups was 3.3°±3.1° for inclination, 2.9°±2.3° for anteversion, 3.0±2.3 mm for leg length change, and 4.0±3.1 mm for change in global offset. Correlation between the robotic system and postoperative radiographs was within 10° for 95.9% of cases for inclination and 99.3% for anteversion. Posterior approach correlation was within 10° for 97.1% of cases for inclination and 100% for anteversion. Anterior approach correlation was within 10° for 92.7% of cases for inclination and 97.6% for anteversion. Intraoperative data on component position obtained from the robotic system compared well with radiographic data on component position. Surgeons must remain vigilant to ensure outliers related to robotic system malfunction do not occur. [Orthopedics. 2016; 39(3):193-199.]. "
pub.1156265482,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty is more advantageous for knees with severe deformity: a randomized controlled trial study design,"OBJECTIVE: A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted to explore the short-term effect of a new robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) system, and the clinical and radiographic effectiveness between the robotic-assisted system and conventional TKA were compared and analyzed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overall, 144 patients were randomly divided into two groups, wherein 72 patients underwent TKA using the robotic‑assisted system and 72 underwent conventional TKA. The demographic data and radiographic parameters of the patients were collected. The factors influencing postoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle deviation were determined by multiple linear regression. Clinical outcomes including postoperative Knee Society score, 10-cm visual analog scale, and range of motion (ROM) and radiographic results including the deviation value of coronal tibial component angle, coronal femoral component angle (CFCA), sagittal tibial component angle, sagittal femoral component angle (SFCA), and HKA angle as well as the rate of outliers in each angle were observed and compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The preoperative demographic data and imaging parameters, including Knee Society score, ROM, sex, surgical side, age, BMI, preoperative HKA angle, preoperative HKA angle deviation, and visual analog scale, showed no significant differences between groups. The robotic‑assisted system group (RAS group) showed a postoperative malalignment of 3.2% for a mechanical axis higher than 3° and the conventional techniques group (CON group) showed a postoperative malalignment of 41.0% for a mechanical axis higher than 3°; the difference was statistically significant ( P <0.001). According to the results of multiple linear regression analysis, when the preoperative HKA angle deviation increased by 1°, the postoperative HKA angle deviation increased by 0.134° ( β =0.134 min; 95% CI: 0.045-0.222). Therefore, patients were divided into a slight lower extremity alignment deviation group (preoperative HKA angle deviation <6°) and severe lower extremity alignment deviation group (preoperative HKA angle deviation ≥6°). For the patients with preoperatively slight lower extremity alignment deviation, the rate of postoperative HKA angle outlier in the RAS group was better than that in the CON group, and the operation duration in the RAS group was significantly longer than that in the CON group ( P <0.05). In the patients with a preoperative HKA angle deviation ≥6°, the rate of postoperative HKA angle and CFCA outliers in the RAS group was better than that in the CON group; the operation duration in the RAS group was significantly longer than that in the CON group, and the HKA angle deviation and CFCA deviation in the RAS group were significantly lower than those in the CON group ( P <0.05). No significant difference was observed in other indexes between the two groups ( P >0.05).
CONCLUSION: This new robotic-assisted TKA system is safe and effective. "
pub.1112861134,Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty in the Presence of Extra-Articular Deformity.,"INTRODUCTION: Tibial or femoral extra-articular deformities complicate the goal achieving optimal mechanical axis alignment for successful total knee arthroplasty (TKA) outcomes. In the presence of these extra-articular deformities, standard operative techniques and instruments may not be reliable. Robotic-arm assisted technology was developed to help achieve a well-aligned and balanced knee in a variety of clinical scenarios. Although prior case series have reported on the use of robotic-arm assisted devices for cases with severe angular deformity, there is a lack of data concerning the use of the robotic device for patients with other potentially complex surgical factors. Therefore, the purpose of this series was to present cases in which the robotic-arm assisted TKA application was used in the setting of extra-articular deformities to educate the surgeon community on this potentially useful method to address these complex cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three cases of patients who underwent robotic-arm assisted TKA in the setting of preoperative extra-articular deformities were identified. These included one with femoral and tibial fracture malunion, another with a proximal tibial fracture nonunion, and another with a healed tibial plateau fracture. Patient clinical histories, intraoperative surgical techniques, and postoperative outcomes were obtained. Specific focus was placed on the surgical management of the patient's pre-existing deformity.
RESULTS: These three case reports are discussed in detail, with emphasis on preoperative planning and intraoperative techniques. The robotic software was able to appropriately consider the extra-articular deformity in the preoperative and real-time updated intraoperative plans. Doing so, the surgeon was able to achieve balanced and aligned TKA in each case. All three patients underwent robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty with no intraoperative or postoperative complications. For all patients, their anteroposterior and lateral radiographs demonstrated well fixed and aligned femoral and tibial components with no signs of loosening or osteolysis. On physical exam, all patients had excellent range-of-motion with mean flexion of 122° (range: 120 to 125° of flexion) at final follow up.
DISCUSSION: The decision on how to best approach TKA in patients with extra-articular deformity should be based on an extensive patient history, physical examination, and thorough evaluation of the magnitude and proximity of the deformity to the knee joint. Utilizing preoperative CT-scans with a 3D plan for robotic-arm assisted surgery allowed for appropriate assessment of the deformity preoperatively and execution of a plan for a balanced and aligned total knee arthroplasty. We have demonstrated excellent results utilizing robotic-arm assisted TKA in these complex cases."
pub.1040431710,Robot-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Increasing evidence suggests performing total knee arthroplasty using computer navigation can lead to more accurate surgical positioning of the components and knee alignment compared to a conventional operating technique without computer assistance. The use of robotic technology could theoretically take this accuracy one level further because it uses navigation in combination with ultimate mechanical precision, which could eliminate or reduce the inevitable margin of error during mechanical preparation of the bony cuts of total knee arthroplasty by the surgeon. We prospectively followed 25 consecutive cases using an active surgical robot. The minimum followup was 5.1 years (mean, 5.5 years; range, 5.1-5.8 years). Our results demonstrate excellent implant positioning and alignment was achieved within the 1 degree error of neutral alignment in all three planes in all cases. Despite this technical precision, the excessive operating time required for the robotic implantation, the technical complexity of the system, and the extremely high operational costs have led us to abandon this procedure and direct our interest more toward smart semiactive robotic systems.

pub.1103990684,Robot‐assisted total hip arthroplasty: Clinical outcomes and complication rate,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to report minimum 2-year outcomes and complications for robotic-arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA).
METHODS: Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed between June 2011 and April 2014. Inclusion criteria were primary robotic-arm-assisted THAs treating idiopathic osteoarthritis with ≥ 2-year follow-up. Demographics, operating time, complications, 2-year outcome scores and satisfaction, and subsequent surgeries were recorded.
RESULTS: There were 181 cases eligible for inclusion, of which 162 (89.5%) had minimum 2-year follow-up. At the latest follow-up, the mean visual analogue scale was 0.7, satisfaction was 9.3, Harris hip score was 91.1 and forgotten joint score was 83.1. Six (3.7%) intraoperative complications and six (3.7%) postoperative complications were reported. No leg length discrepancies (LLDs) or dislocations were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-arm-assisted THA demonstrates favourable short-term outcomes and does not result in a higher complication rate compared to non-robotic THA as reported by the literature."
pub.1131446955,Robotic-Assisted Acetabular Cup Placement in Severe Intrapelvic Acetabular Protrusio: A Case Report.,"CASE: We present a patient with a 30-year history of severe intrapelvic acetabular protrusio. As far as we know, this is the first case report on the use of robotic technology in total hip arthroplasty for severe acetabular protrusion. We also discuss the challenges and lessons learned from this technically demanding case.
CONCLUSION: Robotic assistance has its advantages in the accurate templating of the optimal cup dimensions, orientation, and location. However, the surgeon may still need to manually restore the offset because the center of rotation is not re-established and must be mindful of the severity and chronicity of the soft-tissue contractures."
pub.1093062931,Technology-Assisted Hip and Knee Arthroplasties: An Analysis of Utilization Trends,"BACKGROUND: Robotic and computer navigation technology is available to surgeons for use in hip and knee arthroplasties to increase the precision of component placement. However, they do add significant costs to these procedures, and the long-term clinical outcomes and value of technology assistance for joint replacement remain unclear.
METHODS: We identified 321,522 patients in Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups 469 and 470 who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty (N = 133,472) or primary total or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (N = 188,050) between 2008 and 2015 in the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS).
RESULTS: Among all total joint arthroplasties performed during this period, technology assistance was used in 5.1% of cases. Technology assistance was more common for knee (7.3%) than hip (1.9%) arthroplasty (P < .001). The proportion of cases using technology assistance grew each year, increasing from 2.8% (knee 4.3% and hip 0.5%) in 2008 to 8.6% (knee 11.6% and hip 5.2%) in 2015 (P trend <.001). The proportion of hospitals and surgeons using robotic assistance also increased during the study period, increasing from 16.2% of hospitals and 6.2% of surgeons in 2008 to 29.2% of hospitals and 17.1% of surgeons in 2015 (P trend <.001 for both). Technology was more likely to be used for patients with private insurance (5.9%) compared with Medicare (4.7%, P < .001) or Medicaid (2.2%, P < .001), and for patients at high-volume (6.9%, P < .001) or very high-volume (6.1%, P < .001) as compared with low-volume (2.7%) hospitals.
CONCLUSION: Technology assistance has become increasingly used by orthopedic surgeons for hip and knee arthroplasties, however, adoption has not been uniform."
pub.1132825280,Not All Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Are the Same.,"Because value in healthcare has shifted to a measurement of quality relative to the cost, a greater emphasis exists on improving clinical and functional outcomes and patient satisfaction. Despite advances in implant design, surgical technique, and postoperative rehabilitation, multiple studies demonstrate that nearly 20% of patients remain dissatisfied with their overall outcomes after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Because implant positioning, alignment, and equal soft-tissue balance are critical for a successful TKA, malalignment in the coronal, sagittal, and rotational planes continue to increase failure rates and cause poor clinical outcomes. Robotic-assisted TKA has gained momentum within the past 10 years to better control surgical variables by mitigating technical errors caused by insecure cutting guides and imprecise bone cuts. Contemporary robotic platforms have evolved along with our ability to collect high-quality patient-reported outcome measures data, and this combination is proving the clinical effectiveness. This comprehensive review investigates the advent of robotic-assisted TKA including advantages, disadvantages, historical, and commercially available newer generation systems, clinical outcomes, and cost analysis to better understand the potential added value of this technology."
pub.1106948085,Individualized alignment in total knee arthroplasty using image-based robotic assistance,"IntroductionOver the past decades many innovations were introduced in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) focusing on implant longevity and higher procedural precision; however, there are still a high number of dissatisfied patients. It was reported that better anatomical alignment may result in improved patient outcome; however, current technologies have limitations to achieve this. The aim of this video article is to describe the technique of individualized alignment in TKA with the use of image-based robotic assistance.MethodsThe technology is based on an individual patient knee model computed from segmented computed tomography (CT) scans. A preoperative planning of prosthesis position is conducted following the principle of kinematic alignment. Intraoperatively the soft tissue envelope is recorded and the computer predicts the gap balance based on the virtual planning. The prosthesis position is then adapted to achieve balanced gaps and to avoid soft tissue release. This technique is shown in a cadaver operation and clinical examples of two patients are described.ResultsWith the combination of anatomically oriented prosthesis positioning and minor adaptations with respect to the soft tissue, an individualized alignment is achieved with reduced need of soft tissue release. The robotic-assisted surgery guarantees a precise implementation of the planning. The initial experience showed a promising outcome in short-term follow-up."
pub.1138506858,Robotic arm-assisted versus manual total hip arthroplasty : a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIMS: The aims of this systematic review were to assess the learning curve of semi-active robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty (rTHA), and to compare the accuracy, patient-reported functional outcomes, complications, and survivorship between rTHA and manual total hip arthroplasty (mTHA).
METHODS: Searches of PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar were performed in April 2020 in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. Search terms included ""robotic"", ""hip"", and ""arthroplasty"". The criteria for inclusion were published clinical research articles reporting the learning curve for rTHA (robotic arm-assisted only) and those comparing the implantation accuracy, functional outcomes, survivorship, or complications with mTHA.
RESULTS: There were 501 articles initially identified from databases and references. Following full text screening, 17 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included. Four studies reported the learning curve of rTHA, 13 studies reported on implant positioning, five on functional outcomes, ten on complications, and four on survivorship. The meta-analysis showed a significantly greater number of cases of acetabular component placement in the safe zone compared with the mTHA group (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.10 to 7.94; p < 0.001) and that rTHA resulted in a significantly better Harris Hip Score compared to mTHA in the short- to mid-term follow-up (95% CI 0.46 to 5.64; p = 0.020). However, there was no difference in infection rates, dislocation rates, overall complication rates, and survival rates at short-term follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The learning curve of rTHA was between 12 and 35 cases, which was dependent on the assessment goal, such as operating time, accuracy, and team working. Robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty was associated with improved accuracy of component positioning and functional outcome, however no difference in complication rates or survival were observed at short- to mid-term follow-up. Overall, there remains an absence of high-quality level I evidence and cost analysis comparing rTHA and mTHA. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2021;103-B(6):1009-1020."
pub.1170447157,Evaluation of an Initial Robotic-Assisted Direct Anterior Approach Cohort Receiving a New Short Metaphyseal Filling Collared Femoral Implant.,"BACKGROUND: Shorter, metaphyseal-filling collared stems have become popular with the direct anterior approach (DAA), based on their ease of broaching and insertion through less invasive surgical exposures. To aid with the DAA, robotic-assisted technology provides three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance to accurately assess stem version. With other femoral stems, this has been shown to provide more accurate implant planning and improved patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to understand femoral stem placement predictability and patient outcomes for a newly designed metaphyseal-filling collared stem system through a DAA in combination with a robotic-assisted system during a single surgeon's initial cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single high-volume surgeon, experienced with robotic-assisted DAA total hip arthroplasty (THA), adopted the use of a metaphyseal-filling collared stem. Intraoperative data and patient outcomes up to six months postoperative were collected prospectively during the surgeon's first 123 cases. Student's t-tests (α=0.05) were used for statistical comparisons. Intraoperative and radiographic assessments were performed for all 123 cases.
RESULTS: The estimated version with neck-cut view of the robotic-assisted system was 13.81 ± 3.81°. The final version measurement captured with the robotic-assisted system was 16.56 ± 6.61°. The difference between the estimated version and robotic-assisted measured version was, on average, 2.68 ± 5.7° (p<0.001). The femoral stem sat at the level of the calcar in all but five cases. There were no intraoperative or postoperative periprosthetic fractures. Patients reported significant improvements in reduced Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (HOOS-JR), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS 10), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores throughout their six-month recovery process with no patients reporting a periprosthetic joint infection, fracture, or dislocation.
CONCLUSION: The use of a metaphyseal-filling collared stem with robotic-assisted DAA resulted in adequate stem version when assessed visually and with CT scan assessments. Version estimation values were improved upon over visual assessments when using the robotic system that maps out the proximal femur and the improvement was also demonstrated when compared to the prior literature. This may also be related to the stem's collar providing a visual guide during stem placement posterior fill of this triple-tapered stem design. Although further follow up is needed to assess longer-term outcomes, at six months postoperatively, patients had significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes with all patients reporting minimal to no restrictions with their THA."
pub.1017498989,Robotic-assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty The MAKO Experience,"Since its introduction, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty has been controversial because of poor early clinical outcomes due to implant design, bony fixation, surgical instrumentation, and technique. Improvements in surgical technique and implant design have resulted in improved results and greater survivorship. The ability to obtain accurate implant placement includes avoiding surgeon decisions leading to potential errors. These errors include alignment in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes on each prepared condyle as well as the preservation of the joint line and the resulting overall limb alignment as something critical to obtaining a successful outcome.

pub.1169172882,The Alignment of the Tibial Component in Total Knee Arthroplasty: Is a Technology-Assisted System Better Than Conventional Instrumentation?,"Background Technologies such as navigation and robotics are aimed at improving tibial alignment in total knee arthroplasties (TKA) and eliminating the errors resulting from the use of manual instrumentation. Methods This prospective study analyzed 130 arthroplasties in order to determine whether navigation can improve the frontal mechanical axis of the tibia and whether the postoperative angulation of this axis differs from the preoperative one. The mean patient age was 71.8 years, and the mean BMI was 31.17. Eighty-six patients were female. The same cemented TKA model and the same imageless navigation system were used in all cases. Results The mean postoperative tibial angle following implantation was 87.65°, without any statistically significant differences with respect to the previous angulation. However, navigation was seen to result in a nearly neutral tibial axis, a larger number of cases (41.5%-60.8% {p = 0.002}) aligned within the safe zone (90° ± 3°), a smaller number of outliers, and a clustering of values around the mean. Conclusions Navigation improves the frontal positioning of the tibial component in total knee arthroplasties but does not offer any advantages as compared with conventional instrumentation."
pub.1082542383,Robotrac in total knee arthroplasty. The silent assistant.,"This article describes a new prerobotic device (Robotrac) that may be used effectively in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This device holds the femur in any position, allowing the surgeon to situate the knee in any position of flexion that may be necessary during the course of TKA. Using this device, it often is possible to perform TKA without any additional assistant surgeons. To date, we have used Robotrac in more than 200 consecutive total knee replacements without any untoward effects. With the use of this device, it is possible to save about $142 Canadian per total knee replacement. The literature concerning the use of robotics in medicine is reviewed."
pub.1170435467,"The LANCET robotic system can improve surgical efficiency in total hip arthroplasty: A prospective randomized, multicenter, parallel-controlled clinical trial","Objective: To evaluate the accuracy and safety of the LANCET robotic system, a robot arm assisted operation system for total hip arthroplasty via a multicenter clinical randomized controlled trial.
Methods: A total of 116 patients were randomized into two groups: LANCET robotic arm assisted THA group (N = 58) and the conventional THA group (N = 58). General information about the patients was collected preoperatively. Operational time and bleeding were recorded during the surgery. The position of the acetabular prosthesis was evaluated by radiographs one week after surgery and compared with preoperative planning. Harris score, hip mobility, prosthesis position and angle and complications were compared between the two groups at three months postoperatively.
Results: None of the 111 patients who ultimately completed the 3-month follow-up experienced adverse events such as hip dislocation and infection during follow-up. In the RAA group, 52 (92.9 %) patients were located in the Lewinnek safe zone and 49 (87.5 %) patients were located in the Callanan safe zone. In the control group were 47 (85.5 %) and 44 (80.0 %) patients, respectively. In the RAA group, 53 (94.6 %) patients had a postoperative acetabular inclination angle and 51 (91.1 %) patients had an acetabular version angle within a deviation of 5° from the preoperative plan. These numbers were significantly higher than those of the control group, which consisted of 42 (76.4 %) and 34 (61.8 %) patients respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups of subjects in terms of general condition, intraoperative bleeding, hip mobility, and adverse complications.
Conclusion: The results of this prospective randomized, multicenter, parallel-controlled clinical study demonstrated that the LANCET robotic system leads conventional THA surgery in accuracy of acetabular cup placement and does not differ from conventional THA surgery in terms of postoperative hip functional recovery and complications.
The translational potential of this article: In the past, the success rate of total hip arthroplasty (THA) relied heavily on the surgeon's experience. As a result, junior doctors needed extensive training to become proficient in this technique. However, the introduction of surgical robots has significantly improved this situation. By utilizing robotic assistance, both junior and senior doctors can perform THA quickly and efficiently. This advancement is crucial for the widespread adoption of THA, as patients can now receive surgical treatment in local facilities instead of overwhelming larger hospitals and straining medical resources. Moreover, the development of surgical robots with fully independent intellectual property rights holds immense value in overcoming the limitations of high-end medical equipment. This aligns with the objectives outlined in the 14th Five Year Plan for National Science and Technology Strategy."
pub.1181361229,Long-Term Outcomes in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: Survivorship of Medial versus Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKAs) currently represent an important portion of knee arthroplasty procedures and their usage is on an upward trend. Despite offering better functional outcomes and a quicker recovery compared to total knee arthroplasties (TKAs), UKAs are often scrutinized for their longevity. This article provides an in-depth examination of the technical nuances and survival rates of medial versus lateral UKAs, drawing on recent advances and findings in the field. This manuscript thoroughly evaluates the comparability of patient populations undergoing medial and lateral UKAs, considering their anatomical, biomechanical, and demographic differences. It delves into the specific technical challenges associated with each type and systematically assesses the factors that influence failure, including the intricacies of implant design and patient-specific variables. Despite relevant anatomical and biomechanical contrasts between medial and lateral UKAs, recent literature points to comparable survival rates. The prevalence of early failures within the initial five years post-operation underscores the criticality of precise patient selection and refined surgical techniques. The paper succinctly summarizes pivotal literature and provides essential guidance for optimizing UKA survivorship. It underscores the importance of meticulous patient selection and precise surgical techniques, alongside the identification and mitigation of potential pitfalls that impact outcomes. Finally, robotic technology in UKA has considerably enhanced the precision and reproducibility, representing a viable solution to effectively meet and achieve the recommended technical objectives."
pub.1127502221,Is robotic‐assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty a safe procedure? A case control study,"PURPOSE: The hypotheses were that firstly there is few early specific complications due to the use of a robotic-assisted system for unicompartimental knee arthroplasty (UKA), and secondly there are less revisions and complications after robotic-assisted UKA than after conventional UKA.
METHODS: 200 robotic-assisted UKA (175 patients) and 191 conventional UKA (179 patients) were performed between 2013 and 2018 from the same center. Revisions, intraoperative and postoperative complications, functional and radiological results were collected at the most recent follow-up.
RESULTS: At the most recent follow-up (≥ 1 year), revision rates were 4% (n = 8/200) for robotic-assisted UKA and 11% (n = 21/191) for conventional UKA (p = 0.014). Reoperation rates without implant removal were comparable in the robotic and conventional group (7.3% vs 8.6%). Complication rates for stiffness (4.7% vs 4.2%) and infection (1% vs 1.6%) were comparable in both groups. There was no specific complication related to the robotic-assisted system (no soft tissue or bone lesion caused by the use of the robotic-assistance and no complication related to the use of navigation pins). The KSS function scores were higher following robotic-assisted UKA (p = 0.01). Satisfaction rates and contralateral OA were comparable in the two groups.
CONCLUSION: No complications due to the robotic-assisted system were found in this study. There was no difference in the general complications rate between both groups. Robotic-assisted UKA has a lower revision rate compared to conventional technique UKA at the short-term follow-up.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is the first paper comparing revision rate and clinical outcome between UKA performed using the NAVIO robotic system and a conventional technique and searching for specific complication related to the use of the NAVIO robotic system."
pub.1122817488,Manipulation Under Anesthesia Rates in Technology-Assisted versus Conventional-Instrumentation Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"INTRODUCTION: Various technological advancements, specifically robotic assistance, have been implemented for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures to attempt to improve patient outcomes and decrease complication rates. Manipulations under anesthesia have been considered a surrogate for knee stiffness, an undesired postoperative outcome that can potentially be avoided. Currently, there is a lack of information regarding the impact that these new technologies have on manipulations under anesthesia (MUA) rates following TKA. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate rates of MUAs between a consecutive series of patients who underwent robotic-assisted surgery compared to patients who underwent TKA with conventional instrumentation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 188 consecutive robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasties were performed by five fellowship-trained, high-volume surgeons at academic and community institutions. Patients were paired to a consecutive equal number of control patients by each of the specific surgeon for comparison. All patients followed similar postoperative rehabilitation starting on postoperative day one. Rates of MUAs were evaluated within and between cohorts. Additionally, the percent difference of rates was calculated to compare cohorts. All patients were evaluated at a minimum of two years follow-up time from the index procedure. Chi-square analyses was performed to statistically compare MUA rates between the cohorts.
RESULTS: The overall manipulation under anesthesia rate for the study cohort was 1.06% (2/188 patients), while it was 4.79% in the control cohort (9/188) (p=0.032). A 127.5% difference in manipulation under anesthesia rates was found between the two cohorts. No individual surgeons had higher MUA rates in their robotic-assisted group.
CONCLUSION: Our study found that patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA experienced a significant, 4.5-fold decrease in rates of manipulation under anesthesia (p=0.032). Given that MUAs can be a marker of knee stiffness following total knee arthroplasty, the lower rate indicates that study cohort patients had less knee stiffness and, therefore, greater initial postoperative range of motion than the control cohort. Based on these data, assistive technologies may have an advantageous role contributing to enhanced patient outcomes."
pub.1018541241,Function of the anterior cruciate ligament after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty an in vitro robotic study,"The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the anterior-posterior (AP) stability of the knee after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). AP tibial loads were applied to human cadaveric knee specimens using a robotic testing system. After UKA, the knee exhibited tibial translations similar to that of the native knee, and the forces in the ACL were also similar to those seen in the native knee. The ACL-deficient knee after UKA exhibited significantly greater anterior tibial translations than the native knee and the knee after UKA with an intact ACL. These data suggest that medial UKA does not alter the anterior stability of the knee, but a functional ACL is necessary to ensure normal stability after UKA."
pub.1100834233,Robotic Arm–Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has a number of potential advantages. Therefore, in order to more comprehensively assess this technology, we reviewed the (1) accuracy and precision; (2) soft-tissue protection; (3) patient satisfaction; (4) learning curve; and (5) its other potential benefits.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted using PubMed search database for studies reporting clinical outcomes, cadaver results, radiographic outcomes, surgeon experience, and robotic accuracy. Forty articles were included for the final analysis.
RESULTS: Advantages of RATKA may include greater component accuracy and precision, soft-tissue protection, increased patient satisfaction, a short learning curve, optimal ergonomic design, and less surgeon and surgical team fatigue. The aforementioned advantages might help improve clinical, surgical, and patient-reported outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Although there are a number of studies that highlight the potential advantages of RATKA, most of these studies report of short-term outcomes. It is hoped that longer term studies will continue to support the use of this technology in providing higher patient satisfaction and other clinical outcomes."
pub.1133123797,Comparing different approaches in robotic-assisted surgery for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: outcomes at a short-term follow-up of MAKO versus NAVIO system.,"The popularity of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) continues to grow among orthopaedic surgeons and robotic surgery may be helpful in obtaining a precise placement of the prosthetic components, thanks to the meticulous intra-operative computer study for simulating the prosthetic positioning. This may lead to longer implant survivorship as well as a reduction in intermediate and long-term prosthetic complications, despite the initial greater costs than those of manual UKA. In this preliminary study, from January 2017 and October 2017, 18 patients underwent UKA with MAKO robotic system assistance and 10 patients received UKA with NAVIO robotic system assistance. The two groups were homogeneous by age, BMI, degree of osteoarthritis involvement, and postoperative program. Patients were followed both clinically (Numeric Rating Scale NRS and Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores KOOS) and radiographically. At the end term follow up (2 years), no significant difference was observed for NRS and KOOS as well as for clinical parameters as an active range of motion. A significant discrepancy was detected regarding the duration of the surgery and time of using the robotic system, that appeared to be longer in the NAVIO group than that of MAKO group, likely due to the specific technical aspects that characterize these two different robotic systems. The main finding of this study is that favorable clinical and radiographical results may be obtained using a robotic approach (MAKO or NAVIO) for UKA positioning at a short follow up. Due to the lack of significant clinical differences observed between the two groups of patients at end term follow up, the ""concept"" of a robotic approach, more than a specific patented system, may be considered the key element for improving UKA technique and it is likely that in the near future the choice of a single specific robotic system will still be a ""surgeon's preference"". The results of the study add scientific evidence regarding the effective improvement of UKA results using different robotic approaches. They also show possible economic sustainability of this therapeutic strategy related to the optimal patients' performance obtained at short term follow up, suggesting that the robotic assistance may really become a key element for better long-term survivorship of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty."
pub.1134953801,Robotic Arm-Assisted Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: How Are Components Aligned?,"The purpose of this multicenter, retrospective, observational study was to investigate the association between intraoperative component positioning and soft tissue balancing, as reported by robotic technology for a cohort of patients who received robotic arm-assisted lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) as well as short-term clinical follow-up of these patients. Between 2013 and 2016, 78 patients (79 knees) underwent robotic arm-assisted lateral UKAs at two centers. Pre- and postoperatively, patients were administered the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS) and the Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12). Clinical results were dichotomized based upon KOOS and FJS-12 scores into either excellent or fair outcome, considering excellent KOOS and FJS-12 to be greater than or equal to 90. Intraoperative, postimplantation robotic data relative to computed tomography-based components placement were collected and classified. Following exclusions and loss to follow-up, a total of 74 subjects (75 knees) who received robotic arm-assisted lateral UKAs were taken into account with an average follow-up of 36.3 months (range: 25.0-54.2 months) postoperative. Of these, 66 patients (67 knees) were included in the clinical outcome analysis. All postoperative clinical scores showed significant improvement compared with the preoperative evaluation. No association was reported between three-dimensional component positioning and soft tissue balancing throughout knee range of motion with overall KOOS, KOOS subscales, and FJS-12 scores. Lateral UKA three-dimensional placement does not seem to affect short-term clinical performance. However, precise boundaries for lateral UKA positioning and balancing should be taken into account. Robotic assistance allows surgeons to acquire real-time information regarding implant alignment and soft tissue balancing."
pub.1136266966,Combining load sensor and robotic technologies for ligament balance in total knee arthroplasty,"Good ligament balance in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is thought to improve clinical results, but is highly surgeon-dependent when performed without technological assistance. We therefore describe a TKA technique using the Mako robotic arm (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) as sole means of balancing ligament tension by bone recuts associated to control by the VERASENSE load sensor (Orthosensor, Inc, Dania Beach, Florida, USA). In this preliminary series of 29 patients, 27 (93%) showed a well-balanced knee in extension at end of procedure, and 23 (79%) showed a well-balanced knee in flexion and extension, without any periarticular soft-tissue release. The load sensor analyzes ligament balance after the initial bone cuts, and guides possible further femoral or tibial recuts. This technique enables quantifiable alignment and control of ligament tension. Collecting objective intraoperative data should improve knowledge in placing TKA prostheses."
pub.1132051954,Robotic-assisted surgery in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: does it improve the precision of the surgery and its clinical outcomes? Systematic review,"There is a high prevalence of knee osteoarthritis that affects only the medial tibiofemoral compartment. In this group of patients with severe disease, the medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an excellent choice. However, this technique has a great learning curve due to the lower tolerance of improper positioning and alignment. In this context, the robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) arises as an option to improve the accuracy and secondarily enhance the clinical outcomes related to the UKA. The objective in this study is to determine if there are significant advantages with the use of RAS over conventional surgery (CS). In the systematic review of the literature, classification of the results in three main subjects: (A) precision and alignment; (B) functional results and clinical parameters; (C) survivorship. We found 272 studies, of which 15 meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. There is mostly described that RAS significantly improves the accuracy in position (80–100% of planned versus performed P < 0.05), alignment (2–3 times less error variance P < 0.05) and selection of the proper size of the implants (69.23% of correct size femoral implants versus 16.67% using CS P < 0.0154). Recently, there is mild evidence about benefits in the early rehabilitation and post-operative pain, but in all studies reviewed, there is no advantages of RAS in the long-term functional evaluation. There is no strong literature that supports a longer survival of the prothesis with RAS, being the longest mean follow-up reported of 29.6 months. RAS is a useful tool in increasing the precision of the medial UKA implant placement. However, there is still a lack of evidence that properly correlates this improvement in accuracy with better clinical, functional and survival results."
pub.1162670291,Does preoperative 3D CT planning helps in predicting the component size determination and alignment in automatic robotic total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA),"Purpose: Image-based Robotic Total knee Arthroplasty (RA-TKA)was developed with the purpose of enhancing the accuracy in determining the component sizes preoperatively and helping surgeons in minimizing errors and improve patient outcomes. The research aims to find the reliability of robotic-assisted TKR based on images in determining the correct component sizes using preoperative three-dimensional (3D) computer tomography.
Method: After ethical approval, we conducted a prospective study from March 2022 to December 2022. A total of 100 knees underwent image-based RA-TKA having grade 4 Osteoarthritis knee (Kellegren Lawrence classification). A single senior surgeon performed on all patients. Postoperative implant sizes and fit were assessed by five radiographic markers by an independent observer.
Results: In our study, we found the mean age was (64.96 ± 7.3) years, with female to male ratio of 43:22. The preoperative 3D CT accuracy is 100% for femoral component sizing and 97% for the tibial component. There was a statistically significant improvement in varus deformity from preoperative 7.370 ± 3.70° to 1.24 0 ± 0.910° after surgery., p = 0.001. Improvement in flexion deformity correction was from preoperative 6.50 ± 6.30 to postoperative 1.640 ± 1.770, p = 0.001.
Conclusion: Our study concludes that the use of pre-operative 3D CT helps in predicting the component sizes, minimizes surgical time, and enhances implant position accuracy, as well as improves postoperative limb alignment in the coronal and sagittal planes."
pub.1157633701,Pre-Planning the Surgical Target for Optimal Implant Positioning in Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty can attain highly accurate implantation. However, the target for optimal positioning of the components remains debatable. One of the proposed targets is to recreate the functional status of the pre-diseased knee. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of reproducing the pre-diseased kinematics and strains of the ligaments and, subsequently, use that information to optimize the position of the femoral and tibial components. For this purpose, we segmented the pre-operative computed tomography of one patient with knee osteoarthritis using an image-based statistical shape model and built a patient-specific musculoskeletal model of the pre-diseased knee. This model was initially implanted with a cruciate-retaining total knee system according to mechanical alignment principles; and an optimization algorithm was then configured seeking the optimal position of the components that minimized the root-mean-square deviation between the pre-diseased and post-operative kinematics and/or ligament strains. With concurrent optimization for kinematics and ligament strains, we managed to reduce the deviations from 2.4 ± 1.4 mm (translations) and 2.7 ± 0.7° (rotations) with mechanical alignment to 1.1 ± 0.5 mm and 1.1 ± 0.6°, and the strains from 6.5% to lower than 3.2% over all the ligaments. These findings confirm that adjusting the implant position from the initial plan allows for a closer match with the pre-diseased biomechanical situation, which can be utilized to optimize the pre-planning of robotic-assisted surgery."
pub.1120657722,Robotic arm-assisted vs conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been recommended for treatment of unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis. However, its effectiveness and safeness remain controversial compared with conventional UKA. Therefore, the goal of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to re-evaluate the effects of robotic arm-assisted UKA on clinical functional outcomes.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to screen the relevant studies. Continuous data (surgical time, knee excursion during weight acceptance, American knee society score [AKSS], Oxford knee score [OKS], forgotten joint score [FJS], visual analog scale [VAS], and range of motion [ROM]) were pooled using a standardized mean difference (SMD) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the effect size, while dichotomous data (complication rate, revision rate) were pooled to obtain the relative risk (RR) with a 95% CI by STATA 13.0 software.
RESULTS: Eleven studies involving 498 patients undergoing robotic-assisted UKA and 589 patients receiving conventional UKA were included. Our pooled results demonstrated that robotic-assisted could significantly reduce the complication rate (RR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.45-0.85; P = .0041) and improve the knee excursion during weight acceptance (SMD: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.25-1.00; P = .001), but prolonged the surgical time (SMD: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40-1.08; P < .001). No significant difference in the revision rate, AKSS, OKS, FJS, VAS, and ROM between robotic-assisted and conventional UKA groups.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates robotic-assisted UKA may be an effective and safe surgical procedure for treatment of unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis."
pub.1101902806,Robotic-Assisted and Computer-Navigated Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasties: A Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) effectively improves pain and function associated with isolated compartmental knee arthritis. The developments of computer-navigated and robotic-assisted UKA are among the most significant changes that have improved patient outcomes. This study aimed to systematically review the literature to identify differences between computer-navigated and robotic-assisted UKAs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty total articles were identified. Data pertaining to demographics, outcomes, and complications/failures were extracted from each study. Reoperation/revision rates, indications for reoperation/revision, type of procedure, and number of patients who underwent conversion to TKA (when available) were recorded.
RESULTS: Nine studies reported 451 computer-navigated medial UKAs, with 19 (3.9%) reportedly requiring reoperation: primary revision (n=8; 42.1%), conversion to TKA (n=6), and manipulation under anesthesia (n=5). Eleven studies reported 2,311 robotic-assisted UKAs (74 lateral UKAs), with 106 (5.0%) requiring reoperation: conversion to TKA (n=46; 43.4%), primary revision (n=43), reoperations without component-removal (n=15), subchondroplasty, and partial meniscectomy/synovectomy (both n=1). Reoperation rate discrepancy between computer-navigated and robotic-assisted UKA was not statistically significant (p=0.495); age and BMI differed between both groups (p<0.0001).
DISCUSSION: This study represents the first known comparison of revision rates of computer-navigated and robotic-assisted UKA, suggesting that these methods can benefit orthopaedic surgeons, especially those new to UKA or in a low-volume practice."
pub.1174362266,Comparison of Time and Rate of Achieving Minimal Clinically Important Difference: Robotic Versus Manual Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: Robotics in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) continues to increase with the ever-growing demand to use technology in the surgical setting. However, no studies have used minimal clinically important difference (MCID) to compare patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between robotic UKA (rUKA) and manual UKA (mUKA). This study aimed to compare the rate of achieving MCID for improvement (MCID-I) and worsening (MCID-W) and the time to achieving MCID.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of robotic and manual UKAs performed between 2016 and 2022. Preoperative and postoperative Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Physical, PROMIS Physical Function Short-Form 10a (PF-10a), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short-Form (KOOS-PS) scores were collected. Patients were stratified on reaching MCID-I, MCID-W, or ""no notable change"" (score between MCID-W and MCID-I). Survival curves with and without interval censoring were used to assess the time to achieving the MCID. Log-rank and weighted log-rank tests were used to compare groups.
RESULTS: A total of 256 UKAs (64 robotic and 192 manual) were analyzed. No differences were observed in the proportion of patients achieving MCID-I or MCID-W across all three PROMs. Similarly, median time to achieving MCID showed no significant differences between rUKA and mUKA for PROMIS Global Physical (3.3 versus 4.9 months, P = 0.44), PROMIS PF-10a (7.7 versus 8.3 months, P = 0.93), and KOOS-PS (3.0 versus 6.0 months, P = 0.055) scores, both with and without interval censoring.
DISCUSSION: This study indicates that rUKA and mUKA exhibit comparable rates of achieving MCID-I and MCID-W, along with similar median time to reach MCID. These findings offer valuable patient-centric insights into the effectiveness of rUKA. Additional studies evaluating the long-term outcomes of rUKA are needed to determine its long-term advantages.

pub.1105227244,Robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty is associated with improved early functional recovery and reduced time to hospital discharge compared with conventional jig-based total knee arthroplasty,"Aims: The objective of this study was to compare early postoperative functional outcomes and time to hospital discharge between conventional jig-based total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and robotic-arm assisted TKA.
Patients and Methods: This prospective cohort study included 40 consecutive patients undergoing conventional jig-based TKA followed by 40 consecutive patients receiving robotic-arm assisted TKA. All surgical procedures were performed by a single surgeon using the medial parapatellar approach with identical implant designs and standardized postoperative inpatient rehabilitation. Inpatient functional outcomes and time to hospital discharge were collected in all study patients.
Results: There were no systematic differences in baseline characteristics between the conventional jig-based TKA and robotic-arm assisted TKA treatment groups with respect to age (p = 0.32), gender (p = 0.50), body mass index (p = 0.17), American Society of Anesthesiologists score (p = 0.88), and preoperative haemoglobin level (p = 0.82). Robotic-arm assisted TKA was associated with reduced postoperative pain (p < 0.001), decreased analgesia requirements (p < 0.001), decreased reduction in postoperative haemoglobin levels (p < 0.001), shorter time to straight leg raise (p < 0.001), decreased number of physiotherapy sessions (p < 0.001) and improved maximum knee flexion at discharge (p < 0.001) compared with conventional jig-based TKA. Median time to hospital discharge in robotic-arm assisted TKA was 77 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 74 to 81) compared with 105 hours (IQR 98 to 126) in conventional jig-based TKA (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Robotic-arm assisted TKA was associated with decreased pain, improved early functional recovery and reduced time to hospital discharge compared with conventional jig-based TKA. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:930-7."

Planned inclination was 39.9°±0.8° and with robotic instrumentation was 38. 0°±1.6° with no outliers of 5°; on the postoperative CT scan there were 5 outliers (12%). Planned anteversion was 21.2°±2.4° and intraoperatively was 20.7°±2.4° with no outlier of 5°; on the CT there were 7 outliers (16%). The center of rotation (COR) was superior by a mean 0.9±4.2 mm and medial by 2.7±2.9 mm. This robotic instrumentation achieved precision of inclination in 88%, anteversion in 84% and COR in 81.5%."
pub.1107430770,"Robotic-assisted versus standard unicompartmental knee arthroplasty—evaluation of manuscript conflict of interests, funding, scientific quality and bibliometrics","PurposeRobotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has gained popularity over the last decade claiming enhanced surgical precision and better joint kinematics, with peer-reviewed publications about this new technology also increasing over the past few years. The purpose of our study was to compare manuscripts about robotic-assisted UKA to those about standard UKA in terms of industry funding, author conflict of interest, scientific quality, and bibliometrics.MethodsA systematic search using PRISMA guidelines on PubMed and Google Scholar from 2012 to 2016 resulted in 45 papers where robotic technology was performed for UKA and 167 papers that UKA were performed without the assistance of a robot. Between the two groups, we compared (1) rate of manuscripts with reported conflict of interest or industry funding, (2) journal impact factor, (3) level of evidence, and (4) relative citation ratio.ResultsFifty-one percent (23/45) of robotic UKA manuscripts were industry-funded or had authors with financial conflict of interest, compared to 29% ([49/167], p < 0.01) of non-robotic UKA papers. Significantly more robotic UKA papers (24% [11/45] vs 9% [16/167), p < 0.01) were published in journals that were not assigned an impact factor by the Journal Citations Report. There was no difference in regard to bibliometrics or level of evidence.ConclusionManuscripts in which UKA was performed with the assistance of a robot were more likely to be industry funded or be written by authors with financial conflicts of interest and published in less prestigious journals. There were no differences in scientific quality or influence between the two groups. Readers analyzing published data should be aware of the potential conflicts of interests in order to more accurately interpret manuscripts data and conclusions."
pub.1147555377,Inverse Kinematic Alignment for Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Patient specific alignment might improve clinical outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Different alignment concepts are described, each providing specific features with theoretical benefits or possible disadvantages. Inverse kinematic alignment (iKA) is a new patient specific alignment concept with excellent reported clinical outcome and patient satisfaction at short-term follow-up. iKA is a tibia-first, gap balancing technique restoring the native tibial joint line obliquity (JLO). In each patient, within boundaries, equal medial and lateral tibial resections are performed, compensating for cartilage and bone loss. We describe the surgical technique of iKA using a robotic assisted system (Mako, Stryker, Kalamazoo, USA). A case series of 100 consecutive iKA cases is assessed and the bony resections and resection angles are reported. Both in the coronal plane and axial plane, iKA might offer advantages over existing alignment strategies, possibly providing optimal clinical outcome and durable long-term survival, regardless of the alignment is varus, neutral or valgus."
pub.1174589861,Postoperative outcomes and trends in computer-navigated and robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: As the volume of technology-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) increases, there is a need to characterise the outcomes of robotic-assisted (RA) and computer-navigated (CN) THA. The goal of this study was to assess outcomes and opioid consumption following CN-THA and RA-THA compared to conventionally-instrumented (CON) THA.
METHODS: The Premier Database was queried for all patients who underwent primary, elective THA from 2015-2020. Patients were divided into 3 groups: CN, RA, or CON-THA. Yearly usage trends were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the 90-day risk of postoperative complications. Opioid consumption was reported in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for postoperative days (POD) 0 and 1.
RESULTS: Overall, 474,707 elective THAs were identified (95.7% CON, 2.1% CN, 2.2% RA. After accounting for confounders, CN-THA patients were at decreased risk for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) (aOR: 0.55, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and dislocation (aOR 0.45, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but increased risk for blood transfusion (aOR 1.97, &lt;0.001) compared to CON-THA. RA-THA patients were at decreased risk of dislocation (aOR:0.66, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but increased risk for transfusion (aOR 1.20, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), prosthesis breakage (aOR 3.88, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and periprosthetic fracture (aOR 1.72, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Opioid consumption for CN-THA patients was lower on POD1 and lower for RA-THA patients POD0 and 2 compared to CON-THA.
DISCUSSION: CN-THA was associated with reduced rates of PJI and dislocation, but increased rates of blood transfusion while RA-THA was associated with decreased rates of dislocation, but increased rates of blood transfusion, prosthesis complications, and periprosthetic fracture compared to CON-THA. Technology-assisted THA was associated with lower postoperative opioid consumption."
pub.1156496873,Postoperative full leg radiographs exhibit less residual coronal varus deformity compared to intraoperative measurements in robotic arm‐assisted total knee arthroplasty with the MAKO™ system,"PURPOSE: Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (raTKA), currently a major trend in knee arthroplasty, aims to improve the accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment. However, it is unclear whether and to what extent manual radiographic and navigation measurements with the MAKO™ system correlate. Nonetheless, a high agreement would be crucial to reliably achieve the desired limb alignment.
METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients with osteoarthritis and a slight-to-moderate varus deformity undergoing raTKA were prospectively included in this study. Prior to surgery and at follow-up, a full leg radiograph (FLR) under weight-bearing conditions was performed. In addition, a computed tomography (CT) scan was conducted for preoperative planning. The hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), mechanical lateral distal femur angle (mLDFA), mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA) and joint line convergence angle (JLCA) were measured in the preoperative and follow-up FLR as well as in the CT scout (without weight-bearing) by three independent raters. Furthermore, the HKA was intraoperatively assessed with the MAKO™ system before and after raTKA.
RESULTS: Significantly higher HKA values were identified for intraoperative deformity assessment using the MAKO system compared to the preoperative FLR and CT scouts (p = 0.006; p = 0.05). Intraoperative assessment of the HKA with final implants showed a mean residual varus deformity of 3.2° ± 1.9°, whereas a significantly lower residual varus deformity of 1.4° ± 1.9° was identified in the postoperative FLR (p < 0.001). The mMPTA was significantly higher in the preoperative FLR than in the CT scouts (p < 0.001). Intraoperatively, the mMPTA was adjusted to a mean of 87.5° ± 0.9° with final implants, while significantly higher values were measured in postoperative FLRs (p < 0.001). Concerning the mLDFA, no significant differences could be identified.
CONCLUSION: The clinical importance of this study lies in the finding that there is a difference between residual varus deformity measured intraoperatively with the MAKO™ system and those measured in postoperative FLRs. This has implications for preoperative planning as well as intraoperative fine-tuning of the implant position during raTKA to avoid overcorrection of knees with slight-to-moderate varus osteoarthritis.

pub.1172085105,Two-Dimensional Versus Three-Dimensional Preoperative Planning in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative planning in total hip arthroplasty (THA) involves utilizing radiographs or advanced imaging modalities, including computerized tomography scans, for precise prediction of implant sizing and positioning. This study aimed to compare 3-dimensional (3D) versus 2-dimensional (2D) preoperative planning in primary THA with respect to key surgical metrics, including restoration of the horizontal and vertical center of rotation (COR), combined offset, and leg length.
METHODS: This study included 60 patients undergoing primary THA for symptomatic hip osteoarthritis (OA), randomly allocated to either robotic arm-assisted or conventional THA. Digital 2D templating and 3D planning using the robotic software were performed for all patients. All measurements to evaluate the accuracy of templating methods were conducted on the preoperative computerized tomography scanogram, using the contralateral hip as a reference. Sensitivity analyses explored differences between 2D and 3D planning in patients who had superolateral or medial OA patterns.
RESULTS: Compared to 2D templating, 3D templating was associated with less medialization of the horizontal COR (-1.2 versus -0.2 mm, P = .002) and more accurate restoration of the vertical COR (1.63 versus 0.3 mm, P < .001) with respect to the contralateral side. Furthermore, 3D templating was superior for planned restoration of leg length (+0.23 versus -0.74 mm, P = .019). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that in patients who had medial OA, 3D planning resulted in less medialization of horizontal COR and less offset reduction. Conversely, in patients who had superolateral OA, there was less lateralization of horizontal COR and less offset increase using 3D planning. Additionally, 3D planning showed superior reproducibility for stem, acetabular cup sizes, and neck angle, while 2D planning often led to smaller stem and cup sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated higher accuracy in the planned restoration of native joint mechanics using 3D planning. Additionally, this study highlights distinct variances between the 2 planning methods across different OA pattern subtypes, offering valuable insights for clinicians employing 2D planning."
pub.1171805763,Using preoperative planning software to assess the effect of head length on prosthetic range of motion in a high-risk population: a three-dimensional modeling study,"PurposeConcurrent use of minus heads with tapered stems in total hip arthroplasty (THA) decreases the prosthetic range of motion (pROM). Three-dimensional preoperative templating can simulate the location of the impingement by taking the hip through a virtual pROM. This enables surgeons to simulate how modifying the type of implant, orientation, and position influences impingement. We hypothesized that CT-based modeling would result in a decrease in the pROM, thereby increasing the risk of impingement when minus heads are used.MethodsForty-three patients who underwent robotic-assisted primary THAs were included. Prosthetic head diameter (32/36-mm) and head length (minus/zero/plus) were the predictors. Maximum external rotation at full hip extension and internal rotation at 90° and 100° of flexion prior to prosthetic impingement were the outcome variables. A CT-based preoperative planning software was used for pROM estimation and impingement detection.ResultsSignificant decreases in pROM were found for both head diameters as the head length decreased and was more pronounced in external rotation during full hip extension (changes of 2.8–3.4° for the 32-mm head and 1.6–2.8° for the 36-mm head (p = 0.00011)). The magnitude of loss in pROM when using a minus head was larger than the gain provided by a plus head in tapered stems (p < 0.0001).ConclusionHead length affects the offset and pROM. When the use of minus heads or smaller heads is indicated, 3D preoperative templating for assessing postoperative pROM and impingement provides surgeons with options to consider alternate surgical plans offering additional assurance and protection from dislocation."
pub.1170109272,"Is Tibial Bone Mineral Density Related to Sex, Age, Preoperative Alignment, or Fixation Method in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty?","BACKGROUND: Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has regained interest for its potential for long-term biologic fixation. The density of the bone is related to its ability to resist static and cyclic loading and can affect long-term implant fixation; however, little is known about the density distribution of periarticular bone in TKA patients. Thus, we sought to characterize the bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal tibia in TKA patients.
METHODS: We included 42 women and 50 men (mean age 63 years, range: 50 to 87; mean body mass index 31.6, range: 20.5 to 49.1) who underwent robotic-assisted TKA and had preoperative computed tomography scans with a BMD calibration phantom. Using the robotic surgical plan, we computed the BMD distribution at 1 mm-spaced cross-sections parallel to the tibial cut from 2 mm above the cut to 10 mm below. The BMD was analyzed with respect to patient sex, age, preoperative alignment, and type of fixation.
RESULTS: The BMD decreased from proximal to distal. The greatest changes occurred within ± 2 mm of the tibial cut. Age did not affect BMD for men; however, women between 60 and 70 years had higher BMD than women ≥ 70 years for the total cut (P = .03) and the medial half of the cut (P = .03). Cemented implants were used in 1 86-year-old man and 18 women (seven < 60 years, seven 60 to 70 years, and four ≥ 70 year old). We found only BMD differences between cemented or cementless fixation for women < 60 years.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the preoperative BMD distribution in TKA patients relative to the intraoperative tibial cut. Our results indicate that while sex and age may be useful surrogates of BMD, the clinically relevant thresholds for cementless knees remain unclear, offering an area for future studies."
pub.1168098691,Associations of postoperative outcomes with geriatric nutritional risk index after conventional and robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The association between postoperative outcomes of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) and nutrition status among elderly adults remained unclear. The authors aimed to evaluate these associations and provide a nutrition status reference for the surgical technique selection of TKA.
METHODS: In the present study, the authors used data from a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled project, which recruited patients underwent TKA therapy. A total of 88 elderly adults (age ≥65 years old) were included in this study. Their preoperative and postoperative demographic data and radiographic parameters were collected. Clinical outcomes, including postoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle deviation, knee society score (KSS), 10 cm visual analog scale, and so on, were observed and compared between the RA-TKA group and the conventional TKA group. Logistic regression was performed to adjust several covariates. In addition, according to the results of restricted cubic splines analyses, all participants were categorized into two groups with GNRI≤100 and GNRI >100 for further subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: Our results showed despite having a lower postoperative HKA angle deviation, the RA-TKA group had a similar postoperative KSS score compared with the conventional TKA group in elderly adults. Among elderly patients with GNRI>100, RA-TKA group achieved significantly more accurate alignment (HKA deviation, P =0.039), but did not obtain more advanced postoperative KSS scores because of the compensatory effect of good nutrition status. However, among elderly patients with GNRI≤100, RA-TKA group had significantly higher postoperative KSS scores compared to the conventional TKA group ( P =0.025) and this association were not altered after adjustment for other covariates.
CONCLUSION: Considering the clinical outcomes of conventional TKA may be more susceptible to the impact of nutrition status, elderly patients with GNRI≤100 seem to be an applicable population for RA-TKA, which is more stable and would gain significantly more clinical benefits compared with conventional TKA."
pub.1171813368,High in‐vivo accuracy of a novel robotic‐arm‐assisted system for total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been shown to improve the accuracy and precision of bony resections and implant position. However, the in vivo accuracy of the full surgical workflow has not been widely reported. The primary objective of this study is to determine the accuracy and precision of a robotic-arm-assisted system throughout the intraoperative workflow.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent primary TKA with various workflows and alignment targets by three arthroplasty-trained surgeons with previous experience using the ROSA® Knee System (Zimmer Biomet) over a 3-month follow-up period. Accuracy and precision were determined by measuring the difference between various workflow time points, including the final preoperative plan (PP), robot-validated (RV) resection angle and postoperative radiographs (PR). The absolute mean difference between the measurements determined accuracy, and the standard deviation represented precision. The lateral distal femoral angle, medial proximal tibial angle, femoral flexion angle and tibial slope were measured on postoperative coronal long-leg radiographs and true short-leg lateral radiographs.
RESULTS: A total of 77 patients were included in the final analyses. The accuracy for the coronal femoral angle was 1.62 ± 1.11°, 0.75 ± 0.79° and 1.96 ± 1.29° for the differences between PP and PR, PP and RV and RV and PR. The tibial coronal accuracy was 1.44 ± 1.03°, 0.81 ± 0.67° and 1.57 ± 1.14° for PP/PR, PP/RV and RV/PR, respectively. Femoral flexion accuracy was 1.39 ± 1.05°, 0.83 ± 0.59° and 1.81 ± 1.21° for PP/PR, PP/RV and RV/PR, respectively. Tibial slope accuracy was 0.99 ± 0.72°, 1.19 ± 0.87° and 1.63 ± 1.11°, respectively. The proportion of patients within 3° was 93.2%, 95.3%, 97.3% and 94.6% for the distal femur, proximal tibia, femoral flexion and tibial slope angles when the final intraoperative plan was compared to PRs. No patients had a postoperative complication at the final follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The ROSA Knee System has acceptable accuracy and precision of coronal and sagittal plane resections with few outliers at various steps throughout the platform's entire workflow in vivo.

pub.1181414075,Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Improves Accuracy and Reproducibility of the Polyethylene Insert Thickness Compared to Manual Instrumentation or Navigation: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background: Increased accuracy and lower rates of component positioning outliers have been associated with better long-term survival and functional outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study investigates the accuracy of robotic-assisted TKA compared to navigation-assisted and manual instrumentation techniques, using polyethylene tibial insert thickness as a surrogate.
Methods: Consecutive primary TKA by a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed and divided in 3 groups: manual instrumentation, navigation-assisted, and robotic-assisted (RA-TKA). Polyethylene insert thickness, deviation from planned thickness, and rate of outliers were compared between the 3 groups using nonparametric analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Bonferroni corrections. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of polyethylene thickness ≥9 mm. The learning curve for RA-TKA was evaluated with a box plot graph of groups of 10 consecutive cases.
Results: There were 474 patients in manual instrumentation TKA, 257 in navigation-assisted TKA and 225 in RA-TKA, with median polyethylene thicknesses of 6.0 (interquartile range 5.0-7.0), 6.0 (interquartile range 5.0-7.0), and 5.0 (interquartile range 5.0-6.0) millimeters, respectively (P˂0.001 RA-TKA compared to both other groups). Polyethylene inserts with a thickness ≥9 mm were used in 28 (5.9%) manual instrumentation TKA, 13 (5.1%) navigation-assisted TKA, and 1 (0.4%) RA-TKA (<i>P</i> = .004). Independent predictors for polyethylene thickness ≥9 mm included surgical technique, left side, and male sex. A learning curve of &lt;30 cases was observed before consistent polyethylene thickness was achieved in RA-TKA.
Conclusions: Tibial polyethylene insert thickness, as a surrogate of surgical accuracy, is more reproducible in robotic-assisted than in navigation-assisted or manual-instrumentation TKA. The learning curve to reach high levels of reproducibility with this technique is relatively short."
pub.1155916753,"Overview of the different personalized total knee arthroplasty with robotic assistance, how choosing?","Current limitations in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) function and patient satisfaction stimulated us to question our practice. Our understanding of knee anatomy and biomechanics has evolved over recent years as we now consider that a more personalized joint reconstruction may be a better-targeted goal for TKA. Implant design and surgical techniques must be advanced to better reproduce the anatomy and kinematics of native knees and ultimately provide a forgotten joint. The availability of precision tools as robotic assistance surgery can help us recreate patient anatomy and ensure components are not implanted in a position that may compromise long-term outcomes. Robotic-assisted surgery is gaining in popularity and may be the future of orthopedic surgery. However, moving away from the concept of neutrally aligning every TKA dogma opens the door to new techniques emergence based on opinion and experience and leads to a certain amount of uncertainty among knee surgeons. Hence, it is important to clearly describe each technique and analyze their potential impacts and benefits. Personalized TKA techniques may be classified into 2 main families: unrestricted or restricted component orientation. In the restricted group, some will aim to reproduce native ligament laxity versus aiming for ligament isometry. When outside of their boundaries, all restricted techniques will induce anatomical changes. Similarly, most native knee having asymmetric ligaments laxity between compartments and within the same compartment during the arc of flexion; aiming for ligament isometry induces bony anatomy changes. In the current paper, we will summarize and discuss the impacts of the different robotic personalized alignment techniques, including kinematic alignment (KA), restricted kinematic alignment (rKA), inverse kinematic alignment (iKA), and functional alignment (FA). With every surgical technique, there are limitations and shortcomings. As our implants are still far from the native knee, it is primordial to understand the impacts and benefits of each technique. Mid to long data will help us in defining the new standards."

After propensity score matching, each group comprised 29 hips. Post-operative cup position and orientation were measured from the postoperative CT data. Errors from the target cup position and orientation were compared between the two groups.ResultsPost-operatively, the absolute error of the anteroposterior and superoinferior cup positions from the target position was significantly lower in the rTHA group than in the nTHA group. The change in the post-operative radiographic inclination from the target orientation was lower in the rTHA group than in the nTHA group. Screw fixation for cup implantation was required for three hips in the nTHA group but not in the rTHA group.ConclusionrTHA achieved more precise cup implantation with reduced variation from the target orientation compared to nTHA in patients with osteoarthritis secondary to DDH."
pub.1137744297,Assessment of accuracy of an imageless hand-held robotic-assisted system in component positioning in total knee replacement: a prospective study,"In recent years, robotic technology is becoming more pervasive in joint arthroplasty. The role of robotics in joint replacement surgery is to bring precision and accuracy in bone preparation, implant positioning and soft tissue balancing. However, there is yet to be a study conducted to determine the accuracy of bone preparation done by a new robotic system. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and report on the accuracy of bone cuts using imageless semiautonomous freehand robotic sculpting system, Navio (Smith & Nephew) based on the data provided by the robotic system. Between August 2018 and May 2019, a total of 62 patients were prospectively enrolled in this study. All surgeries were done by the senior author using a medial para-patellar approach and using a posterior stabilised implant (Anthem, Smith & Nephew Inc.). The study included 37 female patients and 25 male patients. The parameters assessed in this study were: (1) mechanical axis, (2) femoral coronal alignment, (3) femoral rotation, (4) femoral sagittal alignment, (5) tibial slope and (6) tibial coronal alignment using paired t test and root mean squared error (RMSE). The robotic system was accurate in achieving the bone cuts as planned in mechanical axis alignment (p = 0.89, RMSE = 0.56), femoral coronal alignment (p = 0.36, RMSE = 0.36), femoral sagittal alignment (p = 0.10, RMSE = 0.44), femoral rotation (p = 0.91, RMSE = 0.11), tibial coronal alignment (p = 0.81, RMSE = 0.24) and tibial slope (p = 0.30, RMSE = 0.37) with the maximum RMSE being 0.56. This study demonstrated that semi-autonomous hand-held robotic system, Navio (Smith & Nephew) for total knee arthroplasty produced accurate component positioning as per plan in all planes. The maximum RMSE was 0.56°."
pub.1173073937,Valgus stress knee radiographs accurately anticipate the bone resection in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: Protocol validation using an image‐based robotic system,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to describe a planning method for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) implantation using preoperative stress radiographs to measure the thickness of tibial and femoral bone resections and to validate this method with data from an image-based robotic surgery system. Having such method for preoperative planning would be of interest for surgeons performing UKA in order to anticipate optimal bone resection on both tibia and femoral sides.
METHODS: A new planning method for medial UKA based on valgus stress knee radiographs validated it with an image-based robotic surgery system (Restoris MCK, MAKO®, Stryker Corporation) was proposed. This retrospective study involved radiographic measurements of 76 patients who underwent image-based robotic medial UKA between April 2022 and February 2023. Preoperative anteroposterior stress radiographs of the knee were used to simulate UKA implantation. The UKA technique was based on Cartier's angle and aimed at restoring the joint line. The total dimension measured was 14 mm (8 mm for minimal tibial component and polyethylene insert + 4 mm for femoral component + 2 mm for safety laxity). Bone resections were measured in the preoperative valgus stress radiographs and then against the intraoperative bone resection data provided by the robotic system. Inter- and intra-observer reliability was assessed using 25 measurements.
RESULTS: The mean planned tibial resection measured in the radiographs was 4.3 ± 0.4 [2.9-5.8], while the mean robotic resection was 4.2 ± 0.5 [2.7-5.8] (mean difference = 0.15 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.27 to 0.57]). There was a strong correlation between these two values (Pearson's rank R = 0.79, p < 0.001). Intra- and inter-observer reliability were also very strong (Pearson's rank R = 0.91, p < 0.001, and Pearson's rank R = 0.82, p < 0.001, respectively). The mean planned femoral bone resection measured in the radiographs was 2.7 ± 0.7 mm [1-4.5], while the mean robotic resection was 2.5 ± 0.9 [1-5] (mean difference = 0.21 mm, 95% CI [-0.66 to 1.08]). There was a strong correlation between these two values (Pearson's rank R = 0.82, p < 0.001). Intra- and inter-observer reliability were also strong (Pearson's rank R = 0.88, p < 0.001, and Pearson's rank R = 0.84, p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This study describes and validates with robotic information a simple and reproducible preoperative planning method to determine femoral and tibial bone resection for medial UKA implantation using antero-posterior valgus stress knee radiographs, leaving a medial safety laxity of 2 mm. It represents a very valuable contribution to the understanding of UKA principles, which can serve to extend its indications and increase reproducibility of the surgical technique.

pub.1175300582,The bone trauma and soft-tissue injury classification system in total hip arthroplasty (BOSTI Hip),"Aims: The primary objective of this study was to develop a validated classification system for assessing iatrogenic bone trauma and soft-tissue injury during total hip arthroplasty (THA). The secondary objective was to compare macroscopic bone trauma and soft-tissues injury in conventional THA (CO THA) versus robotic arm-assisted THA (RO THA) using this classification system.
Methods: This study included 30 CO THAs versus 30 RO THAs performed by a single surgeon. Intraoperative photographs of the osseous acetabulum and periacetabular soft-tissues were obtained prior to implantation of the acetabular component, which were used to develop the proposed classification system. Interobserver and intraobserver variabilities of the proposed classification system were assessed.
Results: The BOne trauma and Soft-Tissue Injury classification system in total Hip arthroplasty (BOSTI Hip) grades osseous acetabular trauma and periarticular muscle damage during THA. The classification system has an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.93) for interobserver agreement and 0.89 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.93) for intraobserver agreement. RO THA was associated with improved BOSTI Hip scores (p = 0.002) and more pristine osseous surfaces in the anterior superior (p = 0.001) and posterior superior (p < 0.001) acetabular quadrants compared with CO THA. There were no differences between the groups in relation to injury to the gluteus medius (p = 0.084), obturator internus (p = 0.241), piriformis (p = 0.081), superior gamellus (p = 0.116), inferior gamellus (p = 0.132), quadratus femoris (p = 0.208), and vastus lateralis (p = 0.135), but overall combined muscle injury was reduced in RO THA compared with CO THA (p = 0.023).
Discussion: The proposed BOSTI Hip classification provides a reproducible grading system for stratifying iatrogenic bone trauma and soft-tissue injury during THA. RO THA was associated with improved BOSTI Hip scores, more pristine osseous acetabular surfaces, and reduced combined periarticular muscle injury compared with CO THA. Further research is required to understand if these intraoperative findings translate to differences in clinical outcomes between the treatment groups."
pub.1181936267,ISTA Award 2023: Toward functional reconstruction of the pre-diseased state in total knee arthroplasty,"Aims: The surgical target for optimal implant positioning in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty remains the subject of ongoing discussion. One of the proposed targets is to recreate the knee's functional behaviour as per its pre-diseased state. The aim of this study was to optimize implant positioning, starting from mechanical alignment (MA), toward restoring the pre-diseased status, including ligament strain and kinematic patterns, in a patient population.
Methods: We used an active appearance model-based approach to segment the preoperative CT of 21 osteoarthritic patients, which identified the osteophyte-free surfaces and estimated cartilage from the segmented bones; these geometries were used to construct patient-specific musculoskeletal models of the pre-diseased knee. Subsequently, implantations were simulated using the MA method, and a previously developed optimization technique was employed to find the optimal implant position that minimized the root mean square deviation between pre-diseased and postoperative ligament strains and kinematics.
Results: There were evident biomechanical differences between the simulated patient models, but also trends that appeared reproducible at the population level. Optimizing the implant position significantly reduced the maximum observed strain root mean square deviations within the cohort from 36.5% to below 5.3% for all but the anterolateral ligament; and concomitantly reduced the kinematic deviations from 3.8 mm (SD 1.7) and 4.7° (SD 1.9°) with MA to 2.7 mm (SD 1.4) and 3.7° (SD 1.9°) relative to the pre-diseased state. To achieve this, the femoral component consistently required translational adjustments in the anterior, lateral, and proximal directions, while the tibial component required a more posterior slope and varus rotation in most cases.
Conclusion: These findings confirm that MA-induced biomechanical alterations relative to the pre-diseased state can be reduced by optimizing the implant position, and may have implications to further advance pre-planning in robotic-assisted surgery in order to restore pre-diseased knee function."
pub.1135476131,Learning curve for active robotic total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) procedures incorporate technology in an attempt to improve outcomes. The Active Robot (ARo) performs a TKA with automated resections of the tibia and femur in efforts to optimize bone cuts. Evaluating the Learning Curve (LC) is essential with a novel tool. The purpose of this study was to assess the associated LC of ARo for TKA.
METHODS: A multi-center prospective FDA cohort study was conducted from 2017 to 2018 including 115 patients that underwent ARo. Surgical time of the ARo was defined as Operative time (OT), segmented as surgeon-dependent time (patient preparation and registration) and surgeon-independent time (autonomous bone resection by the ARo). An average LC for all surgeons was computed. Complication rates and patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores were recorded and examined to evaluate for any LC trends in these patient related factors.
RESULTS: The OT for the cases 10-12 were significantly quicker than the OT time of cases 1-3 (p < 0.028), at 36.5 ± 7.4 down from 49.1 ± 17 min. CUSUM and confidence interval analysis of the surgeon-dependent time showed different LCs for each surgeon, ranging from 12 to 19 cases. There was no difference in device related complications or PRO scores over the study timeframe.
CONCLUSION: Active Robotic total knee arthroplasty is associated with a short learning curve of 10-20 cases. The learning curve was associated with the surgical time dedicated to the robotic specific portion of the case. There was no learning curve-associated device-related complications, three-dimensional component position, or patient-reported outcome scores.

pub.1164706206,Improved accuracy of implant placement with an imageless handheld robotic system compared to conventional instrumentation in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty: a prospective randomized controlled trial using CT‐based assessment of radiological outcomes,"PURPOSE: Image-free handheld robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has shown to achieve desired limb alignment compared to conventional jig-based instrumented total knee arthroplasty (CTKA). The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the accuracy of a semi-autonomous imageless handheld RATKA compared to CTKA in order to achieve the perioperative planned target alignment of the knee postoperatively.
METHODS: Fifty-two patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomized in 1:1 ratio to undergo unilateral CTKA or an imageless handheld RATKA. A full-length lower limb CT-scan was obtained pre- and 6-week postoperative. The primary outcomes were radiologic measurements of achieved target hip-knee-ankle axis (HKA-axis) and implant component position including varus and external rotation and flexion of the femur component, and posterior tibial slope. The proportion of outliers in above radiographic outcomes, defined as > 3° deviation in postoperative CT measurements as compared to perioperative planned target, were also noted. Knee phenotypes were compared with use of the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) classification.
RESULTS: Baseline conditions were comparable between both groups. The overall proportion and percentage of outliers (n = 38, 24.4% vs n = 9, 5.8%) was statistically significant (p < 0.001) in favor of RATKA. The achieved varus-valgus of the femoral component (varus 1.3° ± 1.7° vs valgus - 0.1° ± 1.9°, p < 0.05) with statistically significant less outliers (0% vs 88.5%, p < 0.01), the achieved HKA-axis (varus 0.4° ± 2.1° vs valgus - 1.2° ± 2.1°, p < 0.05) and the posterior tibial slope (1.4° ± 1.1° vs 3.2° ± 1.8°, p < 0.05) were more accurate with RATKA. The most common postoperative CPAK categories were type II (50% CTKA vs 61.5% RATKA), type I (3.8% CTKA vs 23.1% RATKA) and type V (26.9% CTKA vs 15.4% RATKA). CPAK classification III was only found in CTKA (19.2%). Type VI, VII, VIII, and IX were rare in both populations.
CONCLUSIONS: The present trial demonstrates that an imageless handheld RATKA system can be used to accurately perioperatively plan the desired individual component implant positions with less alignment outliers whilst aiming for a constitutional alignment.

pub.1148997305,A Newly Designed “SkyWalker” Robot Applied in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Retrospective Cohort Study for Femoral Rotational Alignment Restoration,"OBJECTIVE: This study explored whether robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has the advantage of restoring femoral rotational alignment compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty (COTKA).
METHODS: Sixty patients (45 women and 15 men) attending our department from May 2019 to December 2020 were selected and divided into two groups, with 30 patients in each group, according to whether they underwent COTKA or RATKA. Femoral rotational alignment results, such as, posterior condylar angle (PCA), patella transverse axis-femoral transepicondylar axis angle (PFA), radiological findings, such as, hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), and medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and operative data (operation time, intraoperative blood loss, tourniquet time, and length of stay (LOS), and clinical outcomes, such as maximum knee flexion angle (MKFA), Knee Society Score (KSS), and Western Ontario Mac Master University Index Score (WOMAC) were compared within and between the two groups.
RESULTS: PCA and PFA in the RATKA group were (0.6 ± 0.3)° and (0.9 ± 0.3)°, respectively, which were smaller than (1.5 ± 2.0)° and (3.1 ± 1.1)° in the COTKA group (P < 0.05), and were closer to 0°; the differences in HKA, LDFA, and MPTA were not statistically significant. With the exception of the LDFA, the HKA, MPTA, PCA, and PFA improved in both groups after surgery (P < 0.05). The blood loss and the LOS of RATKA group were 192.3 ± 23.1 mL and 8.2 ± 1.4 days, which were less than 203.7 ± 29.8 mL and 9.3 ± 1.1 days of the COTKA group, but the operation time showed no statistically significant difference, and the tourniquet time was longer (P < 0.05). The MKFA in the RATKA group was (123.0 ± 3.7)°, which was greater than (116.3 ± 4.6)° in the COTKA group (P < 0.05). In terms of scores, the postoperative results were better than the preoperative results in both groups (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups.
CONCLUSION: The accuracy of femoral rotational alignment reconstructed achieved by RATKA is significantly better than that of COTKA and is more conducive to the recovery of knee flexion function after surgery; although RATKA reduces intraoperative blood loss and postoperative LOS, the short-term clinical efficacy comparison has not yet demonstrated the advantages of robotic technology, and a more optimized design is needed to improve the efficiency of RATKA surgery."
pub.1115993815,In vivo kinematic analysis of patients with robotic‐assisted total hip arthroplasty during gait at 1‐year follow‐up,"BACKGROUND: Suboptimal component positioning has been suggested as an important contributing factor to postoperative gait asymmetry. The aim of this study is to determine whether robotic arm-assisted THA better restores gait symmetry than freehand THA.
METHODS: Component orientation and positioning parameters and in vivo gait kinematics were quantified for implanted and native hips in 20 robotic arm-assisted and eight freehand THA patients, using a validated combined three-dimensional modeling technique.
RESULTS: Although neither THA procedure fully restored the native hip geometry, the robotic arm-assisted THA showed a better accuracy than freehand THA, with lower root mean square errors of component orientations. Gait asymmetry was not fully eliminated by either robotic arm-assisted or freehand THA, with increased internal rotation most notably observed in the implanted hip.
CONCLUSION: Improved accuracy in restoring native hip geometry achieved by the robotic arm-assisted THA procedure did not fully translate into improved gait symmetry."
pub.1085617296,Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: Outcomes at Minimum Two-Year Follow-Up.,"BACKGROUND: Component malposition in total hip arthroplasty (THA) contributes to instability and early failure. Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) utilizes CT-based planning with haptically-guided bone preparation and implant insertion to optimize component position accuracy. This study compared acetabular component position and postoperative complications following manual THA (mTHA) with rTHA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive primary THAs performed by one surgeon at three intervals were analyzed in this retrospective cohort study: the initial 100 consecutive manual THAs (mTHA) in clinical practice (year 2000), the last consecutive 100 mTHA before rTHA introduction (year 2011), and the first consecutive 100 rTHA (year 2012). Acetabular abduction (AAB) and anteversion (AAV) angles were measured using validated software. The Lewinnek safe zone was used to define accuracy (AAB 40°±10° and AAV 15°±10°). Comparisons included operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), infection rate, and dislocation rate.
RESULTS: The rate of acetabular component placement within Lewinnek safe zone was the highest in the rTHA cohort (77%), followed by late mTHA (45%) and early mTHA (30%) (p<0.001). Robotic-assisted THA resulted in an additional 71% improvement in accuracy in the first year of use (p<0.001). Dislocation rate was 5% with early mTHA, 3% in the late mTHA cohort, and 0% in the rTHA cohort within the first two years postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of infection between groups.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted THA improved acetabular component accuracy and reduced dislocation rates when compared with mTHA. Further study is needed to determine if similar improvements will be noted in larger multicenter studies using alternative surgical approaches."
pub.1151545987,Clinical outcomes in TKA are enhanced by both robotic assistance and patient specific alignment: a comparative trial in 120 patients,"IntroductionRobotically assisted surgery was introduced in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to increase the precision of implant positioning and optimize clinical outcomes. However, the target implant position or alignment is debated. The aim of this study was twofold: to compare clinical outcomes of conventional TKA vs. robotically assisted TKA in an adjusted mechanically aligned (MA) TKA series, and to analyze the clinical effects of introducing patient-specific alignment (inverse kinematic alignment, iKA) in a robotically assisted TKA cohort.Materials and methodsA total of 120 patients with end stage osteoarthritis of the knee were enrolled. The first group (n = 40) received conventional adjusted MA TKA. The second group (n = 40) received robotically assisted adjusted MA TKA. The third group (n = 40) received robotically assisted iKA TKA. All patients received cruciate retaining Triathlon TKA with a uniform surgery protocol. The three groups were matched for age, sex, BMI and preoperative osteoarthritis. Preoperative and 1-year postoperative clinical outcomes were documented with the Oxford Knee Score (OKS).ResultsComparison of OKS between the MA groups indicated no significant difference (p = 0.223) between the conventional TKA (group 1; 40.2 ± 5.9) and robotically assisted TKA (group 2; 42.2 ± 6.3) 1 year postoperatively. Comparison of OKS between the robotically assisted groups indicated no significant difference (p = 0.078) between the MA TKA (group 2; 42.2 ± 6.3) and iKA TKA (group 3; 44.8 ± 3.5). Comparison of conventional MA TKA (group 1; 40.3 ± 6.0) with robotically assisted iKA TKA (group 3; 44.8 ± 3.5) indicated a significant difference (p < 0.001).ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that the introduction of both patient-specific alignment and robotically assisted surgery improve clinical outcomes in TKA surgery. When access to robotic assistance is available, performing patient-specific alignment should be the objective."
pub.1146100275,Time-Based Learning Curve for Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Multicenter Study,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has been shown to improve the accuracy of bone resection, reduce radiographic outliers, and decrease iatrogenic injury. However, it has also been shown that RA-TKA surgical times can be longer than manual surgery during adoption. The purpose of this article was to investigate (1) the characteristics of the operative time curves and trends, noting the amount of surgeons who improved, for those who performed at least 12 cases (based on initial modeling); (2) the proportion of RA surgeons who achieved the same operative times for RA-TKA as compared with manual TKAs; and (3) the number of RA-TKA cases until a steady-state operative time was achieved. TKA operative times were collected from 30 hospitals for 146 surgeons between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to estimate the difference between the mean RA-TKA times by case interval and the weighted baseline for manual times. The learning curve was observed at the 12th case. Therefore, operative times were analyzed for each surgeon who performed at least 12 RA-TKA cases to determine the percentage of these surgeons who trended toward a decrease or increase in their times. These surgeons were further analyzed to determine the proportion who achieved the same operating times as manual TKAs. A further hierarchical Bayesian model was used to determine when these surgeons achieved steady-state operative times. There were 60 surgeons (82%) who had decreasing surgical times over the first 12 RA-TKA cases. The remaining 13 (18%) had increasing surgical times (mean increase of 0.59 minutes/case). Approximately two-thirds of the surgeons (64%) achieved the same operating times as manual cases. The steady-state time neutrality occurred between 15 and 20 cases and beyond. This study demonstrated the learning curve for a large cohort of RA-TKAs. This model demonstrated a learning curve between 15 and 20 cases and beyond. These are important findings for this innovative technology."
pub.1053164386,Are Early Results of Robotic Assisted Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Successful?," Objectives: Robotic surgery studies have been increasing in literature in the past years due to its operative advantages on reducing error and improving functional success in partial knee arthroplasty.   Methods: Data were prospectively collected in 21 patients (31 knees) who underwent MAKOplasty, robotic assisted unicondylar medial knee arthroplasty, between June 2013 – January 2014 in our clinic with an average follow-up time of 5.5 months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with American Knee Society Scoring System. Additionally, intra-operative digitally planned implant positions on the robot’s software were compared with post-operative radiographic component alignment. In the radiographic evaluation; anatomic axis of the tibia was observed in the coronal plane. Tibial posterior slope and flexion angle of the femoral component were observed in the sagittal plane.   Results: Pre-operatively 1 patient was scored fair (60 points) and 20 patients were scored poor (mean, 46.6 points) on American Knee Society Scoring System. Post-operatively all 21 patients had excellent knee scores (mean, 99.67 points). Function-wise 7 patients were scored fair (mean, 60 points) and 14 patients were scored poor (mean, 30.7 points) again on American Knee Society Functional Scoring System. Post-operatively all 21 patients exhibited excellent function scores (mean, 99.04 points). In the radiological evaluation, intra-operative robotic analyses were compared with post-operative radiographic alignment. No significant difference was observed statistically (paired t-test, p < 0.05). This comparison is valuable as Lonner, Hernigou, Collier report that mal-alignment by as little as 2° may predispose to implant failures.   Conclusion: Robotic assistance greatly improves clinical and functional outcomes and may help prevent implant failures due to surgical error and mal-alignment in partial knee arthroplasty. "
pub.1152680296,Does acetabular robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty with femoral navigation improve clinical outcomes at 1-year post-operative? A case-matched propensity score study comparing 98 robotic-assisted versus 98 manual implantation hip arthroplasties,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the optimization of implant positioning, the clinical benefit of the use of robotic assistance during THA remains uncertain. In this case-control study (robotic versus manual technique) we made a retrospective short-term comparison of: (1) the functional results, (2) the complications, (3) and the influence of radiological symmetrization of the hips on the functional result.
HYPOTHESIS: The use of a robotic arm improved the functional results of a THA.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: A retrospective case-control study was performed, including patients with unilateral hip osteoarthritis who underwent a robotic arm-assisted THA (THA-R). The controls (THA-C) were matched according to age, sex, body mass index and surgical approach. The Harris (HHS), Oxford (OHS) and Forgotten Joint (FJS) scores were collected preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. At each review, complications were categorized into minor events, revision surgery with and without implant change. Radiographic analysis was performed on weight-bearing images of the pelvis 3 months postoperatively. The objective of the surgery was symmetrization of the THA in the contralateral healthy hip. For each measured parameter of the hip joint center of rotation (COR), global offset (GO) and articular leg length discrepancy (aLLD), the difference between the two sides corresponding to the delta symmetrization was compared.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included in the THA-R group and matched to 98 controls in the THA-C group. At 1 year postoperatively, the FJS and OHS scores were statistically higher in the THA-R group, respectively 82.1±22.3 [8.3; 100] and 40.8±8.8 [6; 48] vs. 71.2±27.8 [0; 100] and 38.1±9.7 [12; 48] in the THA-C group (p=0.004 and p=0.043). There was no difference in HHS (THA-R: 85.9±15.8 [31; 100] vs. THA-C: 85.8±13.3 [49-100] (p=0.962)). The implant revision rate at 1 year was significantly higher in the THA-C group (0% vs. 5.1% (p=0.025)). There was no difference in the reoperation without component exchange despite 3 dislocations (3.1%) in the THA-R group (5 (5.1%) vs. 9 (9.2%) (p=0.273)). The rate of abarticular pathologies (ilio-psoas irritation and greater trochanteric bursitis) was higher in the THA-C group (10 (10.8%) vs. 2 (2%) (p=0.016). Robotic acetabular assistance allowed a significantly better restitution of the horizontal position (THA-R: 1mm±4.8 [-11.7; 12.6] vs. THA-C: 4.1mm±7 [-29.6; 28] (p=0.0005)) and vertical COR (THA-R: 0.5mm±3.1 [-6; 8.3] vs. THA-C: 2mm±4.1 [-6; 14.6] (p=0.0068)). Navigated assistance of the femur did not significantly optimize the restitution of the Global Offset (THA-R: +2mm±6.4 [-16.4; 27.6] vs. THA-C: +0.5mm±7 .7 [-34; 30.2] (p=0.145)), or lower limb length (THA-R: +1.1mm±5 [-8.2; 13.5] vs. THA-C: +0.3mm±6 [-14.1; 22.5] (p=0.344). The FJS was statistically correlated with the restoration of the symmetry of the COR and the aLLD. A post-hoc power analysis confirmed sufficient potency (1-β=0.85).

pub.1174913347,"A Cost Analysis of Traditional Versus Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty Performed With an Imageless, Second-generation Robotic System.","BACKGROUND: This study compared perioperative outcomes as well as encounter and 90-day costs between patients undergoing traditional vs robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 430 TKAs (215 rTKAs, 215 traditional) were retrospectively reviewed. All rTKAs were performed with an imageless, second-generation robotic system. Cohorts were propensity score matched by age, sex, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Perioperative data and 90-day complications were subsequently compared. Cox regression analyses evaluated survival to all-cause revisions. Univariable analyses compared total cost of care for the initial encounter and 90-day postoperative period. Multivariable regression analyses were then performed to evaluate associations with increased encounter and 90-day costs.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing rTKA had a higher incidence of discharge home (86.5% vs 60.0%; <i>P</i>&lt;.001). The rTKA cohort trended toward a lower incidence of 90-day emergency department visits, and there was a significantly lower percentage of 90-day readmissions (4.2% vs 13.5%; <i>P</i>=.001). Cox hazard ratio demonstrated no difference in survival to all-cause revisions (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.5-3.7; <i>P</i>=.64). The cost of surgery was significantly higher in the rTKA cohort ($9292 vs $8392; <i>P</i>&lt;.001); however, there was no difference in cost of encounter ($10,356.86 vs $10,396.44; <i>P</i>=.110) or at 90 days postoperatively ($11,103.89 vs $11,040.13; <i>P</i>=.739). rTKA did not have a significant association with increased cost at 90 days postoperatively (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.02; <i>P</i>=.180).
CONCLUSION: rTKA had a higher intraoperative cost compared with traditional TKA. However, with increased home discharges and fewer 90-day readmissions, rTKA was not associated with increased cost at 90 days. [<i>Orthopedics</i>. 202x;4x(x):xx-xx.]."
pub.1024059624,Robotic-assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty The MAKO Experience,"Since its introduction, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty has been controversial because of poor early clinical outcomes due to implant design, bony fixation, surgical instrumentation, and technique. Improvements in surgical technique and implant design have resulted in improved results and greater survivorship. The ability to obtain accurate implant placement includes avoiding surgeon decisions leading to potential errors. These errors include alignment in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes on each prepared condyle as well as the preservation of the joint line and the resulting overall limb alignment as something critical to obtaining a successful outcome.

pub.1156908133,Posterior Compartment Debridement and Varus Deformity Correction in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Restoration of joint-line position and deformity correction remain important tenets for preserving stability and function after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We sought to characterize the role of posterior osteophytes in the correction of alignment deformity during TKA.
METHODS: We evaluated 57 patients (57 TKAs) who participated in a trial of robotic-arm assisted TKA outcomes. Weight-bearing and fixed preoperative alignment was measured using long-standing radiographs and tools of the robotic-arm tracking system, respectively. Total volume (cm<sup>3</sup>) of posterior osteophytes was quantified using preoperative planning computed tomography scans. Joint-line position was evaluated using bone resection thicknesses measured using a caliper.
RESULTS: The mean (minimum to maximum) initial fixed deformity was 4 degrees (range, 0 to 11) of varus. All patients showed asymmetric posterior osteophytes. Mean total osteophyte volume was 3 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 1 to 9). Total osteophyte volume was positively correlated with severity of fixed deformity (r = 0.48, P = .0001). Removal of osteophytes allowed for the correction of functional alignment to within 3 degrees of neutral in all cases (mean 0 degree), with none requiring release of the superficial medial collateral ligament. Tibial joint-line position was restored to within 3 millimeters in all but 2 cases (mean increase of height, 0.6 [range, -4 to +5]).
CONCLUSION: In the end-stage diseased knee, posterior osteophytes typically occupy space in the posterior capsule on the concave side of the deformity. Thorough debridement of posterior osteophytes may help facilitate management of modest varus deformity with decreased need for soft-tissue releases or adjustments to planned bone resection."
pub.1107123945,Faster return to sport after robotic-assisted lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a comparative study,"IntroductionUnicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is frequently performed on active patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis who desire a quick return to sports. The aim of this study was to compare return to sport after lateral UKA performed by robotic-assisted and conventional techniques.Materials and methodsThis retrospective study has assessed 28 lateral UKA (25 patients), 11 performed with robotic-assisted technique and 17 with conventional technique, between 2012 and 2016. The mean age was 65.5 and 59.5 years, with a mean follow-up of 34.4 months (range 15–50) and 39.3 months (range 22–68). Both groups were comparable pre-operatively. Sport habits and the details of the return to sports were assessed using University of California, Los Angeles Scale (UCLA) and direct questioning.ResultsRobotic-assisted surgical technique provided significantly quicker return to sports than conventional technique (4.2 ±1.8 months; range 1–6 vs 10.5 ± 6.7 months; range 3–24; p < 0.01), with a comparable rate of return to sports (100% vs 94%). The practiced sports after lateral UKA were similar to those done preoperatively, with mainly low- and mid-impact sports (hiking, cycling, swimming, and skiing).ConclusionRobotic-assisted lateral UKA reduces the time to return to sports at pre-symptomatic levels when compared with conventional surgical technique. The return to sports rate after surgery is high in both groups. A long-term study would provide data on the prothesis wear in this active population.Level of evidenceComparative retrospective study, Level III."
pub.1024202478,Robotic clinical trials of uni‐condylar arthroplasty,"A randomised clinical trial has been completed for uni-condylar arthroplasty. The trial, under the auspices of the UK MHRA, comprised 15 knees of patients undergoing conventional surgery, and 13 knees of patients who had robotic surgery using the Acrobot hands-on robotic system. The results of the trial were checked by comparing post-op CT scans with pre-op CT-based plans, and show a significant improvement in accuracy using the robot. The technical concept of the Acrobot approach is also described. Details of the complete system are outlined, including the pre-operative planner. The plan incorporates 3D CT models of the leg, together with CAD models of prostheses that can be used to plan the leg alignment, position the prostheses, plan the shape of the cuts required and generate the regions within which cuts must be constrained. The robotic system is also described, together with the methods for locating, clamping, cutting and monitoring the patient. An outline is given of the means by which the preoperative model is registered or aligned to the intra-operative position of the patient and of the robot, without the need for fiducial markers. Results of the randomised clinical trial are also discussed."
pub.1165576430,Improved perioperative narcotic usage patterns in patients undergoing robotic-assisted compared to manual total hip arthroplasty,"BackgroundRobot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) improves accuracy in achieving the planned acetabular cup positioning compared to conventional manual THA (mTHA), but optimal dosage for peri-RA-THA and mTHA pain relief remains unclear. This study aimed to compare pain control with opioids between patients undergoing direct anterior approach THA with the use of a novel, fluoroscopic-assisted RA-THA system compared to opioid consumption associated with fluoroscopic-assisted, manual technique.MethodsRetrospective cohort analysis was performed on a consecutive series of patients who received mTHA and fluoroscopy-based RA-THA. The average amount of postoperative narcotics in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) given to each cohort was compared, including during the in-hospital and post-discharge periods. Analyses were performed on the overall cohort, as well as stratified by opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients.ResultsThe RA-THA cohort had significantly lower total postoperative narcotic use compared to the mTHA cohort (103.7 vs. 127.8 MME; P < 0.05). This difference was similarly seen amongst opioid-tolerant patients (123.6 vs. 181.3 MME; P < 0.05). The RA-THA cohort had lower total in-hospital narcotics use compared to the mTHA cohort (42.3 vs. 66.4 MME; P < 0.05), consistent across opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients. No differences were seen in post-discharge opioid use between groups.ConclusionsFluoroscopy-based RA-THA is associated with lower postoperative opioid use, including during the immediate perioperative period, when compared to manual techniques. This may have importance in rapid recovery protocols and mitigating episode burden of care."
pub.1127869100,Better accuracy and reproducibility of a new robotically‐assisted system for total knee arthroplasty compared to conventional instrumentation: a cadaveric study,"PURPOSE: Robotically-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been shown to improve alignment and decrease outliers, an important goal in TKA procedures. The purpose of this cadaveric study was to compare the accuracy and reproducibility of a recently introduced TKA robotic system to conventional instrumentation for bone resections.
METHODS: This cadaveric study compared 14 robotically-assisted TKA with 20 conventional TKAs. Four board-certified high volume arthroplasty surgeons with no prior experience in robotics (except one) performed the procedures with three different implant systems. Angle and level of bone resections obtained from optical navigation or calliper measurements were compared to the intra-operative plan to determine accuracy. Group comparison was performed using Student t test (mean) and F test (variance), with significance at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: The robotic group demonstrated statistically more accurate results (p < 0.05) and fewer outliers (p < 0.05) than conventional instrumentation when aiming for neutral alignment. Final limb alignment (HKA) had an accuracy of 0.8° ± 0.6° vs 2.0° ± 1.6°, with 100% vs 75% of cases within 3° and 93% vs 60% within 2°. For the robotically-assisted knees, the accuracy of bone resection angles was below 0.6° with standard deviations below 0.4°, except for the femur flexion (1.3° ± 1.0°), and below 0.7 mm with standard deviations below 0.7 mm for bone resection levels.

pub.1162924472,Arithmetic hip knee angle measurement on long leg radiograph versus computed tomography—inter-observer and intra-observer reliability,"BackgroundPre-operative alignment is important for knee procedures including total knee arthroplasty (TKA), especially when considering alternative alignments. The arithmetic Hip Knee Angle (aHKA) is a measure of coronal alignment calculated using the medial proximal tibial (MPTA) and lateral distal femoral angles (LDFA). Traditionally, aHKA is measured on long leg radiographs (LLR). This study assesses the reproducibility of aHKA measurement on LLR and robotic-assisted TKA planning CT.MethodsSixty-eight TKA patients with pre-operative LLR and planning CTs were included. Three observers measured the LDFA, MPTA and aHKA three times on each modality and intra-observer and inter-observer reliability was calculated. Statistical analysis was undertaken with Pearson’s r and the Bland–Altman test.ResultsMean intra-observer coefficient of repeatability (COR) for LLR vs. CT: MPTA 3.50° vs. 1.73°, LDFA 2.93° vs. 2.00° and aHKA 2.88° vs. 2.57° for CT. Inter-observer COR for LLR vs. CT: MPTA 2.74° vs. 1.28°, LDFA 2.31° vs. 1.92°, aHKA 3.56° vs. 2.00°. Mean intra-observer Pearson’s r for MPTA was 0.93 for LLR and 0.94 for CT, LDFA 0.90 for LLR and 0.91 for CT and aHKA 0.92 for LLR and 0.94 for CT. Inter-observer Pearson’s r for LLR compared to CT: MPTA 0.93 vs. 0.97, LDFA 0.91 vs. 0.90, aHKA 0.91 and 0.95.ConclusionWhen compared to LLR, CT measurements of MPTA, LDFA and aHKA are more reproducible and have a good correlation with LLR measurement. CT overcomes difficulties with positioning, rotation, habitus and contractures when assessing coronal plane alignment and may obviate the need for LLRs."
pub.1144613421,Short-Term Benefits of Robotic Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Over Computer Navigated Total Knee Arthroplasty Are Not Sustained With No Difference in Postoperative Patient-Reported Outcome Measures,"Background: The purpose of this study was to compare early clinical and patient-reported outcomes between robotic assisted (RA) and computer navigation (CN) total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
Methods: One hundred and fifty patients were enrolled in this prospective, single-surgeon, cohort study, with 75 patients each receiving CN-TKA or RA-TKA in a consecutive series. There were no differences in patient age (<i>P</i> = .34) or body mass index (<i>P</i> = .09), but a higher proportion of males underwent RA-TKA (<i>P</i> = .03). We recorded hospital knee pain, analgesic usage, length of hospital stay, range of motion, and patient-reported outcome measures postoperatively for both patient cohorts.
Results: Hospital length of stay was shorter for the RA-TKA patients (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). RA-TKA patients showed improved range of motion (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and decreased pain scores (<i>P</i> = .006) on day 1. Subsequent days showed no significant differences. Narcotic usage was lower for the RA-TKA group on day 2 postoperatively (<i>P</i> = .03) and onwards. Total morphine equivalent dose was also significantly lower for the RA-TKA than for the CN-TKA group (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). There was no difference in Forgotten Joint Score (<i>P</i> = .24) or Oxford Knee Score (<i>P</i> = .51) between groups at 2 years postoperatively.
Conclusion: The use of RA-TKA demonstrated reduced postoperative analgesia usage and length of stay. There were no differences seen between CN-TKA and RA-TKA with respect to clinical outcomes at 2 years after surgery."
pub.1148284743,Dimensional accuracy of TKA cut surfaces with an active robotic system,"This is a study of the dimensional accuracy of the bone cut surfaces in robotic TKA. One surgeon performed robotic TKA on four cadaveric knees. A novel technique was developed for measuring the dimensional accuracy of both the femoral and tibial cut surfaces. CT scans were used to create a pre-operative plan and generate nominal cut surfaces on the 3D bone model. After TKA, the cut surfaces were then laser scanned. Two femoral components were also scanned and compared to nominal dimensions. Flatness was computed as the standard deviation between each of the cut surfaces and the best-fit plane. The angles between the five femoral best-fit planes were compared to the nominal values. The point-to-point distances between the femoral cut surfaces and the nominal cut planes were computed to estimate the bone-to-implant gap. The cut surfaces had an average flatness of 0.16 ± 0.06 mm with low variability between different cut planes. The femoral cut surfaces had average angular errors of 0.47 ± 0.39°, which are of similar magnitude as the errors found for the implants. The bone-to-implant gap was within ±1 mm for 97.9% of the surface on average. Using a novel methodology, the dimensional accuracy of an active robotic system for TKA was found to be very high for both the femoral and tibial bone cuts. Comparison studies are needed with other robotic systems as well as studies comparing manual and robotic techniques."
pub.1170814352,Restoring Hip Joint Anatomy With the Robotic Arm-Assisted System in Hip Fractures: Expanding the Applications for Hip Surgery,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has improved the life quality of osteoarthritic patients, yet challenges persist. The robotic arm-assisted system, integrated into THA, aims to refine implant positioning, enhance precision, reduce errors, and restore the hip joint's anatomy, including hip center, femoral offset, and limb length. We present the first use of the system for the treatment of a subcapital femoral neck hip fracture. A 62-year-old female suffering a left subcapital hip fracture underwent THA using the robotic arm-assisted system. After acetabular registration, accurate component placement was achieved, and a 9-mm limb length discrepancy was addressed. The patient had an unremarkable recovery with a reported Harris hip score of 96.5 at 18 months postsurgery. Robotic-guided navigation in THA, as showcased in this case, ensures accurate implant positioning by restoring the anatomical features of the hip joint. Its potential extends beyond conventional applications, hinting at future use in trauma, revision, and oncology cases. While promising, future adaptations should consider soft tissue dynamics to ensure joint stability and overall success."
pub.1160026504,Total Knee Arthroplasty in a Patient with Ipsilateral Painless Hip Arthrodesis: Technical Surgical Tips and a Novel Method for Intraoperative Navigation-Assisted Planning.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the setting of a previous ipsilateral hip fusion/arthrodesis is an uncommon and challenging procedure. There is little information available in the literature on the challenges and techniques available to perform TKA in these patients. For a traditional TKA procedure, the patient is placed in the supine position and various knee-positioning devices are used to allow for adequate knee and hip flexion, which is required for surgical exposure and tibia preparation. Ipsilateral hip arthrodesis presents two major challenges: (1) Hip flexion is crucial for adequate knee flexion while the patient is supine during the TKA procedure, and (2) the use of advanced technology, specifically computer navigation and robotic-assisted surgery techniques, is limited due to the inability to acquire the hip center of rotation during surgery, due to the lack of hip motion. Therefore, equipment and positioning must be adjusted by the surgeon to facilitate TKA in these patients. This article reports the case of a 72-year-old male patient with a long-standing, painless right hip arthrodesis, presenting with end-stage osteoarthritis of the right knee, leg-length discrepancy, and an 11.6° difference between the mechanical and anatomical axes of the femur. We describe the unique surgical planning as well as the surgical positioning options that allow for adequate knee flexion and proper surgical exposure. Furthermore, we describe a novel method of computer-assisted navigation for intra-operative planning and execution utilizing a reflected tibia as a template for the distal femoral cut."

pub.1053567618,Robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty may lead to improvement in quality‐of‐life measures: a 2‐year follow‐up of a prospective randomized trial,"PURPOSE: Despite reduction in radiological outliers in previous randomized trials comparing robotic-assisted versus conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA), no differences in short-term functional outcomes were observed. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was improvement in functional outcomes and quality-of-life (QoL) measures between robotic-assisted and conventional TKA.
METHODS: All 60 knees (31 robotic-assisted; 29 conventional) from a previous randomized trial were available for analysis. Differences in range of motion, Knee Society (KSS) knee and function scores, Oxford Knee scores (OKS), SF-36 subscale and summative (physical PCS/mental component scores MCS) were analysed. In addition, patient satisfaction, fulfilment of expectations and the proportion attaining a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in KSS, OKS and SF-36 were studied.
RESULTS: Both robotic-assisted and conventional TKA displayed significant improvements in majority of the functional outcome scores at 2 years. Despite having a higher rate of complications, the robotic-assisted group displayed a trend towards higher scores in SF-36 QoL measures, with significant differences in SF-36 vitality (p = 0.03), role emotional (p = 0.02) and a larger proportion of patients achieving SF-36 vitality MCID (48.4 vs 13.8 %, p = 0.009). No significant differences in KSS, OKS or satisfaction/expectation rates were noted.
CONCLUSION: Subtle improvements in patient QoL measures were observed in robotic-assisted TKA when compared to conventional TKA. This finding suggests that QoL measures may be more sensitive and clinically important than surgeon-driven objective scores in detecting subtle functional improvements in robotic-assisted TKA patients.

pub.1171329413,The Learning Curve From Converting From Fluoroscopic to Robotic-Assisted Direct Anterior Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) provides an alternative to fluoroscopic guidance, thus reducing radiation exposure for orthopaedic surgeons. This study was performed to assess the learning curve associated with the adoption of RA-THA using the direct anterior approach (DAA) with regard to surgical time, use of fluoroscopy, and implant placement. In addition, we compared complication rates and patient-reported outcome scores between both cohorts. A case report of an RA-THA is also presented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, non-randomized evaluation of the learning curve by assessing surgical time on a consecutive series of 89 DAA cases performed by a single surgeon. There were 53 cases that had manual THA with fluoroscopy and 36 cases with RA-THA. All cases had an acetabular component placement target of 40° inclination and 20° anteversion. An independent reviewer blinded to surgical technique used the Widmer method to measure acetabular inclination and version. Patient demographics were similar for both groups.
RESULTS: The mean surgical time for the manual fluoroscopic group was 88 ± 21 minutes and 101 ± 14 minutes for the RA-THA group. After 15 RA-THA cases, surgical time reached time neutral compared to the manual fluoroscopic group. The first 17 RA-THA cases utilized fluoroscopy to verify implant position until the surgeon became comfortable with the accuracy of the RA-THA system. After case 17, fluoroscopy was abandoned in all subsequent RA-THA cases. The mean radiation dose delivered to the surgical field was 5.61 ± 5.71 mGy. Manual THA with fluoroscopy resulted in a mean acetabular inclination of 41.3 ± 4.4° and a mean anteversion of 22.4 ± 3.0°. The RA-THA resulted in a mean acetabular inclination of 42.0 ± 4.2° and a mean anteversion of 22.3 ± 3.9°. There was no noted change in RA-THA placement accuracy after case 17, when fluoroscopy was eliminated from the surgical workflow. There were no statistical differences between the manual fluoroscopic and robotic-assisted groups with respect to complications and clinical PROM outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The DAA THA can be performed with RA-THA and achieve comparable acetabular placement without fluoroscopy. Surgical time was higher for the RA-THA group during the learning curve, but then decreased and was consistent with the manual fluoroscopic group after 15 cases."
pub.1131262259,"Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: An Assessment of Content, Quality, and Readability of Available Internet Resources","BACKGROUND: The use of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has significantly increased over the past decade. Internet content is largely unregulated and may contain inaccurate and/or misleading information about robotic TKA. Our goal was to assess the content, quality, and readability of online material regarding robotic-assisted TKA.
METHODS: We conducted an internet search for the top 50 web sites from each of the 3 most popular search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Bing) using the search term robotic total knee replacement. Each web site was assessed for content, quality, and readability. Web site quality was assessed utilizing the QUality Evaluation Scoring Tool (QUEST). Readability was assessed utilizing the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and Flesch Reading Ease Formula scores.
RESULTS: General risks of TKA were discussed in 47.2%, while benefits were discussed in 98.6% of all web sites. Inaccurate claims occurred at a significantly higher rate in physician/community hospital sources compared to university/academic web sites (59% vs 28%, P = .045). Web sites from university/academic web sites had the highest QUEST scores, while physician/community hospital sources scored the lowest (16.1 vs 10.6, P = .01). Most web sites were written at a college reading level or higher.
CONCLUSION: Patients should be counseled on the largely unregulated nature of online information regarding robotic-assisted TKA. Physicians and hospitals should consider revising the readability of their online information to a more appropriate level in order to provide accurate, evidence-based information to allow the patient to make an informed consent decision."
pub.1172858708,Comparison of the efficacy and safety of MAKO robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty versus conventional manual total knee arthroplasty in uncomplicated unilateral total knee arthroplasty a single-centre retrospective analysis,"PurposeTo compare the efficacy and safety of MAKO robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (MA-TKA) with conventional manual total knee arthroplasty (CM-TKA) in patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis (KOA) during the early postoperative period.MethodA retrospective analysis was conducted on 22 patients with KOA who underwent MA-TKA and 26 patients who underwent CM-TKA from April 2023 to July 2023. Hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), American Knee Society Score (AKSS), Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12), visual analogue scale (VAS), and postoperative complications were recorded and compared between the two groups.ResultBoth groups successfully completed the surgeries. In terms of radiographic parameters, postoperative one month LDFA and HKA in the MA-TKA group were significantly lower than those in the CM-TKA group (P < 0.05). At the one month follow-up, 19 patients (86.4%) in the MA-TKA group had an HKA less than 3°, compared to 20 patients (76.9%) in the CM-TKA group. Clinically, VAS scores at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperatively were lower in the MA-TKA group both at rest and during activity. At one month and three months postoperatively, AKSS Function Scores and FJS-12 scores in the MA-TKA group were significantly higher than those in the CM-TKA group (P < 0.05). Regarding postoperative complications, no complications occurred in the MA-TKA group, while one patient in the CM-TKA group experienced postoperative knee stiffness, which resolved after physical therapy, with no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05).ConclusionCompared with conventional manual total knee arthroplasty, MAKO robot-assisted TKA demonstrates better short-term clinical efficacy, achieves better alignment planning, and maintains good safety."
pub.1150238188,Joint gap produced by manual stress is dependent on the surgeon’s experience and is smaller in flexion in robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to retrospectively investigate (1) the reproducibility of gap measurements by manual stress using the Z-shaped retractor depending on the surgeon's experience with this maneuver and (2) the consistency of the gap distraction force produced by manual stress throughout the range of motion (ROM) in the robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It was hypothesized that the joint gap produced by manual stress is not reproducible depending on the surgeon's experience, and the distraction force applied by manual stress throughout the ROM is not constant.
METHODS: Medial and lateral joint gaps were obtained throughout the ROM by manual stress or a tensioner by two surgeons with different levels of experience in robotic-assisted TKA. The association between the differences in gap measurement by the two surgeons and the preoperative radiographic parameters, including the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle and absolute and relative varus/valgus laxities were analyzed.
RESULTS: The experienced surgeon produced significantly greater gaps than the inexperienced surgeon from 0° to 100° flexion, with a mean difference of 0.35 ± 0.12 mm in the medial gap (p < 0.0001), and from 10° to 120° flexion with a mean difference of 0.57 ± 0.13 mm in the lateral gap (p < 0.0001). The tensioner produced a significantly greater medial gap from 70° to 110° flexion with a mean difference of 0.32 ± 0.01 mm in the medial gap (p < 0.0001) and from 0° to 110° flexion with a mean difference of 1.12 ± 0.26 mm in the lateral gap (p < 0.0001). The differences in gap distance by manual stress between experienced and inexperienced surgeons were moderately correlated with the HKA angle in the lateral gap (r = 0.40, p = 0.01). The gap differences due to manual stress and a tensioner showed moderate negative correlation with the HKA angle in the medial gap (r = - 0.50, p = 0.001) and weak negative correlation with the absolute valgus laxity in the lateral gap (r = - 0.35, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The joint distraction force by manual stress may differ depending on the surgeon's experience and tended to be smaller in deep flexion; therefore, the flexion gap may be underestimated. Surgeons should determine implant positioning considering gap balance by manual stress, taking into account these characteristics of the manual stress maneuver.

pub.1136006993,"Robot‐assisted knee arthroplasty improves component positioning and alignment, but results are inconclusive on whether it improves clinical scores or reduces complications and revisions: a systematic overview of meta‐analyses","PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic overview was to identify, synthesise and critically appraise findings of meta-analyses on robot-assisted versus conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis was that robotic assistance would reduce complications and revision rates, yield better clinical scores, and improve component positioning and alignment.
METHODS: Two researchers independently conducted a literature search using Embase<sup>®</sup>, MEDLINE<sup>®</sup>, Web of Science, Allied and Complementary Medicine™ and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 2 November 2020 for meta-analyses (Level I-IV) on robotic assistance in UKA and/or TKA. Outcomes were tabulated and reported as weighted mean difference (WMD), risk ratio (RR) or weighted odds ratio (WOR), and were considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of ten meta-analyses were identified; four on robot-assisted UKA (n, 1880 robot-assisted vs. 2352 conventional UKA; follow-up, 0 to 60 months), seven on robot-assisted TKA (n, 4567 robot-assisted vs. 5966 conventional TKA; follow-up, 0 to 132 months). Of the meta-analyses on UKA, one found that robotic assistance reduced complication rates (relative risk (RR), 0.62), one found that it improved clinical scores (weighted mean difference (WMD), 19.67), three found that it extended operation times (WMD, 15.7 to 17.1 min), and three found that it improved component positioning and alignment (WMD, - 1.30 to - 3.02 degrees). Of the meta-analyses on TKA, two found that robotic assistance improved clinical scores (WMD, 1.62-1.71), two found that that it extended surgery times (WMD, 21.5-24.26 min), and five found that it improved component positioning and alignment (WMD, - 0.50 to - 10.07 degrees). None of the meta-analyses reported differences in survivorship between robot-assisted versus conventional knee arthroplasty.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted knee arthroplasty enabled more accurate component positioning and placement within target zones, but extended operation time considerably. Although robotic assistance improved component positioning, its benefits regarding clinical scores, patient satisfaction and implant survivorship remains to be confirmed. Finally, this overview revealed that six of the ten meta-analyses were of 'critically low quality', calling for caution when interpreting results.

pub.1162675776,Is the Acetabular Cup Orientation Different in Robot-Assisted and Conventional Total Hip Arthroplasty With Right-Handed Surgeons Using an Anterolateral Approach?,"Introduction Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful orthopaedic procedures. Survival rates from 90% at 10 years to 93% at 20 years have been reported in different studies. Differences in implant and patient characteristics can undoubtedly explain some of this variability observed in prosthesis durability, but the effect of surgical technique and implant orientation cannot be ignored. Therefore, many intraoperative methods (anatomic landmarks, intraoperative x-ray, fluoroscopy, navigation, and robotic surgery) have been attempted to avoid acetabular component malpositioning. Although postoperative computed tomography (CT) is accepted as the gold standard for the measurement of acetabular anteversion, it remains controversial in respect of costs and radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to examine how acetabular component orientation was affected in robotic and conventional THA operations performed by two surgeons with right-hand dominance. Material and methods The study included 113 primary THA operations performed on 113 patients between 2017 and 2022 in two groups: (i) robotic THA (Mako, Stryker Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States) (55 patients) and (ii) conventional THA (58 patients). The patients comprised 51 males and 62 females. THA was performed on 54 right-side hips and 59 left-side hips. The operations were performed by two orthopaedic surgeons, each with 20 years of arthroplasty experience, on all the patients in the lateral decubitus position with an anterolateral approach. In all the cases, the orientation of the acetabular component was 40° inclination and 20° anteversion.  Difficult THA procedures (patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), a history of hip surgery, revision THA, defect or deformity of the acetabulum, a history of scoliosis or lumbar posterior surgery, or those requiring proximal femoral osteotomy) were excluded from the study. Using the Liaw and Lewinnek methods, the acetabular component anteversion was measured on the radiographs taken in the optimal position postoperatively and the acetabular cup inclination angles were measured on the pelvis radiographs. The groups were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Pearson Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests. The limits were accepted as 40±5° for inclination and 20±5° for anteversion. Results No statistically significant difference was determined between the groups in respect of age, gender, or operated side. No statistically significant difference was determined between the optimal acetabular cup inclination angles of the robotic and conventional THA groups (p = 0.79). No statistically significant difference was determined between the optimal acetabular cup anteversion angles of the left and right conventional THA groups. Statistically significantly better results were determined in the robotic group in respect of acetabular cup anteversion (p<0,001).  Conclusion The optimal orientation of the acetabular "
pub.1021022139,Translational and rotational knee joint stability in anterior and posterior cruciate-retaining knee arthroplasty,"This study investigated passive translational and rotational stability properties of the intact knee joint, after bicruciate-retaining bi-compartmental knee arthroplasty (BKA) and after posterior cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Fourteen human cadaveric knee specimens were used in this study, and a robotic manipulator with six-axis force/torque sensor was used to test the joint laxity in anterior-posterior translation, valgus-varus, and internal-external rotation. The results show the knee joint stability after bicruciate-retaining BKA is similar to that of the native knee. On the other hand, the PCL-retaining TKA results in inferior joint stability in valgus, varus, external rotation, anterior and, surprisingly, posterior directions. Our findings suggest that, provided functional ligamentous structures, bicruciate-retaining BKA is a biomechanically attractive treatment for joint degenerative disease."
pub.1141642851,Novel robotic technology for the rapid intraoperative manufacture of patient-specific instrumentation allowing for improved glenoid component accuracy in shoulder arthroplasty: a cadaveric study,"BACKGROUND: Accurate prosthesis placement in arthroplasty is an important factor in the long-term success of these interventions. Many types of guidance technology have been described to date often suffering from high costs, complex theater integration, time inefficiency, and problems with day-to-day usability. We present a novel, intraoperative robotics platform, capable of rapid, real-time manufacture of low-cost patient-specific guides while overcoming many of the issues with existing approaches.
METHODS: A prototype robotics platform was assessed in a 24-specimen cadaveric trial during sequential simulated shoulder arthroplasty procedures. The platform consisted of a tableside robot with sterile drapes and sterile disposable components. The robot itself comprised a 3D optical scanner, a 3-axis sterile robotic drill, and a 2-axis receptacle into which the disposable consumables were inserted. The consumable was composed of a region of rapidly setting moldable material and a clip allowing it to be reversibly attached to the robot. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging was obtained for all cadaveric specimens, and a surgical plan was created focusing on glenoid component position-specifically, guidewire position to allow for accurate glenoid preparation before implant insertion. Intraoperatively, for every specimen, the relevant osseous anatomy was exposed and humeral and glenoid preparation undertaken in the usual manner. The sterile disposable was used to create a mold of the joint surface. Once set, the mold was inserted into the robot and an optical scan of the surface was undertaken followed by automatic surface registration with the CT data and surgical plan. An automatic guide hole was subsequently drilled into the molded blank, which was removed from the robot and placed back into the patient, with the melded surface ensuring exact replacement. The guidewire was then driven through the guide hole in accordance with the preoperative plan.
RESULTS: The novel robotic platform achieved average angular accuracies of 1.9° (standard deviation [SD] 1.3) version and 1.2° (SD 0.7) inclination with positional accuracy of 1.1 mm (SD 0.7) compared to a preoperative plan.
DISCUSSION: We have described a novel robotics platform that is able to reliably produce patient-specific intraoperative guides to allow for accurate guidewire placement. Guidance is provided using a portable intraoperative device. The results suggest achieved accuracy levels may be equivalent to those seen in other existing guidance technologies; however, eventual in vivo trials and analysis is required. This technology has potential transferability to improve accuracy in other areas of arthroplasty."

Human performance has limitations, especially when performing a mechanical operation in a biological environment. Recent suggested changes to improve outcomes have been large femoral heads and anterior incisions, but unfortunately neither has resulted in any scientific data that change has been effected. The scientific data does tell us that poor component positions and impingement are the source of increasing mechanical complications. Therefore, attempts to improve the surgeon’s performance by precise quantitative knowledge in the operating room have been used. We discuss robotic guided navigation as a solution. This technology provides predictable and reproducible results."
pub.1137128061,No difference of gait parameters in patients with image‐free robotic‐assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared to a conventional technique: early results of a randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: In recent studies, robotic-assisted surgical techniques for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) have demonstrated superior implant positioning and limb alignment compared to a conventional technique. However, the impact of the robotic-assisted technique on clinical and functional outcomes is less clear. The aim of this study was to compare the gait parameters of UKA performed with conventional and image-free robotic-assisted techniques.
METHODS: This prospective, single-center study included 66 medial UKA, randomized to a robotic-assisted (n = 33) or conventional technique (n = 33). Gait knee kinematics was assessed on a treadmill at 6 months to identify changes in gait characteristics (walking speed, each degree-of-freedom: flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, internal-external rotation, and anterior-posterior displacement). Clinical results were assessed at 6 months using the IKS score and the Forgotten Joint Score. Implants position was assessed on post-operative radiographs.
RESULTS: Post-operatively, the whole gait cycle was not significantly different between groups. In both groups, there was a significant improvement in varus deformity between the pre- and post-operative gait cycle. There was no significant difference between the two groups in clinical scores, implant position, revision, and complication rates.
CONCLUSION: No difference of gait parameters could be identified between medial UKA performed with image-free robotic-assisted technique or with conventional technique.

pub.1129777736,Precision and accuracy of robot‐assisted technology with simplified express femoral workflow in measuring leg length and offset in total hip arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Semi-active robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) has two options to measure the leg length discrepancy (LLD) and combined offset (CO), the 'enhanced' femoral workflow and the so-called 'express' simplified workflow. The purpose of this study was to determine the precision and accuracy of intraoperative LLD and CO measurement with express workflow robotic THA.
METHODS: Between February 2018 and December 2019, 30 patients underwent an express workflow robot-assisted primary THA for intraoperative LLD and CO measurements. Postoperative radiographs were used for LLD and CO measurement. In order to examine the accuracy of the robotic system assessment, the absolute difference between the robotic assessments and radiographic evaluations was calculated.
RESULTS: Intraoperative robotic measurements reported a mean error of 0.2-0.6 mm for each registration, with no significant difference between them (p = 0.311). The average absolute discrepancies between the robotic and radiographic assessments in the LLD and CO measurements were 1.3 ± 1.5 mm (p = 0.17) and 1.1 ± 0.9 mm (p = 0.11), respectively, while the Pearson's correlation coefficients were 0.69 and 0.71.
CONCLUSIONS: An external marker without a femoral array inserted into a screw positioned in the greater trochanter would be an easier and faster method to measure LLD and CO. Our study showed that the measured values of LLD and CO obtained by intraoperative express workflow robot-assisted THA system were precise and accurate."
pub.1135367118,Online Crowdsourcing to Explore Public Perceptions of Robotic-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery,"BACKGROUND: The clinical benefits of robotic-assisted technology in total joint arthroplasty are unclear, but its use is increasing. This study employed online crowdsourcing to explore public perceptions and beliefs regarding robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery.
METHODS: A 30-question survey was completed by 588 members of the public using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants answered questions regarding robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery, sociodemographic factors, and validated assessments of health literacy and patient engagement. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine population characteristics associated with preference for robotic technology.
RESULTS: Most respondents believe robotic-assisted surgery leads to better results (69%), fewer complications (69%), less pain (59%), and faster recovery (62%) than conventional manual methods. About half (49%) would prefer a low-volume surgeon using robotic technology to a high-volume surgeon using conventional manual methods. The 3 main concerns regarding robotic technology included lack of surgeon experience with robotic surgery, robot malfunction causing harm, and increased cost. Only half of respondents accurately understand the actual role of the robot in the operating room. Overall, 34% of participants have a clear preference for robotic-assisted surgery over a conventional manual approach. After multivariable regression analysis, Asian race, working in healthcare, early technology adoption, and prior knowledge of robotic surgery were independent predictors of preferring robotic-assisted surgery.
CONCLUSION: The public's unawareness of the dubious outcome superiority associated with robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery may contribute to misinformed decisions in some patients. Robotic-assisted technology appears to be a powerful marketing tool for surgeons and hospitals."
pub.1172858402,Advantages and limitations of mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: an overview of the literature,"INTRODUCTION: Interest in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has recently grown. Mobile bearing UKA, in which the bearing is not fixed but rather perfectly conforms with femoral and tibial components and moves completely passively between the femoral and tibial implant, has now been used for approximately half a century.
AREAS COVERED: Alongside the recognized advantages of UKA, the mobile-bearing variant benefits from an extremely low rate of polyethylene wear and tolerable minor malalignment. Revision rates for UKA have been reported to exceed those of total knee arthroplasty, but long-term survival rates and outcomes from mobile-bearing UKA have been found to be satisfactory. In addition to the lateral osteoarthritis and loosening, which are main complications of UKA, bearing dislocation is a specific complication of mobile bearing UKA. Fractures and valgus subsidence are more prevalent than in the cementless UKA. While these continue to be features to be addressed, they have been partially solved.
EXPERT OPINION: Given the manifold benefits of UKA, its application could be extended to a larger patient population. Successful outcomes rely on careful patient selection and the surgeon's extensive familiarity with the procedure. Looking ahead, the incorporation of robotic surgery, already a feature of some fixed-bearing UKAs, might shape the future trajectory of mobile-bearing UKA."
pub.1103971451,Laxity Profiles in the Native and Replaced Knee—Application to Robotic-Assisted Gap-Balancing Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The traditional goal of the gap-balancing method in total knee arthroplasty is to create equal and symmetric knee laxity throughout the arc of flexion. The purpose of this study was to (1) quantify the laxity in the native and the replaced knee throughout the range of flexion in gap-balancing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and (2) quantify the precision in achieving a targeted gap profile throughout flexion using a robotic-assisted technique with active ligament tensioning.
METHODS: Robotic-assisted, gap-balancing TKA was performed in 14 cadaver specimens. The proximal tibia was resected, and the native tibiofemoral gaps were measured using a robotic tensioner that dynamically tensioned the soft-tissue envelope throughout the arc of flexion. The femoral implant was then aligned to balance the gaps at 0° and 90° of flexion. The postoperative gaps were then measured during final trialing with the robotic tensioner and compared with the planned gaps.
RESULTS: The native gaps increased by 3.4 ± 1.7 mm medially and 3.7 ± 2.1 mm laterally from full extension to 20° of flexion (P < .001) and then remained consistent through the remaining arc of flexion. Gap balancing after TKA produced equal gaps at 0° and 90° of flexion, but the gap laxity in midflexion was 2-4 mm greater than at 0° and 90° (P < .001). The root mean square error between the planned gaps and actual measured postoperative gaps was 1.6 mm medially and 1.7 mm laterally throughout the range of motion.
CONCLUSION: Aiming for equal gaps at 0° and 90° of flexion produced equal gaps in extension and flexion with larger gaps in midflexion. Consistent soft-tissue balance to a planned gap profile could be achieved by using controlled ligament tensioning in robotic-assisted TKA."
pub.1138765971,Deep learning approach for guiding three‐dimensional computed tomography reconstruction of lower limbs for robotically‐assisted total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was performed to promote the accuracy of bone resection and mechanical alignment. Among these TKA system procedures, 3D reconstruction of CT data of lower limbs consumes significant manpower. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms applying deep learning has been proved efficient in automated identification and visual processing.
METHODS: CT data of a total of 200 lower limbs scanning were used for AI-based 3D model construction and CT data of 20 lower limbs scanning were utilised for verification.
RESULTS: We showed that the performance of an AI-guided 3D reconstruction of CT data of lower limbs for robotic-assisted TKA was similar to that of the operator-based approach. The time of 3D lower limb model construction using AI was 4.7 min. AI-based 3D models can be used for surgical planning.
CONCLUSION: AI was used for the first time to guide the 3D reconstruction of CT data of lower limbs for facilitating robotic-assisted TKA. Incorporation of AI in 3D model reconstruction before TKA might reduce the workload of radiologists."
pub.1138124999,The Use of Computer Navigation and Robotic Technology in Complex Total Knee Arthroplasty,"»: The potential benefits of computer-assisted surgical (CAS) navigation and robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) systems, such as increased reliability of restoring the mechanical axis, fewer outliers, more rapid hospital discharge, less physical therapy requirements, decreased blood loss, and decreased revision rates, have led to their application not only in primary cases but also in complex cases such as preoperative deformity and revision.
»: Early evidence demonstrates that CAS navigation may help to improve alignment in complex cases of femoral and tibial deformity and in cases of femoral bowing.
»: Data regarding deformity correction with robotic systems are similar to CAS navigation with regard to alignment, but are more limited. There are also scant data regarding revision cases and cases of previous intramedullary canal instrumentation.
»: Concerns remain regarding cost, learning curves, and operative times. There are potential long-term cost savings associated with a decrease in revisions and readmissions that require additional investigation.
»: Early evidence for the use of these emerging technologies for deformity correction and revision cases is promising, but their impact on long-term functional outcomes remains to be demonstrated. Additional well-designed comparative studies are warranted."
pub.1181864927,Intraoperative patellar tracking assessment during image-based robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: technical note and reliability study,"INTRODUCTION: Restoration of the anterior knee compartment is increasingly studied with the development of personalized surgery. However, evaluating the patellar tracking during the surgery is still subjective and at the surgeon's discretion. This study aimed 1) to describe the assessment of the patellar tracking during robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA), 2) to describe a new measurement technique for evaluating the evolution of this patellar tracking, and 3) to assess its reliability and repeatability.
METHOD: This monocentric study assessed the evolution of patellar tracking for 20 robotic-assisted TKA. The sharp probe was used to perform patellar tracking in all the arcs of knee flexion before and after the bone cuts. The patella positioning was recorded every 10° of flexion between the full extension and 90° knee flexion and was assessed in the coronal and sagittal planes. For the measurements of the patellar tracking, we used a sagittal view and a coronal view of the knee on the MAKO software. From these two views, the difference between the patellar tracking before and after the bone cuts with the definitive implants was measured. Two independent reviewers performed the measurements to assess their reliability. To determine intraobserver variability, the first observer performed the measurements twice.
RESULTS: The mean age was 68.7 years old ± 5.2 [61; 75], the mean body mass index was 28.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ± 4.2 [21.4; 36.2], the mean HKA angle was 176.3° ± 3.7° [174.1.4; 179.7]. The radiographic measurements showed very good to excellent intra-observer and inter-observer agreements (0.60 to 1.0).
CONCLUSION: This new measurement technique assessed the evolution of patellar tracking after TKA with good inter and intra-observer reliability."
pub.1169225880,Simultaneous Evaluation of Bone Cut and Implant Placement Accuracy in Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"<b>Background:</b> This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of bone cuts and implant placements, simultaneously, for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed using a system with an active robotic arm. <b>Methods:</b> Two experienced orthopaedic surgeons performed TKA on ten cadaveric legs. Computed tomography scans were performed to compare the bone cuts and implant placements with the preoperative planning. The differences between the planned and actual bone cuts and implant placements were assessed using positional and angular errors in the three anatomical planes. Additionally, the cut-implant deviations were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed to detect systematic errors in the bone cuts and implant placements and to quantify the correlations between these errors. <b>Results:</b> The root-mean-square (RMS) errors of the bone cuts (with respect to the planning) were between 0.7-1.5 mm and 0.6-1.7°. The RMS implant placement errors (with respect to the planning) varied between 0.6-1.6 mm and 0.4-1.5°, except for the femur and tibia in the sagittal plane (2.9°). Systematic errors in the bone cuts and implant placements were observed, respectively, in three and two degrees of freedom. For cut-implant deviations, the RMS values ranged between 0.3-2.0 mm and 0.6-1.9°. The bone cut and implant placement errors were significantly correlated in eight degrees-of-freedom (ρ ≥ 0.67, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> With most of the errors below 2 mm or 2°, this study supported the value of active robotic TKA in achieving accurate bone cuts and implant placements. The findings also highlighted the need for both accurate bone cuts and proper implantation technique to achieve accurate implant placements."
pub.1166536116,Acetabular cup positioning in primary routine total hip arthroplasty—a review of current concepts and technologies,"IntroductionTotal hip arthroplasty (THA) has revolutionized the treatment of hip joint arthritis. With the increased popularity and success of the procedure, research has focused on improving implant survival and reducing surgical complications. Optimal component orientation has been a constant focus with various philosophies proposed. Regardless of the philosophy, achieving an accurate acetabular position for each clinical scenario is crucial. In this paper, we review the recent developments in improving the accuracy and ideal positioning of the acetabular cup in routine primary THA.MethodologyA review of the recent scientific literature for acetabular cup placement in primary THA was performed, with available evidence for safe zones, spinopelvic relationship, preoperative planning, patient-specific instrumentation, navigation THA and robotic THA.ConclusionThough the applicability of Lewinnek safe zones has been questioned with an improved understanding of spinopelvic relationships, its role remains in positioning the acetabular cup in a patient with normal spinopelvic alignment and mobility. Evaluation of spinopelvic relationships and accordingly adjusting acetabular anteversion and inclination can significantly reduce the incidence of dislocation in patients with a rigid spine. In using preoperative radiography, the acetabular inclination, anteversion and intraoperative pelvic position should be evaluated. With improving technology and the advent of artificial intelligence, superior and more accurate preoperative planning is possible. Patient-specific instrumentation, navigated and robotic THA have been reported to improve accuracy in acetabular cup positioning as decided preoperatively but any significant clinical advantage over conventional THA is yet to be elucidated."
pub.1148731723,A Morphometric Fixed-Bearing Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Can Reproduce Normal Knee Kinematics. An In Vitro Robotic Evaluation,"Background: A new morphometric fixed-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) system has been introduced to address the anatomical patient-specific challenges. It was our hypothesis that accurate restoration of the patient-specific anatomy would restore normal knee kinematics after UKA. Therefore, we aimed in this cadaveric study to analyze the impact of a medial morphometric UKA on (1) the varus-valgus and anterior-posterior stability of the knee, (2) the knee kinematics during standardized activities of the daily living, and (3) the patellar tracking, measured using a dedicated robotic testing protocol.
Methods: Eight human knee specimens underwent full-leg computed tomography CT scanning and comprehensive robotic assessments of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics. Specimens were tested in the intact state and after implantation of a fixed-bearing medial UKA. Assessments included passive flexion, laxity testing and simulations of level walking, lunge, and stair descent.
Results: Medial and lateral joint laxity after UKA closely resembled intact laxity across the full arc of flexion. Anterior-posterior envelope of motion showed a close match between the intact and UKA groups. Net rollback and average laxity were both not statistically different. Simulation of activities of daily living showed a close match in the anterior-posterior motion profile between the medial condyle and lateral condyle. Patellar tilt and medial-lateral shift during knee flexion matched closely between groups.
Conclusion: Functional assessment of this UKA system shows nearly identical behavior to the intact knee. Fixed-bearing UKA with morphometric, compartment-specific geometry and precise mechanical instrumentation replicates complex knee balance and kinematics."
pub.1174475359,Accuracy and Outcomes of a Novel Cut-Block Positioning Robotic-Arm Assisted System for Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: The primary objective of this study was to determine the accuracy and precision of component positioning of the ROSA Robotic System for total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis systematic review was conducted using 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library) to identify all clinical and radiological studies reporting information about the use and results of the ROSA system. The criteria for inclusion were published research articles evaluating the accuracy of component positioning, learning curve, component alignment, complications, and functional outcomes in adults who underwent robotic-assisted TKA. The National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the quality of all the included studies.
Results: A total of 26 studies were assessed for eligibility, and 17 met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies reported on the accuracy and precision of component positioning. The ROSA platform for TKA had a cutting error of less than 0.6<sup>°</sup> for all coronal and sagittal parameters. Pooled analysis demonstrated accuracy within 0.61-1.87<sup>°</sup> and precision within 0.97-1.34<sup>°</sup> when the final intraoperative plan was compared to postoperative radiographs with fewer outliers. Four studies reported improved functional scores with ROSA-assisted TKA than conventional TKA within 1 year of surgery. There was no difference in overall complication rates when compared to conventional TKA.
Conclusions: The ROSA system is both highly accurate and precise, with fewer outliers when analyzed at various time points, including postoperative standing radiographs. Future studies with robust methodology and longer follow-up are required to demonstrate whether these findings have any clinical benefits in the long term."
pub.1035159579,A Comparison of Classical and Anatomical Total Knee Alignment Methods in Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty Classical and Anatomical Knee Alignment Methods in TKA,"The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes achieved using classical and anatomical alignment methods in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). One hundred and seventeen patients were randomly assigned to undergo robotic-assisted TKA using either the classical (56 patients) or the anatomical alignment method (61 patients). Clinical outcomes including varus and valgus laxities, ROM, HSS and WOMAC scores and radiological outcomes were evaluated after a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Varus and valgus laxity assessments showed no significant inter-group differences (P>0.05). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in ROM, HSS and WOMAC scores (P>0.05). We could not find any significant difference in mechanical alignment of the lower limb. The results of this study show that two alignment methods provide comparable clinical and radiological outcomes after primary TKA."
pub.1033163258,Results of total hip replacement using the Robodoc surgical assistant system: clinical outcome and evaluation of complications for 97 procedures,"BACKGROUND: A computerized robotic surgical system was developed from 1986 by the Thomas J. Watson Research Center. In 1992 the system unit Orthodoc and the milling robot Robodoc were first used on humans. We present the results achieved with Robodoc-assisted total hip arthroplasty in 97 hips.
METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 143 total hip replacements (128 patients) were performed using the Robodoc system. This is a consecutive series. Complete follow-up was possible in 97 hips at a mean follow-up period of 3.8 years.
RESULTS: Technical complications directly related to the robotic device occurred in nine cases (9.3%). The pre-operative Merle d'Aubigne score was determined at 8.1 points compared to a post-operative mean score of 16.2. There was no sign of femoral stem loosening on radiographs.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty with the Orthodoc/ Robodoc system achieves equal results as compared to a manual technique. However, there was a high number of technical complications directly or indirectly related to the robot."
pub.1105856212,Robot-assisted vs. conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Numerous advances have been made in prosthesis design, instrumentation and postoperative rehabilitation for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty; however, only 70–86% of patients are satisfied with the functional outcome and revision rates range between 10% and 20%. The primary outcome for this meta-analysis was implantation accuracy of component positioning and tibiofemoral component safe zone. A total of three randomized controlled trials (RCT), three quasi-RCTs and one prospective trial were included in this review. It was found that the use of robotic-assisted systems reduces implantation errors without an increase in adverse events. There are only a few reports about clinical outcome and long-term follow-up and whether the more accurate component positioning results in a better clinical effect or a better long-term survival of the implants is unknown."
pub.1173240258,Restoration of the anterior compartment after robotic total knee arthroplasty significantly improves functional outcome and range of motion at 1 year,"PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the functional outcomes based on restoring the anterior compartment after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 96 primary TKAs performed between 2021 and 2022. Functional positioning principles were applied using an image-based robotic-assisted system. The mean age was 69.2 ± 7.9 years. Knee Society Score (KSS), Kujala score, Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) and knee flexion were collected preoperatively and at 1 year. The depth difference between native and prosthetic trochlea was measured to assess anterior compartment restoration at full extension, 30°, 70° and 90° flexion. The global anterior compartment restoration combined the anterior compartment restoration and the patellar thickness restoration.
RESULTS: The trochlear offset was mostly understuffed after TKA compared to the native anatomy, mainly for medial and lateral condyles at 30° and 70° of flexion. The global anterior compartment restoration was understuffed in full extension (-0.7 mm ± 2), at 30° (-4.4 mm ± 2) and 70° of flexion (-3.6 mm ± 2.5). At 90°, the global anterior compartment restoration was overstuffed (2.2 mm ± 1.8). Functional scores were not significantly influenced by the anterior compartment stuffing at 0° and 30° (n.s.). The anterior compartment overstuffing at 70° and 90° was associated with decreased KSS function score (p = 0.009) and flexion (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Moderate anterior understuffing was frequently observed after TKA performed with functional positioning and an image-based robotic-assisted system. This understuffing did not influence the functional outcomes. The overstuffing of the anterior compartment led to a reduction in KSS function score and flexion measurements at 1 year.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort study."
pub.1173138269,Comparable results in total knee arthroplasty using the ROSA knee system versus the conventional technique: A retrospective propensity‐matched cohort study,"PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) is an increasingly popular alternative that may increase the accuracy of conventional TKA techniques. This study aims to evaluate RA-TKA accuracy and compare its radiographic and clinical outcomes to conventional TKA (cTKA).
METHODS: A retrospective examination of patients with bi- or tricompartmental knee osteoarthritis who underwent RA-TKA (RObotic Surgical Assistant system) or cTKA and were prospectively documented in the TKA registry. Accuracy was assessed using standardized radiographic implant position evaluations, namely femoral and tibial coronal angles and femoral and tibial sagittal angles. Baseline demographics, surgery details and 6- and 12-month post-TKA patient-reported outcomes (PROMs; e.g., Oxford Knee Score [OKS] and Core Outcome Measures Index) were compared between RA-TKA and propensity score-matched cTKA patients.
RESULTS: Overall correlation between preset and 6-week postoperative angle measurements for RA-TKA was low with significant differences noted only for mean tibial sagittal angles (84.6° [RA-TKA] vs. 82.3° [cTKA]) (p < 0.001). The study groups were demographically similar, although RA-TKA patients had slightly longer operative times and higher blood loss but shorter inpatient stays. There were sustainable improvements in all PROMs already at 6 months, yet RA-TKA patients had significantly higher OKS values over their conventional counterparts at this time point.
CONCLUSION: Radiological and clinical outcomes were comparable between RA-TKA and cTKA. The robotic-assisted system demonstrated higher accuracy in the coronal than sagittal plane and RA-TKA patients achieved better short-term outcomes for pain and disability. While both methods are similar in the hands of a skilled surgeon, long-term studies are necessary to establish clear method superiority.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, Level III."
pub.1142205097,Latest Advances in Robot-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty.,"In the longstanding pursuit of improving alignment and functional outcome in knee arthroplasty, technological evolution leading to robotic systems has now been introduced to the mainstream orthopaedic surgical world. This technology facilitates greater accuracy in implant placement, protects soft tissues, and achieves better balancing, while also allowing the potential to be more bone conserving. Robots currently in use in orthopaedic surgery can be classified into passive or haptic semi-active surgeon-guided systems. Using a virtual model of the knee joint, the robot system guides bone cuts and facilitates precise implant placement. In addition, small changes to bone resection can be made permitting deformity correction and balancing. This is achieved on-table by dynamic referencing, which enables live objective measurement of range of movements, stability, and gap balance throughout the range of motion. Preservation of ligaments and their unnecessary releases has been shown to reduce time to recovery and allow potentially better knee kinematics. Advances in robot technology in knee arthroplasty have led to the development of a variety of systems to execute the multiple steps in this procedure including using computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, plain radiographs (image based), or image-free systems. The combination of these images and on-table registering of bony landmarks allow the creation of a 3-dimensional (3D) virtual, but accurate, model of the knee during surgery. The various systems apply sculpting tools, burrs, or cutting saws to deliver the bone cuts or allow robots to guide placement of cutting blocks to ensure accurate pre-planned bone cuts. Intraoperative adjustments to bone resections can be made using a variety of tracker systems to measure joint movement and ligament balance to correct any malalignments while performing the surgery, so compound errors in the technique are avoided. Data from comparative studies suggest improved accuracy in implant placement in patients compared to conventional knee arthroplasty. Benefits of robot assistance have been demonstrated both in total knee arthroplasty and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Recent studies show a trend toward improved patient-reported outcomes and better patient satisfactions as well as earlier recoveries following robot-assisted knee arthroplasty. Early survivorship data has also shown a better survivorship with robot-assisted knee arthroplasty, although long-term survivorship data are awaited. An increase in familiarity, availability, and demand for this technology is driving innovations aimed at delivering a personalized approach to knee arthroplasty. This chapter will discuss the latest advances and look at the clinical research in relation to the robotic technological advancement comparing some of the different system approaches."
pub.1130650086,Robotic-Assisted versus Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty in a Crossover Cohort: What Did Patients Prefer?,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty represents an increasingly utilized surgical technology; however, there remains clinical question whether the technique produces improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate early clinical outcomes and patient preference of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) versus manual TKA (mTKA) in a direct crossover cohort of patients who underwent consecutive TKAs by each technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review and telephone interview was performed on 36 patients who underwent both rTKA and mTKA by a single surgeon between 2012-2018. Perioperative outcomes-complications/reoperations and patient-preferred technique-were collected with mean clinical follow up of 4.8 and 2.0 years for mTKA and rTKA, respectively.
RESULTS: mTKA were performed significantly (p<0.01) more quickly than rTKA, including shorter tourniquet time (56 versus 73 minutes) and total operating room time (93 versus 116 minutes). rTKA patients length of stay (LOS) was significantly (p<0.01) decreased (1.8 days) compared to mTKA (2.3 days). For rTKA and mTKA, respectively, there was no difference in final range of motion (119 versus 122 degrees), Visual Analog Scale (1.6 versus 0.9), or Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Jr (85 versus 87). Twenty (56%) reported rTKA as the preferred technique over mTKA.
CONCLUSION: In same patient direct comparison, rTKA required longer operative time but improved LOS compared to mTKA. There was no difference in final outcomes with only slightly more patients preferring rTKA."
pub.1167871320,Trends in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty among 138 international experienced arthroplasty knee surgeons,"Purpose: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an established option for treating isolated unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis (OA), but controversies still exist about patient selection, indications, perioperative management and alignment goals. This survey was designed to understand the current trends of experienced arthroplasty knee surgeons performing UKA.
Methods: An online questionnaire was created with SurveyMonkey<b>®</b> to assess global tendencies in the utilization of UKA. A link to the survey was shared with all ESSKA (European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy) members. The questionnaire consisted of free and multiple-choice questions and was divided into four sections: demographic information, the surgical activity of the respondents, indications for surgery and postoperative alignment goals.
Results: A total of 138 ESSKA members from 34 different countries completed the survey. A total of 81 % of the responders performed fewer than 50 UKAs per year; 53 % of UKAs represented less than 20 % of their knee replacements; 71 % used mainly or only fixed-bearing implants; 81 % performed UKA in a shorter time compared to TKA; and 61 % and 72 % were interested in custom-made UKA and robotics, respectively. Thirty-six percent considered a minimum postoperative alignment of 0° for medial UKA, and 32 % considered 10° as the maximum valgus deformity for lateral UKA. Fifty-five percent had no minimum age cut-off, 47 % had no BMI cut-off, and 57 % believed TKA was better than UKA in knees with concomitant high-grade patellofemoral OA. Approximately 50 % of the surgeons desired a coronal alignment that was the same as the predegeneration alignment.
Conclusion: A high level of agreement was reached regarding the following: preference for fixed-bearing UKAs, lower surgical time for UKA compared to TKA, interest in custom-made and robotic UKAs, no age and weight cut-off, TKA preferred in the presence of patellofemoral OA, and a final alignment goal of the predegenerative state both for medial and lateral. There was no agreement regarding length of stay, rehabilitation protocol, preoperative varus and valgus cut-off values, and treatment in cases of absence of anterior cruciate ligament or previous osteotomy."
pub.1167015938,Lower Perioperative Complication Rates and Shorter Lengths of Hospital Stay Associated With Technology-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Versus Conventional Instrumentation in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The use of technology allows increased precision in component positioning in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The objectives of this study were to compare (1) perioperative complications and (2) resource utilization between robotic-assisted (RA) and computer-navigated (CN) versus conventional (CI) TKA.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using a national database to identify patients undergoing unilateral, primary elective TKA from January 2016 to December 2019. A total of 2,174,685 patients were identified and included RA (69,445), CN (112,225), or CI (1,993,015) TKA. Demographics, complications, lengths of stay, dispositions, and costs were compared between the cohorts. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The RA TKA cohort had lower rates of intraoperative fracture (0.05 versus 0.08%, P < .05), respiratory complications (0.6 versus 1.1%, P < .05), renal failure (1.3 versus 1.7%, P < .05), delirium (0.1 versus 0.2%, P < .05), gastrointestinal complications (0.04 versus 0.09%, P < .05), postoperative anemia (8.9 versus 13.9%, P < .05), blood transfusion (0.4 versus 0.9%, P < .05), pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis (0.1 versus 0.2%, P < .05), and mortality (0.01 versus 0.02%, P < .05) compared to conventional TKA, though the cohort did have higher rates of myocardial infarction (0.09 versus 0.07%, P < .05). The CN cohort had lower rates of myocardial infarction (0.02 versus 0.07%, P < .05), respiratory complications (0.8 versus 1.1%, P < .05), renal failure (1.5 versus 1.7%, P < .05), blood transfusion (0.8 versus 0.9%, P < .05), pulmonary embolism (0.08 versus 0.2%, P < .05), and deep vein thrombosis (0.2 versus 0.2%, P < .05) over CI TKA. Total cost was increased in RA (16,190 versus $15,133, P < .05) and CN (17,448 versus $15,133, P < .05). However, the length of hospital stay was decreased in both RA (1.8 versus 2.2 days, P < .05) and CN (2.1 versus 2.2 days, P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Technology-assisted TKA was associated with lower perioperative complication rates and faster recovery."
pub.1048916120,Robotic total knee arthroplastyThe accuracy of CT-based component placement,"BACKGROUND: Accurate alignment of the components in total knee arthroplasty is important. By use of postoperative CT controls, we studied the ability of a robotic effector to accurately place and align total knee arthroplasty (TKA) components according to a purely CT-based preoperative plan.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Robotic TKA was performed in 13 patients (6 men) with primary gonarthrosis. Locator screws were placed into femur and tibia under spinal anesthesia. A CT-scan including the femoral head, knee and ankle was performed. In the preoperative planning software, virtual components were positioned into the CT volume. In a second operation, the robot milled femur and tibia with a high-speed milling tool according to the preoperative plan. On the 10th day, CT controls were performed following the same protocol as preoperatively.
RESULTS: The mean deviation of the postoperative from the preoperatively planned mechanical axis was 0.2 degrees (95% CI: -0.1 degrees to 0.5 degrees ). The accuracy of angular component placement in frontal, sagittal and transverse planes was within +/-1.2 degrees , and the accuracy of linear component placement in mediolateral, dorsoventral and caudocranial directions was within +/-1.1 mm.
INTERPRETATION: Robotic TKA allows placement of components with unparalleled accuracy, but further development is mandatory to integrate soft-tissue balancing into the procedure and make it faster, easier and cheaper."
pub.1141611680,Lengths of Stay and Discharge Dispositions after Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Comparison of Robotic-Assisted and Manual Techniques,"As evidence signifies that short-stay total knee arthroplasties (TKA) can be safe options, it is important to identify factors that contribute to early discharge. There is evidence that robotic-assisted TKAs may lead to shorter lengths of postoperative stays. However, this has not been evaluated as the primary outcome of interest in a large-scale population. The purpose of this study was to compare manual and robotic-assisted TKAs with regard to: (1) length of stay (LOS) and (2) discharge dispositions. TKAs performed between January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019, were identified. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 10,296 patients were included: 5,993 in the manual and 4,303 in the robotic-assisted group. Length of stay, discharge dispositions, and Charlson comorbidity indices (CCIs) were recorded for all patients. The mean LOS was significantly lower in robotic-assisted (1.68 ± 0.86 days) compared with manual (1.86 ± 0.94 days) TKA procedures (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001). In the robotic-assisted group, 2,049 (47.6%) were discharged in 1 day or less compared with 2,325 (38.8%) in the manual group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The proportion discharged home was significantly higher for patients who underwent robotic-assisted (91.3%) compared with manual (87.4%) TKAs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001). When comparing only patients who were discharged home and who did not have home health services, the rate was 51.8% in the robotic-assisted group compared with 44.0% in the manual group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001). The mean CCI was similar for patients who underwent robotic-assisted (2.9 ± 1.4 points) compared with manual (3.0 ± 1.5 points) TKAs. There was a trend toward shorter mean LOS for robotic-assisted versus manual TKA at 17 of the 24 included hospital sites (70.8%). Compared with manual, robotic-assisted TKAs demonstrated shorter lengths of postoperative stays and less need for skilled care after discharge. These results suggest the health care burden resulting from an upsurge of TKA procedures in our aging population might be addressed in part by increased utilization of robotic assistance."
pub.1028449260,Robotic Guidance Does Not Improve Component Position or Short-Term Outcome in Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"We performed a retrospective review in a matched group of patients on the use of robotic-assisted UKA implantation versus UKA performed using standard operative techniques to assess differences between procedures. While both techniques resulted in reproducible and excellent outcomes with low complication rates, the results demonstrate little to no clinical or radiographic difference in outcomes between cohorts. Average operative time differed significantly with, and average of 20 minutes greater in, the robotic-assisted UKA group (P=0.010). Our minimal clinical and radiographic differences lend to the argument that it is difficult to justify the routine use of expensive robotic techniques for standard medial UKA surgery, especially in a well-trained, high-volume surgeon. Further surgical, clinical and economical study of this technology is necessary."
pub.1169029570,Direct anterior approach with conventional instruments versus robotic posterolateral approach in elective total hip replacement for primary osteoarthritis: a case–control study,"BackgroundThe purpose of this study is to compare peri-operative and short-term outcomes in patients who underwent elective total hip replacement (THA) for primary osteoarthritis (OA) with direct anterior approach (DAA) versus a pair-matched cohort of patients who underwent robotic-assisted THA with posterolateral approach.Materials and methodsData from consecutive patients who underwent elective hip replacement from 2021 to 2023 for primary OA were retrospectively retrieved and divided into two groups: the DAA group, who underwent THA with the DAA approach using conventional instruments, and the robotic posterolateral (R-PL group), who underwent robot arm-assisted THA with the posterolateral approach. Comparative assessed outcomes were: operative time, radiographical implant positioning, intake of rescue analgesics, blood loss, transfusion rate, leg length discrepancy and functional outcomes (Harris hip score and forgotten joint score).ResultsA total of 100 pair-matched patients were retrieved with a mean age of 66.7 ± 10.7 (range: 32–85) years and a mean follow-up of 12.8 ± 3.6 (range: 7–24) months. No differences in patients’ characteristics were detected. Patients in the R-PL group required less rescue tramadol (p > 0.001), ketorolac (p = 0.028) and acetaminophen (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the operative time between (MD = 5.0 min; p = 0.071). Patients in the DAA group had significantly lower Hb levels at day 1 (p = 0.002) without significant differences in transfusion rate (p = 0.283). Patients in the R-PL group had shorter length of stay (LOS) with a mean difference of 1.8 days [p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–2.3]. No difference in clinical outcomes was found [leg length discrepancy (LLD), p = 0.572; HHS, p = 0.558; forgotten joint score (FJS), p = 0.629]. No radiographical differences were measured in cup inclination (MD = 2.0°, p = 0.069), malpositioning [odd ratio (OR) = 0.2; p = 0.141], stem alignment (OR = 0.3; p = 0.485) and stem sizing (OR = 1.5; p = 1.000). There was no difference in complication rate except for lateral femoral cutaneous nerve damage, which was higher in DAA group (p < 0.001).ConclusionsR-PL and DAA THA had comparable short-term clinical and radiological outcomes along with similar complication rates. The R-PL group showed significantly lower Hb drop, rescue analgesic consumption and shorter LOS. This is a preliminary study and no strong recommendation can be provided. Further prospective randomized trials are requested to further investigate the cost-effectiveness of robotic surgery in THA.Level of evidenceLevel IV, case–control study."
pub.1123449603,The learning curve of robotic-arm assisted acetabular cup positioning during total hip arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-arm assisted surgery aims to reduce manual errors and improve the accuracy of implant positioning and orientation during total hip arthroplasty (THA). The objective of this study was to assess the surgical team's learning curve for robotic-arm assisted acetabular cup positioning during THA.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 100 patients with symptomatic hip osteoarthritis undergoing primary total THA performed by a single surgeon. This included 50 patients receiving conventional manual THA and 50 patients undergoing robotic-arm assisted acetabular cup positioning during THA. Independent observers recorded surrogate markers of the learning curve including operative times, confidence levels amongst the surgical team using the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) questionnaire, accuracy in restoring native hip biomechanics, acetabular cup positioning, leg-length discrepancy, and complications within 90 days of surgery.
RESULTS: Cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis revealed robotic-arm assisted acetabular cup positioning during THA was associated with a learning curve of 12 cases for achieving operative times (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and surgical team confidence levels (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) comparable to conventional manual THA. There was no learning curve of robotic-arm assisted THA for accuracy of achieving the planned horizontal (<i>p =</i> 0.83) and vertical (<i>p =</i> 0.71) centres of rotation, combined offset (<i>p =</i> 0.67), cup inclination (<i>p =</i> 0.68), cup anteversion (<i>p =</i> 0.72), and correction of leg-length discrepancy (<i>p =</i> 0.61). There was no difference in postoperative complications between the two treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of robotic-arm assisted acetabular cup positioning during THA was associated with a learning curve of 12 cases for operative times and surgical team confidence levels but there was no learning curve effect for accuracy in restoring native hip biomechanics or achieving planned acetabular cup positioning and orientation."
pub.1113162473,Does component placement affect short-term clinical outcome in robotic-arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty?,"AIMS: The purpose of this multicentre observational study was to investigate the association between intraoperative component positioning and soft-tissue balancing on short-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing robotic-arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2013 and 2016, 363 patients (395 knees) underwent robotic-arm assisted UKAs at two centres. Pre- and postoperatively, patients were administered Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS) and Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12). Results were stratified as ""good"" and ""bad"" if KOOS/FJS-12 were more than or equal to 80. Intraoperative, post-implantation robotic data relative to CT-based components placement were collected and classified. Postoperative complications were recorded.
RESULTS: Following exclusions and losses to follow-up, 334 medial robotic-arm assisted UKAs were assessed at a mean follow-up of 30.0 months (8.0 to 54.9). None of the measured parameters were associated with overall KOOS outcome. Correlations were described between specific KOOS subscales and intraoperative, post-implantation robotic data, and between FJS-12 and femoral component sagittal alignment. Three UKAs were revised, resulting in 99.0% survival at two years (95% confidence interval (CI) 97.9 to 100.0).
CONCLUSION: Although little correlation was found between intraoperative robotic data and overall clinical outcome, surgeons should consider information regarding 3D component placement and soft-tissue balancing to improve patient satisfaction. Reproducible and precise placement of components has been confirmed as essential for satisfactory clinical outcome. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2019;101-B:435-442."
pub.1125510969,Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.,"Lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty affords excellent functional results and implant survivorship for properly selected patients. More high-quality studies are necessary to determine whether expanded indications for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty also apply to lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Operative adjuncts such as robotics, custom implants, and navigation technology hold promise in minimizing the technical burden and unfamiliarity of lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Improvements in lateral-specific implants may translate to operational efficiency and improved outcomes, but few lateral-specific implants currently exist. Mobile-bearing devices have increased rates of failure due to bearing dislocation, and further studies are warranted to evaluate this complication with newer designs. Future registry and cohort studies should show medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty separately to allow for better understanding of the nuances and technical differences between these uniquely different procedures."
pub.1131171442,MAKO CT‐based robotic arm‐assisted system is a reliable procedure for total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and radiological results of the MAKO CT-based robotic-assisted system for total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: A PRISMA systematic review was conducted using four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, GOOGLE SCHOLAR) to identify all clinical and radiological studies reporting information regarding the use and results of the CT-based robotic-assisted system to perform TKA between 2016 and 2020. The main investigated outcome criteria were postoperative pain, analgesia requirements, clinical scores, knee range of motion, implant positioning and the revision rate. The ROBINS-I tool (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions) was used to evaluate the quality of included studies and the risk of bias.
RESULTS: A total of 36 studies were identified, of which 26 met inclusion criteria. Of these 26 studies, 14 were comparative. The follow-up varied from 30 days to 17 months. This CT-based, saw cutting Robotic TKA is associated with a significantly lower postoperative pain score (2.6 versus 4.5) and with significantly reduced time to hospital discharge (77 h versus 105), compared with conventional TKA. The two comparative studies assessing functional outcomes at 1 year reported significantly better functional scores with CT-based robotic TKA compared with conventional TKA (WOMAC score: 6 ± 6 versus 9 ± 8 (p < 0.05); KSS function score: 80 versus 73 (p = 0.005)). Only three comparative studies assessed implant positioning, and these reported better implant positioning with CT-based robotic-assisted TKA.
CONCLUSION: The CT-based robotic-assisted system for TKA reduced postoperative pain and improved implant positioning with equal or slightly superior improvement of the functional outcomes at one year, compared to conventional TKA.

pub.1181478007,"AI may enable robots to make a clinical impact in total knee arthroplasty, where navigation has not!","Abstract Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is on the verge of being revolutionized by artificial intelligence (AI), which will make it possible for robots to have a clinical influence in areas where navigation systems have been rendered ineffective. Navigation has been shown to increase surgical accuracy; nevertheless, it has not been shown to provide major gains in terms of clinical outcome for the patient. On the other hand, robotic systems that are powered by artificial intelligence have the potential to improve functional outcomes, boost precision, and tailor procedures to the specific anatomy of each unique patient. Through the utilization of real‐time data and prediction algorithms, artificial intelligence‐guided robots have the potential to overcome the limits of conventional approaches, thereby establishing a new benchmark for TKA."

pub.1138846256,Improved accuracy and reproducibility of a novel CT‐free robotic surgical assistant for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared to conventional instrumentation: a cadaveric study,"PURPOSE: Alignment errors in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) predispose to premature implant loosening and polyethylene wear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a novel CT-free robotic surgical assistant improves the accuracy and reproducibility of bone resections in UKA compared to conventional manual instrumentation.
METHODS: Sixty matched cadaveric limbs received medial UKA with either the ROSA<sup>®</sup> Partial Knee System or conventional instrumentation. Fifteen board-certified orthopaedic surgeons with no prior experience with this robotic application performed the procedures with the same implant system. Bone resection angles in the coronal, sagittal and transverse planes were determined using optical navigation while resection depth was obtained using calliper measurements. Group comparison was performed using Student's t test (mean absolute error), F test (variance) and Fisher's exact test (% within a value), with significance at p &lt; 0.05.
RESULTS: Compared to conventional instrumentation, the accuracy of bone resections with CT-free robotic assistance was significantly improved for all bone resection parameters (p &lt; 0.05), other than distal femoral resection depth, which did not differ significantly. Moreover, the variance was significantly lower (i.e. fewer chances of outliers) for five of seven parameters in the robotic group (p &lt; 0.05). All values in the robotic group had a higher percentage of cases within 2° and 3° of the intraoperative plan. No re-cuts of the proximal tibia were required in the robotic group compared with 40% of cases in the conventional group.
CONCLUSION: The ROSA<sup>®</sup> Partial Knee System was significantly more accurate, with fewer outliers, compared to conventional instrumentation. The data reported in our current study are comparable to other semiautonomous robotic devices and support the use of this robotic technology for medial UKA.

pub.1162636141,Advanced technology in shoulder arthroplasty,"Background: Glenoid component positioning is an important and challenging aspect of total shoulder arthroplasty. The use of freehand technique with standard instrumentation or preoperative planning based on 2-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans provides an opportunity for improvement in terms of component accuracy, precision, and deformity correction. These techniques have produced varying outcomes.
Methods: Preoperative planning software (PPS), patient specific instrumentation (PSI), and intraoperative navigation (NAV) have been developed to improve the accuracy of implant placement and deformity correction with the ultimate goals of improved patient outcomes and implant longevity. Literature search was conducted on published and available studies comparing the accuracy of glenoid component placement and improvements in surgical and patient outcomes amongst the aforementioned techniques.
Results: PPS, PSI, and NAV have demonstrated improved accuracy over freehand techniques with standard instrumentation. However, data demonstrating the clinical benefit and cost effectiveness of these new technologies are lacking.
Discussion: In this paper, we reviewed the evidence available to answer the question of whether or not advanced shoulder arthroplasty technologies have been beneficial and reviewed future technologies in development such as virtual/mixed-reality and robotic assisted shoulder surgery.

pub.1047113435,Can Robot-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Be Cost-Effective? A Markov Decision Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a treatment option for single-compartment knee osteoarthritis. Robotic assistance may improve survival rates of UKA, but the cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted UKA is unknown. The purpose of this study was to delineate the revision rate, hospital volume, and robotic system costs for which this technology would be cost-effective.
METHODS: We created a Markov decision analysis to evaluate the costs, outcomes, and incremental cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted UKA in 64-year-old patients with end-stage unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis.
RESULTS: Robot-assisted UKA was more costly than traditional UKA, but offered a slightly better outcome with 0.06 additional quality-adjusted life-years at an incremental cost of $47,180 per quality-adjusted life-years, given a case volume of 100 cases annually. The system was cost-effective when case volume exceeded 94 cases per year, 2-year failure rates were below 1.2%, and total system costs were <$1.426 million.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted UKA is cost-effective compared with traditional UKA when annual case volume exceeds 94 cases per year. It is not cost-effective at low-volume or medium-volume arthroplasty centers."
pub.1112073290,Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty More Accurately Restored the Posterior Condylar Offset Ratio and the Insall-Salvati Index Compared to the Manual Technique; A Cohort-Matched Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the demonstrated success of modern total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it remains a procedure that involves sophisticated preoperative planning and meticulous technique to reconstruct the mechanical axis, achieve ideal joint balance, and restore maximal range-of-motion (ROM). Recently, robotic-arm assisted TKAs have emerged as a promising new technology offering several technical advantages, and it is achieving excellent radiological results, including establishing the posterior condylar offset ratio (PCOR) and the Insall-Salvati Index (ISI). Studies have demonstrated that these parameters are surgically modifiable, and their accurate restoration (fewer mean differences) correlate with improved final joint range-of-motion. However, there is a paucity of studies that evaluate these parameters in light of performing robotic-arm assisted TKA. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare: 1) PCOR and 2) ISI restoration in a cohort of patients who underwent robotic-arm assisted versus manual TKA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated a series of 43 consecutive robotic-arm assisted (mean age 67 years; range, 46 to 79 years) and 39 manual total knee arthroplasties (mean age 66 years; range, 48 to 78 years) performed by seven fellowship-trained joint reconstructive surgeons. All surgeries were performed using medial para-patellar approaches by high-volume surgeons. Using the Knee Society Radiographic Evaluation System, preoperative and four-to six-week postoperative radiographs were analyzed to determine the PCOR and patella height based on the ISI.
RESULTS: The mean postoperative PCOR was larger in manual TKA when compared to the robotic-assisted cohort (0.53 vs. 0.49; p=0.024). The absolute mean difference between pre- and postoperative PCOR was larger in manual when compared to robotic-arm assisted TKA (0.03 vs. 0.004; p=0.01). In addition, the number of patients who had postoperative ISI outside of the normal range (0.8 to 0.12) was higher in the manual cohort (12 vs. 4).
CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent TKA using robotic-arm assisted technology had smaller mean differences in PCOR which has been previously shown to correlate with better joint ROM at one year following surgery. In addition, these patients were less likely to have values outside of normal ISI, which means they are less likely to develop patella baja, a condition in which the patella would impinge onto the patellar component, leading to restricted flexion and overall decreased ROM."
pub.1148387643,A Case Report of a Subdural Hematoma following Spinal Epidural prior to a Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Introduction: This case report adds to current literature on management of a subdural hematoma following total knee arthroplasty and is particularly important as joint replacement moves into outpatient surgery centers where the orthopedic surgery team becomes the sole patient contact point. <i>Case Presentation</i>. A 66-year-old male presented to the emergency department five days after elective robotic-assisted left total knee arthroplasty performed with spinal epidural with the symptoms of a persistent nonpostural headache. CT of the head revealed a small bifrontal acute subdural hematoma. He was admitted for overnight monitoring as a precaution. No vascular abnormalities or underlying pathology was found on further advanced imaging. He was discharged the following morning after follow-up CT showed no focal changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) one month later confirmed resolution of the subdural hematoma.
Conclusion: Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of the signs and symptoms, as well as the risk factors for subdural hematomas following lumbar puncture, as it is a rare, but potentially life-threatening complication of spinal epidural."
pub.1141517329,"Early outcomes after robotic arm-assisted bi-unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared with total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized controlled trial","AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of robotic arm-assisted bi-unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (bi-UKA) with conventional mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA) during the first six weeks and at one year postoperatively.
METHODS: A per protocol analysis of 76 patients, 43 of whom underwent TKA and 34 of whom underwent bi-UKA, was performed from a prospective, single-centre, randomized controlled trial. Diaries kept by the patients recorded pain, function, and the use of analgesics daily throughout the first week and weekly between the second and sixth weeks. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were compared preoperatively, and at three months and one year postoperatively. Data were also compared longitudinally and a subgroup analysis was conducted, stratified by preoperative PROM status.
RESULTS: Both operations were shown to offer comparable outcomes, with no significant differences between the groups across all timepoints and outcome measures. Both groups also had similarly low rates of complications. Subgroup analysis for preoperative psychological state, activity levels, and BMI showed no difference in outcomes between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Robotic arm-assisted, cruciate-sparing bi-UKA offered similar early clinical outcomes and rates of complications to a mechanically aligned TKA, both in the immediate postoperative period and up to one year following surgery. Further work is required to identify which patients with osteoarthritis of the knee will derive benefit from a cruciate-sparing bi-UKA.

pub.1145143566,Comparative Cost Analysis of Four Different Computer-Assisted Technologies to Implant a Total Knee Arthroplasty over Conventional Instrumentation,"Several computer-assisted technologies, such as navigation and robotics, have been introduced to Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) in order to increase surgical precision and reduce complications. However, these technologies are often criticized due to the increased costs and effort associated with them; however, comparative data are missing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate differences in intraoperative workflows and the related perioperative cost-profiles of four current computer-assisted technologies, used to implant a TKA, in order to gain a comparison to conventional instrumentation. For the cost analysis, additional preoperative imaging and instruments, increased operating room (OR) and planning-time, and expenditures for technical support of the equipment and disposals were calculated, in comparison to conventional TKA, for (1) standard computer-navigation, (2) patient specific instruments (PSI), (3) image-based robotic assistance, and (4) imageless robotic assistance. Workflows at four expert centers which use these technologies were reviewed by an independent observer. The total cost calculation was based on a 125 TKA per year unit in Switzerland. Computer-navigation resulted in 14 min (+23%) increased surgery time and, overall, USD 650 in additional costs. PSI technology saved 5 min (8%) OR time but it created USD 1520 in expenditures for imaging and disposals. The image-based robotic system was the most expensive technology; it created overall additional costs of USD 2600, which predominately resulted from technical support, disposals, the CT-Scan, and 14 min of increased OR time. The imageless robotic assistance resulted in the largest increase in OR-time, as it resulted in an additional 25 min (+42%) on average. Overall, additional costs of USD 1530 were calculated. Every one of the assistive technologies in this study increased the total cost of TKA when compared to a conventional technique, and the most important variables, related to cost, were technical support and additional disposables. The longer surgical times and additional surgical trays required for the techniques had a marginal effect on overall costs. This comparative cost analysis gives valuable information for future efforts to calculate the real costs of these technologies and the subsequent return on investment of each technique."
pub.1175436846,The Influence of Preimplant Balancing on Manipulation under Anesthesia Rates following Imageless Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Acquired idiopathic stiffness (AIS) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often requires manipulation under anesthesia (MUA). Robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) systems provide gap balance templates for objective correlation with the rate of AIS. The purpose of this study was to assess intraoperative balancing parameters that were associated with MUA utilizing an ""anatomical"" implant design.We performed a retrospective chart review of 265 imageless RA-TKA procedures performed by R.M. and K.D. between 2018 and 2020. The primary outcome for AIS or clinically significant ""arthrofibrosis"" was MUA. Patient intraoperative gap planning data were examined for association.The rate of MUA was 8.7% (23/265), which was performed at a mean follow-up time of 75.9 ± 32.2 days. The lateral to medial gap difference in extension was significantly less in patients requiring MUA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.99) (<i>p</i> = 0.034). Significantly less preoperative varus mechanical axis was associated with knees requiring MUA (1.83° vs. 4.04°, OR = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.00-1.19). Decreased templated mechanical axis correction was associated with MUA (2.09° vs. 4.75°, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).A tighter lateral-to-medial gap in extension, less preoperative varus, and smaller templated mechanical axis corrections were associated with increased rates of MUA."
pub.1168218967,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty improves implant position and early functional recovery for the knee with severe varus/valgus deformity,"PurposeRobotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (r-TKA) facilitates precise bone resection and lower limb alignment, yet accuracy and functional recovery for severe varus/valgus deformity is not well-documented. The aim of study was to investigate whether r-TKA improves implant alignment in the coronal and sagittal view and early functional recovery compared to conventional TKA(c-TKA).MethodsThis comparative study included 86 patients with symptomatic knee arthritis who underwent primary TKA at our institution between 1st May and 31th November 2021. Radiological parameters evaluated included hip-knee-ankle angle (HKAA), femoral varus-valgus angle (FVVA), tibial varus-valgus angle (TVVA), posterior tibial slope angle (PTSA), femoral sagittal angle (FSA), posterior condylar offset ratio, and Insall-Salvati index. Operative time, stay length, and complications were reviewed from patient records. The hospital for special surgery (HSS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and knee joint motion range were evaluated at the six-month follow-up.ResultsThe c-TKA and r-TKA groups had no significant differences in HKAA (179.73 ± 3.76°, range: 172.10-188.90° vs. 180.53 ± 2.91°, range: 173.30-188.32°, p = 0.277), FVVA (96.13 ± 2.61°, range: 90.27-101.52° vs. 96.38 ± 2.23°, range: 90.98-100.95°, p = 0.636), and TVVA (88.74 ± 2.03°, range: 83.75–92.74° vs. 89.43 ± 1.83°, range: 85.32–94.15°, p = 1.000). Outlier of mechanical alignment incidence (> 3°) was significantly lower in r-TKA compared with c-TKA, 17.50% (7/40) vs. 41.30% (19/46), (p = 0.017). PTSA of r-TKA remained significantly lower than c-TKA (p = 0.009) in mild-deformity patients. For severe varus/valgus deformity, r-TKA had a significantly lesser HKAA-outlier incidence (p = 0.025), PTSA-outlier incidence (p = 0.019), and lower PTSA (p < 0.001) compared with c-TKA. The r-TKA functional outcome was better than c-TKA regarding HSS (93.12 ± 1.97, range: 90–95, 95%CI:92.11–94.13 vs. 91.33 ± 2.50, range: 85–95, 95%CI:90.20-92.69, p = 0.036), and VAS (0.24 ± 0.44, range:0–1 vs. 0.72 ± 0.75, range:0–2, p = 0.026), knee joint flexion (118.53° ± 8.06, range: 105–130°, 95%CI:114.39-122.67° vs. 112.22 ± 8.09°, range: 100–130°, 95%CI:108.20-116.24° ,p = 0.027) for severe varus/valgus deformity.Conclusionr-TKA improved lower-limb coronal alignment, sagittal implant position, and early functional recovery for patients with severe varus/valgus deformity of the knee. r-TKA did not confer substantial advantages over c-TKA in both radiological and clinical outcomes for the mild varus/valgus deformity."

RESULTS: The postoperative femoral rotation angle (FRA) was -0.72 ± 2.59° in the robot-assisted group and 1.13 ± 2.73° in the conventional group, and were statistically significantly different (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that the RA-TKA provides more precise control of FRA than CON-TKA, and verifies that tibial rotation angle and combined rotation angle affect postoperative knee pain and functional evaluation."
pub.1160235703,Robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty is not associated with increased risk of postoperative deep vein thrombosis,"PURPOSE: Prolongation of operation time due to registration and pin insertion has been reported with robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA), and there has been concern about an increase in the postoperative incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In this study, we compared the incidence of DVT after RATKA with that after conventional manual TKA (mTKA).
METHODS: This consecutive retrospective series included 141 knees that underwent primary TKA using the Journey II system. The CORI robot was used. There were 60 RATKAs and 81 mTKAs. Doppler ultrasound was performed in all patients on postoperative day 7 to determine whether DVT was present.
RESULTS: The operation time was longer in the RATKA cohort (99.5 min vs 78.0 min, p < 0.001). The overall incidence of DTV was 43.9% (62/141 knees), all of which were asymptomatic. There was no significant difference in incidence of DVT between RATKA and mTKA (50.0% vs 39.5%, p = 0.23). Use of the robot did not affect the incidence of DVT following TKA (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.40-2.60; p = 0.96).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of DVT was not significantly different between RA-TKA and mTKA. Multiple logistic regression indicated that RATKA is not associated with increased risk of postoperative DVT.

pub.1153577804,A review of advances in image-guided orthopedic surgery,"Orthopedic surgery remains technically demanding due to the complex anatomical structures and cumbersome surgical procedures. The introduction of image-guided orthopedic surgery (IGOS) has significantly decreased the surgical risk and improved the operation results. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), augmented reality (AR) and robotics in image-guided spine surgery, joint arthroplasty, fracture reduction and bone tumor resection. For the pre-operative stage, key technologies of AI and DL based medical image segmentation, 3D visualization and surgical planning procedures are systematically reviewed. For the intra-operative stage, the development of novel image registration, surgical tool calibration and real-time navigation are reviewed. Furthermore, the combination of the surgical navigation system with AR and robotic technology is also discussed. Finally, the current issues and prospects of the IGOS system are discussed, with the goal of establishing a reference and providing guidance for surgeons, engineers, and researchers involved in the research and development of this area."
pub.1172776124,Complications and Learning Curve Associated with an Imageless Burr-Based (CORI) Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty System: Results from First 500 Cases,"BackgroundThe use of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) is gaining traction. There is evidence to suggest that RA-TKA can help to optimize the precision and accuracy of implant positioning and that there may be protective effects on surrounding bony and soft tissues. Yet, there are important differences between the various RA-TKA systems currently on the market. One such newly introduced RA-TKA system uses imageless technology and performs bony cuts with the use of a burr-based device. The learning curve and complications unique to this system have yet to be assessed.MethodsWe evaluated 500 consecutive RA-TKA cases using a newly developed burr-based and imageless system which were done by a single surgeon between the months of October 2021 and February 2023. Operative times were recorded and compared to the previous 150 conventional TKA cases allowing for the learning curve to be calculated using the CUSUM method. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were categorically profiled.ResultsThe learning curve of this RA-TKA system was found to be 6 cases. Intraoperative complications included unintended bony over resection (n = 3), soft tissue injury (n = 2), and robotic system hardware (n = 2) or software (n = 2) malfunction. Postoperative complications consisted of superficial pin site infection (n = 1) and periprosthetic fracture near the pin sites (n = 1). There were no identified cases of prosthetic joint infection, instability events, or wound complications.ConclusionsThe learning curve and the complication profile of a newly introduced imageless and burr-based RA-TKA system were described. This information serves to guide surgeons in adopting this technology and can counsel them regarding the potential pitfalls and challenges associated with its integration into practice. The work sheds light on the complexity and learning curve of the recently released imageless burr-based RA-TKA system. This important information is intended to help surgeons accept this cutting-edge technology by providing advice on any errors and difficulties that can occur when integrating it into clinical practice. This information can help surgeons navigate the complexities of integrating this new burr-based robotic technology into knee replacement procedures, enabling them to make well-informed decisions and receive guidance."
pub.1084249235,Radiological Comparison and Functional Outcomes of Robotic Assisted Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty with Metal-Backed Onlay Tibial Components,"Robotic surgery studies have been increasing considering operative advantages on reducing error and improving functional success in partial knee arthroplasty. We have been curious whether planning and application of knee implants assisted robotically correspond to their radiological outcomes. Moreover, we were also curious about functional outcomes.  Methods: Data were prospectively collected in 42 patients (62 knees) who underwent MAKOplasty, robotic assisted unicondylar medial knee arthroplasty, between June 2013 – December 2015 For evaluation of components’ accuracy, intra-operative robotic analyses were compared with post-operative radiographic alignment. Statistical analysis was done on these values using paired T-Test. Additionally in our clinic with an average follow-up time of 22 months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with American Knee Society Scoring (AKSS) System.   Results: Difference between intra-operative robotic plans and post-operative radiographs was evaluated for the flexion angle of the femoral component, posterior slope of the tibial component and the varus angle of the tibial component. A novel method is used to evaluate the varus angle of the tibial component. All of the errors are <=0.5°, approximately 86% of the errors are <=0.3° while 18% of errors are zero. No significant difference was observed statistically (paired t-test, p<0.05). Post-operatively all 42 patients had excellent knee scores (mean, 99.67) and functional scores (mean, 99.04) on AKSS while pre-operatively 2 were scored fair, 40 were score poor, and functionally 14 were scored fair and 28 were scored poor.   Conclusion: The difference between robotic plans and radiographic outcomes was statistically not significant where metal-backed onlay tibial components were used. "
pub.1165064676,Comparison of conventional and robotic knee arthroplasty results: A retrospective observational study,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether a standard anesthetic protocol consisting of combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) in conjunction with controlled hypotensive anesthesia (CHA), which was used for conventional total knee arthroplasty (cTKA), could provide equally effective anesthetic conditions for robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA).
METHODS: Data were collected from the medical records of 113 patients (median age=67 years; age range=55-84) who underwent elective unilateral cTKA (n=52) or rTKA (n=61) without a tourniquet from 2021 to 2023. The primary outcome measure was the rate of patients whose anesthetic method did not provide adequate motor and sensory block during the surgery and had to be converted to general anesthesia. The secondary outcome measure was to compare perioperative variables, including pain scores, analgesic consumption, blood loss, transfusions, and complications.
RESULTS: In 6 patients (11.5%) in group rTKA, it was required to convert CSEA to general anesthesia at 160-180 minutes due to the pain at the operative knee and/or to the movement of the operative leg during surgery compared to none / zero in group cTKA (P=.008). Motor and sensory blocks terminated earlier than the total surgery time in those patients. Mean total surgery time was significantly higher in group rTKA than in group cTKA (151.25 ± 24.51 (120-240) minutes vs. 116.72 ± 4.99 (105-125) minutes, P < .001). Total surgery times tended to decrease gradually in group rTKA after the 11th case, indicating a learning curve for surgical performance. Conversion to general anesthesia was required only in 1 patient after the 11th case compared to the previous 5 patients. Mean pain scores and rescue analgesic consumption were higher in group rTKA at postoperative 0 hour and between 0 and 4 hours (P < .05) but similar at the following time points (P > .05). Blood loss, transfusion, and complication rates were similar (P > .05). Hospital discharge times were higher in group rTKA (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Although our standard CSEA protocol failed due to the regression of motor and sensory block during surgery in 11.5% of patients in rTKA, the CSEA technique combined with controlled hypotensive anesthesia provided similar anesthetic conditions in the remaining patients in group rTKA as in group cTKA. The CSEA may be considered an effective and safe anesthetic method for rTKA if interventions are applied to extend the duration of the CSEA for this novel surgical technique.

pub.1136925009,Use of Fulcrum Positioning as a Balancing Tool During Total Knee Arthroplasty on a Robotic Platform,"Total knee arthroplasty is a common procedure performed to improve pain and dysfunction attributed to arthritis, yet postoperative patient dissatisfaction rates remain relatively high. Patient satisfaction and outcomes have been linked to successful joint gap balancing in the coronal and sagittal planes intraoperatively. In previously described balancing techniques, the fulcrum used for alignment changes is customarily centered on the intramedullary axis generating symmetric changes in medial and lateral gaps. We propose a novel technique in the literature that, with the use of robotic-arm assisted technology or similar systems, allows manipulation of the fulcrum center of rotation during pre-resection planning and intraoperative gap establishment before bony cuts to asymmetrically influence medial and lateral, flexion and extension gaps to aid in balancing during total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1154898607,Functional Alignment Philosophy in Total Knee Arthroplasty—Rationale and Technique for the Valgus Morphotype Using an Image Based Robotic Platform and Individualized Planning,"Functional alignment (FA) is a novel philosophy to deliver a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that respects individual bony and soft tissue phenotypes within defined limitations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the rationale and technique of FA in the valgus morphotype with the use of an image-based robotic-platform. For the valgus phenotype the principles are personalized pre-operative planning, reconstitution of native coronal alignment without residual varus or valgus of more than 3°, restoration of dynamic sagittal alignment within 5° of neutral, implant sizing to match anatomy, and achievement of defined soft tissue laxity in extension and flexion through implant manipulation within the defined boundaries. An individualized plan is created from pre-operative imaging. Next, a reproducible and quantifiable assessment of soft tissue laxity is performed in extension and flexion. Implant positioning is then manipulated in all three planes if necessary to achieve target gap measurements and a final limb position within a defined coronal and sagittal range. FA is a novel TKA technique that aims to restore constitutional bony alignment and balance the laxity of the soft tissues by placing and sizing implants in a manner that respects variations in individual anatomy and soft tissues within defined limits."
pub.1150188715,Is combined robotically assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction a good solution for the young arthritic knee?,"Abstract
PurposeAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency can be a consequence or a cause of femoro-tibial osteoarthritis (OA). Several studies have published satisfactory outcomes of unicompartimental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and combined ACL reconstruction despite its absence classically being considered a contraindication. A major challenge in the ACL deficient knee is obtaining appropriate gap balancing and limb axis. Robotically assisted UKA allows for precise control of these factors; however, it’s utilisation as a tool with combined ACL reconstruction and UKA has not been described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of robotically assisted UKA with combined ACL reconstruction.MethodsThis was a retrospective single-centre study of ten patients operated by a single surgeon from 2016 to 2020. All surgery was performed using a cemented fixed bearing UKA prosthesis (Journey uni, Smith and Nephew®) (8 medial, 2 lateral) inserted with the assistance of an image-free robotic-assisted system (BlueBelt, Navio, Smith and Nephew®). All ACL reconstructions were performed using hamstring autograft. Clinical assessment included International Knee Score (IKS) score, Tegner score and patient satisfaction. Radiological assessment was performed to assess radiolucent lines, progression of OA in the other compartments, Hip-Knee-Ankle angle and Posterior Tibial Slope.ResultsThere were eight females (80%), mean age was 57 ± 7 [48–70], mean BMI was 26 ± 3 [22–31]. The mean follow-up was 45 months ± 13 months [24–66]. Mean post-operative IKS knee and function score were respectively 96 ± 4.5 [88–100] and 93 ± 8.2 [74–100], mean Tegner score was 4.5 ± 1.4 [3–6]. Nine patients (90%) returned to sport; one patient (10%) was dissatisfied because of residual pain preventing a return to a desired level of sport. 100% of the radiological objectives were achieved. No radiolucent lines were seen at the last follow-up. There were two re-operations (20%) for stiffness requiring arthroscopic arthrolysis at two and three months respectively following surgery, with full recovery of the flexion at the last follow-up in both cases. No other complications were observed.ConclusionRobotic UKA associated with ACL reconstruction provides satisfactory early patient outcomes and accurate implant positioning. The first results in terms of return to sports were promising."
pub.1170247533,Which way forward? Comparing radiological outcomes using three different surgical approaches in robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy and precision of acetabular component placement in robot-assisted surgery total hip arthroplasty (RAS-THA) using three different approaches.
METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing the Trex RS Hip 1.0 robot navigation system across different surgical approaches. It involved 145 patients treated at three Chinese medical centers from June 2021 to July 2022. Patients with end-stage joint disease were randomly assigned to either the RAS or control group. Acetabular component positioning was evaluated radiographically, and registration accuracy was measured using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
RESULTS: The overall RMSE was 0.72 mm (SD = 0.24 mm), indicating consistent accuracy regardless of surgical approach. Significant variations in anteversion were noted across groups (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Lateral RAS-THA showed enhanced precision. The RAS Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) group had the least deviation in the rotation center's horizontal distance (0.89 ± 1.14 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.0014) and minimal leg length discrepancy (2.41 ± 1.17 mm). The RAS DAA approach also produced more consistent results.
CONCLUSION: Robotic assistance in THA, especially via the DAA approach, enhances the accuracy and precision of acetabular component positioning. Consistent registration accuracy across various surgical approaches confirms the reliability of these methods for THA.

pub.1173506376,The role of subcutaneous fat and BMI in predicting surgical outcomes and patient reported outcomes in robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"Background: The purpose of this study was to assess if subcutaneous fat (SCF) or BMI is a predictor of surgical complications and patient reported outcomes in patients undergoing robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA).
Methods: Patients who underwent robotic-assisted primary THAs at one institution between 2018 and 2020 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Prior to surgery, computed tomography (CT) was used to measure SCF in the posterolateral quadrant of the hip. SCF was measured 3 centimeters (cm) proximal to the greater trochanter (PGT) and 3 cm inferior to the distal tip of the greater trochanter (DGT).Measurements were normalized to the size of the patient's bony anatomy by dividing the subcutaneous fat area measurement by the transverse diameter of the femur 10 cm inferior to the tip of the greater trochanter. Patients were divided into quintiles determined by SCF distribution around the mean (groups 1-5) and BMI (BMI<25, BMI 25-29.9, BMI 30-34.9, BMI 35-39.9, and >40). Ninety day outcomes and PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System) scores were acquired from the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative (MARCQI) database preoperatively, at 14-112 days post-operative and at the latest follow up.
Results: There were 175 patients identified with a mean age of 63.83 years (range 27-89) and a mean BMI of 30.73kg/m2 (range 18.2-48.4). Interclass correlation coefficient was greater than 0.9 in all PGT, DGT, and GT measurements. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) found there was a significantly shorter time from incision to closure in quintiles 1 and 3 when compared to the SCF quintile 5 (p<0.05) and that there was a significantly shorter time from incision to closure in BMI categories 1, 2, and 3 when compared to BMI category 5 (BMI > 40). There were no differences between SCF and BMI as predictive of length of stay, transfusion status, infection, or PROMIS scores.
Conclusion: It can be concluded that hip SCF on axial CT images can reliably measure SCF and is predictive of time from incision to closure, but it does not show a significant difference in predicting the length of stay, infection, or PROMIS scores when compared to BMI."
pub.1147687679,5‐Year Survivorship and Outcomes of Robotic‐Arm‐Assisted Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Purpose: While unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has demonstrated benefits over total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in selected populations, component placement continues to be challenging with conventional surgical instruments, resulting in higher early failure rates. Robotic-arm-assisted UKA (RA-UKA) has shown to be successful in component positioning through preop planning and intraop adjustability. The purpose of this study is to assess the 5-year clinical outcomes of medial RA-UKA.
Methods: This study was a retrospective review of a single-center prospectively maintained cohort of 133 patients (146 knees) indicated for medial UKA from 2009 to 2013. Perioperative data and 2- and 5-year Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Score (WOMAC), and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) outcome measures were collected. Five-year follow-up was recorded in 119 patients (131 knees).
Results: Mean follow-up was 5.1 ± 0.2 years. Mean age and BMI were 68.0 ± 8.1 years and 29.3 ± 4.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. At 2-year follow-up, mean KOOS, WOMAC, and FJS were 71.5 ± 15.3, 14.3 ± 7.9, and 79.1 ± 25.8, respectively. At 5-year follow-up, mean KOOS, WOMAC, and FJS were 71.6 ± 15.2, 14.2 ± 7.9, and 80.9 ± 25.1, respectively. Mean change in KOOS and WOMAC was 34.6 ± 21.4 and 11.0 ± 13.6, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 and <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). For patient satisfaction at last follow-up, 89% of patients were very satisfied/satisfied and 5% were dissatisfied. For patient activity expectations at last follow-up, 85% met activity expectations, 52% were more active than before, 25% have the same level of activity, 23% were less active than before, and 89% were walking without support. All patients returned to driving after surgery at a mean 15.2 ± 9.4 days. Survivorship was 95% (95% CI 0.91-0.98) at 5 years. One knee (1%) had a patellofemoral revision, two knees (1.3%) were revised to different partial knee replacements, and five knees (3.4%) were converted to TKA.
Conclusion: Overall, medial RA-UKA demonstrated improved patient-recorded outcomes, high patient satisfaction, met expectations, and excellent functional recovery. Midterm survivorship was excellent. Longitudinal follow-up is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes of robotic-arm-assisted UKA procedures."
pub.1163730361,Robotic Arm-assisted versus Manual (ROAM) total knee arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial,"Aims: The primary aim was to assess whether robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) had a greater early knee-specific outcome when compared to manual TKA (mTKA). Secondary aims were to assess whether rTKA was associated with improved expectation fulfilment, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and patient satisfaction when compared to mTKA.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken, and patients were randomized to either mTKA or rTKA. The primary objective was functional improvement at six months. Overall, 100 patients were randomized, 50 to each group, of whom 46 rTKA and 41 mTKA patients were available for review at six months following surgery. There were no differences between the two groups.
Results: There was no difference between rTKA and mTKA groups at six months according to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) functional score (mean difference (MD) 3.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.6 to 13.1); p = 0.425). There was a greater improvement in the WOMAC pain score at two months (MD 9.5 (95% CI 0.6 to 18.3); p = 0.037) in the rTKA group, although by six months no significant difference was observed (MD 6.7 (95% CI -3.6 to 17.1); p = 0.198). The rTKA group were more likely to achieve a minimal important change in their WOMAC pain score when compared to the mTKA group at two months (n = 36 (78.3%) vs n = 24 (58.5%); p = 0.047) and at six months (n = 40 (87.0%) vs n = 29 (68.3%); p = 0.036). There was no difference in satisfaction between the rTKA group (97.8%; n = 45/46) and the mTKA group (87.8%; n = 36/41) at six months (p = 0.096). There were no differences in EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) utility gain (p ≥ 0.389) or fulfilment of patient expectation (p ≥ 0.054) between the groups.
Conclusion: There were no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences in the change in WOMAC function between mTKA and rTKA at six months. rTKA was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving a clinically important change in knee pain at two and six months, but no differences in knee-specific function, patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life, or expectation fulfilment were observed."
pub.1145702582,Early Superior Clinical Outcomes in Robotic-Assisted TKA Compared to Conventional TKA in the Same Patient: A Comparative Analysis,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has demonstrated improved alignment and outcome scores when compared with manual total knee arthroplasty (M-TKA); however, few studies compare differences in the same patient. This study is a retrospective review that assesses clinical outcomes of 36 patients who underwent a primary RA-TKA and had undergone a prior contralateral M-TKA. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon at the same institution. Patients were assessed for differences in hospital length of stay, improvement in pre- versus postoperative range of motion, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores. Student's <i>t</i>-test and Fisher's exact test were utilized to detect significant differences. Patient demographics showed a mean age of 64.5, 24 females (67%), and mean body mass index of 35.1 ± 5.7. The average follow-up time was 2.9 years for M-TKA and 1.3 years for RA-TKA. Hospital length of stay was decreased by 5.5 hours for RA-TKA (<i>p</i> = 0.03). Total postoperative WOMAC score was not statistically different between RA-TKA and M-TKA (<i>p</i> = 0.061); however, pain and stiffness components were statistically improved in RA-TKA (<i>p</i> = 0.041 and <i>p</i> = 0.007), respectively. KOOS was higher in RA-TKA, which approached statistical significance (<i>p</i> = 0.005). Pre- versus postoperative knee flexion improved significantly in both cohorts. There was a significant difference in pre- versus postoperative range of motion at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up after RA-TKA in comparison to M-TKA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). There were no postoperative complications. Patients who underwent RA-TKA demonstrated early improvement at 1-year follow-up in pain, stiffness, and knee flexion when compared with their prior contralateral M-TKA. There was a significant decrease in postoperative length of stay by 5.5 hours in the RA-TKA group. Limitations include a small sample size and differences in follow-up times between RA-TKA and M-TKA."
pub.1172532244,Computed tomography radiomics in predicting patient satisfaction after robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"PurposeAfter robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) surgery, some patients still experience joint discomfort. We aimed to establish an effective machine learning model that integrates radiomic features extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans and relevant clinical information to predict patient satisfaction three months postoperatively following RA-TKA.Materials and methodsAfter careful selection, data from 142 patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 99) and a test set (n = 43), approximately in a 7:3 ratio. A total of 1329 radiomic features were extracted from the regions of interest delineated in CT scans. The features were standardized using normalization algorithms, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was employed to select radiomic features with ICC > 0.75 and P < 0.05, generating the Rad-score as feature markers. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was then used to screen clinical information (age, body mass index, operation time, gender, surgical side, comorbidities, preoperative KSS score, preoperative range of motion (ROM), preoperative and postoperative HKA angle, preoperative and postoperative VAS score) as potential predictive factors. The satisfaction scale ≥ 20 indicates patient satisfaction. Finally, three prediction models were established, focusing on radiomic features, clinical features, and their fusion. Model performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves and decision curve analysis.ResultsIn the training set, the area under the curve (AUC) of the clinical model was 0.793 (95% CI 0.681–0.906), the radiomic model was 0.854 (95% CI 0.743–0.964), and the combined radiomic-clinical model was 0.899 (95% CI 0.804–0.995). In the test set, the AUC of the clinical model was 0.908 (95% CI 0.814–1.000), the radiomic model was 0.709 (95% CI 0.541–0.878), and the combined radiomic-clinical model was 0.928 (95% CI 0.842–1.000). The AUC of the radiomic-clinical model was significantly higher than the other two models. The decision curve analysis indicated its clinical application value.ConclusionWe developed a radiomic-based nomogram model using CT imaging to predict the satisfaction of RA-TKA patients at 3 months postoperatively. This model integrated clinical and radiomic features and demonstrated good predictive performance and excellent clinical application potential."
pub.1169011499,Robot-assisted partial knee replacement versus standard total knee replacement (RoboKnees): a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundTotal knee arthroplasty is a common surgery for end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Partial knee arthroplasty is also a treatment option for patients with arthritis present in only one or two knee compartments. Partial knee arthroplasty can preserve the natural knee biomechanics, but these replacements may not last as long as total knee replacements. Robotic-assisted orthopedic techniques can help facilitate partial knee replacements, increasing accuracy and precision. This trial will investigate the feasibility and assess clinical outcomes for a larger definitive trial.MethodsThis is a protocol for an ongoing parallel randomized pilot trial of 64 patients with uni- or bicompartmental knee arthritis. Patients are randomized to either receive robot-assisted partial knee arthroplasty or manual total knee arthroplasty. The primary outcome of this pilot is investigating the feasibility of a larger trial. Secondary (clinical) outcomes include joint awareness, return to activities, knee function, patient global impression of change, persistent post-surgical pain, re-operations, resource utilization and cost-effectiveness, health-related quality of life, radiographic alignment, knee kinematics during walking gait, and complications up to 24 months post-surgery.DiscussionThe RoboKnees pilot study is the first step in determining the outcome of robot-assisted partial knee replacements. Conclusions from this study will be used to design future large-scale trials. This study will inform surgeons about the potential benefits of robot-assisted partial knee replacements.Trial registrationThis study was prospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT04378049) on 4 May 2020, before the first patient was randomized."
pub.1145229216,Accuracy of Intraoperative Mechanical Axis Alignment to Long-Leg Radiographs following Robotic-Arm–Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Improper alignment and implant positioning following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been shown to lead to postoperative pain and increase the incidence of revision procedures. The use of robotic-arm assistance for UKA (RAUKA) has become an area of interest to help overcome these challenges. The accuracy of intraoperative alignment compared with standing long-leg X-rays postoperatively following medial RAUKA has been in question. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to (1) determine final mean intraoperative coronal alignment in extension utilizing an image based intraoperative navigation system, and (2) compare final intraoperative alignment to 6-week weight-bearing (WB) long-leg X-rays. Patients who underwent RAUKA for medial compartmental osteoarthritis were identified from January 1, 2018, to August 31, 2019, through our institution's joint registry. The query yielded 136 (72 right and 64 left) patients with a mean age of 72.02 years and mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.65 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who underwent RAUKA. Final intraoperative alignment was compared with WB long leg X-rays 6 weeks postoperatively by measuring the mechanical alignment. Statistical analysis was primarily descriptive. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between intraoperative alignment to 6-week alignment. A <i>p-</i>value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mean intraoperative coronal alignment after resections and trialing was 4.39 varus ± 2.40 degrees for the right knee, and 4.81 varus ± 2.29 degrees for the left knee. WB long-leg X-rays 6 weeks postoperatively demonstrated mechanical axis alignment for the right and left knees to be 3.01 varus ± 2.10 and 3.7 varus ± 2.38 degrees, respectively. This resulted in a change in alignment of 1.36 ± 1.76 and 1.12 ± 1.84 degrees for the right and left knees, respectively (<i>p</i> <i>&lt;</i> 0.05). Pearson's correlation coefficient demonstrated a correlation of 0.69 between intraoperative to long-leg-X-ray alignment. RAUKA demonstrates excellent consistency when comparing postoperative WB long-leg X-rays to final intraoperative image-based non-WB alignment."
pub.1156288615,Long-term study of functional outcomes of robotic assisted medial UKA using mid-vastus approach in a high-volume centre,"Robotic UKA is one of the recent advancement in surgical management for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Over the years, there have been many studies which have showed results of various conventional UKA, high tibial osteotomy and even robotic uka for medial OA of knee all over the world. But still there is very less work on long-term outcome-based analysis of functional outcomes of robotic assisted medial UKA using mid-vastus approach, which was the aim of the study. A total of 680 patients with medial OA knee that were undergone robotic assisted UKA. The study was done at tertiary teaching institute and hospital from November 2016 to October 2022. The assessment of pain, clinical–functional assessment, walking ability, range of motion were assessed by KSS, SF-12 at pre-operatively, mid-term follow-ups and at final follow-up −5.03(± 0.52) years after surgery. 680 patients suited for medial UKA in our study with mean age of 65 ± 10.6 years. Average operating time was 42 ± 4.7 min. The mean postoperative KSS was 93 ± 4.3, the mean SF-12 was 49 ± 9.1, 55 ± 8.7 for PS and MS, respectively. The patient had better KSS and SF-12 when compared pre-operatively and final follow-up (p −0.012 and -9.320, p −0.017 and −7.475, p −0.014 and −5.196, p −0.021 and −7.418, respectively). Complications were also very less. Robotic UKA using mid-vastus approach is effective treatment for medial compartmental OA knee. On short/long-term follow-up of patients, functional and radiological outcomes were good with few complications rates."
pub.1160038979,Prediction of early functional outcomes in patients after robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a nomogram prediction model,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) is becoming more and more popular as a treatment option for advanced knee diseases due to its potential to reduce operator-induced errors. However, the development of accurate prediction models for postoperative outcomes is challenging. This study aimed to develop a nomogram model to predict the likelihood of achieving a beneficial functional outcome. The beneficial outcome is defined as a postoperative improvement of the functional Knee Society Score (fKSS) of more than 10 points, 3 months after RA-TKA by early collection and analysis of possible predictors.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study on 171 patients who underwent unilateral RA-TKA at our hospital. The collected data included demographic information, preoperative imaging data, surgical data, and preoperative and postoperative scale scores. Participants were randomly divided into a training set ( N =120) and a test set ( N =51). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to screen for relevant factors. Variance inflation factor was used to investigate for variable collinearity. The accuracy and stability of the models were evaluated using calibration curves with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, consistency index and receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: Predictors of the nomogram included preoperative hip-knee-ankle angle deviation, preoperative 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale score, preoperative fKSS score and preoperative range of motion. Collinearity analysis with demonstrated no collinearity among the variables. The consistency index values for the training and test sets were 0.908 and 0.902, respectively. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.908 (95% CI 0.846-0.971) in the training set and 0.902 (95% CI 0.806-0.998) in the test set.
CONCLUSION: A nomogram model was designed hereby aiming to predict the functional outcome 3 months after RA-TKA in patients. Rigorous validation showed that the model is robust and reliable. The identified key predictors include preoperative hip-knee-ankle angle deviation, preoperative visual analogue scale score, preoperative fKSS score, and preoperative range of motion. These findings have major implications for improving therapeutic interventions and informing clinical decision-making in patients undergoing RA-TKA."
pub.1126708922,Computer-Assisted Navigation in Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has successfully treated end-stage knee osteoarthritis for several years. However, recent technological advancements have enabled surgeons to perform TKA with more accuracy and precision. Aligning the femoral and tibial components perpendicular to the mechanical axes of the femur and tibia is a fundamental principle for restoring knee kinematics and soft-tissue balance. Computer-assisted robotic TKA has proven its ability to fine tune lower leg alignment, component position, and soft-tissue balancing. Furthermore, robotic-assisted TKA (RATKA) offers the additional benefit of improving soft-tissue protection compared to manual techniques. Numerous systems have been developed in the advancement of technology in computer processing, and the number of robotic surgical systems is increasing as well. The three main categories of navigation systems can be classified as: image-based console navigation, imageless console navigation, and accelerometer-based handheld navigation systems. The purpose of this review was to describe emerging technologies for TKA. Specifically, we outline the available literature pertaining to each system with regards to their: (1) accuracy and precision of component alignment; (2) soft-tissue protection; (3) postoperative outcomes; and (4) other reported outcomes such as costs."
pub.1139354915,Femorotibial alignment measured during robotic assisted knee surgery is reliable: radiologic and gait analysis,"PurposeFemorotibial alignment is crucial for the outcome of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Robotic-assisted systems are useful to increase the accuracy of alignment in UKA. However, no study has assessed if the femorotibial alignment measured by the image-free robotic system is reliable. The aim of this study was to determine whether measurement of the mechanical femorotibial axis (mFTA) in the coronal plane with handheld robotic assistance during surgery is equivalent to a static measurement on radiographs and to a dynamic measurement during walking.MethodsTwenty patients scheduled for robotic-assisted medial UKA using handheld technology were included in this prospective study. Three measurements of the frontal femorotibial axis were compared: intra-operative acquisition by computer assistance (dynamic, non-weightbearing position), radiographic measurements on long leg X-ray (static, weightbearing position), and by gait analysis during walking (dynamic, weightbearing position).ResultsThere was no significant difference in the mFTA between computer (174.4 ± 3.4°), radiological (173.9 ± 3.3°), and gait analysis (172.9 ± 5.1°) measurements (p = 0.5). There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.6577355, p = 0.0016) between robotic-assisted measurements and gait analysis.ConclusionThere was no significant difference in the femorotibial axis measured by the image-free robotic assistance, from the preoperative radiographs or by gait analysis. The reliability of intra-operative measurements of the frontal femorotibial axis by these robotic-assisted systems is acceptable."
pub.1153941587,The Association of Patient and Procedural Factors on Improved Outcomes: A Cluster Analysis on 853 Total Knee Arthroplasty Patients,"Many studies involving robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) have demonstrated superiority regarding soft tissue balance and consistency with alignment target achievement. However, studies investigating whether RATKA is associated with improved patient outcomes regarding physical function and pain are also important. Therefore, we performed a cluster analysis and examined factors that contributed to differences in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Specifically, we analyzed: (1) reduced WOMAC (rWOMAC) scores regarding pain and function; (2) usage of RATKA; (3) common patient comorbidities; as well as (4) patient demographic factors. The rWOMAC score is an abbreviated PROM that includes pain and physical function domains. This study analyzed 853 patients (95 conventional and 758 robotic-assisted) who had completed preoperative, 6-month, and 1-year postoperative rWOMAC surveys. Two clusters were constructed using rWOMAC pain and function scores at 1 year. Cluster 1 included 753 patients who had better outcomes at 1 year (mean rWOMAC pain = 0.9, mean rWOMAC function = 1.4), and cluster 2 included 100 patients who had worse outcomes at 1 year (mean rWOMAC pain = 7.7, mean rWOMAC function = 10.4). The clusters were compared to determine (1) how scores improved and (2) what patient characteristics were significantly different between clusters. Cluster 1 demonstrated greater improvement from preoperative to 6 months or 1 year (<i>p</i> = 0.0013 for pain preoperative to 6 months, <i>p</i>&lt; 0.0001 for other measures) and 6 months to 1 year (<i>p</i>&lt; 0.0001). Comparisons demonstrated that cluster 1 had older patients (67 vs. 65 years, <i>p</i> = 0.0479) who had lower body mass index or BMIs (31.8 vs. 33.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.0042) and no significant differences in sex (<i>p</i> = 0.7849). Cluster 1 also had a significantly higher percentage of RATKA patients (90 vs. 79%, <i>p</i>&lt; 0.001). Cluster analyses provided differentiating factors which were associated with improved postoperative rWOMAC pain and function scores at 1 year. Patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA were associated with better rWOMAC pain and function scores from preoperative to 6 months and 1 year."
pub.1137817906,Imageless robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty leads to similar 24‐month WOMAC scores as compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty: a retrospective cohort study,"PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) was introduced to improve limb alignment, component positioning, soft-tissue balance and to minimize surgical outliers. This study investigates perioperative outcomes, complications, and early patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of one imageless RA-TKA system compared to conventional method TKA (CM-TKA) at 24-month follow-up.
METHODS: This multi-surgeon retrospective cohort analysis compared 111 imageless RA-TKA patients to 110 CM-TKA patients (n = 221). Basic demographic information, intraoperative and postoperative data, and PROMs, including the functional score of the Knee Society Score (KSS-FS), The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Short Form 12 Mental and Physical scores (SF-12M and P), were collected and recorded preoperatively, at 3-, 12- and 24-months postoperatively. Range of motion (ROM), estimated blood loss (EBL), surgical duration, and complications were also collected.
RESULTS: There were no baseline patient demographic differences between groups. EBL (240 vs. 190 mL, p < 0.001) and surgical duration (123 vs. 107 min, p < 0.001) were significantly greater in RA-TKA. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications, ROM, length of stay (LOS), and PROMs between cohorts at 3-, 12-, 24-months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Imageless RA-TKA is associated with greater EBL and surgical duration compared to CM-TKA. However, at 24-month follow-up, there were no significant differences in ROM, LOS, complications and PROMs between cohorts. Imageless robotic surgery leads to similar 24-month clinical outcomes as compared to CM-TKA.

pub.1109830199,Cognitive Training for Robotic Arm-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty through a Surgical Simulation Mobile Application,"Advances in mobile device technology combined with the implementation of surgical simulation have led to the development of novel applications (apps) as a potential learning tool for surgical trainees. Touch Surgery (TS) (Kinosis Limited, London, United Kingdom) is a mobile-based app that combines cognitive task analysis with a virtual reality medium to familiarize the user with a surgical procedure through interactive rehearsal. The purpose of this study was to compare the educational efficacy of the TS app with a traditional paper-based learning program in performing a robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Twelve participants (four interns, four residents, four adult reconstructive fellows) were randomized to a paper-based technique guide or learning modules from the Mako Partial Knee (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ) TS app. Trainees were subjected to a baseline pretest. After preparing with the allocated training tool, participants completed an immediate posttest followed by a retention test administered 3 weeks later. The TS simulation group demonstrated greater improvement (22% score increase; <i>p</i> = 0.001) in posttest assessment compared with the control group (10% score increase; <i>p</i> = 0. 09). The TS simulation group demonstrated better information recall compared with the control group based on the score differential following the 3-week retention test. This randomized comparative study demonstrated that the TS app was better than traditional paper-based learning for both immediate posttest performance and long-term information recall of the Mako robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Surgical simulation apps may be an effective learning tool for surgical trainees."
pub.1175919365,"Effect of tibia‐first, restricted functional alignment technique on gap width changes, and component positioning in robotic arm‐assisted total knee arthroplasty","PURPOSE: This study aims to quantitatively assess the predictability of post-resection gap dimensions and the attainment of balanced gaps using robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 100 consecutive patients who underwent robotic arm-assisted TKA for knee osteoarthritis using a restricted functional alignment (FA) technique. Tibial cuts were performed based on preoperative tibial anatomy within predefined boundaries, followed by femoral component adjustments according to tensioned soft tissues to optimise gap balance. The primary outcome was the proportion of balanced gaps, defined as differential laxities of ≤2 mm, across extension, flexion, lateral, and medial gap measurements. Ligament balancing in lateral and medial compartments was assessed using a robotic system at 10° and 90° flexion to evaluate if restricted FA facilitated a balanced knee. Secondary outcomes included implant alignment, resection depth, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
RESULTS: Significant increases in both lateral and medial gaps at 10° and 90° flexion were observed following tibial and femoral bone resections (p < 0.001). At extension, average gap changes were 0.9 mm (lateral) and 1.6 mm (medial) after tibial cuts, and 0.5 mm (lateral) and 1.2 mm (medial) after femoral cuts. At 90° flexion, changes were 0.3 mm (lateral) and 1.7 mm (medial) following tibial cuts, and 1.0 mm (lateral) and 1.4 mm (medial) after femoral cuts. Despite these variations, the tibia-first, gap-balancing technique achieved overall balance in 98% of gap measurements. The tibial component was placed at an average of 2.1° varus, while the femoral component was positioned at 0.3° varus and 1.3° external rotation relative to the surgical transepicondylar axis. Significant improvements in PROMs were noted between preoperative and one-year postoperative evaluations (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The tibia-first, restricted FA technique achieved a well-balanced knee in 98% of cases, despite inconsistent gap increments observed between initial assessments and post-resection.

pub.1173977980,"Postoperative Complications and Readmission Rates in Robotic-Assisted Versus Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty: Large, Propensity Score-Matched Patient Cohorts.","INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of research comparing postoperative complication rates between manual total knee arthroplasty (M-TKA) and robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA). This study aims to compare 90-day postoperative complication, readmission, and emergency department rates between RA-TKA and M-TKA.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a multihospital database identified patients who underwent TKA between January 2016 and May 2023. Surgeons who used the robotic-assisted surgery technique in <10% or >90% of their cases annually were excluded. This resulted in 15,999 cases (8,853 RA-TKAs; 7,146 M-TKAs) from 282 surgeons. RA-TKA and M-TKA cohorts were one-to-one matched based on patient sex, age, body mass index, hospital setting, surgeon experience, primary payer, and anesthesia type. Each cohort consisted of 7,146 patients (N = 14,292). 90-day revisits, specifically readmissions, readmissions with >23 hours of observation, and ED visit rates were compared between cohorts. Complications were classified according to the Clinical Classification Software schema and compared between cohorts. Mann-Whitney U, chi-squared, and Fisher exact tests, along with Bonferroni correction, were used to statistically compare cohorts.
RESULTS: All-cause 90-day readmission rates were 2.4% for RA-TKA and 2.6% for M-TKA (P = 0.36). RA-TKA had fewer revisits (RA-TKA: 7.8%; M-TKA: 8.8%, P = 0.027) and rates of readmission with >23 hours of observation (RA-TKA: 1.4%; M-TKA: 2.0%, P = 0.003). RA-TKA had fewer hospital revisits due to joint stiffness (RA-TKA: 17 revisits; M-TKA: 42 revisits, P = 0.002) and chronic pain (RA-TKA: 1 revisit; M-TKA: 8 revisits, P = 0.039). Fewer readmissions were observed for acute injuries (lower extremity muscle/tendon strains) in the RA-TKA cohort (RA-TKA: 1; M-TKA: 9, P = 0.021). RA-TKA had fewer ED visits due to hematomas (RA-TKA: 0 visits; M-TKA: 7 visits, P = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective matched cohort analysis, RA-TKA was associated with markedly fewer revisits and readmissions with >23 hours of observation compared with M-TKA. No differences in all-cause 90-day readmission were observed between cohorts.

pub.1142558076,Short-Term Outcomes of Robotic Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: An Indian Perspective,"BackgroundLateral UKA is a technically more challenging procedure than medial UKA accounting for < 1% of all knee arthroplasties. Robotic UKA for lateral compartment arthritis is rare and has not been reported in India.Materials and MethodsThis is a prospective single-centre clinical study of six patients (five females and one male) who underwent robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA (RALUKA) between May 2018 and January 2020 with patient-specific 3D-CT preoperative plan. Overall satisfaction on a five-level Likert scale, clinical outcome based on the KOOS and MFJS and radiological outcomes based on the HKA axis, femorotibial angle (FTA), tibial posterior slope (PS) obtained were compared preoperatively and postoperatively.ResultsAt a mean follow-up period of 23.84 months, among six patients 33.3% very satisfied, 50% satisfied and 16.7% felt neutral. The mean KOOS changed from 63.03 ± 3.52 to 93.95 ± 3.25 and the mean MFJS was 75.41 ± 10.29 postoperatively. The mean HKA axis changed from 175.81° ± 2.88 valgus to 179.99° ± 2.14 neutral alignment. The mean correction attained was from 4.19° ± 2.88 valgus deformity to 0.01° ± 2.14. The mean FTA and the mean PS changed from 7.34° ± 4.14 of valgus to 1.92° ± 1.85 of valgus and 83.44° ± 1.77 to 85.38° ± 2.10, respectively.ConclusionsThe mean preoperative and postoperative KOOS showed a statistical significance with a p value of < 0.001 (< 0.05), showing significant improvement with RALUKA.

This is a case report on our experience with a CT-based robotic tactile guidance system for unicompartmental knee replacement in a patient with combined medial compartment degenerative joint disease and subchondral defect of the medial femoral condyle. Using the TGS in this case, an exact burring process of the femoral cavity adjacent to the subchondral defect resulted in accurate burring of the cavity depth and width, while preservation of the surrounding supporting bony boundary was possible."
pub.1137189011,Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Reduces Components' Positioning Differences among High- and Low-Volume Surgeons,"Robotic-assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (mUKA) has been introduced to improve accuracy in implant positioning and limb alignment, overcoming the reported high failure rates of conventional UKA. Indeed, mUKA is a technically challenging procedure strongly related to surgeons' skills and expertise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the likelihood of robotic-assisted surgery in reducing the variability of coronal and sagittal component positioning between high- and low-volume surgeons. We evaluated a prospective cohort of 161 robotic mUKA implanted between May 2018 and December 2019 at two high-volume robotic centers. Patients were divided into two groups: patients operated by ""high-volume"" (group A) or ""low-volume"" (group B) surgeons. We recorded intraoperative lower-limb alignment, component positioning, and surgical timing. Postoperatively, every patient underwent a radiographical protocol to assess coronal and sagittal femoral/tibial component alignment. Range of motion and other clinical outcomes were assessed pre- and 12 months postoperatively by using oxford knee score, forgotten joint score, and visual analog scale. Of 161 recruited knees, 149 (A: 101; B: 48) were available for radiographic analysis at 1 month, and clinical evaluation at 12 months. No clinical difference neither difference in mechanical alignment nor coronal/sagittal component positioning were found (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). A significant difference was recorded in surgical timing (A: 57 minutes; B: 86 minutes; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). No superficial or deep infections or other major complications have been developed during the follow-up. Robotics surgery in mUKA confirmed its value in improving the reproducibility of such technical procedure, with satisfactory clinical outcomes. Moreover, it almost eliminates any possible differences in component positioning, and lower limb alignment among low-and high- volume knee surgeons."

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were queried from 1994-2021 for articles comparing radiographic outcomes between RA-THA and mTHA cohorts. A meta-analysis was conducted whenever sufficient data was present for common outcomes.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 20 articles reporting on 4140 patients (RA-THA: n = 1228; mTHA: n = 2912). No differences were demonstrated for acetabular inclination or anteversion. However, RA-THA demonstrated higher rates of cup orientation within the Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones, improved femoral stem alignment, and lower global offset difference (GOD) and limb length discrepancy (all p-values <0.05). Superior femoral canal fill and combined offset were seen among RA-THA patients.
CONCLUSION: Our review found that the use of RA-THA yields superior radiographic outcomes compared to mTHA counterparts. This information can inform healthcare systems considering investing in and implementing these technologies."
pub.1031885263,Computer-assisted and Robotic Surgery in Orthopedics,"Successful outcomes after orthopedic surgical procedures are believed to be highly dependent on reproducible anatomic accuracy. Immediate intraoperative feedback helps surgeons to achieve this accuracy as has been demonstrated with the use of fluoroscopy. Non-image-based computer navigation has been used in joint arthroplasty, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, high tibial osteotomy, and cartilage procedures along with applications in hip and shoulder arthroscopy. Most short-term studies have demonstrated superior accuracy when compared with conventional techniques; however, very few studies have shown better clinical outcomes. Robotic-assisted surgery has been most popular in total and unicompartmental arthroplasty, which again has greater accuracy but similar clinical outcomes when compared with conventional techniques. Economic analyses indicate that these high-cost technologies may only be cost-effective in high-volume centers. Other studies have shown that computer navigation improves the accuracy of lower volume surgeons to a greater degree than higher volume surgeons allowing the former to have results similar to the latter. "
pub.1079100479,Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgery in Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"Complications following total hip arthroplasty (THA), such as dislocation, component loosening and wear, continue to be common indications for revision surgery. Multiple studies have attributed some of these problems to poor acetabular cup alignment and placement outside of the purported radiographic safe zone. In addition, it has been shown that conventional manually performed acetabular cup placement may not lead to optimal alignment, regardless of surgical experience. Additionally, incorrect leg length and offset can lead to dissatisfaction and instability. Therefore, robotic-arm assisted surgery has been introduced to improve accuracy of cup placement and leg length, and to offset with the aim of reducing the risk of hip instability and improving satisfaction after primary THA. Our aim was to prospectively review the use of robotic-arm assisted surgery in 224 patients and to assess whether the pre-operatively determined radiographic targets were achieved post-operatively and the proportion of acetabular cups outside of the safe zone. Pre-determined anteversion and inclination were 15 and 40 degrees, respectively. Our results have shown that the use of robotic-arm assisted surgery resulted in a post-operative mean inclination of 40 degrees (range, 34 to 51 degrees) and a mean anteversion of 16 degrees (range, 9 to 25 degrees). Ninety-nine percent of the patients remained within the pre-designated safe zone. Evidence has shown that robotic-arm assisted surgery may have improved accuracy in cup placement when compared to conventional surgery and possibly to computer-assisted surgery. When compared to the literature on robotic-arm assisted surgery, our results were comparable. We believe that this surgical technique may aid in reducing post-operative THA complications, such as aseptic loosening and dislocations, but further prospective studies are needed to evaluate clinical outcomes and long-term results.

pub.1140355413,Does robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have lower complication and revision rates than the conventional procedure? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on patients who underwent unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to compare the complication rates, revision rates and non-implant-specific complications between robotic-assisted and conventional UKA.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were searched up to 30 June 2020.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Case-control studies comparing robotic-assisted and conventional UKA.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data from all eligible articles were independently extracted by two authors. We analysed the differences in outcomes between robotic-assisted and conventional UKA by calculating the corresponding 95% CIs and pooled relative risks (RRs). Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ<sup>2</sup> and I<sup>2</sup> tests. All analyses were performed using the 'metafor' package of R V.3.6.2 software.
RESULTS: A total of 16 studies involving 50 024 patients were included in the final meta-analysis. We found that robotic-assisted UKA had fewer complications (RR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.96, p=0.036) and lower revision rates (RR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.86, p=0.017) than conventional UKA. We observed no significant differences in non-implant-specific complications between the two surgical techniques (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.04, p=0.96). No publication bias was found in this meta-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that robotic-assisted UKA has fewer complications and lower revision rates than conventional UKA; however, owing to important limitations, the results lack reliability, and more studies are required.

pub.1012654176,Causes and Patterns of Aborting a Robot-Assisted Arthroplasty,"For a successful robot-assisted arthroplasty, every step should be executed harmoniously. However, when we encounter serious obstacles during surgery, it is sometimes better to abort the procedure in a timely manner. This study investigated the possible causes and patterns of aborted robot-assisted arthroplasties. Of 100 consecutively planned robot-assisted arthroplasties, 22 cases were aborted. Most involved total knee arthroplasty (21/22 cases). We classified the causes according to the stage at which they occurred and the type of error. Abortions after starting the milling procedure and abortions due to an interactive factor were the most common. We believe that this study can guide surgeons to effective decision making during robot-assisted arthroplasty."
pub.1042779133,Rigid Patient Positioning is Unreliable in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no study has assessed the ability of rigid patient positioning devices to afford arthroplasty surgeons with ideal acetabular orientation throughout surgery. The purpose of this study is to use robotic arm-assisted computer navigation to assess the reliability of pelvic position in total hip arthroplasty performed on patients positioned with rigid positioning devices.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of 100 hips (94 patients) underwent robotic-guided total hip arthroplasty in the lateral decubitus position from the posterior approach, 77 stabilized by universal lateral positioner, and 23 by peg board. Before reaming, computed tomography-templated computer software generated true values of pelvic anteversion and inclination based on the position of the robot arm registered to the patient's preoperative pelvic computed tomography.
RESULTS: Mean alteration in anteversion and inclination values was 1.7° (absolute value, 5.3°; range, -20° to 20°) and 1.6° (absolute value, 2.6°; range, -8° to 10°), respectively. And 22% of anteversion values were altered by >10° and 41% by >5°. There was no difference between hip positioners used (P = .36). Anteversion variability was correlated with body mass index (P = .02).
CONCLUSION: Despite the use of rigid patient positioning devices-a lateral hip positioner or peg board-this study reveals clinically important malposition of the pelvis in many cases, especially with regard to anteversion. These results show a clear need to pay particular attention to anatomic landmarks or computer-assisted techniques to assure accurate acetabular cup positioning. Patient positioning should not be solely trusted."

METHODS: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic review was conducted using 4 databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science) to identify all clinical studies that investigate clinical or radiological outcomes using RATKA. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist for cohort studies was employed for critical appraisal and evaluation of all 22 studies that met the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: All studies reviewed determined that knee arthroplasty improved clinical outcomes. Twelve studies found statistically better clinical outcomes with RATKA compared with conventional TKA, whereas 9 studies found no difference. One study did not assess clinical outcomes. When assessing radiological outcomes, 14 studies reported that RATKA resulted in more consistent and accurate postoperative mechanical alignment, whereas 2 studies reported no difference. Six studies did not assess radiological outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Although knee arthroplasty is one of the most commonly performed orthopedic operations, the level of patient satisfaction varies. The meta-analyses conducted in our systematic review shows that RATKA results in greater improvements in postoperative Hospital for Special Surgery score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities scores compared to conventional TKA. Furthermore, it shows that RATKA results in more accurate postoperative alignment of prostheses. These together can explain the improved postoperative outcomes. More randomized controlled trials must be conducted before this technique is integrated into routine clinical practice."
pub.1142921901,[ROBOTICS- WHY NOW?],"INTRODUCTION: Total knee arthroplasty is already one of the most successful procedures in orthopedics with high survival rates and excellent post-operative outcomes. Despite these satisfying results, robotic-guided arthroplasty is slowly but surely infiltrating both worldwide and domestic. In Steinfeld et al.'s review ""Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty"" the authors navigate through the pros and cons of robotic-guided total knee arthroplasty and try to answer the question: Robotics, why now?"
pub.1175264415,Comparing Rates of Minimal Clinically Important Difference Between Manual and Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Differences in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between manual total knee arthroplasty (mTKA) and robotic-assisted TKA (rTKA) have not been adequately assessed. We compared the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for improvement (MCID-I) and worsening (MCID-W) between mTKA and rTKA patients.
METHODS: Patients who underwent primary TKA (874 mTKA and 439 rTKA) with complete preoperative and 1-year postoperative PROMs were retrospectively identified using a multihospital joint arthroplasty registry. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Short Form 10a (PROMIS PF-10a), PROMIS Global - Physical, or Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form were collected. The MCID-I, MCID-W, and ""no significant change"" rates were calculated using distribution-based methods. Propensity score matching was performed to control for confounding.
RESULTS: Similar 90-day pulmonary embolism (P = 0.26), deep venous thrombosis (P = 0.67), and emergency department visit (P = 0.35) rates were found. The 90-day readmission rate for mTKA was 1.7 and 3.4% for rTKA (P = 0.08), and the overall revision rates were 2.2% for mTKA and 0.7% for rTKA (P = 0.07). Revision-free survival was 99% at one and 2 years for both groups (P = 0.65 and P = 0.43, respectively). There were no differences in the proportion of patients achieving MCID-I or MCID-W for PROMIS PF-10a, PROMIS Global - Physical, or Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form. The MCID-I for PROMIS PF-10a was achieved in 65.5 and 62.2% of patients who had mTKA and rTKA, respectively (P = 0.32).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated similar complication rates and MCID-I and MCID-W attainment rates between mTKA and rTKA patients. Future studies should assess MCID attainment rates in the long term and in larger cohorts comparing mTKA and rTKA."
pub.1169996322,Functionally aligned total knee arthroplasty: A lateral flexion laxity up to 6 mm is safe!,"PURPOSE: Loose flexion gaps are associated with poor functional outcomes and instability in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The effect of a trapezoidal flexion gap in a functionally aligned TKA remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a larger lateral flexion gap in a robotic-assisted (RA), functionally aligned (FA) and cruciate-retaining (CR) TKA on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Data from 527 TKA in 478 patients from 2018 to 2020 were collected. All patients underwent an RA (MAKO, Stryker), FA and CR TKA. Gap measurements were collected intraoperatively. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), pain Visual analogue score (VAS) and range of motion were collected postoperatively. Patients were also asked about the ease of stair ascent and descent and kneeling on a 5-point scale. The minimum follow-up was 2 years. Patients were stratified into three groups based on lateral flexion laxity.
RESULTS: At 2 years postoperatively, the group with a looser gap (3-6 mm) had higher mean PROMs when compared with the group with a gap of 2-3 mm. There were no differences detected in any other outcomes at 2 years. A total of 70.9% of patients in the group with a 3-6 mm gap reported being able to walk down a flight of stairs 'easily', compared with 56.7% in the 2-3 mm group and 54% in the <2 mm group (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: The study shows that a loose lateral flexion gap in functionally aligned CR TKA does not adversely affect outcomes in the short term.

pub.1146719433,Navigated and Robot-Assisted Technology in Total Knee Arthroplasty: Do Outcome Differences Achieve Minimal Clinically Important Difference?,"BACKGROUND: In total knee arthroplasty (TKA), computer-assisted navigation (N-TKA) and robotic-assisted methods (RA-TKA) are intended to increase precision of mechanical and component alignment. However, the clinical significance of published patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) differences in comparison to conventional TKA (C-TKA) is unknown.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify all studies reporting perioperative PROMs for either primary N-TKA or RA-TKA with a C-TKA comparison cohort with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Relative improvements in PROMs for the two cohorts were compared to published minimal clinically important difference (MCID) values.
RESULTS: After systematic review, 21 studies (N = 3,214) reporting on N-TKA and eight studies (N = 1,529) reporting on RA-TKA met inclusion criteria. Eighteen of 20 studies (90%) reported improved radiographic outcomes with N-TKA relative to C-TKA; five of five studies reported improved radiographic outcomes with RA-TKA relative to C-TKA. Five of 21 studies (24%) reported statistically significant greater improvements in clinical PROMs for N-TKA relative to C-TKA, whereas only two (10%) achieved clinical significance relative to MCID on a secondary analysis. One of 8 studies (13%) reported statistically significant greater improvements in PROMs for RA-TKA relative to C-TKA, whereas none achieved clinical significance relative to MCID on a secondary analysis. No studies reported a significant difference in revision rates.
CONCLUSION: While most studies comparing RA-TKA and N-TKA with C-TKA demonstrate improved radiographic alignment outcomes, a minority of studies reported PROM differences that achieve clinical significance. Future studies should report data and be interpreted in the context of clinical significance to establish patient and surgeon expectations for emerging technologies."
pub.1150356576,Use of intraoperative technology in total knee arthroplasty is not associated with reductions in postoperative pain,"PURPOSE: Our systematic review and meta-analysis sought to assess how technology-assistance impacts (1) post-operative pain and (2) opioid use in patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: Four online databases were queried for studies published up to October 2021 that reported on pain and opioid usage between technology-assisted and manual TKA (mTKA) patients. Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) models were utilized to calculate pooled mean difference (MDs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs). Subgroup analyses were conducted to isolate robotic-arm assisted (RAA) and computed-assisted navigation (CAN) cohorts. Risk of bias was assessed for all included non-randomized studies with the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) tool. For the randomized control trials included in our study, the Detsky scale was applied.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 31 studies, reporting on a total of 761,300 TKAs (mTKA: n = 753,554; Computer-Assisted Navigation (CAN): n = 1,309; Robotic-Arm Assisted (RAA): n = 6437). No differences were demonstrated when evaluating WOMAC (MD: 0.00, 95% CI - 0.69 to 0.69; p = 1.00), KSS (MD: 0.01, 95% CI - 1.46 to 1.49; p = 0.99), KOOS (MD - 2.91, 95% CI - 6.17 to 0.34; p = 0.08), and VAS (MD - 0.54, 95% CI - 1.01 to - 0.007; p = 0.02) pain scores between cohorts. There was mixed evidence regarding how opioid consumption differed between TKA techniques.
CONCLUSION: The present analysis demonstrated no difference in terms of pain across a variety of utilized patient-reported pain measurements. However, there were mixed results regarding how opioid consumption varied between manual and technology-assisted cohorts, particularly in the immediate post-operative period.

Early results suggest a short learning curve and excellent radiographic outcomes (2.5 times improvement in tibial alignment, lower SD). The robotic arm is a valuable tool in modern orthopedics."
pub.1043894588,A Perspective on Robotic Assistance for Knee Arthroplasty,"Knee arthroplasty is used to treat patients with degenerative joint disease of the knee to reduce pain and restore the function of the joint. Although patient outcomes are generally quite good, there are still a number of patients that are dissatisfied with their procedures. Aside from implant design which has largely become standard, surgical technique is one of the main factors that determine clinical results. Therefore, a lot of effort has gone into improving surgical technique including the use of computer-aided surgery. The latest generation of orthopedic surgical tools involves the use of robotics to enhance the surgeons' abilities to install implants more precisely and consistently. This review presents an evolution of robot-assisted surgical systems for knee replacement with an emphasis on the clinical results available in the literature. Ever since various robotic-assistance systems were developed and used clinically worldwide, studies have demonstrated that these systems are as safe as and more accurate than conventional methods of manual implantation. Robotic surgical assistance will likely result in improved surgical technique and improved clinical results."
pub.1167030257,"Varying Complication Rates and Increased Costs in Technology-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus Conventional Instrumentation in 1,372,300 Primary Total Hips","BACKGROUND: The use of technology allows surgeons increased precision in component positioning in total hip arthroplasty (THA). The objective of this study was to compare (1) perioperative complications and (2) resource utilizations between robotic-assisted (RA) and computer-navigated (CN) versus conventional instrumenttaion (CI) THA.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using a large national database to identify patients undergoing unilateral, primary elective THA from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 using RA, CN, or CI. There were 1,372,300 total patients identified and included RA (29,735), CN (28,480), and CI (1,314,085) THA. Demographics, complications, lengths of stay, dispositions, and costs were compared between the cohorts. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The use of RA THA led to lower rates of intraoperative fracture (0.22% versus 0.39%), delirium (0.1% versus 0.2%), postoperative anemia (14.4% versus 16.7%), higher myocardial infarction (0.13% versus 0.08%), renal failure (1.7% versus 1.6%), blood transfusion (2.0% versus 1.9%), and wound dehiscence (0.02% versus 0.01%) compared to CI THA. The use of CN led to lower rates of respiratory complication (0.5% versus 0.8%), renal failure (1.1% versus 1.6%), blood transfusion (1.3% versus 1.9%), and pulmonary embolism (0.02% versus 0.1%) compared to CI THA. Total costs were increased in RA ($17,729 versus $15,977) and CN ($22,529 versus $15,977). Lengths of hospital stay were decreased in RA (1.8 versus 1.9 days) and CN (1.7 versus 1.9 days).
CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative complication rates vary in technology-assisted THA, with higher rates in RA THA and lower rates in CN THA, relative to CI THA. Both RA THA and CN THA were associated with more costs, shorter postoperative hospital stays, and higher rates of discharge home compared to CI THA."
pub.1160458984,Sagittal Alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Sagittal alignment determines the extension and flexion of knee prostheses in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The definition of the sagittal axes may be different between the Mako TKA system (Stryker) and the conventional manual intramedullary approach. Whether there is any discrepancy between the 2 approaches has not been well studied.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 60 full-length computed tomographic (CT) scans of the lower extremities of 54 patients. The femur and tibia were modeled by using Mimics (Materialise). The Mako mechanical axes were determined according to the Mako TKA Surgical Guide. The manual intramedullary axes were determined according to the central axis of the tibial proximal and femoral distal medullary cavities. The femoral, tibial, and combined angular discrepancies were measured in the sagittal plane.
RESULTS: On the femoral side, the Mako mechanical axis was more likely to be located in an extended position relative to the manual intramedullary axis (56 of 60 knees). The median angular discrepancy was 2.46° (interquartile range [IQR], 1.56° to 3.43° [range, -1.06° to 5.24°]). On the tibial side, the Mako mechanical axis was likely to be located in a flexed position relative to the manual intramedullary axis (57 of 60 knees). The median angular discrepancy was 2.40° (IQR, 1.87° to 2.84° [range, -0.79° to 4.20°]). The angular discrepancy of the femoral-tibial sagittal angle was 4.63° (IQR, 3.71° to 5.64° [range, 1.20° to 9.02°]).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with manual TKA, the Mako system is more likely to result in a decreased posterior tibial slope and extension of the femoral prosthesis. It may also influence the evaluation of lower-extremity extension and flexion. When using the Mako system, special attention should be given to these discrepancies.

pub.1175864162,Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Results in Shorter Navigation Working Time With Similar Clinical Outcomes Compared to Computer-Navigated Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Early clinical data are important in the appraisal of newly introduced robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) systems in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, there are few studies to date comparing 1-year clinical outcomes between RAS and computer-assisted navigation (CAS), the forerunner in reducing alignment outliers. The aim of this study was to determine if there was a difference between these two groups in early clinical outcomes, including functional outcome and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
METHODS: A total of 158 propensity score-matched patients who underwent primary TKA with either CAS or RAS were retrospectively analyzed. Perioperative outcomes (navigation time, length of stay, complications, readmissions, transfusions, and technical failure), as well as functional outcome measures (range of motion, sit to stand test, timed-up-and-go test, single-leg stance test, calf raises, and step count), and PROMs (Oxford Knee Score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, 12-item Short Form Survey, Forgotten Joint Score-12, and satisfaction) were compared between those who underwent CAS and those who underwent RAS.
RESULTS: Navigation time was shorter in the RAS group compared to the CAS group (mean difference, 15.4 minutes; P < 0.001). There were 2 complications reported in the CAS group (one patellar clunk, one periprosthetic joint infection), but none in the RAS group. There were no other readmissions, transfusions, or technical failures in either group. Postoperatively, there were no clinical differences in function between groups. Clinically meaningful improvement in PROMs was observed in both groups, with no differences.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of RAS resulted in shorter navigation time compared to CAS in TKA. No other differences were observed in early clinical outcomes between patients who underwent RAS and CAS."
pub.1174540125,Soft tissue laxity is highly variable in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty,"BackgroundOne major goal of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is to achieve balanced medial and lateral gaps in flexion and extension. While bone resections are planned by the surgeon, soft tissue laxity is largely intrinsic and patient-specific in the absence of additional soft tissue releases. We sought to determine the variability in soft tissue laxity in patients undergoing TKA.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 113 patients undergoing TKA. Data on preoperative knee deformity were collected. Data from a dynamic intraoperative stress examination were collected by a robotic tracking system to quantify maximal medial and lateral opening in flexion (85–95 degrees) and extension (-5–20 degrees). T-tests were used to assess the differences between continuous variables.ResultsA valgus stress opened the medial compartment a mean of 4.3 ± 2.3 mm (0.0–12.4 mm) in extension and 4.6 ± 2.3 mm (0.0–12.9 mm) in flexion. A varus stress opened the lateral compartment a mean of 5.4 ± 2.4 mm (0.3–12.6 mm) in extension and 6.2 ± 2.5 mm (0.0–13.4 mm) in flexion.The medial compartment of varus knees opened significantly more in response to valgus stress than valgus knees in both extension (5.2 mm vs. 2.6 mm; P < 0.0001) and flexion (5.4 mm vs 3.3 mm; P < 0.0001). The lateral compartment of valgus knees opened significantly more in response to varus stress than varus knees in both extension (6.7 mm vs. 4.8 mm; P < 0.0001) and flexion (7.4 mm vs. 5.8 mm; P = 0.0003).ConclusionsSoft tissue laxity is highly variable in patients undergoing TKA, contributing anywhere from 0–13 mm to the post-resection gap. Only a small part of this variability is predictable by preoperative deformity. These findings have implications for either measured-resection or gap-balancing techniques.Level of EvidenceLevel III."
pub.1170403723,Impact of change in coronal plane alignment of knee (CPAK) classification on outcomes of robotic-assisted TKA,"BackgroundMechanical alignment with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been widely used since the implantation of the first prosthetic knee. Multiple studies have reported 80% patient satisfaction with TKA. However, the reported patients’ dissatisfaction is believed to be caused by having to convert different knee alignments to neutral alignments. It is postulated that a change in the CPAK classification of knees leads to patient dissatisfaction.Thus, we hypothesized that a change in CPAK classification with robot-assisted TKA with mechanical alignment does not significantly lead to patient dissatisfaction.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 134 patients who underwent robot-assisted mechanical alignment total knee arthroplasty (MA-TKA) using cementless implants and classified them into CPAK system pre- and post-operatively. One year after TKA surgery, we recorded binary responses to patients’ satisfaction with the outcome of surgery and analyzed if a change in CPAK classification is associated with the outcome of surgery.ResultsWe found that 125 out of 134 patients (93.28%) were happy with the outcome of surgery. CPAK classification was changed in 116 patients (86.57%) and maintained in 18 patients (13.43%). Our results also showed that 111 (95.7%) out of 116 patients who had a change in CPAK and 14 (77.8%) out of 18 patients who maintained their CPAK post-surgery were happy with the outcome of surgery (OR = 6.3, CI 1.741–25.17, P value = 0.019).ConclusionWe concluded that changing the patient’s native joint line and CPAK classification does not significantly change the outcome of surgery in terms of satisfaction. The dissatisfaction rate of 20% as published by previous researchers may be confounded by other reasons and not just due to changes in alignment and joint line."
pub.1105917414,The learning curve associated with robotic-arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a prospective cohort study.,"Aims: The primary aim of this study was to determine the surgical team's learning curve for introducing robotic-arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) into routine surgical practice. The secondary objective was to compare accuracy of implant positioning in conventional jig-based UKA versus robotic-arm assisted UKA.
Patients and Methods: This prospective single-surgeon cohort study included 60 consecutive conventional jig-based UKAs compared with 60 consecutive robotic-arm assisted UKAs for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Patients undergoing conventional UKA and robotic-arm assisted UKA were well-matched for baseline characteristics including a mean age of 65.5 years (sd 6.8) vs 64.1 years (sd 8.7), (p = 0.31); a mean body mass index of 27.2 kg.m2 (sd 2.7) vs 28.1 kg.m2 (sd 4.5), (p = 0.25); and gender (27 males: 33 females vs 26 males: 34 females, p = 0.85). Surrogate measures of the learning curve were prospectively collected. These included operative times, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire to assess preoperative stress levels amongst the surgical team, accuracy of implant positioning, limb alignment, and postoperative complications.
Results: Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with a learning curve of six cases for operating time (p < 0.001) and surgical team confidence levels (p < 0.001). Cumulative robotic experience did not affect accuracy of implant positioning (p = 0.52), posterior condylar offset ratio (p = 0.71), posterior tibial slope (p = 0.68), native joint line preservation (p = 0.55), and postoperative limb alignment (p = 0.65). Robotic-arm assisted UKA improved accuracy of femoral (p < 0.001) and tibial (p < 0.001) implant positioning with no additional risk of postoperative complications compared to conventional jig-based UKA.
Conclusion: Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with a learning curve of six cases for operating time and surgical team confidence levels but no learning curve for accuracy of implant positioning. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:1033-42."
pub.1169291856,Accuracy of femoral component anteversion in robotic total hip arthroplasty,"Aims: Femoral component anteversion is an important factor in the success of total hip arthroplasty (THA). This retrospective study aimed to investigate the accuracy of femoral component anteversion with the Mako THA system and software using the Exeter cemented femoral component, compared to the Accolade II cementless femoral component.
Methods: We reviewed the data of 30 hips from 24 patients who underwent THA using the posterior approach with Exeter femoral components, and 30 hips from 24 patients with Accolade II components. Both groups did not differ significantly in age, sex, BMI, bone quality, or disease. Two weeks postoperatively, CT images were obtained to measure acetabular and femoral component anteversion.
Results: The mean difference in femoral component anteversion between intraoperative and postoperative CT measurements (system accuracy of component anteversion) was 0.8° (SD 1.8°) in the Exeter group and 2.1° (SD 2.3°) in the Accolade II group, respectively (p = 0.020). The mean difference in anteversion between the plan and the postoperative CT measurements (clinical accuracy of femoral component anteversion) was 1.2° (SD 3.6°) in the Exeter group, and 4.2° (SD 3.9°) in the Accolade II group (p = 0.003). No significant differences were found in acetabular component inclination and anteversion; however, the clinical accuracy of combined anteversion was significantly better in the Exeter group (0.6° (SD 3.9°)) than the Accolade II group (3.6° (SD 4.1°)).
Conclusion: The Mako THA system and software helps surgeons control the femoral component anteversion to achieve the target angle of insertion. The Exeter femoral component, inserted using Mako THA system, showed greater precision for femoral component and combined component anteversion than the Accolade II component."
pub.1123962829,Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty US and Global Perspectives,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a treatment option for anteromedial osteoarthritis. Compared with total knee arthroplasty (TKA), UKA offers improved knee range of motion, functional recovery and decreased medical complications. Revision rates continue to be higher with UKA compared with TKA. With current UKA implants, there is no significant difference in mobile bearing or fixed bearing, or between cemented and cementless implants. Enabling technology, such as robotic-assisted surgery, has demonstrated improvements in component positioning, but no long-term difference in survival compared with traditional manual instruments."
pub.1138364463,Robotic-arm–assisted Knee Arthroplasty Associated With Favorable In-hospital Metrics and Exponentially Rising Adoption Compared With Manual Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Technology-assisted knee arthroplasty (KA), including robotic-arm-assisted knee arthroplasty (RA-KA) and computer-assisted (CA-KA) knee arthroplasty, was developed to improve surgical accuracy of implant positioning and alignment, which may influence implant stability, longevity, and functional outcomes. However, despite increased adoption over the past decade; its value is still to be determined.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare robotic-arm (RA)-KA, CA-KA, and manual (M)-KA regarding (1) in-hospital metrics (length of stay [LOS], discharge disposition, in-hospital complications, and hospitalization-episode costs), (2) characterize annual utilization trends, and (3) future RA-KA and CA-KA utilization projections.
METHODS: National Inpatient Sample was queried for primary KAs (unicompartmental/total; 2008 to 2018). KAs were classified by modality (M-KA/CA-KA/RA-KA) using International Classification of Disease-9/10 codes. A propensity score-matched comparison of LOS, discharge disposition, in-hospital complications (implant-related mechanical or procedure-related nonmechanical complications), and costs was conducted. Trends and projected utilization rates were estimated.
RESULTS: After propensity score matched to their respective M-KA cohorts, RA-KA and CA-KA exhibited shorter LOS (RA-KA versus M-KA: 2.0 ± 1.4 days versus 2.5 ± 1.8 days; P < 0.001; CA-KA versus M-KA: 2.7 ± 1.4 days versus 2.9 ± 1.6 days; P < 0.001) and in-hospital implant-related mechanical complications (P < 0.05, each). RA-KA demonstrated lower nonhome discharge (P < 0.001) and in-hospital procedure-related nonmechanical complications (P = 0.005). RA-KA had lower in-hospital costs ($16,881 ± 7,085 versus $17,320 ± 12,820; P < 0.001), whereas CA-KA exhibited higher costs ($18,411 ± 7,783 versus $17,716 ± 8,451; P < 0.001). RA-KA utilization increased from <0.1% in 2008 to 4.3% in 2018. CA-KA utilization rose temporarily to 6.2% in 2014, then declined to pre-2010 levels in 2018 (4.5%). Projections indicate that RA-KA and CA-KA will represent 49.9% (95% confidence interval, 41.1 to 59.9) and 6.2% (95% confidence interval, 5.3% to 7.2%) of KAs by 2030.
DISCUSSION: RA-KA may provide value through improving in-hospital metrics and mitigating net costs. Similar advantages may not be reliably attainable with CA-RA. Because RA-KA is projected to reach half of all knee arthroplasties done in the United States by 2030, further cost analyses and long-term studies are warranted."
pub.1006934624,Comparison of manual rasping and robotic milling for short metaphyseal-fitting stem implantation in total hip arthroplasty: a cadaveric study,"OBJECTIVE: The ROBODOC system offers the theoretical advantage of providing better fit and mechanical stability of the stem in total hip arthroplasty. However, there has been no previous study on short metaphyseal-fitting stem implantation using the ROBODOC system. The aim of the present study was to compare the implant position and primary stability of short metaphyseal-fitting stems implanted by robotic milling and manual rasping in a human cadaveric femoral model.
METHODS: Eight matched pairs of human cadaveric femora were randomly assigned to a robotic milling group or manual rasping group. Operative time and intraoperative femoral fractures were monitored, and radiographic evaluation of stem alignment was performed by comparison of preoperative planning and postoperative CT data. Stability testing was performed on six matched pairs of femora, excluding two specimens in which intraoperative fractures occurred.
RESULTS: The robotic milling procedures took an average of 27 minutes longer than the manual rasping procedures (p < 0.001). The robotic milling group exhibited significantly better anteroposterior alignment and vertical seating, and also showed a significantly reduced variability in both alignment and vertical seating. No intraoperative femoral fracture was detected in the robotic milling group, whereas two femoral fractures and one femoral stem tip perforation were detected in the manual rasping group. Stability testing showed no significant difference in translational and rotational migrations between the two groups, although the robotic milling group showed a trend towards reduced variability of stability.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cadaveric study suggests that the use of the ROBODOC system for short metaphyseal-fitting stem implantation may have advantages in improving implant fit and reducing the risk of intraoperative femoral fractures without compromising primary stability."
pub.1036988120,Robotic testing of proximal tibio‐fibular joint kinematics for measuring instability following total knee arthroplasty,"Pain secondary to instability in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been shown to be major cause of early failure. In this study, we focused on the effect of instability in TKA on the proximal tibio-fibular joint (PTFJ). We used a robotics model to compare the biomechanics of the PTFJ in the native knee, an appropriately balanced TKA, and an unbalanced TKA. The tibia (n = 5) was mounted to a six-degree-of-freedom force/torque sensor and the femur was moved by a robotic manipulator. Motion at the PTFJ was recorded with a high-resolution digital camera system. After establishing a neutral position, loading conditions were applied at varying flexion angles (0°, 30°, and 60°). These included: internal/external rotation (0 Nm, ±5 Nm), varus/valgus (0 Nm, ±10 Nm), compression (100 N, 700 N), and posterior drawer (0 N, 100 N). With respect to anterior displacement, external rotation had the largest effect (coefficient = 0.650; p < 0.0001). Polyethylene size as well as the interaction between polyethylene size and flexion consistently showed substantial anterior motion. Flexion and mid-flexion instability in TKA have been difficult to quantify. While tibio-femoral kinematics is the main aspect of TKA performance, the effects on adjacent tissues should not be overlooked. Our data show that PTFJ kinematics are affected by the balancing of the TKA."
pub.1148973634,A direct referencing method of the tibial plateau for the posterior tibial slope in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PurposeThere is no consensus on intraoperative references for the posterior tibial slope (PTS) in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). An arthroscopic hook probe placed on the medial second quarter of the medial tibial plateau (MTP) in an anteroposterior direction may be used as a direct anatomical reference for the PTS. The purpose of this study is to investigate the availability and accuracy of this method.MethodsMarginal osteophyte formation and subchondral depression of the MTP and angles between the bony MTP and the cartilage MTP were retrospectively evaluated using preoperative sagittal MRI of 73 knees undergoing medial UKA. In another 36 knees, intraoperative lateral knee radiographs with the probe placed on the MTP were prospectively taken in addition to the preoperative MRI. Then, angles between the bony MTP and the probe axis and angles between the preoperative bony MTP and the postoperative implant MTP were measured.ResultsAmong 73 knees, one knee with grade 4 osteoarthritis had a posterior osteophyte higher than the most prominent point of the cartilage MTP. No subchondral depression affected the direct reference of the MTP. The mean angle between the bony MTP and the cartilage MTP was −0.8° ± 0.7° (−2.6°–1.0°, n = 72), excluding one knee with a “high” osteophyte. The mean angle between the bony MTP and the probe axis on the intraoperative radiograph was −0.6° ± 0.4° (−1.7–0.0, n = 36). The mean angle between the pre- and postoperative MTP was −0.5° ± 1.5° (−2.9°–1.8°). The root-mean-square (RMS) error of these two PTS angles was 1.6° with this method.ConclusionCartilage remnants, osteophyte formation and subchondral bone depression do not affect the direct referencing method in almost all knees for which medial UKA is indicated. When the posterior “high” osteophyte of the MTP is noted on preoperative radiography, preoperative MRI or CT scan is recommended to confirm no “high” osteophyte on the medial second quarter. The accuracy of this method seems equal to that of robotic-assisted surgery (the RMS error in previous reports, 1.6°–1.9°)."
pub.1071720123,Precision surgery.,"Accurate component placement in joint replacement cannot be overemphasized; despite many re-engineering efforts over the past 3 decades, failure rates at 10 years for total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain constant. Intraoperative decisions with joint replacement have been facilitated with manual instrumentation and are affected by the surgeon's intuition, instinct, and experience. Current technology allows the development and use of high-tech instrumentation, which, irrespective of surgeon-dependent variables, gives intraoperative quantitative information on which precise placement of hip and knee components can be done. Component placement is the single most important technical maneuver the surgeon accomplishes to prevent mechanical complications, which will nearly eliminate outliers from very good and excellent results and revision as a consequence of technical errors; computer navigation has almost made it possible. In knees it gives precise component placement in the coronal and sagittal planes, and in hips it particularly improves acetabular component position by numerical control of inclination, anteversion, and most importantly center of rotation. Precision is enhanced even more when computer navigation is elevated to the next level, which is robotic guidance. The preoperative plan set by the surgeon is executed by the robotic tool while the surgeon manually controls the robotic arm. Bone preparation cannot exceed the boundaries the surgeon has set, as the surgeon's manual force will stop the robot and the error cannot be made. Robotic surgery has progressed in the unicompartmental knee, and this innovation is in the final stages of development in THA."
pub.1033014838,Robot-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"The outcomes of unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKAs) have demonstrated inconsistent long-term survival. We report the first clinical series of UKA using a semiactive robotic system for the implantation of an inlay unicondylar knee arthroplasty. Ten patients were selected for this study. Preoperative mechanical leg alignment values ranged from 0.3 degrees varus to 9.8 degrees varus. A haptic guidance system was used; a detailed description is given in the manuscript. The setup time for the robot was 41 minutes; intraoperative registration process, 7.5 minutes (6-13 minutes); skin incision, 8 cm; robot-assisted burring, 34.8 minutes (18-50 minutes); mean tourniquet time, 87.4 minutes (68-113 minutes); and overall operation time, 132 minutes (118-152 minutes). The planned and intraoperative tibiofemoral angle was within 1 degrees. The postoperative long leg axis radiographs were within 1.6 degrees. Haptic guidance in combination with a navigation module allows for precise planning and execution of both inlay components in UKA."
pub.1018397655,Minimally invasive 3D data registration in computer and robot assisted total knee arthroplasty,"Computer and robot assisted surgery is concerned with the improvements achievable by using computer methods and robotic devices to plan and execute surgical interventions. The registration of different coordinate frames, often achieved through the matching of 3D data sets, represents a crucial step connecting planning and execution. Orthopaedic surgery already features a number of functioning applications which include registration routines relying on presurgically implanted fiducial markers. Replacing such invasive routines with non-fiducial registration procedures is regarded as a necessary step towards a minimisation of surgical invasiveness. A minimally invasive registration technique based on the iterative closest point algorithm is presented and conceived for a specific computer and robot assisted orthopaedic reconstructive intervention, namely total knee arthroplasty. The whole surgical protocol is examined in detail and the experimental results, relative to tests performed on synthetic and animal specimens, are thoroughly reported and discussed. The authors indicate that the proposed registration approach is well-suited for the relevant application and appropriate for in vivo testing."
pub.1154355275,Personalized alignment™ for total knee arthroplasty using the ROSA® Knee and Persona® knee systems: Surgical technique,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures are expected to increase up to 565% in the United States over the next 3 decades. TKAs were traditionally performed with neutral mechanical alignments that provided equal medial and lateral gaps in extension and flexion to reduce implant wear but were less successful at restoring native knee function and associated with high patient dissatisfaction. Kinematic alignment (KA) restores native anatomy and minimizes soft tissue release; however, KAs that recreate severe deformities and/or biomechanically inferior alignments result in significant increases in implant stress and risk of aseptic loosening. Restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) recreates pre-arthritic anatomy within a range of acceptable alignment boundaries, and improved patient clinical scores and faster recoveries have been reported with rKA techniques. Personalized Alignment™ is an evolution of rKA that relies heavily upon robotic assistance to reliably recreate patient anatomy, native soft tissue laxity, and accurate component placement to improve patients' clinical outcomes. The purpose of this surgical technique report is to describe the Personalized Alignment TKA method using the ROSA<sup>®</sup> Knee System and Persona<sup>®</sup> The Personalized Knee<sup>®</sup> implants. Herein we provide specific procedures for pre-operative planning, anatomical landmarking and evaluation, intra-operative planning and adjustment of resections and cuts, cut validation and soft tissue evaluation with robotic-assisted personalized TKA."
pub.1133124199,Quantitative Evaluation of the Thickness of the Available Manipulation Volume Inside the Knee Joint Capsule for Minimally Invasive Robotic Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty,"OBJECTIVE: Developing robotic tools that introduce substantial changes in the surgical workflow is challenging because quantitative requirements are missing. Experiments on cadavers can provide valuable information to derive workspace requirements, tool size, and surgical workflow. This work aimed to quantify the volume inside the knee joint available for manipulation of minimally invasive robotic surgical tools. In particular, we aim to develop a novel procedure for minimally invasive unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) using a robotic laser-cutting tool.
METHODS: Contrast solution was injected into nine cadaveric knees and computed tomography scans were performed to evaluate the tool manipulation volume inside the knee joints. The volume and distribution of the contrast solution inside the knee joints were analyzed with respect to the femur, tibia, and the anatomical locations that need to be reached by a laser-cutting tool to perform bone resection for a standard UKA implant.
RESULTS: Quantitative information was determined about the tool manipulation volume inside these nine knee joints and its distribution around the cutting lines required for a standard implant.
CONCLUSION: Based on the volume distribution, we could suggest a possible workflow for minimally invasive UKA, which provides a large manipulation volume, and deducted that for the proposed workflow, an instrument with a thickness of 5-8 mm should be feasible.
SIGNIFICANCE: We present quantitative information on the three-dimensional distribution of the maximally available volume inside the knee joint. Such quantitative information lays the basis for developing surgical tools that introduce substantial changes in the surgical workflow."
pub.1128844300,What are the benefits of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty over conventional manual total knee arthroplasty? A systematic review of comparative studies,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly successful operation that improves patients' quality of life and functionality. Yet, up to 20% of TKA patients remain unsatisfied with the functional outcomes. Robotic TKA has gained increased attention and popularity in order to improve patient satisfaction and implant survivorship by increasing accuracy and precision of component implantation. The current systematic review was run in order to compare implant survivorship, complication rates, clinical outcomes, and radiological outcomes between robotic-assisted TKA (RA) and conventional manual TKA (CM). Articles were referenced from the US National Library of Medicine (PubMed/MEDLINE), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Nine comparative studies with 1199 operated knees in 1159 patients were included, 614 underwent active or semiactive robotic-assisted TKA compared to 585 CM-TKA. Improvements in the RA group were reported for early functional outcomes, radiographic outliers (RA 16% vs CM 76%) and radiolucent lines (RA 0% vs CM 35%). No significant differences between the two groups were reported in overall survivorship (RA 98.3% vs CM 97.3%), complication rate (RA 2.4% vs CM 1.4%) and operative time (RA 88 min vs CM 79 min). Despite higher costs, roboticassisted TKA offers better short-term clinical outcomes when compared to conventional manual technique with reduction in radiographic outliers and reduced risks of iatrogenic soft tissues injuries (reduced blood loss and postoperative drainage). Further high-quality long-term studies of modern robotic systems are required in order to evaluate how the increased accuracy and reduced outliers affect the long-term survivorship of the implants and the clinical outcomes."
pub.1163501179,Early versus delayed postoperative adductor canal block in total knee arthroplasty,"Background: We hypothesized that patients who received an adductor canal block (ACB) in the operating room following unilateral total knee arthroplasty would have a lower oral morphine milligram equivalent (MME) consumption during the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) phase 1 recovery period compared to patients who received an ACB in the PACU.
Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent robotic-assisted unilateral total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia between March 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021, and received postoperative ACB either in the operating room or the PACU.
Results: A total of 36 and 178 patients received postoperative ACB in the operating room and PACU, respectively, and had median and interquartile range MME consumption in the PACU of 22.5 (20-40) mg and 30.0 (20-40) mg (<i>P</i> = 0.76), respectively. Patients who had an ACB performed in the operating room and PACU had median and interquartile ranges of time spent in the PACU of 101 (75-178) minutes and 186 (125-272) minutes (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), respectively.
Conclusion: Patients who received an ACB in the operating room did not have a lower OME consumption than patients who received an ACB in the PACU but did have a shorter PACU length of stay."
pub.1175353787,Optimizing the patellofemoral compartment in total knee arthroplasty: Is it time for dynamic assessment?,"Despite improvements in implant design, surgical techniques and assistive technologies for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), anterior knee pain (AKP) remains frequently reported, even by satisfied patients. This persistent problem calls for better understanding and management of the patellofemoral or anterior compartment during surgery, just as the techniques and strategies deployed to optimize the flexion and extension spaces through personalized alignment, bone cuts and ligament balancing. Assistive technologies such as navigation and robotics provide new tools to manage this 'third space' through precise pre-operative planning and dynamic intra-operative assessment. Such endeavors must start with clear definitions of the 'third space', how it should be measured, what constitutes its 'safe zone', and how it affects outcomes. There are yet no established methods to evaluate the patellofemoral compartment, and no clear thresholds to define over- or under-stuffing. Static assessment using lateral radiographs provides a limited understanding and depends considerably on flexion angle, while dynamic evaluation at multiple flexion angles or using intra-operative computer or robotic-assistance enables a broader perspective and solutions to manage patellar tracking and anterior offset. Future studies should investigate the impact of variations in anterior offset in TKA, define its safe zone, and understand the effects of of thresholds for over- or under-stuffing. Experimental methods such as in-vivo motion analysis and force sensors could elucidate the influence of anterior offset on flexion and extension biomechanics."
pub.1060165419,Robotic Assistance in Orthopaedic Surgery,"The term ""robot"" refers to a precision mechanical device that is accurately controlled by a computer using intelligent software. The term ""robotic assistance"" refers to the use of such a device to aid a surgeon in the optimal conduct of a procedure, particularly one requiring specified geometrical relationships. The authors have been exploring the application of robotic assistance in situations in which accuracy and precision are required in orthopaedic surgery. The initial application concerned the planning, positioning, and orientation cuts and holes of the bone required for the femoral component of a total knee arthroplasty. A three-dimensional digitizing template allowed the surgeon to specify the desired position and orientation of the component's articular surfaces in relation to the distal femur. The robotic system used this spatial relationship, along with its knowledge of the geometry of the component selected by the surgeon, to plan the precise location of the required bone cuts and holes. Finally, the robotic assistant sequentially positioned saw and drill guides with respect to the distal femur so that the surgeon made these cuts and holes in the locations necessary for optimal component fit, position, and orientation. The robotic assistant functioned easily in the operating room environment; increased the accuracy; and decreased the time, equipment, and personnel required for the conduct of the geometrical part of this surgical procedure."
pub.1125331754,Alignment in total knee arthroplasty.,"Dissatisfaction following total knee arthroplasty is a well-documented phenomenon. Although many factors have been implicated, including modifiable and nonmodifiable patient factors, emphasis over the past decade has been on implant alignment and stability as both a cause of, and a solution to, this problem. Several alignment targets have evolved with a proliferation of techniques following the introduction of computer and robotic-assisted surgery. Mechanical alignment targets may achieve mechanically-sound alignment while ignoring the soft tissue envelope; kinematic alignment respects the soft tissue envelope while ignoring the mechanical environment. Functional alignment is proposed as a hybrid technique to allow mechanically-sound, soft tissue-friendly alignment targets to be identified and achieved.

pub.1129541032,Robotics and Navigation as Learning Tools for Fellows Training in Hip Arthroplasty.,"INTRODUCTION: The association between implant malpositioning and complications has been repeatedly demonstrated. Recently, technological advancements have allowed for more consistent implant placement. Beyond this obvious application, these technologies may also serve as a learning tool. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of fellows' estimation of implant positioning using a robotic system.
METHODS: Data were prospectively collected for all patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty between September 2019 and December 2019. The fellow was blinded to the robotic system. Before reaming and broaching by the senior surgeon, the fellow was asked to place the reamer at 40° of cup inclination and 20° of version. The resulting values were recorded before the true measurements were revealed. A similar process was followed for femoral broaching.
RESULTS: The mean difference between the estimated and actual cup inclination and version was 7.24° (P = 0.060) and 4.81° (P = 0.031), respectively. The mean difference in broach version was 7.00° (P = 0.159). Without the robotic system, 43.47% and 69.57% of patients would have had the cup placed outside of the safe zones described by Lewinnek and Callanan, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The estimated anteversion of the acetabular implant was found to be markedly different from its actual anteversion. A considerable portion of the cups would have been positioned outside of the Lewinnek and Callanan ""safe zones"" provided that the implants would have been manually positioned. The use of robotic or navigation systems may provide useful learning tools for fellows in training to understand their own inaccuracies in estimated implant position and hence refine their abilities."
pub.1120966562,A novel patient-specific instrument design can deliver robotic level accuracy in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: A previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) by our group found that robotic assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) surgery was significantly more accurate than conventional instrumentation. The aim of this study was to determine whether a low-cost novel PSI design could deliver the same level of accuracy as the robot in the same time efficient manner as conventional instruments.
METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing medial UKA took part. Tibial component position was planned using a low dose CT-scan, and compared to a day 1 postoperative CT-scan to determine the difference between the planned and achieved positions. Operations were performed by one expert surgeon using PSI (Embody, London, UK).
RESULTS: The mean absolute difference between planned and achieved tibial implant positions using PSI was 2.0° (SD 1.0°) in the coronal plane, 1.8° (SD 1.5) in the sagittal plane, and 4.5° (SD 3.3) in the axial plane. These results were not significantly different to the 13 historical robotic cases (mean difference 0.5°, 0.5°, and 1.7°, p = 0.1907, 0.2867 and 0.1049 respectively). PSI mean operating time was on average 62 min shorter than the robotic group (p < 0.0001) and 40 min shorter than the conventional instrument group (p < 0.0001). No complications were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this clinical trial demonstrates that for tibial component positioning in UKA, a novel design PSI guide in the hands of an expert surgeon, can safely deliver comparable accuracy to a robotic system, whilst being significantly faster than conventional instruments.

pub.1140245276,Comparison of Iatrogenic Soft Tissue Trauma in Robotic-Assisted versus Manual Partial Knee Arthroplasty.,"Partial knee arthroplasty (PKA) is performed to treat end-stage osteoarthritis in a single compartment. There are minimal data characterizing soft-tissue injuries for PKA with robotic and manual techniques. This cadaver study compared the extent of soft-tissue trauma sustained through robotic-arm assisted PKA (RPKA) and manual PKA (MPKA). Five surgeons prepared 24 cadaveric knees for medial PKA, including six MPKA controls and 18 RPKA assigned into three different workflows: RPKA-LB (six knees) - RPKA with legacy burr; RPKA-NB (six knees) - RPKA with new burr design; and RPKA-NBS (six knees) - RPKA with new burr design and oscillating saw. Two surgeons estimated trauma to the patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), medial capsule, posterior capsule, and posterior cruciate ligament (PCLs) using a five-grade system: Grade 1 - complete soft tissue preservation; Grade 2 - ≤25%; Grade 3 - 26 to 50%; Grade 4 - 51 to 75%; and Grade 5 - ≥76% trauma. A total trauma grade was assigned by summing the grades. Kruskal-Wallis statistical tests were used to assess outcomes. When compared to the MPKA group, all RPKA subgroups had lower total trauma grading (p<0.01), lower posterior capsular damage (p<0.01), and less severe ACL damage (p<0.01). The analysis demonstrated no significant difference between the three RPKA workflows. As this study was performed using cadaveric specimens, additional investigations are necessary to determine associations between robotic or manual-assisted technique, observed soft tissue damage, and postoperative clinical outcomes following PKA."
pub.1138693164,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty improves the outlier of rotational alignment of the tibial prosthesis using 3DCT measurements,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare the accuracy of prosthetic alignment with three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) measurements following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed using a robotic-assisted surgical technique versus a conventional TKA.
METHODS: 41 TKAs were performed with a handheld robotic-assisted surgical procedure (Robot group) between 2019 and 2020. Another 41 patients underwent TKA with a conventional manual surgical procedure (Manual group) using the same prosthesis. The operation durations between both groups were investigated. 3DCT scans of the entire lower extremities were taken before and after the surgery and femoral and tibial alignments in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes were measured using computer software. The differences in prosthetic alignment and translation between the preoperative 3DCT plan and postoperative 3DCT image were also measured.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the post-operative outliers of the femorotibial angle between the groups. In the tibial-axial plane, the mean of prosthetic alignment in the anteroposterior plane was 4.0° in the Robot group and 6.7° in the Manual group (p < 0.01). The rate of outliers for tibial-axial alignment in the Robot group was significantly less than in the Manual group (p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in prosthetic translation in the proximal-distal, anterior-posterior and medial-lateral orientations between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In a radiologic study using 3DCT, robotic-assisted TKA reduced the outliers for rotational alignment of the tibial prosthesis in comparison to conventional TKA, which can lead to improved tracking of the femoral-tibial bearing surfaces."
pub.1116476898,Comparison between navigated reported position and postoperative computed tomography to evaluate accuracy in a robotic navigation system in total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Computer navigation increases reproducibility compared to non-navigated total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Robotics navigation is a branch of computer navigation technology that might further improve accuracy of implant placement. The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy achieved in TKA with a robotic navigation system.
METHODS: One hundred seventy three knees. System studied: Omni navigation System (OMNI, Raynham, MA). Navigated femoral and tibial cuts were compared to postoperative computed tomography (CT). Measurements reviewed: femoral coronal alignment (FCA), femoral sagittal alignment (FSA), femoral rotational alignment (FRA), tibial coronal alignment (TCA), tibial sagittal alignment (TSA) and hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle. Statistical analysis was made using R.
RESULTS: The mean differences between the navigated reported and the CT positions were: FCA: 0.1 ± 1.2° more varus (P = 0.58), FSA: 1.5 ± 0.3° more flexed (P < 0.001), FRA: 0.0 ± 1.7° (P = 0.93), TCA: 0.7 ± 1.1° more varus (P < 0.001), TSA: -1.3 ± 1.5 more negative slope (P < 0.001), HKA angle: 0.4 ± 2.4 more varus (P < 0.049). The percentages of concordance inside a three degree difference were: FCA: 98% (169 knees), FSA: 100% (173 knees), FRA: 94% (162 knees), TCA: 99% (171 knees), TSA: 93% (161 knees) and HKA angle: 83% (144 knees).
CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that the robotic navigation system studied is highly accurate regarding final implant positioning for FCA, FRA and TCA. It has less accuracy in FSA, TSA and the HKA angle."
pub.1092115207,Fourteen Year Follow-Up of Randomized Clinical Trials of Active Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Active robotic total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been used clinically for over 20 years, but long-term results have never been studied. The aims of this study are to determine whether active robotic THA improves clinical outcomes and results in fewer revisions over a long-term follow-up.
METHODS: Patients from 2 US Food and Drug Administration clinical trials (1994-1998 and 2001-2006) who had undergone THA using either an active robotic system or a traditional manual technique were examined to determine if any differences existed in radiographic analysis and patient pain and function using the University of California, Los Angeles; visual analog scale; Health Status Questionnaire (HSQ) pain; HSQ role physical; HSQ physical functioning; Harris pain scores; and the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores at a mean follow-up of 14 years.
RESULTS: The ROBODOC group had statistically significant higher HSQ pain and Harris pain scores and lower Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores. There was no statistically significant difference in probability of a revision for wear between the groups (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.80; P = .179), and no revisions for loosening in either group.
CONCLUSION: Prior studies have demonstrated improved implant fit and alignment with the use of this active robot system. This long-term study now shows no failures for stem loosening at a mean follow-up of 14 years and small but potentially important improvements in clinical outcomes in the robot group."
pub.1099648033,"A multi‐modality tracking, navigation and calibration for a flexible robotic drill system for total hip arthroplasty","BACKGROUND: This paper presents a novel multi-modality tracking and navigation system that provides a unique capability to guild a flexible drill tip inside the bone with accurate curved tunnelling.
METHODS: As the flexible drill tip cannot be tracked optically inside the bone, this research focuses on developing a hybrid tracking and navigation system for tracking a flexible drill tip by using both optical and kinematic tracking. The tracking information is used to guide the THA (total hip arthroplasty) procedure, providing a real-time virtual model of the flexible drill.
RESULTS: The flexible and steerable drill tip system is then tested on total hip arthroplasty followed by evaluation of the positioning and orientation of femoral stem placement by femoral milling.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, we conclude that the tracking and navigation system is able to guide the flexible drill to mill inside femoral canal."
pub.1135385193,Primary Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: An Analysis of 501 Hips With 44-Month Follow-up.,"The aim of this study was to report patient-reported outcome measurements in a large group of patients who underwent robotic-arm assisted primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Prospectively collected data were retrospectively reviewed between April 2012 and May 2017. Primary THAs using the Mako robotic-arm assisted (Mako Surgical Corp [Stryker]) with minimum 2-year follow-up for Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) were included. Exclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater, age younger than 21 years, workers' compensation, or unwillingness to participate. Visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain and patient satisfaction score were obtained. Intraoperative measurements for leg length, global offset, acetabular inclination, and version were documented. A total of 501 hips were included, with 57.29% of the patients being female. Mean follow-up was 43.99±15.59 months. Mean age was 58.70±9.41 years. Mean BMI was 28.41±4.55 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Mean HHS was 90.87±13.45, mean FJS-12 was 79.97±25.87, mean VAS score was 1.20±2.06, and mean patient satisfaction score was 8.85±2.08. Intraoperative values for acetabular inclination and version were 40.0°±2.2° and 20.5°±2.4°, respectively. The rate of revision due to instability was 0.2%. Patients who received primary robotic-arm assisted THA reported excellent results at 44-month follow-up for multiple patient-reported outcome measurements. Consistency in acetabular cup placement accuracy was achieved regarding the Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones. [<i>Orthopedics</i>. 2021;44(2):70-76.]."
pub.1106186505,Patient reported and clinical outcomes of robotic-arm assisted unicondylar knee arthroplasty: Minimum two year follow-up,"BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) originated in the 1950's. There have been many enhancements to the implants and the technique, improving the precision and accuracy of this challenging operation. Specifically for Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopedic System (Rio; Mako Stryker, Fort Lauderdale, FL), there are many studies reporting clinical outcomes, but our search offered nothing regarding patient reported outcomes using validated surveys.
METHODS: Patients with onlay tibial components presenting for routine follow-up of robotic-arm assisted UKA performed between May 2009 and September 2013 were invited to participate. Four joints had simultaneous patella femoral resurfacing. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) and the 2011 Knee Society Scores were collected. Radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis in the non-operative knee compartments was documented.
RESULTS: Eighty-one patients presented for follow-up and consented to participate. Mean follow up was 54 months. Mean patient reported KOOS activities of daily living and pain scores were each 90. Knee Society 2011 mean objective score was 96 and mean function score 81. There was one revision to total knee at 40 months post-op for pain after injury. Seventy-seven percent reported their knee always felt ""Normal"", 20% sometimes, and only 3% reported that it never felt normal.
CONCLUSION: Literature on UKA failure rates suggests that UKA may be a less forgiving procedure than total knee arthroplasty. Robotic-arm assisted surgery is reported to improve the accuracy of implant placement. Based on our prospectively collected positive patient outcomes, the authors have achieved good results from performing robotic-arm assisted UKA on select patients."
pub.1084928936,Accurate 3D reconstruction of bony surfaces using ultrasonic synthetic aperture techniques for robotic knee arthroplasty,"Robotically guided knee arthroplasty systems generally require an individualized, preoperative 3D model of the knee joint. This is typically measured using Computed Tomography (CT) which provides the required accuracy for preoperative surgical intervention planning. Ultrasound imaging presents an attractive alternative to CT, allowing for reductions in cost and the elimination of doses of ionizing radiation, whilst maintaining the accuracy of the 3D model reconstruction of the joint. Traditional phased array ultrasound imaging methods, however, are susceptible to poor resolution and signal to noise ratios (SNR). Alleviating these weaknesses by offering superior focusing power, synthetic aperture methods have been investigated extensively within ultrasonic non-destructive testing. Despite this, they have yet to be fully exploited in medical imaging. In this paper, the ability of a robotic deployed ultrasound imaging system based on synthetic aperture methods to accurately reconstruct bony surfaces is investigated. Employing the Total Focussing Method (TFM) and the Synthetic Aperture Focussing Technique (SAFT), two samples were imaged which were representative of the bones of the knee joint: a human-shaped, composite distal femur and a bovine distal femur. Data were captured using a 5MHz, 128 element 1D phased array, which was manipulated around the samples using a robotic positioning system. Three dimensional surface reconstructions were then produced and compared with reference models measured using a precision laser scanner. Mean errors of 0.82mm and 0.88mm were obtained for the composite and bovine samples, respectively, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the approach to deliver the sub-millimetre accuracy required for the application."
pub.1017757986,In vivo kinematics of a robot-assisted uni- and multi-compartmental knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: There is great interest in providing reliable and durable treatments for one- and two-compartment arthritic degeneration of the cruciate-ligament intact knee. One approach is to resurface only the diseased compartments with discrete unicompartmental components, retaining the undamaged compartment(s). However, placing multiple small implants into the knee presents a greater surgical challenge than total knee arthroplasty, so it is not certain that the natural knee mechanics can be maintained or restored. The goal of this study was to determine whether near-normal knee kinematics can be obtained with a robot-assisted multi-compartmental knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: Thirteen patients with 15 multi-compartmental knee arthroplasties using haptic robotic-assisted bone preparation were involved in this study. Nine subjects received a medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), three subjects received a medial UKA and patellofemoral (PF) arthroplasty, and three subjects received medial and lateral bi-unicondylar arthroplasty. Knee motions were recorded using video-fluoroscopy an average of 13 months (6-29 months) after surgery during stair and kneeling activities. The three-dimensional position and orientation of the implant components were determined using model-image registration techniques.
RESULTS: Knee kinematics during maximum flexion kneeling showed femoral external rotation and posterior lateral condylar translation. All knees showed femoral external rotation and posterior condylar translation with flexion during the step activity. Knees with medial UKA and PF arthroplasty showed the most femoral external rotation and posterior translation, and knees with bicondylar UKA showed the least.
CONCLUSIONS: Knees with accurately placed uni- or bi-compartmental arthroplasty exhibited stable knee kinematics consistent with intact and functioning cruciate ligaments. The patterns of tibiofemoral motion were more similar to natural knees than commonly has been observed in knees with total knee arthroplasty. Larger series are required to confirm these as general observations, but the present results demonstrate the potential to restore or maintain closer-to-normal knee kinematics by retaining intact structures and compartments."
pub.1105072621,Implant orientation accuracy of a hand-held robotic partial knee replacement system over conventional technique in a cadaveric test,"Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty (UKA) is a minimally-invasive surgical procedure for treating isolated compartmental knee osteoarthritis. Accurate implant placement is crucial for a successful UKA procedure. Previous work has shown the improvement in UKA by using robotic systems. Here, we present the implant alignment accuracy of a hand-held robotic UKA system compared with a conventional manual UKA system for 12 cadaver specimens. Two surgeons carried out equal number of medial UKAs with robotic UKA on one knee and the manual UKA on the other knee. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained for each cadaveric model. The final implant positions were identified in the postoperative CT scan. The implant orientations were compared with the planned implant positions to obtain femoral and tibial implant alignment errors. Our results show that the femoral flexion, varus, and rotation root mean square errors for the robotic and conventional approach were 1.23°, 2.81°, 1.62° and 7.52°, 6.25°, 5.0°, respectively. The tibial slope and varus errors for the robotic and conventional approaches were 2.41°, 2.96° and 4.06°, 1.8°, respectively. We did not find any statistical significant difference (p = .05) in the performance of the two surgeons. We conclude that the hand-held robotic UKA system offers significant improvement in the final implant placement."

METHODS: Ten male small-tailed Han sheep were used in this study. Sheep were imaged by computed tomography scan before and after bone resection and the cutting errors between actual bone preparation and preoperative planning of the femur and tibia in three dimensions were measured.
RESULTS: The overall accuracies after surgery compared with that from preoperative surgical planning of the left and right femurs were 1.93 ± 1.02° and 1.93 ± 1.23°, respectively. Additionally, similarly high overall accuracies for the left and right tibia of 1.26 ± 1.04 and 1.68 ± 0.92°, respectively, were obtained. The gap distances of the distal cut, anterior chamfer, anterior cut, posterior chamfer and posterior cut on the medial side were 0.47 ± 0.35 mm, 0.41 ± 0.37 mm, 0.12 ± 0.26 mm, 0.41 ± 0.44 mm and 0.12 ± 0.23 mm, respectively. No intraoperative complications, such as intraoperative fracture, massive bleeding or death, occurred.
CONCLUSION: This new HURWA robotic-assisted TKA system is an accurate and safe tool for TKA surgery based on the sheep model."
pub.1169454464,Patient Perceptions and Interest in Robotic-Assisted Total Joint Arthroplasty,"Background: Robotic-assisted total joint arthroplasty (rTJA) has growing interest among patients and surgeons. However, patient interest in and perceptions of rTJA have not been well explored. We sought to investigate the influence of patient demographics on interest in rTJA and patient perceptions regarding rTJA.
Methods: Patients presenting for their initial adult reconstruction consultation received an optional anonymous survey prior to seeing the provider. Patient sociodemographic parameters were recorded. Additional questions assessed interest in and perceptions surrounding rTJA. Results were analyzed to determine whether patient factors correlated with survey responses.
Results: A total of 360 patients participated. Analysis of responses revealed 77.8% of patients were interested in rTJA. Interest level positively correlated with patient age (R<sub>s</sub> = 0.139, <i>P</i> = .010), education level (R<sub>s</sub> = 0.168, <i>P</i> = .002), household income (R<sub>s</sub> = 0.274, <i>P</i> &lt; .001), and White race (F = 4.157, <i>P</i> = .016). At least 100 patients believed rTJA was easier and more accurate, but more expensive and had a significant learning curve for the surgeon. Over 100 patients believed robots were capable of independently performing most or all of the rTJA operation.
Conclusions: Patient interest in rTJA varies between patients. Many patients have an incomplete understanding of rTJA, and orthopaedic surgeons should address patient perceptions during surgical consultation.

pub.1148310907,Cup placement in primary total hip arthroplasty: how to get it right without navigation or robotics,"Acetabular component orientation and position are important factors in the short- and long-term outcomes of total hip arthroplasty. Different definitions of inclination and anteversion are used in the orthopaedic literature and surgeons should be aware of these differences and understand their relationships. There is no universal safe zone. Preoperative planning should be used to determine the optimum position and orientation of the cup and assess spinopelvic characteristics to adjust cup orientation accordingly. A peripheral reaming technique leads to a more accurate restoration of the centre of rotation with less variability compared with a standard reaming technique. Several intraoperative landmarks can be used to control the version of the cup, the most commonly used and studied is the transverse acetabular ligament. The use of an inclinometer reduces the variability associated with the use of freehand or mechanical alignment guides."
pub.1046861264,The Valgus Stress Radiograph Does Not Determine the Full Extent of Correction of Deformity Prior to Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Routine preoperative stress radiographs have been advocated, in part, to determine ""full correctability"" of deformities before proceeding with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) despite limited data supporting their utility. Fifty consecutive patients undergoing medial UKA with robotic navigation were studied. In 20° of flexion, significantly greater correctability was achieved after removal of osteophytes by an additional 1.8°, with a mean corrected alignment of 2.5° varus. Seventy-four percent of knees were not correctable to neutral alignment or more. In conclusion, preoperative stress radiographs have overstated value in patients undergoing medial UKA since the full extent of correctability of varus deformity cannot be determined until after removal of osteophytes and since most deformities are not fully correctable to neutral in UKA.

pub.1130455429,Accuracy of tibial component positioning in the robotic arm assisted versus conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Our study aims to determine the planned accuracy of the tibial component placement in robotic arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) versus the conventional jig based UKA of the initial cases done in India for the first time with this particular robotic system.Materials & Methods: Study group 1 consisted of patients who underwent robotic arm (MAKO, Stryker, USA) assisted UKA. Group 2 consists of patients who underwent a standard conventional jig based (Oxford knee, Biomet, UK). Post-operative radiographs were taken to determine the Tibial Implant position and orientation which were compared to their preoperative plan respectively by two independent observers. The mean error value was obtained for both study groups respectively and compared to determine the accuracy of the post-operative tibial implant placement.
RESULTS: In the Robotic arm assisted UKA, the deviation of post-operative varus angle from preoperative planned angle was about 0.43° and post-operative Tibial slope alignment differed from preoperative plan was 0.41°. In the Conventional UKA group post-operative varus angle differed from preoperative planned angle by about 2.12° and post-operative Tibial slope alignment deviation from preoperative plan was 2.47°.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic arm assisted system was more accurate compared to the conventional jig-based technique in achieving the planned orientation and alignment of the tibial implant in the initial learning phase of this particular Robotic System used for the first time in India.

pub.1143968996,Makoplasty medial unicondylar knee replacement: Correction or postoperative angle matters?,"INTRODUCTION: Various considerations prevail around optimal postoperative varus deformity, correction angle and physiological constitutional varus deformity. The goal of our present study was to understand correlation between these parameters and their influence over Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index scale (WOMAC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive robotic-arm-assisted medial onlay fixed bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in 143 knees studied. WOMAC score was recorded preoperatively and at specific intervals after surgery for consecutive 2 years.
RESULTS: Mean preoperative and postoperative varus deformities were 10.2° and 4.8°, respectively, and mean correction angle was 5.4°. The preoperative varus and correction angles were found well correlated (r = 0.815). The amount of improvement in the WOMAC total score was not influenced by the postoperative varus angle.
CONCLUSION: The correction angle has a stronger correlation with preoperative varus deformity, and postoperative varus deformity does not imply favourable clinical outcomes."
pub.1173505997,Surgeon-Applied Stress and a Ligament Tensor Instrument Provide a Similar Assessment of Preresection Flexion Laxity During Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) allows surgeons to perform intraoperative soft tissue laxity assessments prior to bone resections and is used to alter resections to achieve gap balance. This study compared 2 techniques for flexion gap laxity assessment during RA-TKA.
Methods: A prospective study of 50 primary RA-TKAs performed by a single surgeon was conducted between February and October 2023. Following full exposure, anterior tibial dislocation, and osteophyte removal, maximal medial and lateral compartment flexion laxity was quantified to the nearest 0.5 mm by the robotic system using a dynamic, surgeon-applied stress (SURGEON). This data was used to plan a balanced flexion gap by adjusting the femoral component size, rotation, and anterior-posterior translation. Flexion laxity was quantified again after distal femoral and proximal tibial resections using a ligament tensor instrument (TENSOR). These new data were used to plan for the same desired flexion gap using the same variables. Paired-samples <i>t</i>-tests and a simple linear regression were used for analysis.
Results: Both methods produced near-identical recommendations for femoral component sizing (mean deviation 0.06 sizes, range -1 to +1 size; <i>P</i> = .569), rotation (deviation mean 1.0°, range -3.0° to +3.0°; <i>P =</i> .741), and anterior-posterior translation (deviation mean 0.13 mm, range -0.5 to +0.5 mm, <i>P</i> = .785). SURGEON femoral component rotation predicted TENSOR rotation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.157; 95% confidence interval = 0.124, 0.633; <i>P</i> = .004).
Conclusions: Assessing flexion laxity with a surgeon-applied stress vs a ligament tensor produced near-identical laxity data in RA-TKA, suggesting surgeons may comfortably choose either technique as a reliable method.

pub.1164499424,New measurement technique for restoration of the trochlear offset after image-based robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a reliability study,"INTRODUCTION: The new concepts in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) tend to improve the alignment and ligament balancing after TKA. Nevertheless, the assessment of the anterior compartment is difficult. The purpose of this study was to describe a new measurement technique of trochlear offset restoration on CT-scan after primary robotic-assisted TKA and assess its reliability and repeatability.
METHOD: This monocentric study assessed the trochlear offset restoration on a CT scan after 20 robotic-assisted TKA. To evaluate the trochlear offset restoration, we measured the depth difference between the native and the prosthetic trochlea. Four sequential positions were assessed on the trochlea: at full extension, at 30°, 70°, and 90° flexion. For each of these positions, we compared the highest point of the lateral native condyle and the lateral prosthetic condyle, the highest point of the medial native condyle and the medial prosthetic condyle, the deepest point of the native trochlear groove and the prosthetic trochlea. Two independent reviewers performed the measurements to assess their reliability. To determine intraobserver variability, the first observer performed the measurements twice.
RESULTS: The mean age was 67.3 years old ± 8.3. Mean values of the trochlear offset restoration for the medial condyle, trochlear groove and lateral condyle were respectively: 1.0 mm ± 1.6, 1.1 mm ± 1.5, -2.7 mm ± 2.3 in full extension; -3.5 mm ± 1.7, -1.5 mm ± 1.7, -3.9 mm ± 3.9 at 30° flexion; -5.1 mm ± 1.8, 2.1 mm ± 2.7, -3.8 mm ± 1.8 at 70° flexion; 2.0 mm ± 1.4 and 3.1 mm ± 1.5 for the medial and lateral condyles at 90° flexion. The radiographic measurements showed very good to excellent intra-observer and inter-observer agreements with mean kappa values of 0.92 and 0.74.
CONCLUSION: We present a novel measurement technique on CT scan for evaluating the restoration of the trochlear offset after TKA, demonstrating excellent inter and intra-observer reliability."
pub.1152052010,The Lateral Malleolus Is a Simple and Reliable Landmark that Can Be Used to Reliably Perform Restricted Kinematically Aligned Total Knee Arthroplasty—Anatomical and Clinical Studies in Japanese Population,"In restricted kinematic alignment total knee arthroplasty (TKA), bone resection is performed within a safe range to help protect against failure from extreme alignments. Patient-specific instrumentation, navigations, and robotics are often required for restricting bone cuts within a specified safe zone. We hypothesized that the lateral malleolus could be used as a landmark for restricting the tibial osteotomy using a mechanical jig. Here, we examine its feasibility in anatomical and clinical settings. We studied long-leg standing radiographs of 114 consecutive patients (228 knees) who underwent knee arthroplasty in our institution. We measured the lateral malleolus angle (LMA), the angle between the tibial axis and the line between the center of the knee and the lateral surface of the lateral malleolus. The medial proximal tibial angle was also measured before and after restricted kinematic alignment TKA under restriction with reference to the lateral malleolus. Mean LMA was 5.5 ± 0.5 degrees. This was relatively consistent and independent of patient's height, weight, and body mass index. The lateral malleolus is a reliable bone landmark that can be used to recognize approximately 5.5 degrees of varus intraoperatively. A surgeon can use this as a restriction of the tibial varus cut up to 6 degrees without the requirement for expensive assistive technologies."

A total of 120 patients who undergone TKA were randomly assigned into group D + R (dexmedetomidine combined with ropivacaine) and group R (only ropivacaine), with 60 cases in each group. The pain scores at rest and exercise at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively. The occurrence of delirium on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 postoperatively were measured, and the sleep quality was evaluated before surgery, the night of surgery, and 24 h postoperatively to observe the occurrence of postoperative complications. The Visual analogu scale (VAS) of group D + R at 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively were lower than those of group R in both rest and exercise states. The incidence of postoperative delirium in group D + R was lower than that in group R on Day 1 and Day 2. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores in group D + R were lower than those in group R. There was no significant difference in postoperative adverse reactions between the two groups. Dexmedetomidine combined with ropivacaine improves postoperative analgesia and sleep quality, and alleviates the occurrence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients with TKA."

pub.1039130505,Determination of optimal non‐invasive patient fixation methods for use in robotic hip replacement surgery—an in vitro study,"BACKGROUND: A robotic system for the implantation of a total hip arthroplasty (THA) is currently under development. One of the goals of this system is non-invasive patient fixation, aiding the robotic system by an infrared tracking system. To determine the extent of fixation that can be achieved by non-invasive methods, an in vitro study was performed.
METHODS: In cadaver testing, different non-invasive fixation methods (Arthrex leg holder with tourniquet mechanism; arthroscopic leg holder with disposable foam inserts; gynaecological leg holder; Goepel knee crutch) were evaluated under load in different directions.
RESULTS: Deviation was measured in the range 0.33-18.1 mm with up to 20 N load. The testing showed the pneumatic leg holder system to provide the highest stability, followed by an arthroscopic leg holder system with foam inserts.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of a leg holder with foam inserts produced a stability that should enable tracking of the remaining deviation by the navigation system. We will therefore use this method in our future development of the robotic milling tool."
pub.1107038195,No difference in outcomes and gait analysis between mechanical and kinematic knee alignment methods using robotic total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes and perform gait analysis during walking to identify differences in kinematic and kinetic parameters between two alignment methods in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned to undergo robotic-assisted TKA using either mechanical (30 patients) or kinematic (30 patients) alignment method. Clinical outcomes including varus and valgus laxities, range of motion (ROM), Hospital for Specific Surgery (HSS), Knee Society Score (KSS), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) scores and radiological outcomes were evaluated. Gait analysis of 3D spatiotemporal, kinetic, and kinematic parameters during walking was then performed for 10 age and gender matched patients of each group to determine differences between the two alignment methods.
RESULTS: The median follow-up duration of the mechanical method group was 8.7 (range 8.1-9.4) years and that of the kinematic method group was 8.4 (range 8.0-9.1) years. Clinical outcomes between the two groups showed no significant difference in HSS, WOMAC, ROM, KS pain, or function score at the last follow-up. No significant difference in varus and valgus laxity assessment, mechanical alignment of the lower limb, or perioperative complications was shown between the two groups. In gait analysis, no significant difference in kinematic or kinetic parameters was found except for varus angle (p < 0.05) and mediolateral ground reaction force (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study show that mechanical and kinematic knee alignment methods provide comparable clinical and radiological outcomes after robotic total knee arthroplasty with an average follow-up of 8 years. There were no functional difference during walking between the two alignment methods either.

pub.1173157071,Evaluation of the External Rotation of the Femur Component in Functionally Aligned Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background The conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for grade 4 knee arthritis lacks individualized strategies for determining femur component rotation, contributing to suboptimal clinical outcomes and heightened patient dissatisfaction. Methods One hundred consecutive active robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) patients were retrospectively evaluated. The control group is the patients undergoing conventional TKA for grade 4 arthritis of the knee joint, where the femoral component is placed in a fixed 3-degree external rotation. The study aimed to explore the relationships between the posterior femoral axis of the functionally aligned TKA (FAA), the trans-epicondylar axis (TEA), and the posterior condylar axis (PCA). Specifically, it investigated whether there is a statistically significant difference in femoral component rotation between the functionally aligned TKA (FTKA) and the conventional 3-degrees of external rotation of the femoral component used in traditional TKA (C-TKA). Internal rotation is indicated by a negative value for the femur component. A student's t-test was employed to compare mean rotation values between FTKA and C-TKA, with a p-value below 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results A total of 100 patients (male: female, 11:89) were studied. The FAA was externally rotated in relation to the TEA (mean 1.451°, SD 1.023°, p-value <0.0001). As regards the PCA, the FAA was externally rotated (mean 2.36°, SD 2.221°, p-value 0.0002). These findings demonstrate a statistically significant difference in femoral component rotation between FTKA and C-TKA. Clinically, no patellofemoral complications or premature loosening were observed at one-year follow-up. Conclusion Functional alignment TKA technique resulted in external rotation of the femur component with respect to TEA and PCA. This negates the null hypothesis, indicating a statistically significant difference amongst the femur component rotation implanted according to the FTKA concept with robotic assisted technology and C-TKA."
pub.1129743519,Management of failed UKA to TKA: conventional versus robotic-assisted conversion technique,"BackgroundFailure of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a distressing and technically challenging complication. Conventional conversion techniques (CCT) with rods and jigs have produced varying results. A robotic-assisted conversion technique (RCT) is an unexplored, though possibly advantageous, alternative. We compare our reconstructive outcomes between conventional and robotic methods in the management of failed UKA.MethodsThirty-four patients with a failed UKA were retrospectively reviewed. Patients underwent conversion total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with either a CCT or RCT. Seventeen patients were included in each group. All procedures were done by a single surgeon at a single institution, with a mean time to follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 1 to 12). The primary outcome measures were the need for augments and polyethylene thickness. Secondary outcome measures were complications, need for revision, estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay, and operative time.ResultsThe mean polyethylene thickness was 12 mm (range, 9 to 15) in the CCT group and 10 mm (range, 9 to 14) in the RCT groups, with no statistical difference between the two groups (P = 0.07). A statistically significant difference, however, was present in the use of augments. In the CCT group, five out of 17 knees required augments, whereas none of the 17 knees in the RCT group required augments (P = 0.04). Procedurally, robotic-assisted surgery progressed uneventfully, even with metal artifact noted on the preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans. Computer mapping of the residual bone surface after implant removal was a helpful guide in minimizing resection depth. No further revisions or reoperations were performed in either group.ConclusionsRobotic-assisted conversion TKA is technically feasible and potentially advantageous. In the absence of normal anatomic landmarks to guide conventional methods, the preoperative CT scans were unexpectedly helpful in establishing mechanical alignment and resection depth. In this limited series, RCT does not seem to be inferior to CCT. Further investigation of outcomes is warranted."
pub.1150493356,Improved joint line and posterior offset restoration in primary total knee replacement using a robotic-assisted surgical technique: An international multi-centre retrospective analysis of matched cohorts,"BACKGROUND: Accurate restoration of joint line height and posterior offset in primary Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) have been shown to be important factors in post-operative range of movement and function. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of joint line and posterior offset restoration in a group of patients that underwent robotic-assisted TKA (raTKA). A matched cohort of patients that underwent a TKA using a conventional jig-based technique was assessed for comparison. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between groups.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 120 patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis that received a TKA using the Navio Surgical System (n = 60), or Conventional manual TKA (n = 60). Procedures were performed between 1 January 2019 and 1 October 2019 at six different centres. Joint line height and posterior offset was measured pre-operatively and post-operatively on calibrated weight bearing plain radiographs of the knee. Two observers performed measurements using validated measuring tools. A BMI and age-matched cohort of patients that underwent TKA using a conventional technique in the same six centres were assessed for comparison. Mean values, standard deviations and confidence intervals are presented for change and absolute change in joint line height and posterior offset. Student's t-test was used to compare the changes between techniques.
RESULTS: Patients that underwent robotic-assisted TKA had joint line height and posterior offset restored more accurately than patients undergoing TKA using a conventional technique. Average change from pre-operative measurement in joint line height using raTKA was -0.38mm [95% CI: -0.79 to 0.03] vs 0.91 [0.14 to 1.68] with the conventional technique. Average absolute change in joint line height using raTKA was 1.96mm [1.74 to 2.18] vs 4.00mm [3.68 to 4.32] with the conventional technique. Average change in posterior offset using raTKA was 0.08mm [-0.40 to 0.56] vs 1.64mm [2.47 to 0.81] with the conventional technique. Average absolute change in posterior offset with raTKA was 2.19mm [1.92 to 2.46] vs 4.24mm [3.79 to 4.69] with the conventional technique. There was a significant difference when comparing absolute change in joint line height and posterior offset between groups (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted primary TKA restores the joint line height and posterior offset more accurately than conventional jig-based techniques."

AREAS COVERED: In this paper a review of the available information on AI in hemophilia has been performed, to better understand the relationship between hemophilia and AI. Regarding the physical elements of AI (robotics), robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty and laparoscopic prostatectomy have been successfully performed in hemophilic patients. Concerning the virtual elements of AI, machine learning (ML) in hemophilia has been used with encouraging results for the following: prediction of disease severity, recognition of factor V as an essential modifier of thrombin generation in mild to moderate hemophilia A, development hemophilia-focused user-centered app, gene therapy, estimation of the risk of myocardial infarction, and identification of CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease off-target for the treatment of hemophilia. AI is an emerging reality that can produce a paradigm shift in hemophilia.
EXPERT OPINION: Various AI systems can facilitate clinical care for professionals, improving the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia. However, AI systems still have many limitations and raise operational and ethical issues. AI systems should be integrated prudently and reasonably within the practitioner's workflow."
pub.1147579335,Noise exposure during robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"The aim of the study was to examine the noise exposure for operating theater staff during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with three different robot systems. There is already evidence that noise exposure during TKA performed manually exceeds recommended guidelines for occupational noise. Therefore, if surgical staff is exposed to it for several years, the development of noise-inducing hearing loss (NIHL) is significantly increased. To investigate the noise exposure during robot-assisted TKA, the study measured the average noise and the peak sound pressure during TKA with MAKO robot (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States), NAVIO robot (Smith and Nephew, London, Great Britain), and CORI robot (Smith and Nephew, London, Great Britain) using a class 1 sound level meter. Each robot system exceeds the recommended guidelines from the national institute for occupational safety and health. While the MAKO robot had the highest average sound level (93.18 dB(A)) of the three robot systems (NAVIO: 88.88 dB(A), CORI: 89.38 dB(A)), the peak sound level was the highest with the NAVIO Robot (134.48 dB(C)) compared to the MAKO Robot (128.98 dB(C)) and CORI robot (126.48 dB(C)). Robot-assisted TKA is a risk factor for NIHL, like manually performed TKA. Further research for decreasing the noise exposure during TKA is needed to minimize the hearing loss in operating theater staff."
pub.1132950083,Robotic‐assisted Unicompartmental knee Arthroplasty optimizes joint line restitution better than conventional surgery,"PURPOSE: To compare joint line restoration after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) between conventional and robotic-assisted surgery. Previous studies have shown that joint line distalization can lead to higher failure rates. The hypothesis was that robotic-assisted UKA is associated with less femoral component distalization and a precise tibial cut, which allows a more anatomical restitution of the knee joint line.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing medial or lateral UKA between May 2018 and March 2020. Preoperative and postoperative radiologic assessment of the joint line was performed by two observers, using three different methods, one for tibial slope and one for tibial resection. Robotic assisted UKA and conventional UKA groups were compared.
RESULTS: Sixty UKA were included, of which 48 (77.42%) were medial. Robotic-assisted UKA were 40 (64.52%) and 22(35.48%) were conventional The distalization of the femoral component was higher in the conventional group despite the method of measurement used In both Weber methods, the difference was statistically different: Conventional 2.3 (0.9 to 5.6) v/s Robotic 1.5 (- 1.1 to 4.1) (p =0.0025*). A higher proportion of patients achieved a femoral component position ≤ two millimeters from the joint line using robotic-assisted UKA compared to the conventional technique . No statistical difference between robotic-assisted and conventional UKA was found in tibial resection and slope.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted UKA shows a better rate of joint line restoration due to less femoral component distalization than conventional UKA. No difference was found in the amount of tibial resection between groups in this study.

However, the clinical outcomes of this procedure relative to manual THA are limited in the literature. This study compared robotic-arm assisted (RAA) THA and manual THA at minimum 2-year follow-up. Data were collected prospectively on all THAs performed from July 2011 to January 2015. Patients were included if they underwent RAA primary THA for idiopathic osteo-arthritis and had minimum follow-up of 2 years. The following patient-reported outcomes were compared: Harris Hip Score (HHS), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12), visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and satisfaction. Postoperative radio-graphs were analyzed for cup inclination, cup version, leg-length discrepancy, and global offset. Robotic-arm assisted THA patients were matched 1:1 with manual THA patients for age, sex, body mass index, and surgical approach. Each study group included 85 patients. There were no significant differences in the demographic factors between the groups. Both HHS and FJS-12 were significantly higher in the RAA group at minimum 2-year follow-up. The VAS score was lower in the RAA group, but this difference was not statistically significant. A significantly higher proportion of patients were in the Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones for cup orientation. There was no difference between the groups in patient satisfaction. Robotic-arm assisted THA yielded improved short-term patient outcomes compared with manual THA and higher likelihood of cup placement in the safe zones. No differences were found regarding VAS scores, patient satisfaction, complication rates, or subsequent revisions between groups. [<i>Orthopedics</i>. 2021;44(2):e236-e242.]."
pub.1139662992,Joint line is restored in robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty performed with a tibia-based functional alignment,"IntroductionFunctional alignment (FA) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been introduced to restore the native joint line obliquity, respect the joint line height and minimize the need of soft tissue releases. The purpose of this study was to assess the intraoperative joint line alignment and compare it with the preoperative epiphyseal orientation of the femur and tibia in patients undergoing robotic-arm-assisted (RA)-TKA using FA.Materials and MethodsThis retrospective study included a consecutive series of patients undergoing RA-TKA between February 2019 and February 2021. The joint line orientation of the femur and tibia in the three-dimensions was calculated and classified on preoperative CT-scans and compared with the intraoperative implant alignment. The tibial cut was performed according to the tibial preoperative anatomy. The femoral cuts were fine-tuned based on tensioned soft tissues, aiming for balanced medial and lateral gaps in flexion and extension.ResultsA total of 115 RA-TKAs were assessed. On average, the tibial component was placed at 1.8° varus (SD 1.3), while the femur was placed at 0.8° valgus (SD 2.2) and 0.6° external rotation (SD 2.6) relative to the surgical transepicondylar axis. Moderate to strong, statistically significant relationships were described between preoperative tibial coronal alignment and tibial cut orientation (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001), preoperative femoral orientation in the coronal and axial planes and intraoperative femoral cuts alignment (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001 and r = 0.5, p < 0.0001, respectively). One case (0.9%) of slight tibial component varus subsidence was reported 45-days post-operatively, but implant revision was not necessary.ConclusionsThe proposed robotic-assisted functional technique for TKA alignment, with a restricted tibial component coronal alignment, based on the preoperative phenotype and femoral component positioning as dictated by the soft tissues, provided joint line respecting resections. Further studies are needed to assess long-term implant survivorship, patient satisfaction and alignment-related failures."
pub.1139210121,Results of Robotic-Assisted Versus Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty at 2-Year Follow-up,"Robotic-assisted technology has been developed to optimize the consistency and accuracy of bony cuts, implant placements, and knee alignments for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With recently developed designs, there is a need for the reporting longer than initial patient outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare manual and robotic-assisted TKA at 2-year minimum for: (1) aseptic survivorship; (2) reduced Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (r-WOMAC) pain, physical function, and total scores; (3) surgical and medical complications; and (4) radiographic assessments for progressive radiolucencies. We compared 80 consecutive cementless robotic-assisted to 80 consecutive cementless manual TKAs. Patient preoperative r-WOMAC and demographics (e.g., age, sex, and body mass index) were not found to be statistically different. Surgical data and medical records were reviewed for aseptic survivorship, medical, and surgical complications. Patients were administered an r-WOMAC survey preoperatively and at 2-year postoperatively. Mean r-WOMAC pain, physical function, and total scores were tabulated and compared using Student's <i>t</i>-tests. Radiographs were reviewed serially throughout patient's postoperative follow-up. A <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. The aseptic failure rates were 1.25 and 5.0% for the robotic-assisted and manual cohorts, respectively. Patients in the robotic-assisted cohort had significantly improved 2-year postoperative r-WOMAC mean pain (1 ± 2 vs. 2 ± 3 points, <i>p</i> = 0.02), mean physical function (2 ± 3 vs. 4 ± 5 points, <i>p</i> = 0.009), and mean total scores (4 ± 5 vs, 6 ± 7 points, <i>p</i> = 0.009) compared with the manual TKA. Surgical and medical complications were similar in the two cohorts. Only one patient in the manual cohort had progressive radiolucencies on radiographic assessment. Robotic-assisted TKA patients demonstrated improved 2-year postoperative outcomes when compared with manual patients. Further studies could include multiple surgeons and centers to increase the generalizability of these results. The results of this study indicate that patients who undergo robotic-assisted TKA may have improved 2-year postoperative outcomes."

pub.1169150331,Financial Conflicts of Interest and Industry Funding are Associated With Conclusions Favorable to New Technologies: A Review of Published Economic Analyses in Hip and Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: New technologies in hip and knee arthroplasty are commonly evaluated using cost-effectiveness analyses and similar economic assessments. There is a wide variation in the methodology of these studies, introducing the potential for bias. The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between potential financial conflicts of interest (COI) and the outcomes of economic analyses. We hypothesized that authors' COI and industry funding would be associated with conclusions favorable to a new technology.
METHODS: Economic analyses making cost-effectiveness or economic implementation claims on patient-specific instrumentation, robotics, and implants used in hip and knee arthroplasty published from 2010 to 2022 were identified. Papers were evaluated to determine if conclusions were favorable to the new technology being studied. Fisher's exact test was utilized to determine the relationship between the presence of COI and an article's conclusions.
RESULTS: Of 43 eligible articles, 76.7% were cost-effectiveness analyses, 23.2% were cost analyses, and 67.4% of articles had conclusions favorable to a technology. Of the 29 articles with favorable conclusions, 26 had an author with a financial COI (89.7%), and 14 had industry funding (48.3%). Of the 33 articles with a financial COI, 26 (78.8%) had favorable conclusions, and of the 16 articles with industry funding, 14 (87.5%) had favorable conclusions. Fisher's exact test revealed a statistically significant association between an article having favorable conclusions and the presence of an author's COI or industry funding (odds ratio, 13.5; 95% CI [confidence interval], 2.3 to 79.9; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS: Financial COIs were present in 79.1% of lower extremity arthroplasty economic analyses on technologies and were associated with an article having conclusions favorable to the new technology. Surgeons and decision-makers should be aware of the variability and assumptions in these studies and the potential bias of the conclusions."
pub.1128127230,Early Economic Analysis of Robotic-Assisted Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty May Be Cost Effective in Patients with End-Stage Osteoarthritis,"Unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA), as an alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA), has been shown to be an effective option for patients with single-compartment end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Implant survival is contingent upon proper alignment, which has been improved with the advent of robotic-assisted surgery (r-UKA), but whether this outweighs the increased cost of the robotic-assist device has not been analyzed in the literature. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mid-term cost-effectiveness of r-UKA compared with UKA with traditional instrumentation (t-UKA) in the United States. A cost-effectiveness analysis using a four-state Markov model was performed using data from the 2018 National Joint Registry of England and Wales and a retrospective multicenter, cohort study on a cohort of 65-year-old patients having undergone r-UKA. The main outcome was cost per revision avoided and sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of using different model assumptions on the results. The Markov model illustrated that the benefit derived from r-UKA versus t-UKA was beneficial from a payer's perspective. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $14,737 per revision avoided in a facility seeing 100 patients a year. Case volume was shown to be the primary variable affecting cost-effectiveness, with the value of r-UKA directly increasing with higher case volumes. Cost-effectiveness analyses demonstrated that the use of r-UKA is an effective alternative to t-UKA in patients with single-compartment knee osteoarthritis. While this study could benefit from longer follow-up clinical studies to illustrate the benefits of r-UKAs beyond the current 2 years time horizon, r-UKAs remained cost-effective, even after investigating several different assumptions."
pub.1120304458,"Imageless, robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty combined with a robotic tensioning system can help predict and achieve accurate postoperative ligament balance","BACKGROUND: Achieving balanced gaps is a key surgical goal in total knee arthroplasty, yet most methods rely on subjective surgeon feel and experience to assess and achieve knee balance intraoperatively. Our objective was to evaluate the ability to quantitatively plan and achieve a balanced knee throughout the range of motion using robotic-assisted instrumentation in a tibia-first, gap-balancing technique.
METHODS: A robotic-assisted, gap-balancing technique was used in 121 consecutive knees. After resection of the proximal tibia, a computer-controlled tensioning device was inserted into the knee joint and the pre-femoral-resection knee gaps were acquired dynamically throughout flexion under controlled load. Predicted gap profiles were used to plan the femoral implant by adjusting the implant alignment and position within certain boundaries to achieve a balanced knee throughout the range of flexion. Femoral cuts were then made according to this plan using a miniature robotic-assisted cutting guide. The tensioning device used to measure the pre-femoral-resection gaps was then reinserted into the joint to quantify the final gap balance under known tension. The final gap profiles were then compared with the predictive gap plans.
RESULTS: The overall root mean square error between the predicted and achieved gaps was 1.3 mm and 1.5 mm for the medial and lateral sides, respectively. Use of robotic assistance resulted in over 90% of knees having mediolateral balance within 2 mm across the flexion range. Gaps at 0° flexion were 2 mm smaller than the gaps at 90°. This difference decreased to less than 1 mm when comparing the tibiofemoral gaps at 10°, 45°, and 90°.
CONCLUSIONS: Imageless, robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty accurately predicts postoperative gaps before femoral resections. This allows surgeons to virtually plan femoral implant alignment and optimize gap balance throughout the range of motion. The accurate prediction of gaps throughout the arc of motion combined with precise, robotically assisted femoral resection produces accurate postoperative ligament balance consistently."
pub.1111052246,An assessment of early functional rehabilitation and hospital discharge in conventional versus robotic-arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a prospective cohort study.,"AIMS: The objectives of this study were to compare postoperative pain, analgesia requirements, inpatient functional rehabilitation, time to hospital discharge, and complications in patients undergoing conventional jig-based unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) versus robotic-arm assisted UKA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 146 patients with symptomatic medial compartment knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary UKA performed by a single surgeon. This included 73 consecutive patients undergoing conventional jig-based mobile bearing UKA, followed by 73 consecutive patients receiving robotic-arm assisted fixed bearing UKA. All surgical procedures were performed using the standard medial parapatellar approach for UKA, and all patients underwent the same postoperative rehabilitation programme. Postoperative pain scores on the numerical rating scale and opiate analgesia consumption were recorded until discharge. Time to attainment of predefined functional rehabilitation outcomes, hospital discharge, and postoperative complications were recorded by independent observers.
RESULTS: Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with reduced postoperative pain (p < 0.001), decreased opiate analgesia requirements (p < 0.001), shorter time to straight leg raise (p < 0.001), decreased number of physiotherapy sessions (p < 0.001), and increased maximum knee flexion at discharge (p < 0.001) compared with conventional jig-based UKA. Mean time to hospital discharge was reduced in robotic UKA compared with conventional UKA (42.5 hours (sd 5.9) vs 71.1 hours (sd 14.6), respectively; p < 0.001). There was no difference in postoperative complications between the two groups within 90 days' follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with decreased postoperative pain, reduced opiate analgesia requirements, improved early functional rehabilitation, and shorter time to hospital discharge compared with conventional jig-based UKA."
pub.1092458032,THINK surgical TSolution-One® (Robodoc) total knee arthroplasty,"THINK Surgical TSolution-One<sup>®</sup> is an active-autonomous, image-based, robotic milling system which enables the surgeon to attain a consistently accurate implant component positioning. The TSolution-One<sup>®</sup> system is capable of achieving this through an image-based preoperative planning system which allows the surgeon to create, view and analyse the surgical outcome in 3D. The accuracy and precision of component positioning have been attributed to the following factors: customized distal femoral resection, accurate determination of the femoral rotational alignment, minimization of errors and maintenance of bone temperature with robotic milling. Despite all these advantages, there is still a paucity of long-term, high-quality data that demonstrates the efficacy of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

pub.1171076843,Return to Sports in Patients Aged 50 Years or Younger After Robotic-Assisted Patellofemoral Arthroplasty: A 10-Year Experience Reporting High Clinical Benefits and High Patient Satisfaction With Return to an Active Lifestyle,"BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on return to sports and patient psychometric ratings of success after patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) in younger patients with high expectations to return to an active lifestyle.
PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this article was to determine the role of PFA and its success in meeting patient expectations regarding the return to low-impact recreational sports and an active lifestyle in younger, active patients. It was hypothesized that PFA would allow younger patients to return to low-impact sports and an active lifestyle and achieve high patient psychometric ratings.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
METHODS: In this 10-year prospective study (2009-2018), robotic-assisted PFA was performed on 44 patients (32 women and 12 men; n = 51 consecutive knees), with a mean age of 37.2 years (range, 21-50 years). The follow-up rate was 98%, with a mean of 5.3 years (range, 2-9.3 years). Primary clinical outcomes were as follows: the validated Cincinnati Knee Rating System sports activity and symptom rating scales, patient psychometric ratings of the substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS). Secondary outcomes were the Cincinnati Knee Rating System occupational rating, visual analog pain scale, and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Survivorship was defined by conversion to total knee replacement (TKR).
RESULTS: Before PFA, 78% of patients (35/45 knees) were symptomatic and unable to perform recreational sports, with only 20% of patients (9/45 knees) performing some low-impact sports. After PFA, 80% of patients (36/45 knees) were able to perform low-impact sports, and 7% (3/45 knees) performed jumping-pivoting sports (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The SCB scored by the patient showed 87% of knees as good, very good, or normal. On the PASS analysis, 89% of patients (95% CI, 76%-96%) were ""pleased,"" and 93% (95% CI, 82%-99%) would undergo surgery again. There were clinically relevant improvements in symptoms of pain, swelling, and giving way (<i>P</i> = .0001). Preoperatively, 91% of knees had moderate to severe pain with activities of daily living, and only 11% of knees had pain at the follow-up. Five of the 50 knees (10%) underwent TKR conversion with one patient lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: PFA resulted in a high return of patients to low-impact sports with high SCB and PASS psychometric ratings. The robotic-assisted 3-dimensional preoperative planning allowed precise intraoperative trochlear implant alignment in knees with severe trochlear dysplasia. PFA is recommended as an alternative treatment in younger patients with end-stage symptomatic patellofemoral arthritis.

pub.1136875103,A clinical review of robotic navigation in total knee arthroplasty: historical systems to modern design,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has shown improved reproducibility and precision in mechanical alignment restoration, with improvement in early functional outcomes and 90-day episode of care cost savings compared to conventional TKA in some studies. However, its value is still to be determined.Current studies of RA-TKA systems are limited by short-term follow-up and significant heterogeneity of the available systems.In today's paradigm shift towards an increased emphasis on quality of care while curtailing costs, providing value-based care is the primary goal for healthcare systems and clinicians. As robotic technology continues to develop, longer-term studies evaluating implant survivorship and complications will determine whether the initial capital is offset by improved outcomes.Future studies will have to determine the value of RA-TKA based on longer-term survivorships, patient-reported outcome measures, functional outcomes, and patient satisfaction measures.

pub.1136755690,Early postoperative clinical recovery of robotic arm-assisted vs. image-based navigated Total hip Arthroplasty,"BackgroundThis study compared the early clinical recovery of total hip arthroplasty (THA) using computer navigation systems (nTHA) and robotic arm-assisted THA (rTHA).MethodsThirty prospective subjects who underwent rTHA were clinically compared to 30 subjects who underwent nTHA. Clinical data (surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, pain severity, number of days to independent walking, and Harris Hip Score (HHS) at discharge), and radiographic parameters (inclination and anteversion angles) were statistically compared between the two groups.ResultsFollow-up times were 24.3 ± 6.0 and 27.0 ± 7.0 days in the rTHA and nTHA groups, respectively. The surgical time (135.1 ± 13.9 min vs. 146.2 ± 12.8 min, p = 0.002), number of days to independent walking (7.2 ± 2.0 vs. 11.5 ± 3.0 days, p < 0.001), and postoperative pain using a numeric rating scale on postoperative days 7, 10,, and 14 (1.4 ± 0.9 vs. 2.2 ± 1.2, p = 0.005; 1.0 ± 0.8 vs. 1.8 ± 1.1, p = 0.002; 0.3 ± 0.5 vs. 1.1 ± 0.9, p < 0.001; respectively) were significantly reduced in the rTHA group compared to the nTHA group. The rTHA group showed a significantly higher postoperative HHS compared to the nTHA group (85.3 ± .3.2 vs. 81.0 ± 8.5, p = 0.014). No statistically significant difference was observed in radiographic parameters between the groups; however, the incidence of intraoperative target angle changes was significantly lower in the rTHA group than in the nTHA group (0/30 subjects [0%] vs. 11/30 subjects [36.7%], p < 0.001).ConclusionThe surgical time, postoperative pain, and number of days to independent walking were significantly shorter, and the HHS at discharge was significantly higher in the rTHA group than in the nTHA group. Thus, compared to the nTHA group, the rTHA group showed improved early clinical recovery."
pub.1126868756,Impact of surgeon handedness in manual and robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to examine whether surgeon handedness could affect cup positioning in manual total hip arthroplasty (THA), and whether robot could diminish or eliminate the impact of surgeon handedness on cup positioning in robot-assisted THA.MethodsFifty-three patients who underwent bilateral robot-assisted THA and sixty-two patients who underwent bilateral manual THA between August 2018 and July 2019 in our institute were respectively analyzed in this study. When the difference between the bilateral anteversion and inclination was greater than 5°, the patient was regarded as having different cup positioning between bilateral THA. Their demographics, orientation of acetabular cup, and postoperative 3 month Harris hip score (HHS) were recorded for analysis.ResultsThere were no significant differences in the gender, age, BMI, diagnosis’s composition, and preoperative and postoperative HHS between the robotic and manual group. Two left hips dislocated in the manual group. The anteversion of left hip was significantly larger than that of right hip (24.77 ± 10.44 vs 22.44 ± 8.67, p = 0.043) in the manual group. There were no significant differences of cup positioning between bilateral robot-assisted THA. The patients in manual group were significantly more likely to have different cup positioning between bilateral hips than those in robotic group (77% vs 45%, p = 0.000). More manual THA were located out of the target zone than robot-assisted THA (70% vs 48%, p = 0.001).ConclusionsSurgeon’s handedness showed a trend towards an impact on cup positioning in manual THA and robot might help surgeon eliminate the adverse impact. However, the impact of handedness on the clinical outcomes still needs further observation."
pub.1105176489,Evaluation of Native Femoral Neck Version and Final Stem Version Variability in Patients With Osteoarthritis Undergoing Robotically Implanted Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Combined anteversion in total hip arthroplasty influences both dislocation risk and range of motion. One of its components, stem version (SV), could be dictated by many factors, from native femoral anatomy to stem geometry and surgeon's choice. In the present multicenter study, robotic technology was used to assess the influence of native femoral version on final SV and combined anteversion using a straight, uncemented stem.
METHODS: Three hundred sixty-two patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty were enrolled from 3 different orthopedic centers from 2012 and 2016. All patients underwent computed tomography planning with measurement of femoral neck version (FNV) and intraoperative measurement of stem version (SV), acetabular component version (AV), and combined version (CV) with robotic instrumentation.
RESULTS: Mean FNV was 5.0° ± 9.6°, and SV was 6.4° ± 9.7°. The average difference between FNV and SV was 1.6° ± 9.8°. A moderate correlation was found between FNV and SV (R = 0.48, P < .001). SV was between 5° and 20° in 174 patients (48%). Mean CV was 28.2° ± 7.9°. A strong correlation was found between SV and CV (R = 0.89, P < .001). A significant difference in SV was found between the 3 centers (P < .001). CV was <25° in 109 patients (30.1%). Relative risk of CV < 25° was 8.6 times greater with SV < 5° (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: With the use of an uncemented, single-wedge, straight stem, SV is highly variable. Despite being moderately correlated with native FNV, SV can be partially influenced by the surgeon. A low SV could be hardly corrected, bringing high risk of low CV."
pub.1139662986,"Robotics in orthopaedic surgery: why, what and how?","IntroductionRobotics applied to orthopedics has become an interesting topic both from the surgical point of view and the engineering one. The main goal of those systems is the enhancement of joint arthroplasty surgery, providing the robotic support to precisely and accurately prepare the bone, restore the limb alignment and the physiological kinematics of the joint. Various robotic systems are currently available on the market, each addressing specific kind of surgeries and characterized by a series of specific features that may involve different requirements and/or modus operandi.Material and methodsAn overview of these devices was performed, addressing the different categories in which robots are subdivided in terms of: operations performed, requirements and level of interaction of the surgeon. The main models currently available on the market were addressed and relative studies in the literature were reported and compared, to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of the different technologies.ResultsThe different robotic systems were subdivided in: open/closed platform, image-based/imageless and active/passive/semi-active. Regardless of the typology of robotic system, the main aim is to improve precision and accuracy of the operation. It is to be noted that, regardless of the typology of robotic system, the surgeon is still in charge of the planning and approval of the operation: only the precise and consistent execution of his directives is entrusted to the robot. The positive factors have however to be weighed against the fact that robotic systems involve an important initial investment and most of the times require the surgeons and the staff to learn how to operate them (with a learning curve differing from system to system).ConclusionsEach surgeon, when considering if and which robotic system to adopt, has to properly evaluate the different benefits and drawbacks involved to find the surgical robot that fits his needs the best."
pub.1171227547,Patients undergoing robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty have a greater improvement in knee-specific pain but not in function,"Aims: The aim was to assess whether robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) had greater knee-specific outcomes, improved fulfilment of expectations, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and patient satisfaction when compared with manual TKA (mTKA).
Methods: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken (May 2019 to December 2021), and patients were allocated to either mTKA or rTKA. A total of 100 patients were randomized, 50 to each group, of whom 43 rTKA and 38 mTKA patients were available for review at 12 months following surgery. There were no statistically significant preoperative differences between the groups. The minimal clinically important difference in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score was defined as 7.5 points.
Results: There were no clinically or statistically significant differences between the knee-specific measures (WOMAC, Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS)) or HRQoL measures (EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) and EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS)) at 12 months between the groups. However, the rTKA group had significantly (p = 0.029) greater improvements in the WOMAC pain component (mean difference 9.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 18.4) over the postoperative period (two, six, and 12 months), which was clinically meaningful. This was not observed for function (p = 0.248) or total (p = 0.147) WOMAC scores. The rTKA group was significantly (p = 0.039) more likely to have expectation of 'Relief of daytime pain in the joint' when compared with the mTKA group. There were no other significant differences in expectations met between the groups. There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction with their knee (p = 0.464), return to work (p = 0.464), activities (p = 0.293), or pain (p = 0.701).
Conclusion: Patients undergoing rTKA had a clinically meaningful greater improvement in their knee pain over the first 12 months, and were more likely to have fulfilment of their expectation of daytime pain relief compared with patients undergoing mTKA. However, rTKA was not associated with a clinically significant greater knee-specific function or HRQoL, according to current definitions."
pub.1124955976,A prospective double-blinded randomised control trial comparing robotic arm-assisted functionally aligned total knee arthroplasty versus robotic arm-assisted mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty,"BackgroundTotal knee arthroplasty (TKA) with mechanical alignment (MA) aims to achieve neutral limb alignment in all patients, whereas TKA with functional alignment (FA) aims to restore native, patient-specific anatomy and knee kinematics by manipulating bone resections and fine-tuning implant positioning. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal alignment technique in TKA by comparing patient satisfaction, functional outcomes, implant survivorship, complications, and cost-effectiveness in MA TKA versus FA TKA. Robotic technology will be used to execute the planned implant positioning and limb alignment with high-levels of accuracy in all study patients.Methods and analysisThis prospective double-blinded randomised control trial will include 100 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary robotic arm-assisted TKA. Following informed consent, patients will be randomised to MA TKA (the control group) or FA TKA (the investigation group) at a ratio of 1:1 using an online random number generator. Blinded observers will review patients at regular intervals for 2 years after surgery to record predefined study outcomes relating to postoperative rehabilitation, clinical progress, functional outcomes, accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment, gait, implant stability, cost-effectiveness, and complications. A superiority study design will be used to evaluate whether FA TKA provides superior outcomes compared to MA TKA. Primary and secondary objectives will be used to quantify and draw inferences on differences in the efficacy of treatment between the two groups. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol population analysis will be undertaken. The following statistical methods will be employed to analyse the data: descriptive statistics, independent t test, paired t test, analysis of variance, Fisher exact test, chi-square test, and graphical displays. Ethical approval was obtained from the London-Surrey Research Ethics Committee, UK. The study is sponsored by University College London, UK.DiscussionThis is the first study to describe the use of robotic technology to achieve FA TKA, and the only existing clinical trial comparing robotic MA TKA versus robotic FA TKA. The findings of this study will enable an improved understanding of the optimal alignment technique in TKA for achieving high-levels of patient satisfaction, improving functional outcomes, increasing implant survivorship, improving cost-effectiveness, and reducing complications.RegistrationClinical Trials.gov, NCT04092153.

Demographic differences were assessed with chi-square and analysis of variance. Mean scores between groups were compared using univariate analysis of covariance, controlling for all significant demographic differences.
RESULTS: Of the 1960 cases identified, 896 used navigation, 135 used robotics, and 929 used no technology. There were significant statistical differences in one-year Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement scores (85.23 vs 85.95 vs 86.76, respectively; P = .014) and two-year Forgotten Joint Score-12 scores (64.72 vs 73.35 vs 74.63, respectively; P = .004) between the 3 groups. However, these differences did not exceed the mean clinically important differences. Length of stay was statistically longest for patients who underwent conventionally performed THA versus navigation and robotics (2.22 vs 1.46 vs 1.91, respectively; P < .001). Surgical time was significantly longer for cases performed using robotics versus navigation and conventionally (119.61 vs 90.35 vs 95.35, respectively; P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Statistical differences observed between all modalities are not likely to be clinically meaningful with regard to early patient-reported outcomes. Although intraoperative use of technology may improve the accuracy of implant placement, these modalities have not yet translated into improved early reported functional outcomes.

In this randomized controlled clinical trial, robot-assisted THA (RaTHA) and Conventional THA (CoTHA) were performed using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis to evaluate the learning curve of the RaTHA system. The demographic data, preopera1tive clinical data, duration of operation, postoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS), postoperative Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and duration of operation between the learning stage and the proficiency stage of the RaTHA group were compared between the two groups.ResultsThe average duration of operation of the RaTHA group was increased by 34.73 min compared with the CoTHA group (104.26 ± 19.33 vs. 69.53 ± 18.38 min, p < 0.01). The learning curve of the RaTHA system can be divided into learning stage and proficiency stage, and the former consists of the first 13 cases by CUSUM analysis. In the RaTHA group, the duration of operation decreased by 29.75 min in the proficiency stage compared to the learning stage (121.12 ± 12.84 vs.91.37 ± 12.92, p < 0.01).ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that the surgical team required a learning curve of 13 cases to become proficient using the RaTHA system. The duration of operation, total blood loss, and drainage gradually shortened (decreased) with the learning curve stage, and the differences were statistically significant.Trial registrationNumber: ChiCTR2200061630, Date: 29/06/2022."
pub.1138179537,Stiffness after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: Risk factors and arthroscopic treatment,"INTRODUCTION: One of the principal complications after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is stiffness. There are no publications concerning stiffness after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Study objectives were to describe the incidence of stiffness after UKA, to look for risk factors, and to describe safe and effective arthroscopic treatment.
METHODS: There were 240 UKA performed between March 2016 and January 2019 included. Robotic-assisted surgery was performed in 164 patients and mechanical instrumentation in 76 patients. Stiffness was defined as flexion < 90° or a flexion contracture > 10° during the first 45 post-operative days. Patients with stiffness were treated with arthroscopic arthrolysis. Several factors were studied to look for risk factors of stiffness: body mass index, gender, age, mechanical or robotic instrumentation, preoperative flexion, previous meniscectomy, and anticoagulant treatment. Arthrolysis effectiveness was evaluated by flexion improvement and UKA revision rate.
RESULTS: 22 patients (9%) developed stiffness. Mechanical instrumentation significantly increased the risk of stiffness with OR = 0.26 and p = 0.005. Robotic-assisted surgery decreased the risk of stiffness by five-fold. Before arthrolysis, mean knee flexion was 79°, versus 121° (53% improvement) after arthroscopic arthrolysis. Only 2 patients (9%) underwent UKA revision after arthrolysis.
DISCUSSION: Stiffness after UKA is an important complication with an incidence of 9% in this study. Arthroscopic arthrolysis is a safe and effective treatment with a range of motion improvement of > 50%. Robotic-assisted surgery significantly decreases the risk of postoperative stiffness.

pub.1163155496,"Image‐free handheld robotic‐assisted technology improved the accuracy of implant positioning compared to conventional instrumentation in patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty, without additional benefits in improvement of clinical outcomes","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes in patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SB-TKA) using either robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) or conventional TKA (C-TKA).
METHODS: Included were the patients who underwent SB-TKA between January 2018 and January 2020 and had a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Of 151 patients included, 117 patients were operated using an image-free handheld robotic sculpting system (RA-TKA group) and 34 patients operated using conventional instrumentation (C-TKA group). The key outcomes noted were multiple patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse events, and radiological outcomes. Two investigators independently measured the radiological outcomes on pre- and post-operative radiographs in coronal plane (medial proximal tibial angle [MPTA] and anatomic lateral distal femoral angle [aLDFA]) and sagittal plane (posterior tibial slope [PTS] and posterior condylar offset [PCO]). The chi-square test was used to examine categorical variables. Student's t test was used to analyze the continuous variables.
RESULTS: Patients in both groups were similar in baseline characteristics (gender, body mass index, incidence of comorbidities, and length of hospital stay) except that RA-TKA group patients younger (66.7 ± 8.9 vs 70.4 ± 10.5, P = 0.037) than C-TKA group. The operative time was longer in RA-TKA group as compared to C-TKA (189.3 ± 37.1 vs 175.0 ± 28.2, P = 0.040). The final PROs at each were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05). The values of PROs at final follow-up in RA-TKA compared to C-TKA were VAS pain (0.4 ± 0.9 vs 0.4 ± 0.5), KOOS-JR (89.3 ± 5.8 vs 87.1 ± 5.3), and physical (55.9 ± 2.8 vs 55.4 ± 3.2), mental (61.1 ± 4.4 vs 60.2 ± 4.7) component of VR-12 scores, and KSS satisfaction (37.5 ± 1.1 vs 37.1 ± 2.2) (all P > 0.50 or non-significant [n.s.]). While one patient in RA-TKA required revision of femoral component for peri-prosthetic fracture, none of the patient in conventional group were revised (0.85% vs 0%, P = n.s.). The proportion of patients with outliers in RA-TKA group was lower for aLDFA (2.6% vs 22.1%, P < 0.01) and PTS (0% vs 35%, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This comparative study in patients undergoing SB-TKA found reduction of outliers in femoral and tibial implant positioning with RA-TKA as compared to C-TKA. There were no differences in both groups for pain, function, and satisfaction at a minimum of 2 years of follow-up.

pub.1122373916,Robots and Tools for Remodeling Bone,"The field of robotic surgery has progressed from small teams of researchers repurposing industrial robots, to a competitive and highly innovative subsection of the medical device industry. Surgical robots allow surgeons to perform tasks with greater ease, accuracy, or safety, and fall under one of four levels of autonomy; active, semi-active, passive, and remote manipulator. The increased accuracy afforded by surgical robots has allowed for cementless hip arthroplasty, improved postoperative alignment following knee arthroplasty, and reduced duration of intraoperative fluoroscopy among other benefits. Cutting of bone has historically used tools such as hand saws and drills, with other elaborate cutting tools now used routinely to remodel bone. Improvements in cutting accuracy and additional options for safety and monitoring during surgery give robotic surgeries some advantages over conventional techniques. This article aims to provide an overview of current robots and tools with a common target tissue of bone, proposes a new process for defining the level of autonomy for a surgical robot, and examines future directions in robotic surgery."
pub.1022546608,Achieving Accurate Ligament Balancing Using Robotic‐Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) allows replacement of a single compartment in patients with limited disease. However, UKA is technically challenging and relies on accurate component positioning and restoration of natural knee kinematics. This study examined the accuracy of dynamic, real-time ligament balancing using a robotic-assisted UKA system. Surgical data obtained from the computer system were prospectively collected from 51 patients (52 knees) undergoing robotic-assisted medial UKA by a single surgeon. Dynamic ligament balancing of the knee was obtained under valgus stress prior to component implantation and then compared to final ligament balance with the components in place. Ligament balancing was accurate up to 0.53 mm compared to the preoperative plan, with 83% of cases within 1 mm at 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, and 110° of flexion. Ligamentous laxity of 1.31 ± 0.13 mm at 30° of flexion was corrected successfully to 0.78 ± 0.17 mm (P < 0.05). Robotic-assisted UKA allows accurate and precise reproduction of a surgical balance plan using dynamic, real-time soft-tissue balancing to help restore natural knee kinematics, potentially improving implant survival and functional outcomes."
pub.1150607185,Introduction of ROSA robotic‐arm system for total knee arthroplasty is associated with a minimal learning curve for operative time,"PURPOSE: The introduction of robotics for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) into the operating theatre is often associated with a learning curve and is potentially associated with additional complications. The purpose of this study was to determine the learning curve of robotic-assisted (RA) TKA within a multi-surgeon team.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 83 consecutive conventional jig-based TKAs compared with 53 RA TKAs using the Robotic Surgical Assistant (ROSA) system (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) for knee osteoarthritis performed by three high-volume (> 100 TKA per year) orthopaedic surgeons. Baseline characteristics including age, BMI, sex and pre-operative Kellgren-Lawrence graded and Hip-Knee-Ankle Axis were well-matched between the conventional and RA TKA groups. Cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis was used to assess learning curves for operative times for each surgeon. Peri-operative and delayed complications (infection, periprosthetic fracture, thromboembolism, and compromised wound healing) and revisions were reviewed.
RESULTS: The CUSUM analysis for operative time demonstrated an inflexion point after 5, 6 and 15 cases for each of the three surgeons, or 8.7 cases on average. There were no significant differences (p = 0.53) in operative times between the RA TKA learning (before inflexion point) and proficiency (after inflexion point) phases. Similarly, the operative times of the RA TKA group did not differ significantly (p = 0.92) from the conventional TKA group. There was no discernible learning curve for the accuracy of component planning using the RA TKA system. The average length of post-operative follow-up was 21.3 ± 9.0 months. There was one revision for instability in the conventional TKA group and none in the RA TKA group. There were no significant difference (p > 0.99) in post-operative complication rates between the conventional TKA and RA TKA groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the RA TKA system was associated with a learning curve for operative time of 8.7 cases. Operative times between the RA TKA and conventional TKA group were similar. The short learning curve implies this RA TKA system can be adopted relatively quickly into a surgical team with minimal risks to patients."
pub.1075082915,Robotics and computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery.,"These are just a few representative applications of the synergistic use of computer and robotic technology assisting the orthopaedic surgeon. While the individual systems are certain to change over time, the basic principles of correlating radiographic and anatomic data through a registration process, and displaying additional instrument or implant information through smart tools and surgical navigation are certain to become an increasingly important aspect of joint arthroplasty, deformity correction, and spinal and trauma surgery. Only the orthopaedic surgeon who clearly understands the goals, applications, and limitations of these systems can decide which are appropriate for his patients, his hospital, and his practice. Determining the cost and time benefits, both before and after an obligatory ""learning curve"" requires a complex interaction of capital investments, time savings, and outcome research on both safety and efficacy issues. The orthopaedist who understands and applies these technologies will help his patients to achieve the best possible care.

pub.1120528439,An Experienced Surgeon Can Meet or Exceed Robotic Accuracy in Manual Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: Reports in the literature indicate that implant placement is more accurate with robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA); however, these studies have not always accounted for surgeon experience. The purpose of the present study was to compare the accuracy of tibial component alignment in UKA between an experienced high-volume surgeon and the published data on robotic-assisted surgery.
METHODS: The radiographs made before and after 128 consecutive medial UKAs performed manually by a single surgeon using a cemented fixed-bearing implant were reviewed. Native tibial and tibial implant slope and varus alignment of the tibial implant were measured on preoperative and postoperative lateral and anteroposterior radiographs, respectively. The percentages of knees in which the postoperative measurements were within preoperative targets and the root mean square (RMS) error rates between the planned and achieved targets were compared with published robotic-assisted-UKA data.
RESULTS: In the present study, the proportion of manual UKAs in which the tibial component alignment was within the preoperative target was 66% (85 of 128), which exceeded published values in a study comparing robotic (58%) with manual (41%) UKA. The RMS error for tibial component alignment in the present study (1.48°) was less than published RMS error rates for robotic UKAs (range, 1.8° to 5°). Fifty-eight percent (74) of the 128 study UKAs were within the surgeon's preoperative goal for tibial slope, which was closer to the published value of 80% for robotic UKAs than is the published rate of 22% for manual UKAs. The RMS error for tibial slope in the study UKAs (1.50°) was smaller than the published RMS error rates for tibial slope in robotic UKAs (range, 1.6° to 1.9°).
CONCLUSIONS: Accurate implant alignment is important in UKA. In this study, an experienced surgeon achieved or exceeded robotic accuracy of tibial implant alignment in UKA. However, the relationship between implant position and patient outcomes is unknown, and a consensus on ideal surgical targets for optimal implant survivorship has yet to be established.

Postoperatively, Perth computed tomography (CT) protocol is a valid measurement technique in determining both femoral and tibial component alignments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of intraoperative component alignment by robotic-assisted TKA through CT validation. A total of 33 patients underwent TKA using the MAKO robotic-assisted TKA system. Intraoperative measurements of both femoral and tibial component placements, as well as limb alignment as determined by the MAKO software were recorded. Independent postoperative Perth CT protocol was obtained (<i>n</i> = 29) and compared with intraoperative values. Mean absolute difference between intraoperative and postoperative measurements for the femoral component were 1.17 degrees (1.10) in the coronal plane, 1.79 degrees (1.12) in the sagittal plane, and 1.90 degrees (1.88) in the transverse plane. Mean absolute difference between intraoperative and postoperative measurements for the tibial component were 1.03 degrees (0.76) in the coronal plane and 1.78 degrees (1.20) in the sagittal plane. Mean absolute difference of limb alignment was 1.29 degrees (1.25), with 93.10% of measurements ≤3 degrees of postoperative CT measurements. Overall, intraoperatively measured component alignment as estimated by the MAKO robotic-assisted TKA system is comparable to CT-based measurements."

A continued improvement in efficacy, adaptability, and cost reduction has stimulated increased interest in robotic-assisted surgery. The evolution in orthopedic surgery has allowed for advanced surgical planning, precision robotic machining of bone, improved implant-bone contact, optimization of implant placement, and optimization of the mechanical alignment.

The aim of this study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of all published primary research into RAA and to apply the Progressive Scholarly Acceptance (PSA) model to evaluate its acceptance as an orthopaedic surgical technique. A literature search was performed that included all peer-reviewed, primary, English language publications on RAA from its introduction in 1992 up to 2019. RAA was defined as robot-assisted hip or knee arthroplasty. A bibliometric analysis was performed to categorise articles by type of study and level of evidence. Studies were also categorised as initial investigations (II) or refining studies (RS). A PSA analysis was performed, with the end-point being defined as the point in time when the number of RS exceeded the number of II. Of the 199 studies originating from 19 countries and 101 institutions, only 16 (8.04%) were randomised-controlled trials. Fifty-one percent of studies had been published since 2015. Using PSA analysis, 161 (80.9%) studies were categorised as II and 38 (19.1%) were categorised as RS. This demonstrates that RAA has not yet reached the point of scholarly acceptance. Scholarly acceptance of RAA as an orthopaedic surgical technique has yet to be reached. However, there has been an exponential increase in the number of publications on RAA in the last 5 years, reflecting renewed interest this technique. We predict that, for the next 5 years, RAA will remain in the experimental phase due to the rapid development of new technology in this field."
pub.1077478939,"Advances in knee arthroplasty for younger patients: traditional knee arthroplasty is prologue, the future for knee arthroplasty is prescient.","Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was a remarkable development in orthopedic surgery. Joint arthroplasty and arthroscopy were perhaps the greatest innovations in orthopedics in the 20th century and occurred without the advantages of today's technology. Initially, TKA was performed only on elderly patients and those with advanced rheumatoid arthritis because of concerns with long-term wear of polyethylene. Surgeons strongly discouraged this surgery for patients younger than age 60 years because both patients and many orthopedic surgeons believed that knee implants would last only for approximately 10 years, particularly in younger and more active patients. Reports in the late 1980s and early 1990s about accelerated polyethylene wear and osteolysis substantiated the conviction that TKA was contraindicated in younger patients. This led to complacency toward TKA, thus inhibiting technological advances in the procedure to develop implants for younger and more active patients."
pub.1158670562,Incidence of soft tissue releases in robotic assisted cementless TKA with mechanical alignment and flexion gap balancing,"BackgroundTo ensure the success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), precise bone cuts and a well-balanced soft tissue envelope are crucial. Soft tissue release may be necessary, subject to various factors. Therefore, documenting the type, frequency, and necessity of soft tissue releases can establish a benchmark for comparing different alignment techniques and philosophies and evaluating their outcomes. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that robotic-assisted knee surgery requires minimal soft tissue release.MethodsWe prospectively documented and retrospectively reviewed the soft tissue releases employed in securing ligament balance in the first 175 patients who received robotic-assisted TKAs at Nepean Hospital. ROSA was utilized in all surgeries with the aim of restoring mechanical coronal alignment, with a flexion gap balancing technique. Surgeries were performed between December 2019 to August 2021 by a single surgeon who used a standard medial parapatellar approach without a tourniquet, and the cementless persona prosthesis. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months post-surgery. Soft tissue releases included any form of medial release for varus knee, posterolateral release for valgus knee and PCL fenestration or sacrifice.ResultsThere were 131 female and 44 male patients, aged between 48 to 89 years (average 60 years). The preoperative HKA ranged from 22 degrees varus to 28 degrees valgus, with 71% of patients presenting with a varus deformity. For the whole group, the no need for soft tissue release was documented in 123 patients (70.3%), small fenestrated releases of PCL in 27 (15.4%), sacrifice of PCL in 8 (4.5%), medial releases in 4 (2.3%) and posterolateral releases in 13 (7.4%). In 29.7% of patients in whom a soft tissue release was necessary for balance, over half were/received minor fenestrations of the PCL. Outcomes to date included no revisions or impending revisions, 2 MUAs (1%), and Oxford knee scores averaged 40 at 6 months.ConclusionWe concluded that Robot technology enhanced the precision of bone cuts and allowed for titration of required soft tissue releases to achieve optimal balance."
pub.1068896326,Knee kinematics with a high-flexion posterior stabilized total knee prosthesis: an in vitro robotic experimental investigation.,"BACKGROUND: An analysis of contemporary total knee arthroplasty reveals that, on the average, patients rarely flex the knee beyond 120 degrees. The biomechanical mechanisms that inhibit further flexion after total knee arthroplasty are unknown. The objective of the present study was to investigate the capability of a single design of a fixed-bearing, high-flexion posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty system (LPS-Flex) to restore the range of flexion to that of the intact knee.
METHODS: Thirteen cadaveric human knees were tested, with use of a robotic testing system, before and after total knee arthroplasty with the LPS-Flex prosthesis. The passive path and the kinematics under an isolated quadriceps force of 400 N, under an isolated hamstring force of 200 N, and with these forces combined were determined. Posterior femoral translation of the lateral and medial femoral condyles and tibial rotation were recorded from 0 degrees to 150 degrees of flexion.
RESULTS: The medial and lateral condyles of the intact knee translated posteriorly from full extension to 150 degrees, reaching a mean peak (and standard deviation) of 22.9 +/- 11.3 mm and 31.9 +/- 12.5 mm, respectively, under the combined muscle forces. Following total knee arthroplasty, the amount of posterior femoral translation was lower than that observed in the intact knee. At 150 degrees, approximately 90% of the intact posterior femoral translation was recovered by the total knee replacement. Internal tibial rotation was observed for all knees throughout the range of motion. The cam-spine mechanism engaged at approximately 80 degrees and disengaged at 135 degrees. Despite the absence of cam-spine engagement, further posterior femoral translation occurred from 135 degrees to 150 degrees.
CONCLUSIONS: The tibiofemoral articular geometry of the intact knee and the knee after total knee arthroplasty with use of the LPS-Flex design demonstrated similar kinematics at high flexion angles. The cam-spine mechanism enhanced posterior femoral translation only at the mid-range of flexion. The femoral component geometry of the LPS-Flex total knee prosthesis may improve posterior tibiofemoral articulation contact in high flexion angles."
pub.1140214198,"Digital twins, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technology to identify a real personalized motion axis of the tibiotalar joint for robotics in total ankle arthroplasty","PurposeAxial alignment of the talar implant in total ankle arthroplasty remains a major issue, since the real axis of motion of each patient is impossible to determine with usual techniques. Further knowledge regarding individual axis of motion of the ankle is therefore needed.Material and methodsTherefore, digital twins, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technology were used to identify a real personalized motion axis of the tibiotalar joint. Three-dimensional (3D) models of distal extremities were generated using computed tomography data of normal patients. Digital twins were used to reproduce the mobility of the ankles, and the real ankle of the patients was matched to the digital twin with machine learning technology.ResultsThe results showed that a personalized axis can be obtained for each patient. When the origin of the axis is the centre of mass of the talus, this axis can be represented in a geodesic system. The mean value of the axis is a line passing in first approximation through the centre of the sphere (with a variation of 3 mm from the centre of the mass of the talus) and through a point with the coordinates 91.6° west and 7.4° north (range 84° to 98° west; − 2° to 12° north). This study improves the understanding of the axis of the ankle, as well as its relationship to the possibility to use the geodesic system for robotic in ankle arthroplasty.ConclusionThe consideration of a personalized axis of the ankle might be helpful for better understanding of ankle surgery and particularly total ankle arthroplasty."
pub.1112769282,Coronal and Sagittal Balancing of Total Knee Arthroplasty Old Principles and New Technologies.,"The number of total knee arthroplasties performed in the United States is growing, and a leading cause of failure is postoperative knee instability from suboptimal coronal or sagittal balancing.

pub.1134575118,Achieving a Balanced Knee in Robotic TKA,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery with manual instruments provides a quantitatively balanced knee in approximately 50% of cases. This study examined the effect of combining robotics technology with real-time intra-operative sensor feedback on the number of quantitatively balanced cases in a consecutive series of 200 robotic-assisted primary TKAs. The robotics platform was used to plan the implant component position using correctable poses in extension and a manual, centrally pivoting the balancer in flexion, prior to committing to the femoral cuts. During the initial trialing, the quantitative state of balance was assessed using an instrumented tibial tray that measured the intra-articular loads in the medial and lateral compartments. These sensor readings informed a number of surgical corrections, including bone recuts, soft-tissue corrections, and cement adjustments. During initial trialing, a quantitatively balanced knee was achieved in only 65% of cases. After performing the relevant soft-tissue corrections, bone recuts, and cement adjustments, 87% of cases ended balanced through the range of motion. Meanwhile, this resulted in a wide range of coronal alignment conditions, ranging from 6° valgus to 9° varus. It is therefore concluded that gaps derived from robotics navigation are not indicative for a quantitatively balanced knee, which was only consistently achieved when combining the robotics platform with real-time feedback from intra-operative load sensors."
pub.1138149164,Adoption of Robotic Arm-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty Results in Reliable Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes at Minimum Two-Year Follow Up.,"INTRODUCTION: Longevity and success of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is largely dependent on component positioning. While use of robotic platforms can improve this positioning, published evidence on its clinical benefits is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes of THA with robotic surgical assistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an analysis of robotic arm-assisted primary THAs performed by a single surgeon utilizing a posterior approach. A total of 99 patients (107 cases) who had a minimum two-year follow up were identified. Their mean age was 61 years (range, 33 to 84 years), and their mean body mass index was 30.5 kg/m2 (range, 18.5 to 49.1 kg/m2). There were 56% female patients and primary osteoarthritis was the principal hip diagnosis in 88.8%. Operative times, lengths of hospital stay, and discharge dispositions were recorded, along with any complications. Modified Harris Hip Scores (HHS) were calculated to quantify clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Mean postoperative increases in HHS at 2- to 5.7-year follow up was 33 points (range, 6 to 77 points). There were no complications attributable to the use of robotic assistance. Surgical-site complications were rare; one case underwent a revision for prosthetic joint infection (0.93%) but there were no dislocations, periprosthetic fractures, or cases of mechanical implant loosening. There was no evidence of progressive radiolucencies or radiographic failure.
DISCUSSION: Robotic arm-assisted THA resulted in low complication rates at minimum two-year follow up, with clinical outcomes comparable to those reported with manual surgery.1-4 The haptically-guided acetabular bone preparation enabled reliable cementless acetabular fixation and there were no adverse events related to the use of the robot. Dislocations were avoided in this case series. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to compare manual to robotic surgery and to investigate whether the precision found with this functional planning will reliably reduce the incidence of dislocations."

Outcomes studied included Lower Extremity Functional Score (LEFS), new Knee Society Score (KSS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR.), VR/SF-12, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores, and perioperative opioid consumption. Patients in the robotic cohort had superior early functional outcomes, with greater LEFS (conventional = 23; robotic = 31) at 1 week post-op (<i>p</i>=0.015) and KOOS-JR (conventional = 74; robotic = 81) at up to 6 months post-op (<i>p</i>=0.037); these two values remained statistically significant after mixed-model regression analysis (<i>p</i>=0.010; <i>p</i>=0.023), respectively. At 1 year post-op, expectations were more likely to be met in those who received robotic assistance (<i>p</i>=0.06). No differences were reported with respect to postoperative opioid usage (<i>p</i>=0.320), reoperations (<i>p</i>=1.00), and complications (<i>p</i>=0.628). Robotic-assisted UKA resulted in more rapid recovery and less early postoperative pain and were more likely to meet expectations than conventional UKA, although functional differences equilibrated by 1 year postoperatively. Further follow-up is necessary to determine if implant durability is impacted by robotics."
pub.1128046699,Comparable surgery time for robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty after initial learning curve," Aims and Objectives: In the past years, further development in knee replacement still continues. Computer-assisted surgery techniques in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are on the rise. One point of criticism is the prolonged time of surgery and associated cost as known from old techniques like navigation. The primary objective of this study was to determine the learning curve for the time of surgery and accuracy in implant positioning for an imageless robotic system for TKA.   Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, the first 30 robotic-assisted TKA from a single senior surgeon were analyzed with regard to time of surgery and accuracy of implant position on the basis of the intraoperative plan and the postoperative x-rays. This data was compared to the last 30 manual TKAs of the same surgeon with the same prosthesis. Evaluation of the learning curve was performed with CUSUM analysis. The time of surgery after finishing the learning curve in the robotic group was compared to the manual group.   Results: The learning curve in the robotic group for surgery time was finished after 11 cases. The robotic experience did not affect the accuracy of implant positioning, such as limb alignment and restoration of the joint line. The mean absolute deviation of the postoperative limb alignment to the intraoperative plan was 2° (+/- 1,1). The mean absolute deviation of the medial proximal tibial (mPTA) and distal lateral femoral angle (dLFA) was 1° (+/- 0,9) for both. The mean surgery time in the robotic group after finishing the learning curve was 66 minutes (+/- 4,2) and in the total manual group 67 minutes (+/- 3,5) (n.s.).   Conclusion: After finishing the initial learning curve of 11 cases for robotic-assisted TKA the time of surgery is equal to the manual conventional technique. However, there is no learning curve for implant positioning with the imageless robotic system. The implementation of the intraoperative plan is accurate to 1° with the robotic system. "
pub.1135436194,Minimal Clinically Important Difference in Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Versus Standard Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether robotic total knee arthroplasty (R-TKA) demonstrated evidence of improvement in minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in early (<4 weeks) and intermittent (4-8 month) patient-reported outcomes compared with manual total knee arthroplasty (M-TKA).
METHODS: A prospectively collected database was reviewed of 1160 consecutive patients undergoing R-TKA or M-TKA from December 2017 to October 2019. Primary outcomes consisted of Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Measures of Physical Health (PH) and Mental Health (MH). Statistical analysis included MCID via the distribution method.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated conflicting results for early MCID achievement favoring M-TKA (4-week KOOS-JR, P = .03) for the multisurgeon cohort, but favored R-TKA (4-week Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-PH, P = .04) in the single-surgeon analysis, and the remaining outcome scores were similar. Ultimately, multivariate analysis demonstrated similar 4-week and 6-month MCID achievement in all measures. Lower preoperative scores consistently achieved MCID at a higher rate in M-TKA, although in R-TKA, the higher baseline scores improved at a rate comparable with those with lower scores in all but the short-term postoperative KOOS-JR.
CONCLUSION: R-TKA demonstrated comparable MCID achievement to M-TKA across the larger cohort. Single-surgeon comparison did show some early benefit. Confounding variables such as surgical technique, implant fixation, and responsiveness of an outcome measure may be as important as simply what tools are used during surgery. Such granular data should be sought out in future studies."
pub.1139929393,Does robotic assisted technology improve the accuracy of acetabular component positioning in patients with DDH?,"BACKGROUND: Accurate positioning of the acetabular component is key in performing total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, reconstruction of the acetabulum in the setting of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a challenge. Robotic assisted THA has the potential to improve the accuracy of implantation of the acetabular cup in cases with DDH. The purpose of this study was to assess whether robotic technology improves the accuracy of acetabular component positioning in patients with DDH.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included 59 THAs using robotic assisted technology from June 2019 to January 2020 as the study group. These were compared to conventional THAs without robotic technology after control for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), Crowe type and operation date. Radiographic measurements were taken by 2 blinded orthopaedic residents. The percentage of hips within the Lewinnek and Collanan safe zones were calculated, along with acetabular rotation centers for the ""target zone."" Surgical time and perioperative bleeding were also compared between both groups.
RESULTS: One patient suffered dislocation in conventional group while no dislocation occurred in robotic group. The acetabular components of the robotic assisted group had more cases located within the Lewinnek (<i>p</i> = 0.013) and Collanan (<i>p</i> = 0.008) safe zones than conventional group (94.9% vs 79.7% and 74.6% vs 50.8%). There were 7 cases in conventional group and 4 cases in robotic group that had more lateral or more superior rotational centers of THA, but did not reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> = 0.342). No statistical difference was detected between groups with regards to blood loss (<i>p</i> = 0.098) and surgical time (<i>p</i> = 0.602).
CONCLUSION: Robot assisted technology can assist surgeons with implanting acetabular cups more in Lewinnek and Callanan safe zone than conventional techniques without additional blood loss and surgical time.

pub.1128046711,Posterior condylar offset ratio more precisely reconstructed with robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty when compared to conventional manual technique," Aims and Objectives: The use of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty promises more precision in TKA implant technique. Precise implantation is elemental in improving functional and radiological outcome after TKA. The posterior condylar offset ratio (PCOR) is one important radiological parameter in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The PCOR correlates with the maximum range-of-motion of the knee. A decrease of PCOR in TKA could lead to early impingement of the tibial insert with a consecutive decreased flexion range of the knee. The primary objective of this study was to determine differences in PCOR reconstruction after TKA between manual and robotic arm-assisted TKA surgery.   Materials and Methods: A total of 80 patients undergoing primary TKA performed by one single senior surgeon were included in this prospective study. Two groups (Robotic arm-assisted TKA group, manual TKA group, n=40 patients each) were compared on the basis of hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), medial proximal tibial angle (mPTA), distal lateral femoral angle (dLFA) and PCOR. Weight-bearing full-leg a.p. radiographs, as well as lateral knee radiographs, were performed pre- and postoperatively. All surgeries were performed with one single posterior stabilized TKA prosthesis type. Statistics consisted of parametric t-testing with a level of significance of p<0.05.   Results: Preoperative limb alignment, mPTA and dLFA did not differ in between groups (each p>0.05). Postoperative mean PCOR was larger in the robotic arm-assisted TKA group (0.51 ± 0.05 vs. manual TKA group 0.47 ± 0.05, p=0.006). The absolute mean difference of pre- and postoperative PCOR was higher in the manual TKA group when compared to the robotic arm-assisted TKA group (-0.059 vs. -0.017, p=0.001). Manual TKA group showed a mean relative deviation of 12,03% (± 9,1%) in pre- to postoperative PCOR, whereas a mean relative deviation of 3.9 % (± 4.5%) was found in the robotic arm-assisted TKA group.   Conclusion: Robotic arm-assisted TKA showed higher precision regarding postoperative PCOR with lower absolute mean differences and less relative deviation in pre- and postoperative PCOR when compared to manual TKA. A precise reconstruction of PCOR correlates with a better functional outcome as shown in previous studies before. "

In this prospective randomized controlled trial, we investigated the therapeutic effects of knee extension exercises using the HAL-SJ after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Seventy-six patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to HAL-SJ or conventional physical therapy (CPT) groups. The HAL-SJ group underwent exercise using the HAL-SJ for 10 days postoperatively, in addition to CPT; the CPT group underwent only CPT. Pain intensity and active and passive knee extension angles were evaluated preoperatively and on postoperative days 1–10 and weeks 2 and 4. Performance tests and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were evaluated preoperatively and at postoperative weeks 2 and 4. Statistical analysis showed that the HAL-SJ group significantly improved active and passive knee extension angles compared with the CPT group. The HAL-SJ group showed immediate improvement in active knee extension angle through day 5. There were no significant differences in results between the performance tests and KOOS. Knee extension exercises with the HAL-SJ improved knee pain and the angle of extension in the acute phase after TKA."
pub.1105926995,Improved implant position and lower revision rate with robotic‐assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The aim of this case-control study was to compare implant position and revision rate for UKA, performed with either a robotic-assisted system or with conventional technique.
METHODS: Eighty UKA (57 medial, 23 lateral) were performed with robotic assistance (BlueBelt Navio system) between 2013 and 2017. These patients were matched with 80 patients undergoing UKA using the same prosthesis, implanted using conventional technique. The sagittal and coronal component position was assessed on postoperative radiographs. The revision rate was reported at last follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 19.7 months ± 9 for the robotic-assisted group, and 24.2 months ± 16 for the control group. The rate of postoperative limb alignment outliers (± 2°) was significantly higher in the control group than in the robotic-assisted group for both lateral UKA (26% in robotic group versus 61% in control group; p = 0.018) and medial UKA (16% versus 32%, resp.; p = 0.038). The coronal and sagittal tibial baseplate position had significantly less outliers (± 3°) in the robotic-assisted group, than in the control group. Revision rates were: 5% (n = 4/80) for robotic assisted UKA and 9% (n = 7/80) for conventional UKA (n.s.). The reasons for revision were different between groups, with 86% of revisions in the control group occurring in association with component malposition or limb malalignment, compared with none in the robotic-assisted group.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted UKA has a lower rate of postoperative limb alignment outliers, as well as a lower revision rate, compared to conventional technique. The accuracy of implant positioning is improved by this robotic-assisted system.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level of evidence III. Retrospective case-control study CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is the first paper comparing implant position, clinical outcome, and revision rate for UKA performed using the Navio robotic system with a control group."
pub.1145602704,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: Is there a maximum level of efficiency for the operating surgeon?,"Aims: Recent studies have attempted to quantify the learning curve associated with integration of robotic technology into surgical practice, but to our knowledge, no study has demonstrated the number of cases needed to reach a steady state of maximum efficiency in operating times using robotic assisted technology.
Patients and methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 682 consecutive knees that underwent a robotic-assisted TKA for osteoarthritis by a single surgeon between 2017 and 2020. Procedure times (minutes), length of stay (LOS), and short-term postoperative complications and reoperations were analyzed to define trends. Time series analyses were used to identify the approximate time-point at which a maximum level of surgical operating speed was achieved. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and chi-square analyses then followed to compare average procedure duration, LOS, and complications across distinct moving groups of 50 procedures.
Results: Time series analyses suggest substantially improved times by the 50th procedure and reached a stable plateau between the 150th and 200th procedure. Average duration for the first 50 procedures was approximately 85 min, dropping to 69 min for procedures 51-100, 66 min for procedures 101-150, and then plateauing at approximately 61 min for procedures 151-682, demonstrating significant improvements in surgical efficiency at each 50-procedure interval (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in LOS, readmissions, and reoperations with increasing groups of 50 procedures performed.
Conclusion: Results from this study will allow surgeons to better understand the implications of integrating robotic arm-assisted technology into their practice. Surgeons can expect significant improvement of their operative time following completion of at least 50 procedures, while likely reaching a maximum level of surgical efficiency between 151 and 200 procedures."
pub.1008311121,Surgical navigation for total knee arthroplasty: A perspective,"A new generation of surgical tools, known as surgical navigation systems, has been developed to help surgeons install implants more accurately and reproducibly. Navigation systems also record quantitative information such as joint range of motion, laxity, and kinematics intra-operatively. This article reviews the history of surgical navigation for total knee arthroplasty, the biomechanical principles associated with this technology, and the related clinical research studies. We describe how navigation has the potential to address three main challenges for total knee arthroplasty: ensuring excellent and consistent outcomes, treating younger and more physically active patients, and enabling less invasive surgery."
pub.1167815620,Evaluation of the native femoral neck and stem version reproducibility using robotic-arm assisted direct-anterior total hip arthroplasty.,"The intraoperative measurement of the femoral version (FV) has gained attention in wake of an optimised combined version (CV) philosophy. Whereas some data is available utilising different approaches, to our belief this study provides the first in vivo FV data in DA-THA using the MAKO™ robot. To improve the accuracy of the femoral stem version in DA-THA, we want to ask the following question: How effectively can we reproduce the native femoral version in DA- THA using the MAKO™ robot? The first 125 total hip cases through DAA with the use of the combined anteversion concept and the help of the MAKO™ robot from a single institution, single surgeon from January 2020 to July 2021 were retrospectively analysed. The native version (NV) and broach version (BV) were determined with the use of the MAKO™ preoperative computed tomography planning software. The data of the NV and BV of 115 withheld patients was normally distributed. The native femoral version ranged from -12° till 33° (mean 7,8° +/- 8,1) and the broach version ranged from -18° till 43° (mean 8,2° +/- 9,9). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the NV and BV was 0,78. The native femoral version can be reproduced by broaching the proximal femur, in a robotically implanted direct anterior cementless THA, with 78% effectiveness. Stem placement seemed to be more precise with growing experience, however this appeared not to be significant."
pub.1168098693,A new designed full process coverage robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty: a multicentre randomized clinical trial,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of a new complete robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) with that of the manual total hip arthroplasty (MTHA) and to verify the accuracy and safety of the former.
METHODS: Overall, 148 patients were enroled from 3 March 2021 to 28 December 2021 in this study and classified into RA-THA ( n =74 patients) and MTHA ( n =74 patients) groups. The sex, age, operative side, BMI, diagnosis, other basic information, operative time, acetabular prosthesis anteversion and inclination, femoral prosthesis anteversion and angulation, femoral prosthesis filling rate, leg length discrepancy (LLD), Harris hip score, and visual analogue scale (VAS) score of the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the two groups regarding sex, age, operative side, BMI, diagnosis, Harris hip score, VAS score, acetabular inclination, acetabular prosthesis anteversion, femoral prosthesis anteversion, combined anteversion, and femoral prosthesis filling rate ( P >0.05). The operative time was significantly longer in the RA-THA group than in the MTHA group (106.71±25.22 min vs. 79.42±16.16 min; t=7.30, P <0.05). The femoral angulation (1.78°±0.64°) and LLD (2.87±1.55 mm) in the RA-THA group were significantly lesser than those in the MTHA group (2.22°±1.11° and 5.81±6.27 mm, respectively; t=-2.95 and t=-3.88, P <0.05).
CONCLUSION: The complete RA-THA has some advantages over the traditional procedure in restoring the lower limb length and controlling the femoral prosthesis angulation. Thus, this study verifies the accuracy and safety of the robot-assisted system."
pub.1149899122,Comparison of Exeter stem offset size for total hip arthroplasty between males and females: A retrospective series of 780 hips,"Background: Many orthopaedic surgeons use a 'standard' stem offset length, typically 37.5 mm and 44 mm for females and males respectively, in total hip arthroplasty. With increasingly personalized surgery, 'standard' one-size-fits-all stem lengths may be outdated. This study aims to test whether pre-operative templating affects stem length choice and whether 'standard' stem sizes are therefore outdated.
Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all total hip arthroplasty patients using Stryker's Exeter cemented femoral hip system in our centre between 2016 and 2020. Demographic and surgical data were collected. Data from surgeons who templated pre-operatively were compared to data from those who did not.
Results: 780 patients were included (309 male, 471 female), average age 71.4 years (range 23-96). We found a significant difference between male and female offset lengths; more males had an offset length of 44 mm and more females had an offset length of 37.5 mm (p = 0.004). Among surgeons who did not template pre-operatively, 20.6% of female patients and 10.3% of male patients had other 'non-standard' offset lengths. Among surgeons who did template pre-operatively, the proportion of both female and male patients who had other 'non-standard' offset lengths was significantly higher (43.1% and 23.4%, respectively p < 0.05).
Conclusions: The difference between templating and non-templating surgeons' stem choice revealed significant individual variability between males and females. 'Standard' offset lengths for males and females were still used in the majority of our cohort. However, with the emergence of mainstream robotic arthroplasty, we feel that pre-operative templating has become a minimum standard."
pub.1112063713,Robotics‐assisted versus conventional manual approaches for total hip arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta‐analysis of comparative studies,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared robotics-assisted (RA) and conventional manual (CM) approaches for total hip arthroplasty (THA), but their results are controversial.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted for controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing the clinical efficacy of the RA and CM approaches for THA and published between August 1998 and August 2018. The obtained data were analyzed using the statistical software Review Manager 5.3.
RESULTS: Fourteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, which revealed that the RA group had less intraoperative complications, better cup angle, and more cases of cup placement in the safe zone than the CM group. However, the operation time required for the CM group was less than that required for the RA group. Moreover, postoperative complications (eg, dislocation and revision surgery) were less frequent in the CM group than in the RA group. However, the two groups had similar functional scores, total number of complications, and rate of occurrence of limb length discrepancy.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the CM approach, the RA approach yields better radiological outcomes and fewer intraoperative complications in THA, but similar functional scores."
pub.1021342921,Impingement and stability of total hip arthroplasty versus femoral head resurfacing using a cadaveric robotics model,"We identified and compared the impingent-free range of motion (ROM) and subluxation potential for native hip, femoral head resurfacing (FHR), and total hip arthroplasty (THA). These constructs were also compared both with and without soft tissue to elucidate the role of the soft tissue. Five fresh-frozen bilateral hip specimens were mounted to a six-degree of freedom robotic manipulator. Under load-control parameters, in vivo mechanics were recreated to evaluate impingement free ROM, and the subluxation potential in two ""at risk"" positions for native hip, FHR, and THA. Impingement-free ROM of the skeletonized THA was greater than FHR for the anterior subluxation position. For skeletonized posterior subluxations, stability for THA and FHR constructs were similar, while a different pattern was observed for specimens with soft tissues intact. FHR constructs were more stable than THA constructs for both anterior and posterior subluxations. When the femoral neck is intact the joint has an earlier impingement profile placing the hip at risk for subluxation. However, FHR design was shown to be more stable than THA only when soft tissues were intact."
pub.1010710616,Coordinated control of bone cutting for a CT‐free navigation robotic system in total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robots are gradually becoming intelligent tools for surgeons in computer assisted orthopedic surgery. A hands-on robot combining CT-free navigation software and coordinated control has been designed for total knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: The hands-on robot is under bilateral force control so that the robot not only follows the force commands from the operator but also shapes the reflected force back to the operator. The proposed coordinated control also defines three operating modes to fulfill intelligent bone cutting by tuning appropriate scaling to the admittance gains.
RESULTS: Experimental results demonstrated assistive, resistant and emergent actions to meet various bone cutting conditions by the coordinated controller.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed coordinated controller enables the robot to perform bone cutting more safely, rapidly and accurately compared with being performed by manual bone saw. The intelligent bone cutting has been successfully verified by a cadaver test."
pub.1145175125,Augmented Intelligence in Joint Replacement Surgery: How can artificial intelligence (AI) bridge the gap between the man and the machine?,"Robot-assisted arthroplasty is likely to grow exponentially in the years to come. While most surgeons recognize their superiority in refining alignment and improving component positioning accuracy, the universal adaptability of robots remains slow due to certain technological and behavioural gaps. Endoprosthesis robots currently suffer from increased reaction time, lack of natural adaptation to the surgeon's abilities, and unavailability and inapplicability in different surgical contexts. As humans and machines have to move forward into the next phase of their relationship, robots enabled with artificial intelligence (AI) may become more advanced and an alternative to overcome existing challenges like cost, training, and improve performance based on feedback provided by surgeons. Augmented intelligence is perhaps a more apt word than artificial, as it reflects more human-machine fusion and several areas are already proactively adopting the terminology. Arthroplasty robots can benefit from AI by using computer vision models, applying sensors, and integrating feedback and loop execution. All of this would help achieve a technical superiority to the surgeon alone. This brief perspective on how humans and machines are likely to benefit from the integration of AI outlines the technical side of this enablement."
pub.1129541035,Robotic Arm-assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty is More Cost-Effective Than Manual Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Markov Model Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the benchmark surgical treatment of advanced and symptomatic hip osteoarthritis. Preliminary evidence suggests that the robotic arm-assisted (RAA) technology yields more accurate and reproducible acetabular cup placement, which may improve survival rate and clinical results, but economic considerations are less well-defined. The purpose of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of the RAA THA with manual THA (mTHA) modalities, considering direct medical costs and utilities from a payer's perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to analyze two potential interventions for hip osteoarthritis and degenerative joint disorder: RAA THA and mTHA. Potential outcomes of THA were categorized into the transition states: infection, dislocation, no major complications, or revision. Cumulative costs and utilities were assessed using a cycle length of 1 year over a time horizon of 5 years.
RESULTS: RAA THA cohort was cost effective relative to mTHA cohort for cumulative Medicare and cumulative private payer insurance costs over the 5-year period. RAA THA cost saving had an average differential of $945 for Medicare and $1,810 for private insurance relative to mTHA while generating slightly more utility (0.04 quality-adjusted life year). The preferred treatment was sensitive to the utilities generated by successful RAA THA and mTHA. Microsimulations indicated that RAA THA was cost effective in 99.4% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Medicare and private payer scenarios, RAA THA is more cost effective than conventional mTHA when considering direct medical costs from a payer's perspective.

pub.1171537640,"Enhanced recovery after surgery day surgery for MAKO® robotic-arm assisted TKA; better outcome for patients, improved efficiency for hospitals","Introduction: Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) was designed to improve implant position accuracy by providing surgeons with real-time intra-operative data to tailor the operation to the patient. Proponents of robotic-assisted TKA believe that this translates into meaningful improvements in outcomes. However, there are concerns that the longer surgical duration associated with robotic-assisted TKA leads to longer length of stay (LOS). In this study, the authors investigated the outcome of MAKO® Robotic-arm Assisted TKA combined with ERAS protocol to assess its effect on LOS and short-term outcomes.
Methods: All patients who had undergone unilateral MAKO® ERAS Day Surgery TKA from August 2020 to July 2021 were prospectively followed up and matched to patients who underwent conventional ERAS Day Surgery TKA in the same time period. Factors such as surgical duration, LOS, immediate reduction in pain, 30-days complications, and 6-month PROMs and knee ROM were compared between the two groups.
Results: 42 patients underwent MAKO® ERAS Day surgery TKA and were matched to 42 patients who underwent conventional ERAS Day surgery TKA. The study found that despite the longer surgical duration, LOS was comparable between both groups (1.1 ± 0.9days in the MAKO® group vs 1.0 ± 0.3days in the conventional group, p = 0.755) with successful 24-hour discharge in 88.1 % of patients in the MAKO® group. The MAKO® group achieved significantly better ROM compared to the conventional group 6-months post operatively. Post-operative PROMs were comparable between both groups.
Conclusion: ERAS Day Surgery protocol can significantly reduce the LOS of patient undergoing MAKO® Robotic-arm Assisted TKA, conferring cost savings and making it a valid option for patients."
pub.1156099119,Biopsychosocial effects and experience of use of robotic and virtual reality devices in neuromotor rehabilitation: A study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR)-based neuromotor rehabilitation have shown promising evidence in terms of patient's neuromotor recovery, so far. However, still little is known on the perceived experience of use of robotic and VR devices and the related psychosocial impact. The present study outlines a study protocol aiming to investigate the biopsychosocial effects and the experience of use of robotic and non-immersive VR devices in patients undergoing neuromotor rehabilitation.
METHODS: Adopting a prospective, two-arm, non-randomized study design, patients with different neuromotor diseases (i.e., acquired brain injury, Parkinson's Disease, and total knee/hip arthroplasty) undergoing rehabilitation will be included. In a real-world clinical setting, short- (4 weeks) and long-term (6 months) changes in multiple patient's health domains will be investigated, including the functional status (i.e., motor functioning, ADLs, risk of falls), cognitive functioning (i.e., attention and executive functions), physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and the psychological status (i.e., anxiety and depression, quality of life satisfaction). At post-intervention, the overall rehabilitation experience, the psychosocial impact of the robotic and VR devices will be assessed, and technology perceived usability and experience of use will be evaluated through a mixed-methods approach, including both patients' and physiotherapists' perspectives. Repeated measures within-between interaction effects will be estimated, and association analyses will be performed to explore the inter-relationships among the variables investigated. Data collection is currently ongoing.
IMPLICATIONS: The biopsychosocial framework adopted will contribute to expanding the perspective on patient's recovery within the technology-based rehabilitation field beyond motor improvement. Moreover, the investigation of devices experience of use and usability will provide further insight into technology deployment in neuromotor rehabilitation programs, thereby maximising therapy engagement and effectiveness.

This study sought to identify sagittal and coronal alignment targets that correlate with minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
METHODS: A total of 1,311 consecutive total knee arthroplasties were retrospectively reviewed. Posterior tibial slope (PTS), femoral flexion (FF), and tibio-femoral alignment (TFA) were measured radiographically. Patients were grouped based on whether they achieved multiple MCIDs for PROM scores. Classification and regression tree machine learning models were utilized to identify optimal alignment zones. The mean follow-up was 2.4 years (range, 1 to 11).
RESULTS: The change in PTS and postoperative TFA were most predictive for achieving MCIDs in 90% of the models. Approximating native PTS within 4° correlated with MCID achievement and superior PROMs. Preoperative varus and neutral aligned knees were more likely to meet MCIDs and superior PROM scores when not overcorrected into valgus postoperatively (≥7°). Preoperative valgus-aligned knees correlated with MCID achievement when postoperative TFA was not overcorrected into substantial varus (<0°). Albeit less impactful, FF ≤ 7° correlated with MCID achievement and superior PROMs regardless of preoperative alignment. Sagittal and coronal alignment measurements had moderate to strong interactions in 13 of 20 models.
CONCLUSION: Optimized PROM MCIDs correlated with approximating native PTS while maintaining similar preoperative TFA and incorporating moderate FF. Study findings demonstrate interactions between sagittal and coronal alignment which may optimize PROMs, highlighting the importance of three-dimensional implant alignment targets.

pub.1153002209,Sex and Gender-Related Differences in the Outcome of Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Current Concepts Review,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Sex and gender-related differences may influence the outcome of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). The present paper aims to depict the importance of sex and gender-related issues in the perioperative management of patients undergoing THA to improve clinical outcomes and prevent postoperative complications. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> From January 2002 to August 2022, OVID-MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPU S, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed were searched to identify relevant studies for further analysis. The search strategy included the following terms: ((""gender-related differences"" [MeSH Terms] OR ""sex-related differences"" [All Fields]) OR (""gender indicators"" [MeSH Terms] OR ""sex"" [All Fields])) AND (""total hip arthroplasty"" [MeSH Terms] OR (total hip replacement [All Fields])). <i>Results:</i> Twenty-eight papers were included in this current concepts review. Sex and gender-related differences were analyzed with regard to the following points: (1) surgical approach, robotic surgery, scar cosmesis, and implant choice; (2) postoperative clinical outcome and complications; (3) sexual activity after THA; and (4) psychological status and daily functional requirements. The data analysis showed that female patients need more specific attention in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases to improve clinical and functional outcomes, reduce complications risk, and manage patient satisfaction. <i>Conclusions:</i> THA outcomes may be influenced by sex and gender-related factors which should be carefully assessed and addressed in patients undergoing surgery to improve the postoperative outcomes of patients' satisfaction and reduce postoperative complications that can differ between the two sexes."
pub.1157622557,Analysis of Gait Ability and Patient Reported Outcome Measurements after Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty for Osteoarthritis of the Knee with Windswept Deformity,"Introduction: Windswept deformity (WD) refers to valgus deformity in one knee and varus deformity in the other. We performed robotic-assisted (RA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for osteoarthritis of the knee with WD, made patient reported outcome measurements (PROMs), and performed gait analysis based on triaxial accelerometery.
Case Report: A 76-year-old woman presented to our hospital with bilateral knee pain. Image-free handheld RA TKA was performed on the left knee with severe varus deformity and severe pain during walking. RA TKA was performed on the right knee with severe valgus deformity 1 month later. The RA technique was used to determine implant positioning and the plan for osteotomy intraoperatively, taking into account soft-tissue balance. This made it possible to use a posterior stabilized implant instead of a semi-constrained implant for severe valgus knee deformity with flexion contracture (Krachow classification Type 2). At 1 year after TKA, PROMs were inferior in the knee with pre-operative valgus deformity. Gait ability improved after surgery. Even with the RA technique, it took 8 months to achieve left-right balance while walking and for the variability of the gait cycle to become equivalent to that of a normal knee.
Conclusion: Primary RA TKA is a viable option for osteoarthritis of the knee with WD. It took time for the gait ability of both knees to become equal and PROMs were better with the varus deformity compared to before surgery."
pub.1132253930,Robotic arm-assisted bi-unicompartmental knee arthroplasty maintains natural knee joint anatomy compared with total knee arthroplasty: a prospective randomized controlled trial,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare robotic arm-assisted bi-unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (bi-UKA) with conventional mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in order to determine the changes in the anatomy of the knee and alignment of the lower limb following surgery.
METHODS: An analysis of 38 patients who underwent TKA and 32 who underwent bi-UKA was performed as a secondary study from a prospective, single-centre, randomized controlled trial. CT imaging was used to measure coronal, sagittal, and axial alignment of the knee preoperatively and at three months postoperatively to determine changes in anatomy that had occurred as a result of the surgery. The hip-knee-ankle angle (HKAA) was also measured to identify any differences between the two groups.
RESULTS: The pre- to postoperative changes in joint anatomy were significantly less in patients undergoing bi-UKA in all three planes in both the femur and tibia, except for femoral sagittal component orientation in which there was no difference. Overall, for the six parameters of alignment (three femoral and three tibial), 47% of bi-UKAs and 24% TKAs had a change of < 2° (p = 0.045). The change in HKAA towards neutral in varus and valgus knees was significantly less in patients undergoing bi-UKA compared with those undergoing TKA (p < 0.001). Alignment was neutral in those undergoing TKA (mean 179.5° (SD 3.2°)) while those undergoing bi-UKA had mild residual varus or valgus alignment (mean 177.8° (SD 3.4°)) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted, cruciate-sparing bi-UKA maintains the natural anatomy of the knee in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes better, and may therefore preserve normal joint kinematics, compared with a mechanically aligned TKA. This includes preservation of coronal joint line obliquity. HKAA alignment was corrected towards neutral significantly less in patients undergoing bi-UKA, which may represent restoration of the pre-disease constitutional alignment (p &lt; 0.001).

pub.1168277107,Intraoperative Assessment of Stability in Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Novel Method Utilizing Implant Collinearity,"Background: Hip dislocation remains a leading cause of revision following total hip arthroplasty, and intraoperative assessment of acetabular positioning can be difficult to perform. There are multiple clinical tests, as well as computer and robotic techniques, that aim to reduce dislocation rates after hip arthroplasty. These approaches aim to optimize the relationship between acetabular and femoral component positioning. It is hypothesized in this study that implant collinearity assessment intraoperatively can help determine appropriate acetabular component position. More specifically, implant collinearity, when achieved with a specific leg position, can reliably predict appropriate acetabular positioning.
Methods: A single-surgeon, single-centered study with 55 patients was undertaken between August 2017 and March 2020. Using preoperative imaging and computer simulation, data points were taken for 3 different acetabular configurations and comparing using 2 femoral positions. The angle differences from the collinear position (0 degrees) were compared between groups.
Results: A total of 55 patients' imaging was analyzed using 3 acetabular configurations and 2 femoral positions. The test leg position (30-degree flexion/30-degree internal rotation/10-degree adduction) was closer to collinearity than the control position (30-degree flexion/30-degree internal rotation/0-degree adduction) in all 3 acetabular configurations by a mean of 8 degrees (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), 7 degrees (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and 4 degrees (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), respectively.
Conclusions: The use of a 10-degree adducted position more reliably recreates implant collinearity when determining acetabular positioning during total hip arthroplasty. This intraoperative test adds another data point to assist the surgeon in achieving safe component positioning."

In this study, the performance of 3 assistants holding the medial retractor during minimally invasive hip arthroplasty was compared with a semiactive retractor holder in a cadaver setup.
METHODS: A total of 40 measurements on 3 cadavers were carried out with each subject (3 human, 1 robot) measuring each cadaver 10 times. The retractor was equipped with a sensor array on both sides, to measure variations of the retracting pressures over a 2-minute interval.
RESULTS: The semiactive retractor holder showed an almost constant performance compared with the test subjects. There was no significant reduction of the applied pressure and almost no variation during the 2-minute interval and across all measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the semiactive retractor holder was more stable than that of a human assistant, making it suitable for intraoperative usage."
pub.1173933690,Early and delayed periprosthetic joint infection in robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a multicenter study,"BackgroundRobot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has significantly improved knee surgery outcomes in the last few years. However, its association with the periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) rate remains debatable. This study investigates the incidence of early and delayed PJI in a multicentric cohort of patients who underwent RA-TKA, aiming to elucidate the risk associated with this procedure.MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed data from a consecutive series of patients who underwent RA-TKA using the NAVIO Surgical System (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, USA) between 2020 and 2023. The inclusion criteria encompassed individuals over 18 years of age with a minimum follow-up period of three months. The primary outcome was the incidence of early and delayed PJI, defined according to the European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS) diagnostic criteria. Secondary outcomes included the evaluation of postoperative complications.ResultsThe study included patients who underwent RA-TKA with the NAVIO system, achieving an average follow-up of 9.1 ± 3.9 months. None of the patients met the EBJIS criteria for a likely or confirmed infection, indicating an absence of both early and delayed PJI cases. Two patients required subsequent surgical interventions due to patellar maltracking and prosthetic loosening, respectively. Additionally, three patients underwent passive manipulation under anesthesia (MUA).ConclusionThe findings indicate no evidence of early or delayed PJI in patients undergoing RA-TKA within the study period. The low complication rate further supports the reliability and safety of this surgical technique in short-term follow-up.Level of evidenceIV."
pub.1028882098,Kinematic Analysis of Conventional and High-Flexion Cruciate-Retaining Total Knee Arthroplasties An In Vitro Investigation,"This study examined the kinematics of a cruciate-retaining (CR) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) component that attempts to enhance knee flexion by improving posterior tibiofemoral articular contact at high-flexion angles. Using an in vitro robotic experimental setup, medial and lateral femoral translations of this CR design were compared with that of a conventional CR TKA design and intact knee under a combined quadriceps and hamstring muscle load. Both CR TKA designs showed similar kinematics throughout the range of flexion (0 degrees -150 degrees ). The TKAs restored nearly 80% of the posterior femoral translation of the intact knee at 150 degrees . The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) forces measured for the high-flexion CR TKA component indicate that the PCL is important in the mid-flexion range but has little effect on knee kinematics at high flexion."
pub.1093032151,Coronal Correction for Severe Deformity Using Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Although robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has the potential to accurately reproduce neutral alignment, it is still unclear if this correction is attainable in patients who have severe varus or valgus deformities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess a single surgeon's experience with correcting coronal deformities using the robotic-assisted TKA device. Specifically, we looked at correction of varying degrees of varus and valgus deformity in patients who underwent robotic arm-assisted TKA. A total of 330 robotic-assisted TKA cases performed by a single surgeon were analyzed. Preoperative CT scans were registered to the robotic-assisted software to create a three-dimensional rendering from which coronal alignment was measured. Postoperative coronal alignment measurements were taken in the operating room using the robotic-assisted device after trial component placement. The robotic-assisted device uses optical tracking from navigation probes placed on the distal femur and proximal tibia. The robotic-assisted software can register these probes as bony landmarks to measure coronal alignment in the distal plane of the femoral component and proximal plane of the tibial component. A total of 261 cases were of varus knees, 46 cases were of valgus knees, and 23 cases had 0° preoperative alignment. Severe deformity was defined as 7° or greater deformity. Preoperative neutral alignment was defined as 0°, while postoperative neutral alignment was defined as 0° ± 3°. There were 129 patients with and initial severe varus and 7 patients with an initial severe valgus deformity of 7° or greater. Patients were divided into varus or valgus cohorts, and analysis was performed on the overall cohort, as well as nonsevere (<7°) and severe (7° or greater) deformity cohorts.All 132 knees with initial varus deformity of less than 7° were corrected to neutral (mean 1°, range -1-3°). A total of 82 knees (64%) with 7° or greater varus deformity were corrected to neutral (mean 2°, range 0-3°). However, roughly 30% of patients with severe deformity who were not corrected to neutral were still corrected within a couple of degrees of neutral. There were seven knees with 7° or greater valgus deformity, and all were corrected to neutral (mean 2°, range 0-3°). This study demonstrated that all knees were corrected in the appropriate direction within a few degrees of neutral, and no knees were overcorrected. The implication of this ability to achieve alignment goals on clinical outcomes will need to be evaluated in future studies. The results from this study demonstrate the potential for the robotic-assisted device during TKA in helping surgeons achieve a preoperatively planned desired neutral alignment."
pub.1170371376,Efficacy and safety of robotic-assisted knee reconstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Robotic-assisted surgery is increasingly being utilized in hip and knee reconstruction. However, the relative efficacy and safety of robotic-assisted total knee replacement (RATKR) compared to traditional surgery remained uncertain. This study aimed to systematically review the current literature comparing the outcomes of RATKR to traditional procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in major databases to identify studies comparing RATKR with traditional surgeries. The primary outcomes were functional scores and post-operative complications. Pooled mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were considered for inclusion. The pooled functional scores of The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee Society Score (KSS), hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, visual analogue score (VAS) pain score showed no significant differences between the two groups (MD = -0.99, 95% CI -2.32 to 0.34, p-value = 0.14). The subgroup analysis for hip and knee reconstructions also revealed no significant difference in terms of functional scores. However, for post-operative complications, while there was no significant difference in terms of blood loss (MD = -1.62, 95% CI -4.42 to 1.17, p-value = 0.25), the readmission rates were significantly higher in the RATKR group (MD = 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11, p-value < 0.00001). The overall heterogeneity was extremely high (I² = 93%), particularly in the analyses of post-operative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that robotic-assisted knee reconstruction did not significantly improve functional outcomes compared to traditional surgery. The safety profile was similar except for a higher readmission rate following RATKR. Given the high heterogeneity, further large-scale, well-designed, randomized controlled trials are needed to conclusively determine the efficacy and safety of robotic-assisted hip and knee reconstruction."
pub.1107454237,Intraoperative placement of total hip arthroplasty components with robotic-arm assisted technology correlates with postoperative implant position: a CT-based study.,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of implant placement when using robotic assistance during total hip arthroplasty (THA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients underwent a planned THA using preoperative CT scans and robotic-assisted software. There were nine men and 11 women (n = 20 hips) with a mean age of 60.8 years (sd 6.0). Pelvic and femoral bone models were constructed by segmenting both preoperative and postoperative CT scan images. The preoperative anatomical landmarks using the robotic-assisted system were matched to the postoperative 3D reconstructions of the pelvis. Acetabular and femoral component positions as measured intraoperatively and postoperatively were evaluated and compared.
RESULTS: The system reported accurate values for reconstruction of the hip when compared to those measured postoperatively using CT. The mean deviation from the executed overall hip length and offset were 1.6 mm (sd 2.9) and 0.5 mm (sd 3.0), respectively. Mean combined anteversion was similar and correlated between intraoperative measurements and postoperative CT measurements (32.5°, sd 5.9° versus 32.2°, sd 6.4°; respectively; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65; p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant correlation between mean intraoperative (40.4°, sd 2.1°) acetabular component inclination and mean measured postoperative inclination (40.12°, sd 3.0°, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.62; p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant correlation between mean intraoperative version (23.2°, sd 2.3°), and postoperatively measured version (23.0°, sd 2.4°; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76; p &lt; 0.001). Preoperative and postoperative femoral component anteversion were significantly correlated with one another (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64; p &lt; 0.001). Three patients had CT scan measurements that differed substantially from the intraoperative robotic measurements when evaluating stem anteversion.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate the success of hip reconstruction overall using robotic-assisted THA. The overall hip reconstruction obtained in the operating theatre using robotic assistance accurately correlated with the postoperative component position assessed independently using CT based 3D modelling. Clinical correlation during surgery should continue to be practiced and compared with observed intraoperative robotic values. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:1303-9."
pub.1106152047,Does the Robotic Arm and Preoperative CT Planning Help with 3D Intraoperative Total Knee Arthroplasty Planning?,"Although several studies highlight the advantages of robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA), few investigate its intraoperative outcome. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the RA-TKA's ability to assist with intraoperative correction of: (1) flexion and (2) extension gaps, as well as its ability to (3) accurately predict implant sizes. Additionally, in this RA-TKA cohort, length of stay, complications, and readmissions were assessed. A total of 335 patients who underwent RA-TKA were included. The robotic software virtually measured the intraoperative prebone cut extension and flexion gaps. Differences in medial versus lateral prebone cut extension and flexion gaps were calculated. A total of 155 patients (46%) had an extension gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, -0.3 mm), while 119 patients (36%) had a flexion gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, -0.6 mm). Postbone cut differences in medial versus lateral flexion and extension gaps were measured. Balanced knees were considered to have a medial and lateral flexion gap difference within 2 mm. The robot-predicted implant size was also compared with the final implant size. Additionally, lengths of stay, complications, and readmissions were assessed. All patients achieved a postbone cut extension gap difference between -1 and 1 mm (mean, -0.1 mm). A total of 332 patients (99%) achieved a postbone cut flexion gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, 0 mm). For 98% of prostheses, the robotic software predicted within 1 implant size the actual tibial or femoral implant size used.The mean length of stay was found to be 2 days. No patients suffered from superficial skin infection, pin site infections or fractures, soft tissue damage, and no robotic cases were converted to manual TKA due to intraoperative complications. A total of 8 patients (2.2%) were readmitted; however, none were directly related to robotic use. The robotic software and use of a preoperative computed tomography (CT) substantially helped with intraoperative planning and accurate prediction of implant sizes. Therefore, based on the results of this study, the RA-TKA device does, in fact, provide considerable intraoperative assistance."
pub.1005747846,Quantitative Analysis of Technological Innovation in Knee Arthroplasty Using Patent and Publication Metrics to Identify Developments and Trends,"BACKGROUND: Surgery is in a constant continuum of innovation with refinement of technique and instrumentation. Arthroplasty surgery potentially represents an area with highly innovative process. This study highlights key area of innovation in knee arthroplasty over the past 35 years using patent and publication metrics. Growth rates and patterns are analyzed. Patents are correlated to publications as a measure of scientific support.
METHODS: Electronic patent and publication databases were searched over the interval 1980-2014 for ""knee arthroplasty"" OR ""knee replacement."" The resulting patent codes were allocated into technology clusters. Citation analysis was performed to identify any important developments missed on initial analysis. The technology clusters identified were further analyzed, individual repeat searches performed, and growth curves plotted.
RESULTS: The initial search revealed 3574 patents and 16,552 publications. The largest technology clusters identified were Unicompartmental, Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI), Navigation, and Robotic knee arthroplasties. The growth in patent activity correlated strongly with publication activity (Pearson correlation value 0.892, P < .01), but was growing at a faster rate suggesting a decline in vigilance. PSI, objectively the fastest growing technology in the last 5 years, is currently in a period of exponential growth that began a decade ago. Established technologies in the study have double s-shaped patent curves.
CONCLUSION: Identifying trends in emerging technologies is possible using patent metrics and is useful information for training and regulatory bodies. The decline in ratio of publications to patents and the uninterrupted growth of PSI are developments that may warrant further investigation."
pub.1122334655,Accuracy of Bone Resection in MAKO Total Knee Robotic-Assisted Surgery,"Accurate component positioning and planning is vital to prevent malalignment of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) as malalignment is associated with an increased rate of polyethylene wear and revision arthroplasty. The MAKO total knee robotic arm-assisted surgery (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI) uses a preoperative computed tomography scan of the patient's knee and three-dimensional planning to size and orientate implants prior to bone resection. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the MAKO Total Knee system in achieving the preoperative plan for bone resection and final limb coronal alignment. A series of 45 consecutive cases was performed using the MAKO Total Knee system and Triathlon Total Knee implant (Stryker) between April 2018 and May 2019. The difference between what was planned and what was achieved for bone resection and coronal limb alignment was calculated. A total of 37 patients had their data captured using the MAKO system software. Mean difference from the plan for distal femoral cuts was 0.38mm (0.32) deep/proud, anterior femoral cuts 0.44mm (0.27) deep/proud and tibial cuts 0.37mm (0.30) deep/proud. In total, 99 out of 105 (94.29%) of bone resections were within 1mm of the plan. Mean absolute difference in final limb coronal alignment was 0.78° (0.78), with 78.13% being ≤1.00° of the plan, and 100% being ≤3.00° of the plan. The accuracy in achieving preoperatively planned bone resection and final limb coronal alignment using the MAKO Total Knee system is high. Future research is planned to look at whether this is associated with decreased rates of polyethylene wear and revision arthroplasty."

pub.1174290741,Impact of Joint Laxity on 2-Year KOOS Outcomes of Posterior Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty,"The objective of this study was to determine relationships between intraoperative posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) sacrificing posterior stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) laxity measurements throughout flexion and patient outcomes at 2 years post-TKA and to define clinically relevant laxity thresholds to optimize patient outcomes.In a single-surgeon study, PCL sacrificing TKA using a robotics-assisted platform with a digital joint tensioning device was performed in 115 knees in 115 patients. Final intraoperative joint laxity was recorded, and 2-year Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs) were obtained. A Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm was used to identify medial and lateral laxity windows which maximized the 2-year KOOS pain score. Wilcoxon nonparametric tests were used to compare outcomes between groups.Significant associations were found between intraoperative joint laxity and 2-year KOOS pain outcomes throughout flexion. Clinically relevant laxity windows were defined medially and laterally in mid-flexion and flexion for improved outcomes, whereas only a lateral laxity window could be defined in extension. When all laxity windows were satisfied, a 14.5-KOOS point improvement was found (97.2 vs. 77.8, <i>p</i> = 0.0060) compared to knees which did not satisfy any window. Improvements in Activities of Daily Living (Δ8.8, <i>p</i> = 0.0143), Sports (Δ22.5, <i>p</i> = 0.0108), and Quality of Life (Δ18.7, <i>p</i> = 0.0011) KOOS subscores were also found in knees which satisfied all windows versus 0-1 window.Intraoperative joint laxity is associated with postoperative outcomes in a PS knee design, wherein patients balanced within identified laxity targets reported improved outcomes over those that did not. Clinically significant thresholds were defined and were predominately found in mid-flexion and flexion for medial and lateral laxity. When target windows were combined further improved outcomes were identified."
pub.1124431481,Robotic-Assisted versus Manual Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: Contemporary Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Early Functional Outcomes,"Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RA-UKA) aims to improve accuracy of component placement. Studies have shown improvement in radiographic positioning/alignment with RA-UKA but have not addressed clinical outcome measures (COMs). The purpose of this study was to determine if RA-UKA is associated with improved early revision rates and functional outcome scores (FOS) compared with manual UKA. A systematic review of all English language articles from 1999 to 2019 on RA-UKA using Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases identified 277 studies. Seven (three randomized controlled trials) met inclusion criteria. Revision rates/FOS were aggregated for RA-UKA and manual UKA; a forest plot was constructed utilizing inverse variance/Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects meta-analysis. The seven articles included a total of 363 RA-UKA patients and 425 manual UKA patients. Mean age was 66 ± 3.5 and 65 ± 4.0 years, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.8 ± 2.1 and 27.1 ± 1.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Mean follow-up was 25.5 months (4.5-48) and 29.1 months (4.5-48) for RA-UKA and manual UKA, respectively. At latest follow-up, RA-UKA patients showed a 26% ± 12 improvement in COMs versus 24% ± 12 improvement for manual UKA patients (<i>p</i> = 0.6). The revision rate was 3% for both groups (<i>p</i> = 0.8); however, a meta-analysis of RCTs showed no difference. Robotic and manual UKAs offer comparable improvements in pain, FOS, and revision rates. The effects of follow-up duration, ceiling effects of COMs, and surgeon experience remain unknown. Future studies comparing robotic versus manual UKAs with longer term follow-up may inform further benefits of each, with respect to component durability, alignment, and functional improvement."
pub.1013005686,Association and impact of patellofemoral dysplasia on patellofemoral arthropathy and arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The association of patellar and trochlear anomalies resulting in isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis has often been postulated but rarely studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of patellofemoral dysplasia, specifically trochlear anomalies, which are a cause for degenerative disease and may result in a worse outcome after arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral arthritis.
METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients who underwent robotic image-based patellofemoral arthroplasty were compared with an age and sex-matched group of patients who underwent medial unicompartmental arthroplasty using the same image-based navigation system and had no patellofemoral, lateral disease or malalignment. The compared parameters were the patellofemoral-trochlear angle and Dejour score in the preoperative radiographs and patellofemoral-trochlear angle and internal rotation of the trochlea compared to the intercondylar line in the proximal, middle and distal trochlea.
RESULTS: Significantly higher rates of patella alta (T=5, P=0.0001) and trochlear dysplasia (6% vs. 55%) were found, as manifested by an increase in the trochlear angle and Dejour score. Furthermore, the trochlea was found to have a higher degree of internal rotation in patients with isolated patellofemoral arthritis compared to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patellofemoral anomalies such as patella alta and trochlear dysplasia are present in association with isolated patellofemoral arthritis. Isolated patellofemoral arthritis is also associated with higher rates of trochlear internal rotation. Correction of this internal rotation is essential in the success of arthroplasty in patients with patellofemoral disease.

pub.1021176889,Robot-assisted primary cementless total hip arthroplasty with a short femoral stem: a prospective randomized short-term outcome study,"BACKGROUND: Recently, two topical issues in total hip arthroplasty (THA) have been robot-assisted surgery and use of a short stem. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of robotic milling on the accuracy of short femoral stem positioning and on the short-term clinical outcome in THA using a prospective, randomized design.
METHODS: We randomized 54 patients into two groups, either robotic milling group or manual rasping group. The patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at 8 weeks, 5 months, 12 months, and 24 months.
RESULTS: Robotic milling group had a significantly longer operation time, requiring on average 8.9 min for registration and 11.2 min for milling. On the other hand, robotic milling group showed superior results in terms of stem alignment and leg length equality. Two intraoperative femoral fractures occurred only in manual rasping group. Harris hip scores and WOMAC scores at 24 months postoperatively were similar in both groups. No complications including stem loosening, infection, nerve palsy, or dislocation were encountered in either group during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that robot-assisted short stem THA could increase the accuracy of stem alignment, improve leg length equality, and help reduce the risk of intraoperative femoral fracture as compared with manual rasping. However, the clinical outcome scores did not differ between the two groups at the time of short-term follow-up. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine whether there will be a long-term clinical relevance of robot-assisted implantation of short femoral stems in THA."
pub.1101902807,Decreased Time to Return to Work Using Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Compared to Conventional Techniques.,"INTRODUCTION: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a commonly used procedure for patients suffering from debilitating unicompartmental knee arthritis. For UKA recipients, robotic-assisted surgery has served as an aid in improving surgical accuracy and precision. While studies exist detailing outcomes of robotic UKA, to our knowledge, there are no studies assessing time to return to work using robotic-assisted UKA. Thus, the purpose of this study was to prospectively assess the time to return to work and to achieve the level of work activity following robotic-assisted UKA to create recommendations for patients preoperatively. We hypothesized that the return to work time would be shorter for robotic-assisted UKAs compared with TKAs and manual UKAs, due to more accurate ligament balancing and precise implementation of the operative plan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients scheduled to undergo a robotic-assisted UKA at an academic teaching hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria included employment at the time of surgery, with the intent on returning to the same occupation following surgery and having end-stage knee degenerative joint disease (DJD) limited to the medial compartment. Patients were contacted via email, letter, or phone at two, four, six, and 12 weeks following surgery until they returned to work. The Baecke physical activity questionnaire (BQ) was administered to assess patients' level of activity at work pre- and postoperatively. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and Excel® (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). Descriptive statistics were calculated to assess the demographics of the patient population. Boxplots were generated using an Excel® spreadsheet to visualize the BQ scores and a two-tailed t-test was used to assess for differences between pre- and postoperative scores with alpha 0.05.
RESULTS: The mean time to return to work was 6.4 weeks (SD=3.4, range 2-12 weeks), with a median time of six weeks. There was no difference seen in the mean pre- and postoperative BQ scores (2.70 vs. 2.69, respectively; p=0.87).
CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study suggest that most patients can return to work six weeks following robotic-assisted UKA which appears to be shorter than conventional UKA and TKA. Future level I studies are needed to verify our study findings."
pub.1144167011,The Learning Curve of Reaching the Planned Limb Alignment in Robotic-Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Evidence on the learning curve associated with robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (ra-TKA) is scarce and mostly based on operative time. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess a surgeon's learning experience based on accuracy to reach planned limb alignment and its impact on surgical-characteristics, limb-alignment, and perioperative-outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted on a consecutive series of 204 primary ra-TKAs (patients), performed by a single surgeon in a single institution (3/7/2018-to-6/18/2019). Cumulative summation control sequential analysis was used for the assessment of the learning curve using accuracy of reaching the planned limb alignment establishing that surgeries had an initial-learning-phase, followed by a second-consolidation-phase. Baseline demographics, operative/tourniquet times, prosthesis type, and limb alignment were compared between these two phases. Length of stay, discharge disposition, complications, reoperation/readmission (90 days), and total morphine equivalents (TMEs) prescribed were compared between phases. Independent sample <i>t</i>-tests, and chi-squared analyses were performed. ra-TKA demonstrated a learning curve of 110 cases for reaching planned limb alignment (<i>p</i> = 0.012). Robotic experience resulted in significantly more proportion of knees in neutral-axis postoperatively (<i>p</i> = 0.035) and significant reduction in TMEs prescribed (<i>p</i> = 0.04). The mean operative and tourniquet time were found to be significantly lower in second-phase versus the first-phase (<i>p</i> for both &lt; 0.0001). ra-TKA has a significant learning curve in clinical practice. A surgeon can reach the planned limb alignment with increased accuracy over time (110-cases). Progressive robotic learning and associated operative time efficiency can lead to significantly lower opioid consumption in patients undergoing TKA."
pub.1117605530,"Robotic arm assisted total knee arthroplasty workflow optimization, operative times and learning curve","Robotic arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) has many potential benefits including advanced preoperative templating, restoration of mechanical alignment, accuracy of bony resection, robust safety mechanisms, and dynamic gap balancing. One of the most frequently quoted drawbacks preventing experienced surgeons from adopting this technology is the perceived increase in surgical time. This technique paper outlines the general concepts used to improve operating room efficiency as well as the step-by-step workflow to consistently perform RTKA with surgical times under 60 minutes. Although the clinical and functional results of RTKA are just beginning to be described in literature, this manuscript demonstrates that with proper technique and workflow, surgical time should not be a significant factor to deter surgeons from adopting this new technology."
pub.1170644825,The effect of different alignment strategies on trochlear orientation after total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: When planning and delivering total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there are multiple coronal alignment strategies such as functional alignment (FA), kinematic alignment (KA), mechanical and adjusted mechanical alignment (MA, aMA). Recent three-dimensional and robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) studies have demonstrated that KA potentially better restores the trochlear anatomy than MA. The purpose of this study was to compare the restoration of the native trochlear orientation in patients undergoing RAS TKA using four different alignment strategies. It was hypothesised that FA would result in the lowest number of outliers.
METHODS: This is a prospective study of 200 patients undergoing RAS-TKA with a single implant. All patients were analysed for MA and KA prebalancing, and 157 patients received aMA and 43 patients FA with intraoperative balancing. Preoperative transverse computed tomography scans were used to determine the posterior condylar axis (PCA), lateral trochlear inclination (LTI) angle, sulcus angle (SA) and anterior trochlear line (ATL) angle. Implant measurements were obtained using a photographic analysis. Intraoperative software data combined with implant data and preoperative measurements were used to calculate the differences. Outliers were defined as ≥3° of alteration. Trochlea dysplasia was defined as LTI < 12°.
RESULTS: Native transepicondylar PCA had a median of 2°, LTI 18°, SA 137°, ATL 4°. LTI outliers were observed in 47%-60% of cases, with KA < FA < aMA < MA. For ATL, the range of outliers was 40.5%-85%, KA < FA < aMA < MA. SA produced 81% of outliers. Of all median angle values, only LTI when using KA was not significantly altered compared to the native knee.
CONCLUSION: There is a significant alteration of trochlear orientation after TKA, regardless of the alignment strategy used. KA produced the lowest, but a substantial, number of outliers. The uniform design of implants causes the surgeon to compromise on balance in flexion versus trochlear position. The clinical relevance of this compromise requires further clinical investigations.

pub.1169210382,Tourniquet does not affect intraoperative kinematics during total knee arthroplasty: Results of a prospective study using a robotic assistance system,"PURPOSE: Tourniquet use during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains controversial. There are limited data demonstrating the effect of tourniquet use on flexion and extension gaps. The use of a tourniquet can theoretically affect the kinematics of the knee joint, specifically the extension and flexion gaps and the laxity, by mechanically compressing the soft tissues including the muscles above the knee joint. Therefore, this study was designed to prospectively evaluate changes in flexion and extension gaps with and without the use of a tourniquet.
METHODS: The following prospective study included 50 consecutive patients who underwent TKA using a surgical robot. The inclusion criteria were advanced osteoarthritis (OA) and varus-alignment or valgus-alignment &lt;3° (hip-knee-ankle angle, standing long-leg X-ray), and the exclusion criteria were BMI &gt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and mechanical axis in &gt;3° valgus. A CR-TKA was performed, and the medial and lateral gaps (in mm) throughout the full range of motion in 10° increments were recorded. The procedure was conducted both with and without an applied tourniquet (350 mmHg).
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the medial joint space. By contrast, the lateral gap showed significant differences in 10-20° of flexion (with a tourniquet 1.9 mm vs. without a tourniquet 2.1 mm, p = 0.018), 20-30° (1.6 vs. 1.8 mm, p = 0.02), 100-110° (0.9 vs. 1.1 mm, p = 0.021), and 110-120° (0.8 vs. 1 mm, p = 0.038). Thus, at the above degrees of flexion on the lateral side, there was a decrease in the mean of 0.2 mm with the use of a tourniquet.
CONCLUSION: Although the use of a tourniquet showed a detectable change in the lateral gap in four 10° segments of flexion, clinical relevance with an average difference of 0.2 mm is not achieved. Thus, the use of a tourniquet in TKA can still be advocated based on the presented data.

pub.1004744757,Effect of arthritis in other compartment after unicompartmental arthroplasty,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of robotic-assisted (MAKO Surgical Corp.) unicondylar replacement in the treatment for knee osteoarthritis after the initial surgical insult is worn off to evaluate the impact of residual patellofemoral and lateral osteoarthritis on the outcome of medial unicompartmental knee replacement. One hundred and thirty-four patients who underwent uncomplicated 144 robotic-assisted medial unicondylar replacements for knee arthritis were identified and studied. Original radiographs were used to classify severity of patellofemoral and lateral compartmental osteoarthritis in these patients. Severity of patellofemoral and lateral compartmental osteoarthritis was analyzed against Oxford and Knee Society scores and amount of ipsilateral residual knee symptoms at 6 months postoperative period. Preoperative Oxford and Knee Society scores, other comorbidities and long-term disability were studied as confounding variables. We found significant improvement in symptoms and scores in spite of other compartment diseases. Poorer outcome was seen in association with comorbidities and long-term disability but not when radiographic signs of arthritis in the other compartments were present. Six patients required revision of which three had (lateral facet) patellofemoral disease in the original X-rays. In conclusion, there is a higher amount of postoperative retained symptoms, but similar outcome when there is radiographic disease in the other compartments. However, when symptoms are severe enough to necessitate revision, this is due to the lateral facet of patellofemoral compartment and not lateral compartment disease."
pub.1133119236,Estimation of Femoral Version During Total Hip Arthroplasty: Surgeon Visual Assessment versus Robotic-Arm Assisted Technology.,"INTRODUCTION: Malposition of THA implants can lead to many complications, some of which may necessitate reoperation. Thus, proper implant placement is critical for optimizing patient outcomes. In addition, intraoperative visual estimation of stem position has been shown to be unreliable. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare a surgeon's visual estimation of femoral version to the actual version captured using a three-dimensional robotic-arm assisted platform.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 25 THAs performed by a single surgeon was performed. The mean version, as estimated by intraoperative visual assessment, was compared to that measured by the robotic-arm assisted technology software using a two-sided t-test. Outliers were evaluated for the following intervals: 1 to 5°, 6 to 10°, and greater than 10°. A separate analysis was performed for anteverted versus retroverted stems.
RESULTS: The mean version, as estimated by intraoperative visual assessment, was 9.16 ± 4.02° (range, 3 to 18°) compared to 3.52 ± 8.66° (range, -12 to 19) as measured by the robotic-arm assisted software (P=0.005). The surgeon's estimates of broach version and those measured by the robotic-arm assisted software were identical in three cases (12%). The evaluation methods differed by 1 to 5° in six cases (24%), 6 to 10° in 10 cases (40%), and greater than 10° in six cases (24%). Larger differences between methods were noted for cases in which the stem was found to be in anteversion by the robotic-arm assisted software.
CONCLUSIONS: Visual estimation of femoral implant version differed significantly from measurements captured by three-dimensional robotic-arm assisted imaging. This suggests that estimating stem position intraoperatively by eye is not reliable, even when done by an experienced surgeon. The use of robotic-arm assisted technology may be recommended for determining femoral stem version intraoperatively."
pub.1137681664,"The Accuracy of Computed Tomography-Based, Three-Dimensional Implant Planning in Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty","Advanced imaging used in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA), such as computed tomography (CT)-based three-dimensional (3D) planning, may provide an accurate means of implant sizing preoperatively. The purpose of this study was to examine preoperative CT-based implant planning accuracy for robotic-assisted TKA in patients who have (1) varus deformities, (2) valgus deformities, (3) neutral alignment, and (4) retained hardware. A total of 393 patients underwent a robotic-assisted TKA by a single surgeon received preoperative CT scans. The surgeon reviewed the CT-based model preoperatively and recorded the expected size of the components. The final implants used in each case were recorded and compared with the surgeon's preoperative plan. In all groups of patients, the surgeon's CT-based implant plan was within one size of the implant utilized 100% of the time for both the tibiae and femora. Overall, the surgeon was exactly matched in 319 (81%) and 315 (80%) cases for the femoral and tibial components, respectively. For the femoral component, the mean age for patients in whom the original plan was exactly matched was younger than those whose implants were upsized and older than patients those implants were downsized (<i>p</i> = 0.024). Other patient demographics and preoperative knee alignment were not associated with predictive accuracy for femoral or tibial components. Our results demonstrate how preoperative CT-based, 3D planning for robotic-assisted TKA is accurate to within one size of the components in every case (100%), and exactly matched in 80%. The results of this study are important because they demonstrate how CT-based preoperative implant planning for TKA is reliable and accurate across all native knee alignments and other patient-specific factors. In addition, they build on a previous study by the same single surgeon, demonstrating that predictive ability can improve over time. This may be important as we move toward more outpatient surgery with less ability for prostheses inventory at ambulatory sites."
pub.1169086579,A Restricted Functional Balancing Technique for Total Knee Arthroplasty With a Varus Deformity: Does a Medial Soft-Tissue Release Result in a Worse Outcome?,"BACKGROUND: A functional alignment technique for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) utilizes implant position modifications to balance the soft tissues. There is concern that, in some cases, extreme coronal and tibial component alignment could facilitate early implant failure. To be cautious, a restricted functional alignment may be used. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the results of TKA in patients who have varus deformities using a restricted functional alignment technique. We hypothesized that adding a medial soft-tissue release within restricted boundaries would not result in inferior outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on robotic arm-assisted TKA patients with varus deformities utilizing a functional balancing strategy with a three-degree varus coronal limb and tibial component alignment restriction. Outcome scores of those patients still requiring a medial-soft tissue release were compared to those without for inferior outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 202 of 259 (78.0%) knees were able to be balanced without any medial soft-tissue release with an average final hip-knee-ankle alignment of 1.9° varus. The remaining 57 knees required a medial soft-tissue release. They had an average final hip-knee-ankle of 2.8° varus and an average medial proximal tibial angle of 2.5° varus. Comparing the cohorts without and with a release, at final follow-up averaging two years, there was not a statistically significant difference in Knee Society-Knee Score (97.7 and 98.4, P = .525), Functional Score (86.7 and 88.7, P = .514), Forgotten Joint Score (59.8 and 66.6, P = .136), and Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Survey for Joint Replacement Junior Score (79.5 and 84.8, P = .066).
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a restrictive functional balancing strategy for TKA minimizes the need for soft-tissue releases and provides for excellent overall outcomes. An additional medial soft-tissue release can still be utilized without an inferior average two-year outcome."
pub.1146389245,A comparison of utilization and short-term complications of technology-assisted versus conventional total knee arthroplasty,"BackgroundWhile technology-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TA-TKA) improves implant positioning, whether it confers improved clinical outcomes remains inconclusive. We sought to examine national TA-TKA utilization trends and to compare outcomes between TA-TKA and unassisted TKA (U-TKA).MethodsPatients who underwent primary, elective TKA from 2010 to 2018 were identified using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Demographic, perioperative, and 30-day outcomes were collected. Patients were stratified on the basis of whether they underwent TA-TKA, which included computer navigation and robotics, or U-TKA. The proportion of patients undergoing TKA using TA-TKA was calculated. One-to-one propensity-score matching paired patients undergoing TA-TKA or U-TKA. Independent samples t-tests and Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare continuous variables, and chi-squared tests were used to compare categorical variables.ResultsOf the 402,284 TKA patients, 10,429 (2.6%) cases were performed using TA-TKA. Comparing the unmatched TA-TKA and U-TKA groups, race (p < 0.001), smoking status (p = 0.050), baseline functional status (p < 0.001), and body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001) significantly differed. Propensity-score matching yielded 8633 TA-TKA and U-TKA pairs. The TA-TKA cohort had shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) (2.7 ± 2.5 versus 2.8 ± 1.9 days, p = 0.017) but similar operative times (92.4 ± 33.4 versus 92.6 ± 39.8 min, p = 0.670). Compared with the U-TKA group, the TA-TKA group had lower major complication (7.6% versus 9.4%, p < 0.001) and transfusion (3.9% versus 5.1%, p < 0.001) rates and higher rates of discharge to home (73.9% versus 70.4%, p < 0.001). Reoperation and readmission rates did not significantly differ between groups.ConclusionsTA-TKA utilization remains low among orthopedic surgeons. Compared with U-TKA, TA-TKA yielded improved perioperative and 30-day outcomes. Nonetheless, surgeons must consider the benefits and drawbacks of TA-TKA when determining the proper surgical technique and technology for each patient.Level III evidenceRetrospective cohort study."
pub.1175606841,Aetiology of patient dissatisfaction following primary total knee arthroplasty in the era of robotic-assisted technology,"Aims: Patient dissatisfaction following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with manual jig-based instruments has been reported to be as high as 30%. Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has been increasingly used in an effort to improve patient outcomes, however there is a paucity of literature examining patient satisfaction after RA-TKA. This study aims to identify the incidence of patients who were not satisfied following RA-TKA and to determine factors associated with higher levels of dissatisfaction.
Methods: This was a retrospective review of 674 patients who underwent primary TKA between October 2016 and September 2020 with a minimum two-year follow-up. A five-point Likert satisfaction score was used to place patients into two groups: Group A were those who were very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, or neutral (Likert score 1 to 3) and Group B were those who were satisfied or very satisfied (Likert score 4 to 5). Patient demographic data, as well as preoperative and postoperative patient-reported outcome measures, were compared between groups.
Results: Overall, 45 patients (6.7%) were in Group A and 629 (93.3%) were in Group B. Group A (vs Group B) had a higher proportion of male sex (p = 0.008), preoperative chronic opioid use (p < 0.001), preoperative psychotropic medication use (p = 0.01), prior anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (p < 0.001), and preoperative symptomatic lumbar spine disease (p = 0.004). Group A was also younger (p = 0.023). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative opioid use (p = 0.012), prior ACL reconstruction (p = 0.038), male sex (p = 0.006), and preoperative psychotropic medication use (p = 0.001) as independent predictive factors of patient dissatisfaction.
Conclusion: The use of RA-TKA demonstrated a high rate of patient satisfaction (629 of 674, 93.3%). Demographics for patients not satisfied following RA-TKA included: male sex, chronic opioid use, chronic psychotropic medication use, and prior ACL reconstruction. Patients in these groups should be identified preoperatively and educated on realistic expectations given their comorbid conditions."
pub.1155229273,Imaging of the Hip Prior to Replacement: What the Surgeon Wants to Know,Total hip arthroplasty is an effective treatment for severe degenerative arthritis and is increasingly being used. Radiography is the primary modality for the initial diagnosis of osteoarthritis and preoperative planning. Additional radiographic views may include the spine and lower extremities in order to optimize implant positioning for the individual patient. Computed tomography is sometimes used for preoperative planning and intraoperative robotic assistance. Magnetic resonance imaging and diagnostic ultrasound is generally reserved for patients without obvious arthritis. Ultrasound-guided injections may provide diagnostic and/or therapeutic benefits.
pub.1138506853,Robotic arm-assisted versus conventional medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: five-year clinical outcomes of a randomized controlled trial,"AIMS: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a bone-preserving treatment option for osteoarthritis localized to a single compartment in the knee. The success of the procedure is sensitive to patient selection and alignment errors. Robotic arm-assisted UKA provides technological assistance to intraoperative bony resection accuracy, which is thought to improve ligament balancing. This paper presents the five-year outcomes of a comparison between manual and robotically assisted UKAs.
METHODS: The trial design was a prospective, randomized, parallel, single-centre study comparing surgical alignment in patients undergoing UKA for the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis (ISRCTN77119437). Participants underwent surgery using either robotic arm-assisted surgery or conventional manual instrumentation. The primary outcome measure (surgical accuracy) has previously been reported, and, along with secondary outcomes, were collected at one-, two-, and five-year timepoints. Analysis of five-year results and longitudinal analysis for all timepoints was performed to compare the two groups.
RESULTS: Overall, 104 (80%) patients of the original 130 who received surgery were available at five years (55 robotic, 49 manual). Both procedures reported successful results over all outcomes. At five years, there were no statistical differences between the groups in any of the patient reported or clinical outcomes. There was a lower reintervention rate in the robotic arm-assisted group with 0% requiring further surgery compared with six (9%) of the manual group requiring additional surgical intervention (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study has shown excellent clinical outcomes in both groups with no statistical or clinical differences in the patient-reported outcome measures. The notable difference was the lower reintervention rate at five years for roboticarm-assisted UKA when compared with a manual approach.

pub.1041359922,An integrated CAD/CAM/robotic milling method for custom cementless femoral prostheses,"Aseptic loosening is the primary cause of cementless femoral prosthesis failure and is related to the primary stability of the cementless femoral prosthesis in the femoral cavity. The primary stability affects both the osseointegration and the long-term stability of cementless femoral prostheses. A custom cementless femoral prosthesis can improve the fit and fill of the prosthesis in the femoral cavity and decrease the micromotion of the proximal prosthesis such that the primary stability of the custom prosthesis can be improved, and osseointegration of the proximal prosthesis is achieved. These results will help to achieve long-term stability in total hip arthroplasty (THA). In this paper, we introduce an integrated CAD/CAM/robotic method of milling custom cementless femoral prostheses. The 3D reconstruction model uses femoral CT images and 3D design software to design a CAD model of the custom prosthesis. After the transformation matrices between two units of the robotic system are calibrated, consistency between the CAM software and the robotic system can be achieved, and errors in the robotic milling can be limited. According to the CAD model of the custom prosthesis, the positions of the robotic tool points are produced by the CAM software of the CNC machine. The normal vector of the three adjacent robotic tool point positions determines the pose of the robotic tool point. In conclusion, the fit rate of custom pig femur stems in the femoral cavities was 90.84%. After custom femoral prostheses were inserted into the femoral cavities, the maximum gaps between the prostheses and the cavities measured less than 1 mm at the diaphysis and 1.3 mm at the metaphysis."
pub.1130293963,Learning Curve of Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty for a High-Volume Surgeon,"The learning curve has been established for robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) during the first month of use; however, there have been no studies evaluating this on a longer term. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare operative times for three cohorts during the first year following adoption of RATKA (initial, 6 months, and 1 year) and a prior cohort of manual TKA. We investigated both mean operative times and the variability of operative time in each cohort. This is a learning curve study comparing a single surgeon's experience using RAKTA. The study groups were made up of two cohorts of 60 cementless RATKAs performed at ∼6 months and 1 year of use. A learning curve was created based on the mean operative times and individual operative times were stratified into different cohorts for comparison. Study groups were compared with the surgeon's initial group of 20 cemented RATKAs and 60 cementless manual cases. Descriptive numbers were compiled and mean operative times were compared using Student's <i>t</i>-tests for significant differences with a <i>p</i>-value of &lt; 0.05. The mean surgical times continued to decrease after 6 months of RATKA. In 1 year, the surgeon was performing 88% of the RATKA between 50 and 69 minutes. The initial cohort and 1-year robotic-assisted mean operative times were 81 and 62 minutes, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001). Mean 6-month robotic-assisted operative times were similar to manual times (<i>p</i> = 0.12). A significant lower time was found between the mean operative times for the 1-year robotic-assisted and manual (<i>p</i> = 0.008) TKAs. The data show continued improvement of operative times at 6 months and 1 year when using this new technology. The results of this study are important because they demonstrate how the complexity of a technology which initially increases operative time can be overcome and become more time-effective than conventional techniques."
pub.1134953238,Effect of Manual versus Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty on Cervical Spine Static and Dynamic Postures,"This study compared surgeon cervical (C) spine postures and repetitive motions when performing traditional manual total knee arthroplasty (MTKA) versus robotic-assisted TKA (RATKA). Surgeons wore motion trackers on T3 vertebra and the occiput anatomical landmarks to obtain postural and repetitive motion data during MTKA and RATKA performed on cadavers. We assessed (1) flexion-extension at T3 and the occiput anatomical landmarks, (2) range of motion (ROM) as the percentage of time in the flexion-extension angle, (3) repetition rate, defined as the number of the times T3 and the occiput flexion-extension angle exceeded ±10°; and (4) static posture, where T3 or occiput postures exceed 10° for more than 30 seconds. The average T3 flexion-extension angle for MTKA cases was 5-degree larger than for RATKA cases (19 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 8 degrees). The surgeons who performed MTKA cases spent 15% more time in nonneutral C-spine ROM than those who performed RATKA cases (78 ± 25 vs. 63 ± 36%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The repetition rate at T3 was 4% greater for MTKA than RATKA (14 ± 5 vs. 10 ± 6 reps/min). The percentage of time spent in static T3 posture was 5% greater for overall MTKA cases than for RATKA cases (15 ± 3 vs. 10 ± 3%). In this cadaveric study, we found differences in cervical and thoracic ergonomics between manual and robotic-assisted TKA. Specifically, we found that RATKA may reduce a surgeon's ergonomic strain at both the T3 and occiput locations by reducing the time the surgeon spends in a nonneutral position."
pub.1129455410,Active Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA): Initial Experience with the TSolution One ® TKA System.,"Several recent advances, including the use of robotic devices, have been explored to improve outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The TSolution One ® Total Knee Application (THINK Surgical, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) introduces an active robotic device that supports an open implant platform and CT-based preoperative planning workflow, and requires minimal surgeon intervention for making bone cuts. Our experience was part of a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of this active robotic system for TKA. Each patient underwent a preoperative CT-scan, which was uploaded to proprietary planning software. The surgeon reviewed the software-generated 3D digital model, selected the appropriate implants and generated a final preoperative plan. Intra-operatively, a standard medial parapatellar approach was used. The leg was then rigidly attached to the robot via fixation pins, and registration markers were placed in the tibia and femur. Landmark registration was performed to inform the robot of the knee's position in space and to confirm the robot's ability to execute the preoperative plan. Next, the robot performed femoral and tibial cuts using a cutter in a sequential fashion along a defined cut-path. The robot was then removed from the operative field and the surgeon completed the procedure by removing marginal bone and performing final balancing and implantation in the usual fashion. The TSolution One® Total Knee Application is a computer-assisted device that potentially allows a surgeon to make more accurate cuts and to determine optimal implant position based on the patient's specific anatomy. It is the only active robotic system currently available. In this manuscript, we describe the operative technique and workflow involved in performing this surgery and offer insight on optimizing safety and efficiency as we introduce new technologies to the operating theater. We also present two cases performed by the senior author to further demonstrate technical aspects of the procedure."
pub.1111442372,Assuring the long-term total joint arthroplasty: a triad of variables.,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to compare accuracy in restoring the native centre of hip rotation in patients undergoing conventional manual total hip arthroplasty (THA) versus robotic-arm assisted THA. Secondary objectives were to determine differences between these treatment techniques for THA in achieving the planned combined offset, component inclination, component version, and leg-length correction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 50 patients undergoing conventional manual THA and 25 patients receiving robotic-arm assisted THA. Patients undergoing conventional manual THA and robotic-arm assisted THA were well matched for age (mean age, 69.4 years (sd 5.2) vs 67.5 years (sd 5.8) (p = 0.25); body mass index (27.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (sd 2.1) vs 26.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (sd 2.2); p = 0.39); and laterality of surgery (right = 28, left = 22 vs right = 12, left = 13; p = 0.78). All operative procedures were undertaken by a single surgeon using the posterior approach. Two independent blinded observers recorded all radiological outcomes of interest using plain radiographs.
RESULTS: The correlation coefficient was 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.95) for intraobserver agreement and 0.88 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.94) for interobserver agreement in all study outcomes. Robotic THA was associated with improved accuracy in restoring the native horizontal (p &lt; 0.001) and vertical (p &lt; 0.001) centres of rotation, and improved preservation of the patient's native combined offset (p &lt; 0.001) compared with conventional THA. Robotic THA improved accuracy in positioning of the acetabular component within the combined safe zones of inclination and anteversion described by Lewinnek et al (p = 0.02) and Callanan et al (p = 0.01) compared with conventional THA. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in achieving the planned leg-length correction (p = 0.10).
CONCLUSION: Robotic-arm assisted THA was associated with improved accuracy in restoring the native centre of rotation, better preservation of the combined offset, and more precise acetabular component positioning within the safe zones of inclination and anteversion compared with conventional manual THA."
pub.1154925162,"Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Utilizing NAVIO, CORI Imageless Systems and Manual TKA Accurately Restore Femoral Rotational Alignment and Yield Satisfactory Clinical Outcomes: A Randomized Controlled Trial","<i>Background and objectives</i>: The introduction of novel techniques in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) aiming to enhance outcomes and satisfaction of the procedure is constantly ongoing. In order to evidence a priority of one, we have conducted a randomized controlled trial with the aim of comparing patient-reported functional outcomes, radiographic outcomes and intraoperative measures between imageless (NAVIO and CORI), robotic-assisted (ra)- TKA (ra-TKA) and manual TKA (mTKA) for primary knee osteoarthritis (KOA). <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A total of 215 patients with the diagnosis of KOA of the knee were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: NAVIO (76 patients) or CORI (71 patients) robotic-assisted TKA, or manual technique (68 patients) TKA. The primary outcome (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Study [KOOS]), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Range of motion (ROM), femoral component rotational alignment and the secondary outcomes (surgery time, blood loss, complications, and revision at 12 months after surgery) were compared between three groups. KOOS and VAS were collected at particular follow up visits from each patient individually and ROM in flexion and extension was assessed during the physical examination. Femoral component rotational alignment was measured on the CT scan performed postoperatively utilizing the Berger's method. Statistical significance was set at <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. <i>Results</i>: Both the ra-TKA groups and mTKA group displayed significant improvements in the majority of the functional outcome scores at 12 months. Despite having more prominent surgery time (NAVIO: mean +44.5 min in comparison to mTKA and CORI: mean +38.5 min in comparison to mTKA), both NAVIO and CORI tend to achieve highly accurate femoral component rotational alignment with mean radiographic scores in NAVIO vs. CORI vs. mTKA of 1.48° vs. 1.33° vs. 3.15° and lower blood loss (NAVIO: 1.74; CORI: 1.51; mTKA: 2.32. Furthermore, the investigation revealed the significant difference in femoral component rotational alignment between mTKA-NAVIO and mTKA-CORI and significantly different KOOS scores in NAVIO vs. CORI vs. mTKA of 87.05 vs. 85.59 vs. 81.76. Furthermore, the KOOS analysis showed between group significant statistical differences, but did not reach minimal clinically significant difference. There were no differences in postoperative ROM and VAS. There were no differences in complications between groups. <i>Conclusions</i>: To achieve a successful TKA, the precise tool and individualised objective is of great importance. The results suggest satisfactory results after both ra-TKA methods and mTKA. Ra-TKA and mTKA stand for a safe and reliable treatment method for OA. Patients reported excellent alleviation in functional outcomes and the radiological results revealed that the better precision does not necessarily lead to a better outcome. Therefore, ra-TKA does not imply strong enough advantages in comparison to the manual method, especi"
pub.1134808455,"MINARO HD: control and evaluation of a handheld, highly dynamic surgical robot","PurposeCurrent surgical robotic systems are either large serial arms, resulting in higher risks due to their high inertia and no inherent limitations of the working space, or they are bone-mounted, adding substantial additional task steps to the surgical workflow. 
The robot presented in this paper has a handy and lightweight design and can be easily held by the surgeon. No rigid fixation to the bone or a cart is necessary. A high-speed tracking camera together with a fast control system ensures the accurate positioning of a burring tool.MethodsThe capabilities of the robotic system to dynamically compensate for unintended motion, either of the robot itself or the patient, was evaluated. Therefore, the step response was analyzed as well as the capability to follow a moving target.ResultsThe step response show that the robot can compensate for undesired motions up to 12 Hz in any direction. While following a moving target, a maximum positioning error of 0.5 mm can be obtained with a target motion of up to 18 mm/s.ConclusionThe requirements regarding dynamic motion compensation, accuracy, and machining speed of unicompartmental knee arthroplasties, for which the robot was optimized, are achieved with the presented robotic system. In particular, the step response results show that the robot is able to compensate for human tremor."
pub.1136871254,Improved sizing with image-based robotic-assisted system compared to image-free and conventional techniques in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,"AIMS: Ideal component sizing may be difficult to achieve in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Anatomical variants, incremental implant size, and a reduced surgical exposure may lead to over- or under-sizing of the components. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of UKA sizing with robotic-assisted techniques versus a conventional surgical technique.
METHODS: Three groups of 93 medial UKAs were assessed. The first group was performed by a conventional technique, the second group with an image-free robotic-assisted system (Image-Free group), and the last group with an image-based robotic arm-assisted system, using a preoperative CT scan (Image-Based group). There were no demographic differences between groups. We compared six parameters on postoperative radiographs to assess UKA sizing. Incorrect sizing was defined by an over- or under-sizing greater than 3 mm.
RESULTS: There was a higher rate of tibial under-sizing posteriorly in the conventional group compared to robotic-assisted groups (47.3% (n = 44) in conventional group, 29% (n = 27) in Image-Free group, 6.5% (n = 6) in Image-Based group; p < 0.001), as well as a higher rate of femoral under-sizing posteriorly (30.1% (n = 28) in conventional group, 7.5% (n = 7) in Image-Free group, 12.9% (n = 12) in Image-Based group; p < 0.001). The posterior femoral offset was more often increased in the conventional group, especially in comparison to the Image-Based group (43% (n = 40) in conventional group, 30.1% (n = 28) in Image-Free group, 8.6% (n = 8) in Image-Based group; p < 0.001). There was no significant overhang of the femoral or tibial implant in any groups.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted surgical techniques for medial UKA decrease the risk of tibial and femoral under-sizing, particularly with an image-based system using a preoperative CT scan. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2021;103-B(4):610-618."
pub.1004115718,The Kinematics of Fixed- and Mobile-Bearing Total Knee Arthroplasty,"The success of any total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is influenced by a complex interaction between component geometry and the surrounding soft tissues. The objective of this study was to investigate posterior femoral translation and tibial rotation in a single design posterior-stabilized TKA offering fixed- and mobile-bearing tibial components. Specifically, we examined whether mobile-bearing TKA restores normal knee translation and rotation better than fixed-bearing TKA design. Eleven human knee specimens retrieved postmortem were tested using a robotic system. The translation and rotation of the intact and reconstructed knees were compared. The data indicate that for all knees, posterior femoral translation occurs along the passive path and under muscle loading conditions. Furthermore, increasing flexion angle corresponded with increased internal tibial rotation. Femoral translation and tibial rotation for fixed- and mobile-bearing posterior-stabilized TKAs were similar despite component design variations. However, both arthroplasties only partially restored intact knee translation and rotation. The data presented here may serve as an aid in the development of a rationale for additional improvement in surgical techniques and prosthesis design, so that normal knee function may be restored."
pub.1117486181,Accuracy of a New Robotically Assisted Technique for Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Cadaveric Study,"BACKGROUND: Although the utility of robotic surgery has already been proven in cadaveric studies, it is our hypothesis that this newly designed robotically assisted system will achieve a high level of accuracy for bone resection. Therefore, we aimed to analyze in a cadaveric study the accuracy to achieve targeted angles and resection thickness.
METHODS: For this study, 15 frozen cadaveric specimens (30 knees) were used. In this study, Zimmer Biomet (Warsaw, IN) knees, navigation system, and robot (ROSA Knee System; Zimmer Biomet) were used. Eight trained, board-certified orthopedic surgeons performed robotically assisted total knee arthroplasty implantation using the same robotic protocol with 3 different implant designs. The target angles obtained from the intraoperative planning were then compared to the angles of the bone cuts performed using the robotic system and measured with the computer-assisted system considered to be the gold standard. For each bone cut the resection thickness was measured 3 times by 2 different observers and compared to the values for the planned resections.
RESULTS: All angle mean differences were below 1° and standard deviations below 1°. For all 6 angles, the mean differences between the target angle and the measured values were not significantly different from 0 except for the femoral flexion angle which had a mean difference of 0.95°. The mean hip-knee-ankle axis difference was -0.03° ± 0.87°. All resection mean differences were below 0.7 mm and standard deviations below 1.1mm.
CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that this study was funded by Zimmer Biomet and only used Zimmer Biomet implants, robot, and navigation tools, the results of our in vitro study demonstrated that surgeons using this new surgical robot in total knee arthroplasty can perform highly accurate bone cuts to achieve the planned angles and resection thickness as measured using conventional navigation."
pub.1107539926,Sensor-Based Soft Tissue Balancing in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly successful procedure with utilization expected to grow substantially over the coming decades. However, the revision burden has not concurrently improved, with over 30% of revisions related to technical imperfections (Mulhall KJ, Ghomrawi HM, Scully S, Callaghan JJ, Saleh KJ, Clin Orthop Relat Res 446:45, 2006; Sharkey PF, Hozack WJ, Rothman RH, Shastri S, Jacoby SM, Clin Orthop Relat Res 404:7, 2002; Wylde V, Hewlett S, Learmonth ID, Dieppe P, Pain 152(3):566, 2011). Accurate alignment and soft tissue balancing have been identified as important factors in mitigating these risks. Historically, accuracy relating to soft tissue balance has relied upon surgeon experience and subjective tactile feel. This chapter will explore the utilization of intraoperative sensors related to soft tissue balancing in total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1138868472,Can robotic technology mitigate the learning curve of total hip arthroplasty?,"AIMS: Traditionally, acetabular component insertion during total hip arthroplasty (THA) is visually assisted in the posterior approach and fluoroscopically assisted in the anterior approach. The present study examined the accuracy of a new surgeon during anterior (NSA) and posterior (NSP) THA using robotic arm-assisted technology compared to two experienced surgeons using traditional methods.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data was reviewed for 120 patients at two institutions. Data were collected on the first 30 anterior approach and the first 30 posterior approach surgeries performed by a newly graduated arthroplasty surgeon (all using robotic arm-assisted technology) and was compared to standard THA by an experienced anterior (SSA) and posterior surgeon (SSP). Acetabular component inclination, version, and leg length were calculated postoperatively and differences calculated based on postoperative film measurement.
RESULTS: Demographic data were similar between groups with the exception of BMI being lower in the NSA group (27.98 vs 25.2; p = 0.005). Operating time and total time in operating room (TTOR) was lower in the SSA (p < 0.001) and TTOR was higher in the NSP group (p = 0.014). Planned versus postoperative leg length discrepancy were similar among both anterior and posterior surgeries (p > 0.104). Planned versus postoperative abduction and anteversion were similar among the NSA and SSA (p > 0.425), whereas planned versus postoperative abduction and anteversion were lower in the NSP (p < 0.001). Outliers > 10 mm from planned leg length were present in one case of the SSP and NSP, with none in the anterior groups. There were no outliers > 10° in anterior or posterior for abduction in all surgeons. The SSP had six outliers > 10° in anteversion while the NSP had none (p = 0.004); the SSA had no outliers for anteversion while the NSA had one (p = 0.500).
CONCLUSION: Robotic arm-assisted technology allowed a newly trained surgeon to produce similarly accurate results and outcomes as experienced surgeons in anterior and posterior hip arthroplasty. Cite this article: <i>Bone Jt Open</i> 2021;2(6):365-370."
pub.1170247094,True Confessions of Neutral Mechanical Disciple-How I Learned to Love a Patient-Specific Target.,"INTRODUCTION: Classical neutral mechanical alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been a standard paradigm, while more recently, other alignment schemas, such as kinematic, individualized, and functional, have been explored. This study aimed to investigate the effect of three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT)-based surgical robotics inputs on a classically trained surgeon's TKA component positions and alignment targets over time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 1,394 consecutive robotically-assisted TKAs by a single surgeon from 2016 to 2020 were analyzed. Metrics collected included pre-balance planned implant component positions, final planned implant component positions after soft tissue balancing, and constitutional alignment from CT scans. Joint line obliquity was plotted against the arithmetic hip-knee angle (aHKA) using coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK). Three categories of alignment strategy were defined: true mechanical alignment (tMA), adjusted mechanical alignment (aMA), and no mechanical alignment (noMA).
RESULTS: A shift to overall varus component positioning was observed over the years. Joint line obliquity according to CPAK showed a wider spread in later years, and the distribution of tibial and femoral coronal alignment angles expanded over time.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed a change in alignment targets and final positioning of components away from neutral biomechanical axes in a large volume of TKAs by a single, classically trained surgeon over five years of using a robotic arm-assisted TKA system with CT-based planning. The most dominant factor for this change was the use of 3D CT planning, allowing the surgeon to assess patient-specific anatomy and plan accordingly. Outcome data is needed to determine if this change in behavior and surgical technique was beneficial. In summary, using a CT scan-based robotically assisted technique led to a gradual and complete shift from tMA to predominantly a non-mechanically aligned philosophy in TKA."
pub.1171224809,"Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty improves functional outcomes, complications, and revisions","Aims: Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (R-UKA) has been proposed as an approach to improve the results of the conventional manual UKA (C-UKA). The aim of this meta-analysis was to analyze the studies comparing R-UKA and C-UKA in terms of clinical outcomes, radiological results, operating time, complications, and revisions.
Methods: The literature search was conducted on three databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science) on 20 February 2024 according to the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Inclusion criteria were comparative studies, written in the English language, with no time limitations, on the comparison of R-UKA and C-UKA. The quality of each article was assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist for Measuring Quality.
Results: Among the 3,669 articles retrieved, 21 studies on 19 series of patients were included. A total of 3,074 patients (59.5% female and 40.5% male; mean age 65.2 years (SD 3.9); mean BMI 27.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 2.2)) were analyzed. R-UKA obtained a superior Knee Society Score improvement compared to C-UKA (mean difference (MD) 4.9; p &lt; 0.001) and better Forgotten Joint Score postoperative values (MD 5.5; p = 0.032). The analysis of radiological outcomes did not find a statistically significant difference between the two approaches. R-UKA showed longer operating time (MD 15.6; p &lt; 0.001), but reduced complication and revision rates compared to C-UKA (5.2% vs 10.1% and 4.1% vs 7.2%, respectively).
Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that the robotic approach for UKA provided a significant improvement in functional outcomes compared to the conventional manual technique. R-UKA showed similar radiological results and longer operating time, but reduced complication and revision rates compared to C-UKA. Overall, R-UKA seems to provide relevant benefits over C-UKA in the management of patients undergoing UKA."
pub.1124650208,Low femoral component prominence negatively influences early revision rate in robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The revision rate of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is higher than in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and implant positioning may play a role. In combination with a pre-operative CT, robotic UKA may provide the ability to position the implants more precisely. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of component prominence relative to the native joint surface on early outcomes and revisions. The hypothesis was that aiming for restoration of joint space to 0.5-1.5 mm will improve outcomes.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 94 patients undergoing robotic-assisted UKA (Mako, Stryker) was performed. The 'prominence' of the implant surface relative to the native bony surface in sagittal plane, hip-knee-ankle (HKA) correction in coronal plane was documented intraoperatively. The mean achieved gap between two components under valgus stress captured in at least 5 different flexion angles was calculated. These were then analysed for impact on early revision rate and outcomes, stratified by gender.
RESULTS: Median HKA correction was 3.5° (range 0°-9.5°). Median femoral prominence was 1.5 mm (range - 0.6 to 4 mm) and median tibial prominence was 4.3 mm (2-7 mm). The median achieved gap was 1.0 mm (- 1.2 to 2.8 mm). There was no difference in achieved correction between men and women (p = n.s.) but men had a higher achieved combined prominence than women (p < 0.001). PROMs did not correlate with the average gap (p = n.s.) nor with combined prominence (p = n.s.). Two patients underwent an early revision. Lower femoral prominence was a significant predictor of revision (p = 0.045; OR = 0.21; 95% CI 0.000-0.918).
CONCLUSION: Female patients need less component prominence to achieve the same average gap balance through a range of motion, without correlation with patient's height. Intraoperatively low femoral prominence could be a reason for early revision.

pub.1117657335,A systematic review of robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: prosthesis design and type should be reported.,"AIMS: Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) promises accurate implant placement with the potential of improved survival and functional outcomes. The aim of this study was to present the current evidence for robotic-assisted UKA and describe the outcome in terms of implant positioning, range of movement (ROM), function and survival, and the types of robot and implants that are currently used.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of PubMed and Medline was performed in October 2018 in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. Search terms included ""robotic"", ""knee"", and ""surgery"". The criteria for inclusion was any study describing the use of robotic UKA and reporting implant positioning, ROM, function, and survival for clinical, cadaveric, or dry bone studies.
RESULTS: A total of 528 articles were initially identified from the databases and reference lists. Following full text screening, 38 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included. In all, 20 studies reported on implant positioning, 18 on functional outcomes, 16 on survivorship, and six on ROM. The Mako (Stryker, Mahwah, New Jersey) robot was used in 32 studies (84%), the BlueBelt Navio (Blue Belt Technologies, Plymouth, Minnesota) in three (8%), the Sculptor RGA (Stanmore Implants, Borehamwood United Kingdom) in two (5%), and the Acrobot (The Acrobot Co. Ltd., London, United Kingdom) in one study (3%). The most commonly used implant was the Restoris MCK (Stryker). Nine studies (24%) did not report the implant that was used. The pooled survivorship at six years follow-up was 96%. However, when assessing survival according to implant design, survivorship of an inlay (all-polyethylene) tibial implant was 89%, whereas that of an onlay (metal-backed) implant was 97% at six years (odds ratio 3.66, 95% confidence interval 20.7 to 6.46, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: There is little description of the choice of implant when reporting robotic-assisted UKA, which is essential when assessing survivorship, in the literature. Implant positioning with robotic-assisted UKA is more accurate and more reproducible than that performed manually and may offer better functional outcomes, but whether this translates into improved implant survival in the mid- to longer-term remains to be seen.

pub.1148687150,Total Hip Arthroplasty with Robotic Arm Assistance for Precise Cup Positioning: A Case‐Control Study,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether more precise cup positioning can be achieved with robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) as compared to conventional THA.
METHODS: In this study, between July 2019 and May 2021, 93 patients aged 23-75 years with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) and adult developmental dysplasia of hip who underwent first hip surgery were included in the study. They were randomly assigned to either the robotic-assisted THA group (n = 45) or the conventional THA group (n = 48). After the operation, all patients were given routine rapid rehabilitation guidance. The duration of operation was recorded to estimate the learning curve through cumulative summation analysis. We compared the demographics, duration of operation, cup positioning, leg length discrepancy, hip offset, and Harris Hip Score between robot-assisted THA and manual THA. Precision in the positioning of the acetabular prosthesis using the MAKO system was also compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The mean duration of operation for the robot-assisted THA group was 91.37 ± 17.34 min (range: 63 to 135 min), which was significantly higher than that for the conventional THA group. When the number of procedures was increased to 13, the duration of operation in the robot-assisted group decreased significantly and gradually became stable. In terms of duration of operation, robot-assisted THA was associated with a learning curve of 13 cases. The mean amount of bleeding in the robot-assisted THA group was not significantly different from that in conventional THA group (328 ± 210 ml vs 315 ± 205 ml) (p = 0.741). There was no significant difference in the proportion of prostheses located within Lewinnek's safe zone between robot-assisted THA group and conventional THA group (69.81% vs 64.41%). The leg length discrepancy (LLD) was significantly smaller in the robot-assisted THA group than in the conventional THA group (p < 0.001), but both were within acceptable limits (10 mm). The inclination and anteversion angles of the acetabular prosthesis planned before operations were correlated with the actual measurement (r = 0.857 p < 0.001, r = 0.830, p < 0.001). After surgery, none of the patients experienced hip dislocation, aseptic loosening, or periprosthetic infection during the 3 months of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of acetabular prostheses in the Lewinnek's safety zone was higher and the extent of LLD was significantly lower in the robot-assisted THA group, as compared to the same metrics in the conventional THA group. The MAKO robot improved the accuracy of implant placement in THA."
pub.1172095550,Robotic-assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty restored prearthritic alignment and led to superior functional outcomes compared with conventional techniques.,"PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) can ensure precise preoperative planning, minimise soft tissue damage and restore native coronal alignment. However, few studies have investigated how these advantages translate into differences in early postoperative outcomes. This study aimed to compare differences in early outcomes between conventional UKA (C-UKA) and robotic-assisted UKA (R-UKA).
METHODS: This retrospective study investigated two groups of patients who underwent medial UKA: C-UKA group (n = 35) and R-UKA group (n = 35). We assessed (1) serum indicators (hemoglobin, creatine kinase and C-reactive protein) and pain visual analogue scale (VAS) at postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, 4 and 6; (2) radiologic parameters including joint line height change and arithmetic and mechanical hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA and mHKA); (3) patient-reported outcomes including Knee Society Scores, Western Ontario and Mcmaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) at 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Despite similar serum indicator results, pain VAS was lower in the R-UKA group than in the C-UKA group at PODs 2 (2.5 ± 1.3 vs. 3.6 ± 1.2, p = 0.02), 4 (2.4 ± 0.9 vs. 3.3 ± 1.0, p = 0.03) and 6 (1.9 ± 1.1 vs. 3.1 ± 1.1, p < 0.01). The joint line height change was significantly lower in the R-UKA group than in the C-UKA group (0.9 mm ± 0.6 mm vs. 2.0 mm ± 1.3 mm, p = 0.02). The equivalence test for preoperative aHKA and postoperative mHKA revealed equivalence in only the R-UKA group (p < 0.01). The R-UKA group showed better WOMAC and FJS-12 compared to C-UKA group at 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: R-UKA led to lower pain VAS in the early postoperative period compared with C-UKA. Additionally, R-UKA effectively restored the joint line and prearthritic lower limb alignment, resulting in superior functional outcomes at 1-year follow-up compared with C-UKA.

pub.1156013349,Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty is Safe in the Ambulatory Surgery Center Setting,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has become more popular in the United States. With the significant trend towards performing TKA in outpatient and ambulatory surgery center (ASC) settings, this study was implemented to determine the safety and efficacy of RA-TKA in an ASC.
METHOD: A retrospective review identified 172 outpatient TKAs (86 RA-TKAs and 86 TKAs) performed between January 2020 and January 2021. All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon at the same free-standing ASC. Patients were followed for at least 90 days after surgery; complications, reoperations, readmissions, operative time, and patient-reported outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: In both groups, all patients were successfully discharged home from the ASC on the day of surgery. No differences were noted in overall complications, reoperations, hospital admissions, or delays in discharge. RA-TKA had slightly longer operative times (79 vs 75 min [p = 0.017]) and total length of stay at the ASC (468 vs 412 min [p < 0.0001]) than conventional TKA. No significant differences were noted in outcome scores at 2-, 6-, or 12-week follow-ups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that RA-TKA can be successfully implemented in an ASC, with similar outcomes compared with TKA using conventional instrumentation. Initial surgical times were increased secondary to the learning curve of implementing RA-TKA. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine implant longevity and long-term outcomes.

pub.1107555882,Accuracy assessment of a novel image-free handheld robot for Total Knee Arthroplasty in a cadaveric study,"Surgical navigation has been shown to improve the accuracy of bone preparation and limb alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Previous work has shown the effectiveness of various types of navigation systems. Here, for the first time, we assessed the accuracy of a novel imageless semiautonomous handheld robotic sculpting system in performing bone resection and preparation in TKA using cadaveric specimens. In this study, we compared the planned and final implant placement in 18 cadaveric specimens undergoing TKA using the new tool. Eight surgeons carried out the procedures using three types of implant designs. A quantitative analysis was performed to determine the translational, angular, and rotational differences between the planned and achieved positions of the implants. The mean femoral flexion, varus/valgus, and rotational error was -2.0°, -0.1°, and -0.5°, respectively. The mean tibial posterior slope, and varus/valgus error was -0.2°, and -0.2°, respectively. We obtained higher flexion errors for the femoral implant when using cut-guides as compared to using a bur for cutting the bones. The image-free robotic sculpting tool achieved accurate implementation of the surgical plan with small errors in implant placement. Future studies will focus on determining how well the accurate implant placement translates into a clinical and functional benefit for the patient."
pub.1123748316,Mid-term survivorship and patient-reported outcomes of robotic-arm assisted partial knee arthroplasty.,"AIMS: Limited evidence is available on mid-term outcomes of robotic-arm assisted (RA) partial knee arthroplasty (PKA). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate mid-term survivorship, modes of failure, and patient-reported outcomes of RA PKA.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent RA PKA between June 2007 and August 2016 was performed. Patients received a fixed-bearing medial or lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA), or bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BiKA; PFA plus medial UKA). All patients completed a questionnaire regarding revision surgery, reoperations, and level of satisfaction. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were assessed using the KOOS for Joint Replacement Junior survey.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 4.7 years (2.0 to 10.8). Five-year survivorship of medial UKA (n = 802), lateral UKA (n = 171), and PFA/BiKA (n = 35/10) was 97.8%, 97.7%, and 93.3%, respectively. Component loosening and progression of osteoarthritis (OA) were the most common reasons for revision. Mean KOOS scores after medial UKA, lateral UKA, and PFA/BiKA were 84.3 (SD 15.9), 85.6 (SD 14.3), and 78.2 (SD 14.2), respectively. The vast majority of the patients reported high satisfaction levels after RA PKA. Subgroup analyses suggested tibial component design, body mass index (BMI), and age affects RA PKA outcomes. Five-year survivorship was 98.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 97.2 to 99.5) for onlay medial UKA (n = 742) and 99.1% (95% CI 97.9 to 100) for onlay medial UKA in patients with a BMI &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (n = 479).
CONCLUSION: This large single-surgeon study showed high mid-term survivorship, satisfaction levels, and functional outcomes in RA UKA using metal-backed tibial onlay components. In addition, favourable results were reported in RA PFA and BiKA. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2020;102-B(1):108-116."
pub.1092866667,Robotic arm-assisted versus conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"OBJECTIVES: This study reports on a secondary exploratory analysis of the early clinical outcomes of a randomised clinical trial comparing robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee with manual UKA performed using traditional surgical jigs. This follows reporting of the primary outcomes of implant accuracy and gait analysis that showed significant advantages in the robotic arm-assisted group.
METHODS: A total of 139 patients were recruited from a single centre. Patients were randomised to receive either a manual UKA implanted with the aid of traditional surgical jigs, or a UKA implanted with the aid of a tactile guided robotic arm-assisted system. Outcome measures included the American Knee Society Score (AKSS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Forgotten Joint Score, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Short Form-12, Pain Catastrophising Scale, somatic disease (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Score), Pain visual analogue scale, analgesic use, patient satisfaction, complications relating to surgery, 90-day pain diaries and the requirement for revision surgery.
RESULTS: From the first post-operative day through to week 8 post-operatively, the median pain scores for the robotic arm-assisted group were 55.4% lower than those observed in the manual surgery group (p = 0.040).At three months post-operatively, the robotic arm-assisted group had better AKSS (robotic median 164, interquartile range (IQR) 131 to 178, manual median 143, IQR 132 to 166), although no difference was noted with the OKS.At one year post-operatively, the observed differences with the AKSS had narrowed from a median of 21 points to a median of seven points (p = 0.106) (robotic median 171, IQR 153 to 179; manual median 164, IQR 144 to 182). No difference was observed with the OKS, and almost half of each group reached the ceiling limit of the score (OKS > 43). A greater proportion of patients receiving robotic arm-assisted surgery improved their UCLA activity score.Binary logistic regression modelling for dichotomised outcome scores predicted the key factors associated with achieving excellent outcome on the AKSS: a pre-operative activity level > 5 on the UCLA activity score and use of robotic-arm surgery. For the same regression modelling, factors associated with a poor outcome were manual surgery and pre-operative depression.
CONCLUSION: Robotic arm-assisted surgery results in improved early pain scores and early function scores in some patient-reported outcomes measures, but no difference was observed at one year post-operatively. Although improved results favoured the robotic arm-assisted group in active patients (i.e. UCLA ⩾ 5), these do not withstand adjustment for multiple comparisons.<b>Cite this article</b>: M. J. G.

pub.1172262015,Surgical factors play a critical role in predicting functional outcomes using machine learning in robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: Predictive models help determine predictive factors necessary to improve functional outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, no study has assessed predictive models for functional outcomes after TKA based on the new concepts of personalised surgery and new technologies. This study aimed to develop and evaluate predictive modelling approaches to predict the achievement of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 1 year after TKA.
METHODS: Four hundred thirty robotic-assisted TKAs were analysed in this retrospective study. The mean age was 67.9 ± 7.9 years; the mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.0 ± 6.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The following PROMs were collected preoperatively and 1-year postoperatively: knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score for joint replacement, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) Function, WOMAC Pain. Demographic data, preoperative CT scan, implant size, implant position on the robotic system and characteristics of the joint replacement procedure were selected as predictive variables. Four machine learning algorithms were trained to predict the MCID status at 1-year post-TKA for each PROM survey. 'No MCID' was chosen as the target. Models were evaluated by class discrimination (F1-score) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).
RESULTS: The best-performing model was ridge logistic regression for WOMAC Function (area under the curve [AUC]  = 0.80, F1 = 0.48, sensitivity = 0.79, specificity = 0.62). Variables most strongly contributing to not achieving MCID status were preoperative PROMs, high BMI and femoral resection depth (posterior and distal), supporting functional positioning principles. Conversely, variables contributing to a positive outcome (achieving MCID) were medial/lateral alignment of the tibial component, whether the procedure was an outpatient surgery and whether the patient received managed Medicare insurance.
CONCLUSION: The most predictive variables included preoperative PROMs, BMI and surgical planning. The surgical predictive variables were valgus femoral alignment and femoral rotation, reflecting the benefits of personalised surgery. Including surgical variables in predictive models for functional outcomes after TKA should guide clinical and surgical decision-making for every patient.

pub.1130753958,Computerised tomography-based planning with conventional total hip arthroplasty versus robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty: study protocol for a prospective randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundRobotic-arm assisted surgery aims to reduce manual errors and improve the accuracy of implant positioning during total hip arthroplasty. The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of implant positioning, restoration of hip biomechanics, patient satisfaction, functional outcomes, implant survivorship, cost-effectiveness, and complications in conventional manual total hip arthroplasty (CO THA) versus robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (RO THA). Preoperative pelvic computerised tomography (CT) scans will be used to create patient-specific, virtual, three-dimensional reconstructions for surgical planning in both treatment groups.Methods and analysisThis prospective randomised controlled trial will include 60 patients with symptomatic hip osteoarthritis undergoing primary THA. Following informed consent, patients will be randomised to CO THA (control group) or RO THA (investigation group) at a ratio of 1:1 using an online random number generator. Observers will review patients at regular intervals for 2 years after surgery to record predefined study outcomes relating to the accuracy of implant positioning, hip biomechanics, postoperative rehabilitation, clinical progress, functional outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and complications. Primary and secondary objectives will be used to quantify and draw inferences on differences in the efficacy of treatment between the two groups. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol population analysis will be undertaken. Intention to treat relates to the allocated treatment (CO THA or RO THA), and per-protocol refers to the actual treatment received by the patient. The following statistical methods will be employed to analyse the data: descriptive statistics, independent t test, paired t test, analysis of variance, Fisher exact test, chi-square test, and graphical displays. Ethical approval was obtained from the London-Bromley Research Ethics Committee, UK. The study is sponsored by University College London, UK.DiscussionThis study compares a comprehensive and robust range of clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes in CT-planned CO THA versus CT-planned RO THA. The findings of this study will enable an improved understanding of the differences in CO THA versus RO THA with respect to patient satisfaction, functional outcomes, implant survivorship, cost-effectiveness, and complications.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04095845.

Imaging demonstrated laterally dislocated patella, with asymmetric femoral trochlea, and advanced lateral compartment arthritis. The patient underwent robotic-assisted lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RAUKA). The patient saw marked improvements in patient-reported outcome measurements from her initial visit to the last follow-up visit. While treatment of knee osteoarthritis in patients with NPS can be difficult, especially with attempts of patellar realignment, we present a case of a patient who underwent RAUKA, with sustained improvements in patient outcomes and range of motion, at the 2-year follow-up visit. This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate the use of a novel technology in a rare condition."
pub.1091614265,Advances in Computer-Aided Technology for Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Technology such as computer-assisted navigation systems, robotic-assisted systems, and patient-specific instrumentation has been increasingly explored during the past decade in an effort to optimize component alignment and improve clinical outcomes. Computer-assisted navigation accurately restores mechanical-axis alignment, but clinical outcome data are inconsistent. Computer-assisted navigation gap balancing has shown early promise in establishing mechanical-axis alignment with improved functional outcomes. Robotic-assisted systems more accurately restore component alignment when compared with computer-assisted navigation, but clinical outcomes have yet to be determined. Patient-specific instrumentation does not consistently improve alignment, accuracy, or patient outcomes.

pub.1033569916,Adoption of Robotic vs Fluoroscopic Guidance in Total Hip Arthroplasty: Is Acetabular Positioning Improved in the Learning Curve?,"BACKGROUND: Acetabulum positioning affects dislocation rates, component impingement, bearing surface wear rates, and need for revision surgery. Novel techniques purport to improve the accuracy and precision of acetabular component position, but may have a significant learning curve. Our aim was to assess whether adopting robotic or fluoroscopic techniques improve acetabulum positioning compared to manual total hip arthroplasty (THA) during the learning curve.
METHODS: Three types of THAs were compared in this retrospective cohort: (1) the first 100 fluoroscopically guided direct anterior THAs (fluoroscopic anterior [FA]) done by a surgeon learning the anterior approach, (2) the first 100 robotic-assisted posterior THAs done by a surgeon learning robotic-assisted surgery (robotic posterior [RP]), and (3) the last 100 manual posterior (MP) THAs done by each surgeon (200 THAs) before adoption of novel techniques. Component position was measured on plain radiographs. Radiographic measurements were taken by 2 blinded observers. The percentage of hips within the surgeons' ""target zone"" (inclination, 30°-50°; anteversion, 10°-30°) was calculated, along with the percentage within the ""safe zone"" of Lewinnek (inclination, 30°-50°; anteversion, 5°-25°) and Callanan (inclination, 30°-45°; anteversion, 5°-25°). Relative risk (RR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) were calculated. Variances (square of the standard deviations) were used to describe the variability of cup position.
RESULTS: Seventy-six percentage of MP THAs were within the surgeons' target zone compared with 84% of FA THAs and 97% of RP THAs. This difference was statistically significant, associated with a RR reduction of 87% (RR, 0.13 [0.04-0.40]; P < .01; ARR, 21%; number needed to treat, 5) for RP compared to MP THAs. Compared to FA THAs, RP THAs were associated with a RR reduction of 81% (RR, 0.19 [0.06-0.62]; P < .01; ARR, 13%; number needed to treat, 8). Variances were lower for acetabulum inclination and anteversion in RP THAs (14.0 and 19.5) as compared to the MP (37.5 and 56.3) and FA (24.5 and 54.6) groups. These differences were statistically significant (P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Adoption of robotic techniques delivers significant and immediate improvement in the precision of acetabular component positioning during the learning curve. While fluoroscopy has been shown to be beneficial with experience, a learning curve exists before precision improves significantly."
pub.1003317402,Robotic and Navigation Systems in Orthopaedic Surgery: How Much Do Our Patients Understand?,"BACKGROUND: Technology in orthopaedic surgery has become more widespread in the past 20 years, with emerging evidence of its benefits in arthroplasty. Although patients are aware of benefits of conventional joint replacement, little is known on patients' knowledge of the prevalence, benefits or drawbacks of surgery involving navigation or robotic systems.
METHODS: In an outpatient arthroplasty clinic, 100 consecutive patients were approached and given questionnaires to assess their knowledge of navigation and robotics in orthopaedic surgery. Participation in the survey was voluntary.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients volunteered to participate in the survey, mean age 56.2 years (range, 19 to 88 years; 52 female, 46 male). Forty percent of patients thought more than 30% of National Health Service (NHS) orthopaedic operations involved navigation or robotics; 80% believed this was the same level or less than the private sector. One-third believed most of an operation could be performed independently by a robotic/navigation system. Amongst perceived benefits of navigation/robotic surgery was more accurate surgery (47%), quicker surgery (50%), and making the surgeon's job easier (52%). Sixty-nine percent believed navigation/robotics was more expensive and 20% believed it held no benefit against conventional surgery, with only 9% believing it led to longer surgery. Almost 50% would not mind at least some of their operation being performed with use of robotics/navigation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although few patients were familiar with this new technology, there appeared to be a strong consensus it was quicker and more accurate than conventional surgery. Many patients appear to believe navigation and robotics in orthopaedic surgery is largely the preserve of the private sector. This study demonstrates public knowledge of such new technologies is limited and a need to inform patients of the relative merits and drawbacks of such surgery prior to their more widespread implementation."
pub.1168218510,Caliper-Based Restricted Kinematic Alignment Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Restricted kinematic alignment total knee arthroplasty (rKA-TKA) is a reasonable selection for avoiding an extreme alignment that has been conceded to induce implant failure. However, computer-aided devices (CAS), such as navigation, robotics, and patient-specific instrumentation, are necessary to perform rKA-TKA. This paper reports on the surgical technique of kinematic alignment total knee arthroplasty (KA-TKA) using mechanical instruments. The lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) and the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) are measured from preoperative long radiographs or CT of the lower limb, and the arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA) is calculated from the MPTA - LDFA. The predefined restriction boundaries are used to determine the osteotomy angle. In our practice, the LDFA is 85° to 93°, the MPTA is 85° to 90°, and the aHKA is 5° varus to 3° valgus. If correction of the femoral osteotomy is required, this can be achieved by changing the thickness of the paddle set on the distal articular surface or by adjusting the angle of the variable angle femoral cutting guide. For the tibia, the distal end of the extramedullary rod, with the proximal part placed in the center of the knee joint, should be adjusted so that it does not exceed the lateral malleolus. This limits the medial tilt of the osteotomy plane to within 5.5°. These techniques allow restricted KA to be performed with existing mechanical instruments without using CAS."
pub.1160413323,The function of cruciate ligaments in bi-cruciate retaining Total knee arthroplasty with asymmetrical design,"BACKGROUND: Bi-cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty with an asymmetrical design may improve knee function and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to compare the kinematics, anteroposterior laxity, and in situ forces of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments of knees subjected to this treatment with those of healthy knees.
METHODS: Seven fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were tested using a robotic/universal force-moment sensor system. The kinematics during passive flexion-extension motion and anteroposterior laxity for native knee, treated knee, and treated knee with cruciate ligament transection states were investigated. The motions of the intact and treated knees during each test were repeated after anterior/posterior cruciate ligament transection to calculate the in situ force in the ligaments.
FINDINGS: The screw-home movement of normal knees disappeared after treatment. The in situ force of the anterior cruciate ligament in treated knees was higher than that in intact knees at ˃15° during flexion and at 60° and 90° against an anterior force. The in situ force of the posterior cruciate ligament in treated knees was higher at 0°, 15°, and 30° during flexion and at all flexion angles against a posterior force.
INTERPRETATION: The screw-home movement of normal knees decreased, and the in situ force of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments increased after treatment."
pub.1160594092,Effectiveness of Robotic Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty on Transfusion Rate in Staged Bilateral Surgery,"The transfusion rate in staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains high despite the application of blood management techniques. The potential of robotic arm-assisted TKA (R-TKA) in reducing the transfusion rate in staged bilateral surgery has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of R-TKA on transfusion reduction compared with conventional TKA (C-TKA) in staged bilateral surgery. This retrospective study involved two groups of patients who underwent 1-week interval staged bilateral TKA-the C-TKA group and the R-TKA group-using MAKO SmartRobotics (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA). Each group comprised 53 patients after propensity score matching and was compared in terms of nadir hemoglobin (Hb) level and transfusion rate after each stage of surgery. Both groups showed no significant differences in the propensity-matched variables of age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score, and preoperative Hb level. The R-TKA group showed a significantly higher nadir Hb level than the C-TKA group after the second TKA (<i>p</i> = 0.002). The transfusion rate was not significantly different between the two groups after the first TKA (<i>p</i> = 0.558). However, the R-TKA group showed a significantly lower transfusion rate in the TKA (<i>p</i> = 0.030) and overall period (<i>p</i> = 0.023) than the C-TKA group. Patients who undergo staged bilateral R-TKA have lower transfusion rate than those who undergo C-TKA. R-TKA may be effective in minimizing unnecessary allogeneic transfusions in staged bilateral surgery."

The aim of this study is to explore the objectives, functionalities, and outcomes of a platform designed to provide personalized surgical experiences to qualified patients, along with the associated problems and opportunities. (2) Methods: A survey-based analysis was conducted on patients who were prescribed the use of a specific care management platform and underwent primary robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) between January 2021 and February 2023. (3) Results: Patients registered on the platform who have undergone primary robotic TKA (rTKA) were considered. The mean age of registered patients is 68.6 years. The male (M)/female (F) ratio is 45.1%/54.9%. The patients interviewed were at an average distance of 485 days from the intervention, with a standard deviation of 187.5. The survey highlighted appreciation for the app and its features, but also limitations in its use and in its perception by the patients. All these data were evaluated according to the Wald principles and strategies to improve patient recruitment, enhance adherence, and create a comprehensive patient journey for optimized surgical experiences. (4) Conclusions: This patient care platform may have the potential to impact surgical experiences by increasing patient engagement, facilitating remote monitoring, and providing personalized care. There is a need to emphasize the importance of integrating the recruiting process, improving adherence strategies, and creating a comprehensive patient journey within the platform."
pub.1149587318,Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Restores Native Knee Kinematics During Activities of Daily Living: A Pilot Study,"The ability of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to restore native knee kinematics during activities of daily living remains unclear. The objectives of this prospective study were to identify changes in knee kinematics after medial UKA (mUKA) and to determine if mUKA restores native knee kinematics during activities of daily living. We hypothesized that kinematics are different between the mUKA knee and contralateral knee before surgery, that mUKA restores native knee kinematics, and that mUKA does not affect lateral compartment dynamic joint space. Nine participants performed walking, chair rise, stair ascent and stair descent within a biplane radiography system before and after mUKA. Bilateral knee kinematics were determined for each activity using a validated tracking process that matched subject-specific bones and implants to the biplane radiographs. Compared to contralateral knee, the pre-UKA knee was more adducted (p ≤ 0.019), and more laterally translated (p ≤ 0.008) during all four activities. Additionally, compared to contralateral knee, pre-UKA knee was less internally rotated (p ≤ 0.044) during chair rise and stair ascent. Lateral compartment dynamic joint space did not change during any activity from pre to post mUKA. Our results indicate that mUKA generally restores native kinematics during activities of daily living without altering lateral compartment dynamic joint space."
pub.1144786005,Registration of Proximal Tibial Centre May Need to be Selectively Lateralized to Avoid Coronal Malalignment in Digitally-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty,"PurposePlacement of prosthetic components and limb alignment can be adversely impacted by errors in identification of registration points in digitally assisted knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to trigonometrically analyze the impact on the accuracy of coronal tibial component and limb alignment of discrepancy between the registered midpoint of the proximal bony tibia vis-à-vis the radiographic medio-lateral center of the lateralized final tibial implant in certain varus-deformed knees.MethodsWe analyzed trigonometrically the angular difference θ$$\theta$$ in coronal alignment of tibial component and hip–knee–ankle angle resulting from lateral translation of the medio-lateral center of the final tibial implant, with respect to the initial registered midpoint of the proximal bony tibia. θ$$\theta$$ was calculated using the equation tan(θ$$\theta$$) = d/t, where d is the numerical distance between the registered point and the center of the final tibial tray position and t is the length of tibia distal to the resection.ResultsOne degree of varus malpositioning of the tibial component and the limb can occur for every 6.3 mm of lateral translation of the tibial implant with respect to the midpoint of the proximal bony tibia of average reported length (372 mm). The magnitude of this error is inversely proportional to tibial length and the patient’s height.ConclusionsCoronal malalignment of the tibial component and the limb is directly proportional to the amount of lateral translation of the tibial tray with respect to the registered midpoint of the proximal bony tibia and inversely proportional to the patient’s height. This may occur in cases with tibial extra-articular deformity, those undergoing reduction osteotomy, downsizing of the tray, or inadvertently during tibial preparation. The error can be avoided by initial registration of the tibial midpoint more laterally by templating, re-registering the new center of the resected tibial surface or osteotomy for extra-articular deformity.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1169185714,Safety and Effectiveness of Robotic‐Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the advantages of robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (raTKA) over conventional manual TKA (cmTKA) by comprehensively comparing patients who received raTKA and cmTKA in terms of postoperative pain, function, imaging assessment, and trauma to the body. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of raTKA in patients using the YUANHUA-TKA system.
METHODS: In a prospective, randomized single-blind trial, 60 patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA from October 2020 to December 2020 were randomly assigned to either raTKA or cmTKA. Clinical evaluation, including the time of osteotomy and prosthesis model testing, the total operation time, the visual analogue scale at rest, VAS in motion, opioid consumption, white blood cell count, neutrophil ratio, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), passive and active range of motion (pROM, aROM), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC [stiffness, pain, and function]) score, gait analysis, keen society score (KSS), adverse events, and blood loss were collected by the project nurse, as well as the imaging evaluation, including the lateral tibia component angle (LTC), frontal femoral component angle, frontal tibia component angle (FTC), lateral femoral component angl, and hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA). The student t-test (or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and the χ<sup>2</sup>-test (or the Fisher exact test) were used to determine differences in categorical variables.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the two groups in pain throughout the whole follow-up period. On the third day postoperatively, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the cmTKA group was significantly higher (p = 0.02), as well as the CRP (p = 0.04). No significant difference was found in the WOMAC stiffnes score or pROM. However, the aROM and the flexion range when walking (FRW) were significantly better in the raTKA group throughout the trial (p &lt; 0.05). The KSS at the 1-month follow-up and the WOMAC function score at the 1-year follow-up were both significantly better in the raTKA group (p &lt; 0.05). The HKA and the LTC in the raTKA group closer to the ideal angle, and the difference between the groups was significant (p &lt; 0.05). The total operation time of the raTKA group was significantly longer (p = 0.001). The intraoperative blood loss had no significant difference in the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Compared with cmTKA, raTKA with the YUANHUA robot not only avoids extra pain and trauma in patients but promises better functional recovery and improves the accuracy of the prosthesis position and axial alignment reconstruction."
pub.1139040152,What is the evidence for clinical use of advanced technology in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty?,"BACKGROUND: With an aim of improving prosthesis survivorship of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), use of computer-assisted technologies (CATs) such as robotics, has been on the rise to reduce intraoperative errors in surgical technique. In light of recent influx of CATs in the UKA, a review of these innovations will help providers to understand their clinical utility.
METHOD: A systematic literature search was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines.
RESULTS: Among 19 studies comparing robot-assisted UKA with conventional UKA, only 32% were randomized control trials, 47% reported minimum mean follow-up of 2 years, and 21% evaluated prosthesis survival. Similar results were obtained for navigation-assisted UKA and UKA performed with patient-specific instrumentation.
CONCLUSION: While CATs seem to reduce the surgical errors in UKA, the evidence on the efficacy of any of the studied CATs to improve survivorship remains limited and there are issues related to cost-effectiveness, learning curve, and increase in operating time."
pub.1076832367,Less invasive total hip arthroplasty using navigational tools.,"Although traditional total hip arthroplasty offers good visualization of bony landmarks and allows for the accurate orientation and fixation of implants, these benefits are achieved at the expense of extensive soft-tissue dissection and can result in postoperative complications and a delayed return to full function. To address these disadvantages, navigational tools were coupled with a mini-incision technique that allowed accurate bone preparation and orientation of the implant components without direct visualization of the bony landmarks. Additionally, image-guided systems provide three-dimensional information before and during surgery, making it possible to know, in real time, the orientation of implants and to visualize the full bony anatomy. This ""computer-enhanced vision"" allows surgeons to perform less invasive and eventually minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty with improved accuracy."
pub.1101776566,Iatrogenic Bone and Soft Tissue Trauma in Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Compared With Conventional Jig-Based Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Prospective Cohort Study and Validation of a New Classification System,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare macroscopic bone and soft tissue injury between robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) and conventional jig-based total knee arthroplasty (CJ-TKA) and create a validated classification system for reporting iatrogenic bone and periarticular soft tissue injury after TKA.
METHODS: This study included 30 consecutive CJ-TKAs followed by 30 consecutive RA-TKAs performed by a single surgeon. Intraoperative photographs of the femur, tibia, and periarticular soft tissues were taken before implantation of prostheses. Using these outcomes, the macroscopic soft tissue injury (MASTI) classification system was developed to grade iatrogenic bone and soft tissue injuries. Interobserver and Intraobserver validity of the proposed classification system was assessed.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing RA-TKA had reduced medial soft tissue injury in both passively correctible (P < .05) and noncorrectible varus deformities (P < .05); more pristine femoral (P < .05) and tibial (P < .05) bone resection cuts; and improved MASTI scores compared to CJ-TKA (P < .05). There was high interobserver (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.92 [95% confidence interval: 0.88-0.96], P < .05) and intraobserver agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.94 [95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.97], P < .05) of the proposed MASTI classification system.
CONCLUSION: There is reduced bone and periarticular soft tissue injury in patients undergoing RA-TKA compared to CJ-TKA. The proposed MASTI classification system is a reproducible grading scheme for describing iatrogenic bone and soft tissue injury in TKA.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: RA-TKA is associated with reduced bone and soft tissue injury compared with conventional jig-based TKA. The proposed MASTI classification may facilitate further research correlating macroscopic soft tissue injury during TKA to long-term clinical and functional outcomes."
pub.1162892266,Robotic‐assisted technology does not influence functional outcomes among obese and morbidly obese total knee arthroplasty patients,"PURPOSE: Despite benefits of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on function and quality of life, obese patients have less improved functional outcomes following TKA compared to their normal weight counterparts. Furthermore, obesity is a risk factor for aseptic loosening and revision surgery following TKA. With known benefits of robotic-assisted TKA (RaTKA) in precision and patient satisfaction, we aimed to evaluate the differences in patient reported outcome and early complication rates for patients undergoing RaTKA versus conventional TKA among patients of varying BMI groups.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent conventional versus RaTKA. Patients were grouped by BMI range (< 30 kg/m2, 30-40 kg/m2, and > 40 kg/m2). Patient-reported outcomes were measured by Oxford Knee Scores and 12-Item Short Form Survey scores preoperatively, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year postoperatively. Mixed-effects linear models were built for each patient-reported outcome to assess the interaction between type of surgery and BMI while adjusting for known confounders such as demographic variables.
RESULTS: A total of 350 patients (n = 186 RaTKA, n = 164 conventional TKA) met inclusion criteria. SF-12 physical scores were significantly higher at 2-year follow-up among non-obese patients compared to obese and morbidly obese patients (p = 0.047). There was no statistically significant interaction between the type of surgery performed (RaTKA versus conventional TKA) and obesity regarding their effects on patient reported outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates no differences in functional outcomes among patients undergoing RaTKA compared to conventional TKA. Furthermore, obesity had no significant effect on this association.

METHODS: This retrospective, consecutive case-control trial included 83 patients with varus osteoarthritis of the knee undergoing Conv-TKA versus RA-TKA using bi-cruciate stabilized TKA. The rotational mismatch of the femoral and tibial components between the two groups were compared using 3DCT measurements. PROMs (2011 Knee Society Score (KSS), forgotten joint score-12 (FJS-12), patella score were compared in patients between 1 and 2 years postoperatively.
RESULTS: The two groups did not exhibit significant differences in any of the following preoperative factors: age at surgery, body mass index (BMI), preoperative range of motion (ROM), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle. There were no significant differences in postoperative HKA angle and tibial rotation angle, the absolute values of the femoral rotational angle and rotational mismatch were significantly smaller in the RA-TKA group than in the Conv-TKA group (both p < 0.01). Neither Postoperative PROMs (2011 KSS: pain, patient satisfaction, patient expectation, advanced activities score) nor patella score differed significantly between the groups, but FJS-12 was significantly better in the Conv-TKA group than in the RA-TKA group (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: RA-TKA did not improve FJS-12 compared to Conv-TKA, but did result in more accurate rotational alignment of femoral component and rotational mismatch between the femoral and tibial components.

pub.1157156985,Correcting for distal femoral asymmetry is necessary to determine postoperative alignment deviations from planned alignment of the femoral component,"BACKGROUND: One method for assessing the accuracy of manual, patient-specific, navigational, and robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) instrumentation is to use a post-operative computer tomogram and determine the deviation of the femoral component alignment relative to the planned alignment in the native (i.e. healthy) contralateral distal femoral epiphysis. However, side-to-side asymmetry might introduce errors which inflate alignment deviations. This study quantified asymmetry in the distal femoral epiphysis.
METHODS: High resolution CT images (0.5 mm slice thickness) were acquired from bilateral lower limb specimens of 13 skeletally mature subjects with no skeletal abnormalities. Images were segmented to generate 3D femur models. Asymmetry was quantified by differences in positions and orientations required to shape-match the distal epiphysis of the mirror 3D femur model to the distal epiphysis of the contralateral 3D femur model.
RESULTS: Asymmetry was due to random rather than systematic differences. Random differences (i.e. standard deviations) in proximal-distal (P-D) and anterior-posterior (A-P) positions were 1.1 mm and in varus-valgus (V-V) and internal-external (I-E) orientations were 0.9° and 1.3°, respectively. These represented substantial relative errors of up to 50 % in previously reported overall alignment deviations.
CONCLUSIONS: Although small in an absolute sense, asymmetry of the distal femur epiphysis introduced substantial relative errors when assessing accuracy of femoral component alignment in TKA. When post-operative computer tomograms are used to assess the accuracy of manual, patient specific, navigational, and robotic-assisted TKA instrumentation, the overall deviation should be corrected for asymmetry to better indicate the accuracy of the surgical technique."
pub.1157882709,Robotic-Arm-Assisted Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty with a Fixed-Bearing Implant,"Background: Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with knee arthritis have isolated lateral compartment arthritis; however, lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) comprises just 1% of all knee arthroplasties<sup>1</sup>. This low proportion is partly because of the perceived complexity of lateral UKA and concerns over implant longevity and survivorship compared with total knee arthroplasty (TKA)<sup>2,3</sup>. With an improved understanding of knee kinematics alongside advances in implant design and tools to aid in appropriate restoration of limb alignment, lateral UKA can be an appealing surgical alternative to TKA for certain patients with lateral knee arthritis<sup>4,5</sup>. In appropriately selected patients, lateral UKA has been associated with reduced osseous and soft-tissue resection, more natural knee kinematics, less pain, shorter hospitalization, decreased blood loss and infection rates, and excellent survivorship and patient-reported outcomes<sup>6-9</sup>.
Description: This surgical approach and technique described for lateral UKA utilizes robotic-arm assistance and modern fixed-bearing implants<sup>10</sup>. The specific steps involve appropriate patient evaluation and selection, extensive radiographic and computed-tomography-based preoperative templating, a lateral parapatellar approach, intraoperative confirmation of component position and alignment, and robotic-arm assistance to perform osseous resections to achieve limb alignment and kinematic targets<sup>10</sup>. Final implants are cemented in place, and patients typically are discharged home on the day of surgery<sup>10</sup>.
Alternatives: Nonoperative treatment for end-stage knee arthritis includes weight loss, activity modification, assistive devices, bracing, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and various injections<sup>11</sup>. Alternative surgical treatments include TKA<sup>4</sup> and, in certain patients, an offloading periarticular osteotomy<sup>12</sup>.
Rationale: Lateral UKA is an appealing surgical option for nonobese patients who have disabling knee pain isolated to the lateral compartment, good preoperative range of motion, and a passively correctable valgus limb deformity<sup>10,13</sup>.
Expected Outcomes: Patients are typically discharged home on the day of surgery, or occasionally on postoperative day 1 if medical comorbidities dictate hospital monitoring overnight<sup>10</sup>. Patients return to light activities, including walking, immediately postoperatively. By 3 months postoperatively, patients will generally have returned to all desired activities<sup>9</sup>. The mid-term outcomes of this procedure, as performed by the corresponding author, have been published recently<sup>14,15</sup>. The 5-year survivorship of 171 lateral UKAs was 97.7%, with 72.8% of patients reporting that they were very satisfied with their procedure and 19.8%, that they were satisfied<sup>14</sup>.

pub.1181435938,"Precise Acetabular Prosthesis Positioning Using a Novel Robot‐Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty System: A Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial","OBJECTIVE: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is currently one of the most effective treatment methods for end-stage hip joint disease, and its long-term effectiveness largely depends on the accurate placement of the acetabular prosthesis. In conventional surgery, the placement of the acetabular prosthesis mainly relies on the surgeon's clinical experience and surgical techniques. To further improve the accuracy of prosthesis placement, a new robotic system for THA is designed. The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness and safety of THA assisted by this robotic system.
METHOD: A multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled, superiority study design was adopted with statistical methods of t test and Chi-squared test. Participants undergoing primary THA have been enrolled in three centers of joint surgery in China since July 17, 2023. Robotic THA was operated in the experimental group, and conventional instruments were used in the control group. The primary outcome is the proportion of anteversion and inclination angles in the safe zone. The secondary outcomes include operation time, WOMAC score, Harris score, SF-36 health questionnaire, dislocation rate of hip joint, and rates of adverse events and serious adverse events.
RESULTS: A total of 138 patients were included in this study. The proportion of both anteversion and inclination angles in the safe zone was 92.2% in the experimental group and 50.8% in the control group, with significant difference (p < 0.01). The average operation time in the experimental group and control group was 116.4 and 80.5 min respectively, with significant difference (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in WOMAC score, Harris score, and SF-36 between the two groups (6 ± 2) weeks after operation (p > 0.05). The dislocation rate of hip joint in the experimental group and control group were 3.0% and 1.5%, respectively, without significant difference (p > 0.05). The rate of adverse events and severe adverse events in the experimental group and control group also showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). No adverse events or serious adverse events were judged to be ""definitely related"" to the experimental instruments.
CONCLUSION: Robotic THA could prolong the operation time within an acceptable range, but more precise acetabular prosthesis positioning could be obtained when compared with conventional surgery. Besides, no significant difference was found in function scores, dislocation rate or other adverse events, which indicates that this new robot system shows both good effectiveness and safety in THA.

pub.1149894779,Current Occupational Perspective of Total Hip Joint Surgeons in China: A Survey of Members of the Chinese Orthopedic Association,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the basic occupational information and the preferences of surgical techniques in Chinese joint surgeons.
METHODS: A survey study was conducted during the Chinese Hip Society (CHS) conference of 2020. Participants from hospitals all over the country were included as the potential respondents. The questions were asked for respondents' basic information, overviews of total hip arthroplasty (THA), surgical techniques, and prosthesis selection. After data collection and filtration, analysis was conducted using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Only 8.31% of joint surgeons used robotics or navigation systems to assisted their total hip arthroplasty. For the approach preference, posterolateral approaches were generally favored, being used commonly by 75.36% of respondents while the direct anterior approach was considered the preferred choice by 8.31% of Chinese joint surgeons. 24.36% of the respondents choose to use domestic prosthesis in over 80% of their patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The intelligent THA is in the early stage at present but developing rapidly in China. The composition of surgical approach is simple at present and the continuing education should aim at increasing the diversity of approach selection in the following years. Domestic prosthesis is playing significant role in the prosthesis market. Joint registration system is urgently needed for Chinese joint surgery."
pub.1159824564,MAKO robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty cannot reduce the aggravation of ankle varus incongruence after genu varus correction ≥ 10°: a radiographic assessment,"IntroductionThe objective of this study was to investigate the ankle alignment alterations after the correction of knee varus deformity in MAKO robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (MA-TKA).MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted for 108 patients with TKA from February 2021 to February 2022. Patients were divided into two groups based on MAKO robot involvement during the procedure: the MA-TKA group (n = 36) and the conventional manual total knee arthroplasty (CM-TKA) group (n = 72). The patients were divided into four subgroups according to the degree of surgical correction of the knee varus deformity. Seven radiological measurements were evaluated pre and post-surgery: mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA), tibial plafond inclination angle (TPIA), talar inclination angle (TIA), and tibiotalar tilt angle (TTTA). TTTA is a quantitative representation of the extent of ankle incongruence.ResultsThe number of mTFA, mLDFA, and MPTA outliers in the MA-TKA group was significantly lower compared to the CM-TKA group (P<0.05). Knee varus deformity was properly corrected and the mechanical axis was restored in all patients, regardless of the treatment group. Only for varus corrections ≥ 10° did TTTA change significantly (p < 0.01) and ankle varus incongruence aggravate post-operation. The ΔTTTA correlated negatively with ΔTFA (r=-0.310,P = 0.001) and correlated positively with ΔTPIA (r = 0.490,P = 0.000). When the varus correction was ≥ 7.55°, the probability of ankle varus incongruence exacerbation increased 4.86-fold.ConclusionCompared with CM-TKA, MA-TKA osteotomy showed more precision but was unable to reduce post-operation ankle varus incongruence. When the varus correction ≥ 10°, ankle varus incongruence aggravated, while when the varus correction ≥ 7.55°, the probability of ankle varus incongruence increased 4.86-fold.

pub.1164648806,"Functional alignment in total knee arthroplasty best achieves balanced gaps and minimal bone resections: an analysis comparing mechanical, kinematic and functional alignment strategies","PURPOSE: Key concepts in total knee arthroplasty include restoration of limb alignment and soft-tissue balance. Although differences in balance have been reported amongst mechanical alignment (MA), kinematic alignment (KA) and functional alignment (FA) techniques, it remains unclear whether there are differences in gap imbalance or resection thicknesses when comparing different constitutional alignment subgroups.
METHODS: MA (measured resection technique), KA (matched resections technique) and FA (technique based on the restricted KA boundaries) were compared in 116 consecutive patients undergoing 137 robotic-assisted cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasties. The primary outcome was the proportion of balanced gaps (differential laxities ≤ 2 mm) for extension, flexion, medial and lateral gap measurements. Manual pre-resection laxity measurements were obtained for MA and KA and manual post-resection measurements were obtained for FA in 10° and in 90° of knee flexion. Secondary outcomes were resection depths and implant alignment. All outcomes were analysed per constitutional coronal alignment and joint line obliquity subgroups.
RESULTS: The proportions of balance in all four gap measurements were 54.7%, 66.4% and 96.5%, with MA, KA and FA, respectively. Across all constitutional alignment types, FA achieved the highest proportion of balance. MA resected the least amount of bone from the medial tibial plateau. KA had femoral components in most valgus and most internally rotated, tibial components in most varus and was the most bone-preserving for the posteromedial femoral condyle. FA had the most externally rotated femoral components and was most bone-preserving for the distal femoral resections.
CONCLUSION: The study shows that implant alignment to the mechanical axis or joint line anatomy (equal resections) alone does not guarantee a balanced total knee arthroplasty. FA resulted in the highest proportion of balanced knees across all analysed subgroups. Future research will consider whether one alignment philosophy leads to superior outcomes for different constitutional alignment subgroups.

pub.1172389025,Inverse kinematic total knee arthroplasty using conventional instrumentation restores constitutional coronal alignment,"PURPOSE: Restricted inverse kinematic alignment (iKA) is a contemporary alignment strategy for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), commonly performed with robotic assistance. While superior clinical results are reported for kinematic-type alignment strategies, registry data indicate no survivorship benefit for navigation or robotic assistance. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of an instrumented, restricted iKA technique for achieving patient-specific alignment.
METHODS: Seventy-nine patients undergoing 84 TKAs (five bilateral procedures) using an iKA technique were included for preoperative and postoperative lower limb alignment analysis. The mean age was 66.5 (range: 43-82) with 33 male and 51 female patients. Artificial intelligence was employed for radiographic measurements. Alignment profiles were classified using the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) system. Preoperative and postoperative alignment profiles were compared with subanalyses for preoperative valgus, neutral and varus profiles.
RESULTS: The mean joint-line convergence angle (JLCA) reduced from 2.5° to -0.1° postoperatively. The mean lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) remained unchanged postoperatively, while the mean medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) increased by 2.5° (p = 0.001). By preservation of the LDFA and restoration of the MPTA, the mean hip knee ankle angle (HKA) moved through 3.5° varus to 1.2° valgus. The CPAK system was used to visually depict changes in alignment profiles for preoperative valgus, neutral and varus knees; with 63% of patients observing an interval change in classification.
CONCLUSION: Encouraged by the latest evidence supporting both conventional instrumentation and kinematic-type TKA strategies, this study describes how a restricted, conventionally instrumented iKA technique may be utilised to restore constitutional lower limb alignment.

pub.1171068675,Cemented vs Cementless Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Yield Similar Short-Term Clinical Outcomes,"Background: In primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there is ongoing controversy about optimal fixation (cemented vs cementless). Cemented TKA remains the gold standard, with the largest body of long-term evidence available to support it. However, cementless TKA implants are gaining popularity due to potential biomechanical advantages and a growing body of literature supporting survivorship. Due to paucity of literature investigating fixation methods in robotic-assisted TKA (Ra-TKA), we aim to compare clinical outcomes of cementless Ra-TKA with those of cemented Ra-TKA.
Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent Ra-TKA by 19 surgeons comparing results of cases using cementless vs cemented fixation. We observed short-term complications, emergency room visits, and readmissions. We collected patient-reported outcomes measurement information system and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome scores preoperatively and 12 weeks after surgery.
Results: A total of 582 TKA cases were included: 335 cementless and 247 cemented. The patients in the cementless group were younger and had a higher body mass index. The cemented group had a higher rate of return to the operating room, with manipulation under anesthesia for stiffness being the most common indication in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in 30-day readmissions, 90-day emergency room visits, or patient-reported outcomes.
Conclusions: Our retrospective study demonstrated higher return to operating room in the cemented group vs the cementless group. We reported no differences in any other short-term outcomes between the cementless and cemented Ra-TKA. Our data support efficacy and safety of cementless Ra-TKA at 3-month follow-up."

METHODS: This was a multicentre registry study from October 2016 to June 2021 that included 861 primary RA-TKA patients who completed at least one pre- and postoperative patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) questionnaire, including Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS JR), and pain out of 100 points. The mean age was 67 years (35 to 86), 452 were male (53%), mean BMI was 31.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (19 to 58), and 553 (64%) cemented and 308 (36%) cementless implants.
RESULTS: There were significant improvements in PROMs over time between preoperative, one- to two-year, and &gt; two-year follow-up, with a mean FJS of 17.5 (SD 18.2), 70.2 (SD 27.8), and 76.7 (SD 25.8; p &lt; 0.001); mean KOOS JR of 51.6 (SD 11.5), 85.1 (SD 13.8), and 87.9 (SD 13.0; p &lt; 0.001); and mean pain scores of 65.7 (SD 20.4), 13.0 (SD 19.1), and 11.3 (SD 19.9; p &lt; 0.001), respectively. There were eight superficial infections (0.9%) and four revisions (0.5%).
CONCLUSION: RA-TKA demonstrated consistent clinical results across multiple institutions with excellent PROMs that continued to improve over time. With the ability to achieve target alignment in the coronal, axial, and sagittal planes and provide intraoperative real-time data to obtain balanced gaps, RA-TKA demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes and PROMs in this patient population.Cite this article: <i>Bone Jt Open</i> 2022;3(7):589-595."

This study was conducted according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines. All studies in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane that reported radiological and functional outcomes after TKA or UKA with either robotic or conventional methods were included in the review. Selected endpoints for random effects, pairwise meta-analysis included operative details, radiological outcomes (mechanical axis, component angle deviation, and outliers), and functional outcomes (American Knee Society Score, Knee Society Function Score, revision and complication rate, range of motion (ROM), Hospital for Special Surgery score, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index). A total of 23 studies comprising 2,765 knees were included from the initial search. Robot-assisted TKA and UKA were associated with significantly better component angle alignment accuracy (low-to-high quality evidence) at the cost of significantly greater operation time. Robot-assisted UKA was found to have significantly better short-term functional outcomes compared with conventional UKA (moderate-to-high quality evidence). Robot-assisted TKA, however, did not exhibit significantly better short- and midterm subjective knee outcome scores compared with its conventional counterpart (high-quality evidence). Robot-assisted TKA and UKA were associated with nonstatistically significant improved ROM and lesser rates of revision. Robot-assisted total and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty leads to better radiological outcomes, with no significant differences in mid- and long-term functional outcomes compared with conventional methods for the former. Larger prospective studies with mid- and long-term outcomes are required to further substantiate findings from the present study."

One hundred forty-six primary THAs on 130 patients were included in this study. Robot-assisted primary THA was performed on 75 hips and a hand-rasping technique was used on 71 hips.ResultsAt 2 and 3 years postoperatively, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) clinical score was slightly better in the robotic-assisted group. At 5 years followup, however, the differences were not significant. Postoperative limb lengths of the robotic-milling group had significantly less variance than the hand-rasping group. At 2 years postoperatively, there was significantly more stress shielding of the proximal femur in the hand-rasping group; this difference was more significant 5 years postoperatively.ConclusionsSubstantially more precise implant positioning seems to have led to less variance in limb-length inequality and less stress shielding of the proximal femur 5 years postoperatively.Level of Evidence Level II, therapeutic study.

pub.1107054942,Robotic‐arm assisted total knee arthroplasty has a learning curve of seven cases for integration into the surgical workflow but no learning curve effect for accuracy of implant positioning,"PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the surgical team's learning curve for robotic-arm assisted TKA through assessments of operative times, surgical team comfort levels, accuracy of implant positioning, limb alignment, and postoperative complications. Secondary objectives were to compare accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment in conventional jig-based TKA versus robotic-arm assisted TKA.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 60 consecutive conventional jig-based TKAs followed by 60 consecutive robotic-arm assisted TKAs performed by a single surgeon. Independent observers recorded surrogate markers of the learning curve including operative times, stress levels amongst the surgical team using the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) questionnaire, accuracy of implant positioning, limb alignment, and complications within 30 days of surgery. Cumulative summation (CUSUM) analyses were used to assess learning curves for operative time and STAI scores in robotic TKA.
RESULTS: Robotic-arm assisted TKA was associated with a learning curve of seven cases for operative times (p = 0.01) and surgical team anxiety levels (p = 0.02). Cumulative robotic experience did not affect accuracy of implant positioning (n.s.) limb alignment (n.s.) posterior condylar offset ratio (n.s.) posterior tibial slope (n.s.) and joint line restoration (n.s.). Robotic TKA improved accuracy of implant positioning (p < 0.001) and limb alignment (p < 0.001) with no additional risk of postoperative complications compared to conventional manual TKA.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of robotic-arm assisted TKA led to increased operative times and heightened levels of anxiety amongst the surgical team for the initial seven cases but there was no learning curve for achieving the planned implant positioning. Robotic-arm assisted TKA improved accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment compared to conventional jig-based TKA. The findings of this study will enable clinicians and healthcare professionals to better understand the impact of implementing robotic TKA on the surgical workflow, assist the safe integration of this procedure into surgical practice, and facilitate theatre planning and scheduling of operative cases during the learning phase.

pub.1014011841,Robotic Arm‐assisted UKA Improves Tibial Component Alignment: A Pilot Study,"The alignment of the components of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) reportedly influences outcomes and durability. A novel robotic arm technology has been developed with the expectation that it could improve the accuracy of bone preparation in UKA. During the study period, we compared the postoperative radiographic alignment of the tibial component with the preoperatively planned position in 31 knees in 31 consecutive patients undergoing UKA using robotic arm-assisted bone preparation and in 27 consecutive patients who underwent unilateral UKA using conventional manual instrumentation to determine the error of bone preparation and variance with each technique. Radiographically, the root mean square error of the posterior tibial slope was 3.1 degrees when using manual techniques compared with 1.9 degrees when using robotic arm assistance for bone preparation. In addition, the variance using manual instruments was 2.6 times greater than the robotically guided procedures. In the coronal plane, the average error was 2.7 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees more varus of the tibial component relative to the mechanical axis of the tibia using manual instruments compared with 0.2 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees with robotic technology, and the varus/valgus root mean square error was 3.4 degrees manually compared with 1.8 degrees robotically. Further study will be necessary to determine whether a reduction in alignment errors of these magnitudes will ultimately influence implant function or survival.

pub.1131104281,A brief history of artificial intelligence and robotic surgery in orthopedics & traumatology and future expectations,"Recently, the rate of the production and renewal of information makes it almost impossible to be updated. It is quite difficult to process and interpret large amounts of data by human beings. Unlimited memory capacities, learning abilities, artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and robotic surgery techniques cause orthopedic surgeons to be concerned about losing their jobs. The idea of AI, which was first introduced in 1956, has evolved over time by revealing deep learning and evolutionary plexus that can mimic the human neuron cell. Image processing is the leading improvement in developed algorithms. Theoretically, these algorithms appear to be quite successful in interpreting medical images and orthopedic decision support systems for preoperative evaluation. Robotic surgeons have emerged as significant competitors in carrying out the taken decisions. The first robotic applications of orthopedic surgery started in 1992 with the ROBODOC system. Applications started with hip arthroplasty continued with knee arthroplasty. Publications indicate that problems such as blood loss and infection caused by the long operation time in the early stages have been overcome in time with the help of learning systems. Comparative studies conducted with humans indicate that robots are better than humans in providing limb lengthening, patient satisfaction, and cost. As in all new technologies, the developments in both AI applications and robotics surgery indicate that technology is in favor in terms of cost/benefit analyses. Although studies indicate that new technologies are more successful than humans, the replacement of technology with experience and long-term results with traditional methods will not be observed in the near future."

The aim of our study is to compare the standard operative technique and the assisted navigation technique to understand if the robotic technology is able to obtain more accurate implants and with a better outcome. In the period between January 2016 and February 2018, in our Clinic, were performed 94 medial unicompartmental knee implants. The implantation of the medial unicompartmental prosthesis was performed in 30 cases with the standard technique and in 29 cases with the image-free robotic technique (Navio Surgical System). The objective of our study was to evaluate the anatomical and mechanical axes, the tibial slope, the coronal inclination of the femoral tibial space, the coronal angulation of the tibial and femoral component and the height of the Joint-Line. Furthermore, to evaluate the outcome we has execute international scores (IKDC and KSS Insall mod.). The advanced navigation seems to allow the implantation of the unicompartmental prosthesis more precisely, although not always with a statistically significant difference compared to the standard technique. further clinical studies are needed to analyze the medium and long-term survival rate, as well as the patient's subjective outcome."

This five-degree-of-freedom robot was designed to replicate the rotations (±40 deg, accuracy 0.5 deg) and three-dimensional (3D) forces (up to 2 kN, with a 1% error settling time of 0.6 s) that the humeral implant exerts on the glenoid implant. We tested the performances of the simulator using force patterns measured in real patients. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of different orientations of the glenoid implant on joint stability. When simulating realistic dynamic forces and implant orientations, the simulator was able to reproduce stable behavior by measuring the translations of the humeral head of less than 24 mm with respect to the glenoid implant. Simulation with quasi-static forces showed dislocation in extreme ranges of implant orientation. The robotic GH simulator presented here was able to reproduce physiological GH forces and may therefore be used to further evaluate the effects of glenoid implant design and orientation on joint stability."
pub.1139918446,Component placement accuracy in two generations of handheld robotics-assisted knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionTotal knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the gold standard for treatment of end-stage osteoarthritis. Previous studies have shown that successful outcomes following TKA depend on accurate implant alignment and soft tissue balancing. Robotic-assisted TKA have demonstrated improved accuracy in component placement and have been associated with better outcomes and patient satisfaction. This study aims to report on the execution accuracy of two generations of handheld robotic-assisted surgical systems.MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of TKA procedures with two sequential generations of the same handheld robotic-assisted surgical system. Intra-operative data captured included pre-operative limb deformity, limb axes, range of motion, kinematic balance, and the resulting plan for component placement in three-dimensional space. Patients were stratified based on their preoperative coronal lower limb mechanical alignment (> 3° varus, < 3° varus, < 3° valgus, and ≥ 3° valgus). Measurements of component placement (overall lower limb alignment, medial and lateral flexion gaps, and tibial and femoral resection depths) were assessed using descriptive statistics.ResultsA total of 435 patients were included and stratified based on preoperative lower limb alignment: 229 with ≥ 3° varus, 78 with varus < 3° and 58 with valgus < 3°, and 70 with valgus > 3°. The mean difference between planned and achieved alignment in the lower limb valgus patients was < 1° across all groups. Mean differences between planned and achieved medial flexion gap was higher in the > 3° subgroup in the varus patient cohort ([< 3°]: 1.15 ± 1.92 vs. [> 3°]: 1.90 ± 2.57); this value was higher in the < 3° subgroup for valgus patients ([< 3°]: 1.34 ± 1.83 vs. [> 3°]: 0.956 ± 1.65). Average resection depth ranged from 9.46 to 10.4 mm in the posterior medial femur, 9.25 to 9.95 mm in the posterior lateral femur, 7.45 to 8.79 mm in the distal medial femur, 8.22 to 9.18 mm in the distal lateral femur, 6.70 to 7.07 mm in the medial tibial condyle and 6.40 to 7.19 mm in the lateral tibial condyle. Non-inferiority testing demonstrated the newer generation is non-inferior to the older generation.ConclusionRobotic-assisted knee replacement using handheld image-free systems is able to maintain accuracy of component placement. Further investigation of patient reported outcomes as well as long-term implant longevity are needed."
pub.1124124104,Preliminary experience with an image-free handheld robot for total knee arthroplasty: 77 cases compared with a matched control group,"BackgroundAchieving an optimal limb alignment is an important factor affecting the long-term survival of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This is the first study to look at the limb alignment and orientation of components in TKA using a novel image-free handheld robotic sculpting system.MethodsThis case-controlled study retrospectively compared limb and component alignment of 77 TKAs performed with a robot (Robot-group) with a matched control group of patients who received conventional alignment with intramedular rods (Control group). Alignment and component positioning was measured on full-leg weight-bearing and standard lateral X-rays by two independent observers. The image-free handheld robotic sculpting system calculated the planned and achieved mechanical axis (MA). Outliers were defined as > 3° deviation from planned alignment.ResultsMean MA was 180.1° (SD = 1.9) in the Robot-group, compared to the Control group with a mean MA of 179.1° (SD = 3.1, p = 0.028). We observed 5 outliers (6%) in the Robot-group and 14 outliers (18%, p = 0.051) in the Control group. Fraction of outliers of the frontal tibial component was 0% in the Robot-group versus 8% in the Control group (p = 0.038). There were no other statistical differences regarding the implant positioning between both groups.ConclusionThe Robot-group showed significantly less outliers compared to the conventional technique. Whether these differences are clinically relevant is questionable and should be investigated on the long term. Randomized controlled trials with larger patient series will be needed in the future to confirm our preliminary results."
pub.1016513943,Effect of robotic milling on periprosthetic bone remodeling,"The ROBODOC system has provided better fit and fill of the stem and less destruction of the bony architecture than with manual surgery. These benefits might affect femoral periprosthetic bone remodeling. We evaluated the effects of robotic milling in cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA) in a longitudinal 24-month follow-up study using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and plain radiographs of 29 patients (31 hips) after ROBODOC THA and 24 patients (27 hips) after manual THA with the same stem design. To minimize the influence of other factors on bone remodeling, only female osteoarthritis patients, who had no drugs that might affect bone metabolism were enrolled. Significantly less bone loss occurred at the proximal periprosthetic areas in the ROBODOC group. In zone 1, the decrease was 15.5 versus 29.9% using conventional rasping; in zone 7, the loss was 17.0% with ROBODOC compared to 30.5% with conventional rasping (p < 0.05). On radiographs, endosteal spot welds in the proximal medial portion were more pronounced in the ROBODOC group (48 vs. 11% in the conventional group, p < 0.05). Our results suggest that robotic milling is effective in facilitating proximal load transfer around the femoral component and minimizing bone loss after cementless THA."
pub.1145363314,Application of a robotics path planning algorithm to assess the risk of mobile bearing dislocation in lateral unicompartmental knee replacement,"Due to ligament laxity, bearing dislocation occurs in 1–6% of Oxford Domed Lateral (ODL) replacements with most dislocations occurring medially. Dislocations were studied using a previously built mechanical rig, however testing using the rig was inefficient. The aim of this study was to develop a better tool that was more reliable and efficient. An established robotics software package, the Open Motion Planning Library, was modified to accept the ODL components. Using a robotics path planning algorithm, the mobile bearing was allowed to find a way out from between the femoral and tibial components i.e. to dislocate. Testing assessed a range of clinically relevant positions of the femoral component relative to the tibial component. Dislocations were labelled as medial, lateral, anterior or posterior depending on the dislocation direction. The Distraction to Dislocation (DD) measured the minimum vertical distraction of the femoral component from the tibial component for a dislocation to occur. Results were validated against the mechanical rig. Statistical analysis of medial dislocation showed excellent agreement with an intraclass correlation value of 0.993 (95% CI 0.982–0.998). All DDs from the dislocation analysis tool were within 1 mm of the mechanical rig DDs with results sharing a remarkably similar trend. The robotics dislocation analysis tool output DDs which were marginally higher than the manual mechanical rig: 0.50 mm anteriorly, 0.25 mm posteriorly and 0.50 mm laterally. Medially, the computational DD differed on average by 0.09 mm (stand deviation: 0.2026 mm). Our study describes the development and validation of a novel robotics dislocation analysis tool, which allows mobile bearing dislocation risk quantification. The tool may also be used to improve surgical implantation parameters and to assess new implant designs that aim to reduce the medial dislocation risk to an acceptable level."
pub.1024080196,The dimensional accuracy of preparation of femoral cavity in cementless total hip arthroplasty,"Objective: To observe the accuracy of femoral preparation and the position of the cementless prosthesis in femoral cavity, and to compare the results between the computer-assisted surgical group (CASPAR) and the conventional group. Methods: Ten femoral components were implanted either manually or by CASPAR in cadaver femurs. The specimens were cut to 3 mm thick slices. Microradiograms of every slice were sent to a computer for analysis with special software (IDL). The gaps and the medullary cavities between component and bone, the direct bone contact area of the implant surface, the gap width and the percentage of gap and bone contact area were measured in every slice. Results: In the proximal implant coated with HA of the CASPAR group, the average percentage of bone contact reached 93.2% (ranging from 87.6% to 99.7%); the average gap percentage was 2.9% (ranging from 0.3% to 7.8%); the maximum gap width was 0.81 mm and the average gap width was only 0.20 mm. While in the conventional group, the average percentage of bone contact reached 60.1% (ranging from 49.2% to 70.4%); the average gap percentage was 32.8% (ranging from 25.1% to 39.9%); the maximum gap width was 2.97 mm and the average gap width was 0.77 mm. The average gap around the implant in the CASPAR group was only 9% of that in the manual group; the maximum and average gap widths were only about 26% of those in the manual group. On the other hand, the CASPAR group showed 33% higher bone contact than the manual group. Conclusion: With the use of robotics-assisted system, significant progress can be achieved for femoral preparation in total hip arthroplasty."
pub.1038883063,Robotic Assistance Enables Inexperienced Surgeons to Perform Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasties on Dry Bone Models with Accuracy Superior to Conventional Methods,"Robotic systems have been shown to improve unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) component placement accuracy compared to conventional methods when used by experienced surgeons. We aimed to determine whether inexperienced UKA surgeons can position components accurately using robotic assistance when compared to conventional methods and to demonstrate the effect repetition has on accuracy. Sixteen surgeons were randomised to an active constraint robot or conventional group performing three UKAs over three weeks. Implanted component positions and orientations were compared to planned component positions in six degrees of freedom for both femoral and tibial components. Mean procedure time decreased for both robot (37.5 mins to 25.7 mins) (P = 0.002) and conventional (33.8 mins to 21.0 mins) (P = 0.002) groups by attempt three indicating the presence of a learning curve; however, neither group demonstrated changes in accuracy. Mean compound rotational and translational errors were lower in the robot group compared to the conventional group for both components at all attempts for which rotational error differences were significant at every attempt. The conventional group's positioning remained inaccurate even with repeated attempts although procedure time improved. In comparison, by limiting inaccuracies inherent in conventional equipment, robotic assistance enabled surgeons to achieve precision and accuracy when positioning UKA components irrespective of their experience.

pub.1005078594,Optimizing Flexion After Total Knee Arthroplasty,"The clinical results with most modern total knee arthroplasty (TKA) designs are highly satisfactory regarding pain relief and improving walking ability. However, one problem that has not been addressed fully by most current designs is the ability to consistently achieve flexion greater than 120 degrees. Although the human knee is capable of flexion of more than 150 degrees, an analysis of the results of contemporary TKA reveals that on average, patients rarely flex beyond 120 degrees. Key factors influencing range of flexion after TKA include preoperative knee motion, surgical technique, prosthetic design, and rehabilitation. The success of any total knee system may in part be linked to its ability to optimally restore normal kinematic function. Some arthroplasty designs currently are available that incorporate modifications aimed at improving range of flexion, but limited data currently are available on their function and potential advantages. Currently, an in vitro experimental model incorporating robotics is being used to investigate the kinematics of the native knee and various TKA designs at flexion angles beyond 120 degrees. This robotic model in conjunction with clinical studies may provide an understanding of the limitations of contemporary knee designs regarding achieving higher degrees of knee flexion. This may lead to the refinement of existing designs and development of newer prostheses that may enhance the range of flexion that is achievable after TKA."
pub.1033760540,A patient-specific model of total knee arthroplasty to estimate patellar strain: A case study,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate patellar cut during total knee arthroplasty can lead to patellar complications due to increased bone strain. In this study, we evaluated patellar bone strain of a patient who had a deeper patellar cut than the recommended.
METHODS: A patient-specific model based on patient preoperative data was created. The model was decoupled into two levels: knee and patella. The knee model predicted kinematics and forces on the patella during squat movement. The patella model used these values to predict bone strain after total knee arthroplasty. Mechanical properties of the patellar bone were identified with micro-finite element modeling testing of cadaveric samples. The model was validated with a robotic knee simulator and postoperative X-rays. For this patient, we compared the deeper patellar cut depth to the recommended one, and evaluated patellar bone volume with octahedral shear strain above 1%.
FINDINGS: Model predictions were consistent with experimental measurements of the robotic knee simulator and postoperative X-rays. Compared to the recommended cut, the deeper cut increased the critical strain bone volume, but by less than 3% of total patellar volume.
INTERPRETATION: We thus conclude that the predicted increase in patellar strain should be within an acceptable range, since this patient had no complaints 8 months after surgery. This validated patient-specific model will later be used to address other questions on groups of patients, to eventually improve surgical planning and outcome of total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1132149168,Robotic-Assisted Patellofemoral Replacement—Correlation of Preoperative Planning with Intraoperative Implant Position and Early Clinical Experience: A Minimum 2-Year Follow-up,"Patello-femoral arthroplasty (PFA) is successful in a selected group of patients and yields a good functional outcome. Robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty has been shown to provide better implant positioning and alignment. We aim to report our early outcomes and to compare Mako's (Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopaedic System [RIO]) preoperative implant planning position to our intraoperative PFA implant position. Data for this study was prospectively collected for 23 (two bilateral) patients who underwent robotic-assisted PFA between April 2017 and May 2018. All preoperative implant position planning and postoperative actual implant position were recorded. Presence of trochlear dysplasia and functional outcome scores were also collected. There were 17 (two bilateral) female and 6 male patients with a mean age of 66.5 (range: 41-89) years. The mean follow-up period was 30 (range: 24-37) months. Eighteen knees (72%) had evidence of trochlear dysplasia. The anterior trochlear line was on average, 7.71 (range: 3.3-11.3) degrees, internally rotated to the surgical transepicondylar axis and on average 2.9 (range: 0.2-6.5) degrees internally rotated to the posterior condylar line. The preoperative planning range was 4-degree internal to 4-degree external rotation, 4-degree varus to 6-degree valgus, and 7-degree flexion to 3-degree extension. The average difference between preoperative planning and intraoperative implant position was 0.43 degrees for rotation (<i>r</i> = 0.93), 0.99 degrees for varus/valgus (<i>r</i> = 0.29), 1.26 degrees for flexion/extension (<i>r</i> = 0.83), and 0.34 mm for proudness (<i>r</i> = 0.80). Six patients (24%) had a different size component from their preoperative plan (<i>r</i> = 0.98). The mean preoperative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) was 16 and the mean postoperative OKS was 42. No patient had implant-related revision surgery or any radiological evidence of implant loosening at final follow-up. Our early results of robotic PFA are promising. Preoperative Mako planning correlates closely with intraoperative implant positioning. Longer follow-up is needed to assess long-term patient outcomes and implant survivorship."
pub.1121015772,When Can I Trust The Robot? An Algorithm for CT-Based Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been shown to demonstrate a variety of clinical benefits for patients, including reductions in dislocation rates, decreased impingement, and improved implant longevity. However, variability in surgeon experience with robotic systems can lead to inconsistent results. Mastery of the initial acetabular registration step is critical to performing a predictable and accurate robotic-assisted total hip replacement.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 100 consecutive patients who underwent unilateral THA with MAKOplasty®. From this data, we reviewed where errors in planning or registration occurred. These cases either required a repeat registration if the error was caught early, or the errors were realized on postoperative imaging when the x-ray did not match the preoperative plan. Subsequently, we developed an algorithm to ensure accurate registration and implemented its use on the next 100 cases, again reviewing the intraoperative case data and postoperative x-rays for any errors.
RESULTS: Initial analysis revealed that 87 of the first 100 cases were correctly registered, where postoperative acetabular cup position matched the plan on first attempt. Of the remaining 13 cases that had a registration error, eight cases were identified intra-operatively and re-registered. There were five cases where the postoperative x-ray did not match the plan despite a ""good"" registration. For incorrectly registered cases (N = 13), seven of 13 were found to exhibit a type I error (initial registration), while six of 13 demonstrated a type II error (fine point registration). Following the implementation of our registration algorithm, we were able to decrease the discrepancy between the preoperative plan (planning) and the postoperative x-rays (execution) from 13% to 0% of cases.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we present a detailed method to examine registration errors during robotic-navigated THA with MAKOplasty®. From this analysis, we were able to develop a successful algorithm that allows the surgeon to ensure correct registration and ultimately a postoperative x-ray that matches the preoperative plan. Our algorithm presents a principled approach that provides the surgeon and patient confidence in the safety and efficacy a roboticassisted total hip replacement."
pub.1103753180,Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Demonstrated Greater Accuracy and Precision to Plan Compared with Manual Techniques,"This study determined if robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) allows for more accurate and precise bone cuts and component position to plan compared with manual total knee arthroplasty (MTKA). Specifically, we assessed the following: (1) final bone cuts, (2) final component position, and (3) a potential learning curve for RATKA. On six cadaver specimens (12 knees), a MTKA and RATKA were performed on the left and right knees, respectively. Bone-cut and final-component positioning errors relative to preoperative plans were compared. Median errors and standard deviations (SDs) in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes were compared. Median values of the absolute deviation from plan defined the accuracy to plan. SDs described the precision to plan. RATKA bone cuts were as or more accurate to plan based on nominal median values in 11 out of 12 measurements. RATKA bone cuts were more precise to plan in 8 out of 12 measurements (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). RATKA final component positions were as or more accurate to plan based on median values in five out of five measurements. RATKA final component positions were more precise to plan in four out of five measurements (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). Stacked error results from all cuts and implant positions for each specimen in procedural order showed that RATKA error was less than MTKA error. Although this study analyzed a small number of cadaver specimens, there were clear differences that separated these two groups. When compared with MTKA, RATKA demonstrated more accurate and precise bone cuts and implant positioning to plan."
pub.1144165133,Proof of concept study for using UR10 robot to help total hip replacement,"BACKGROUND: The demand for total hip replacement (THR) for treating osteoarthritis has grown substantially worldwide. The existing robotic systems used in THR are invasive and costly. This study aims to develop a less-invasive and low-cost robotic system to assist THR surgery.
METHODS: A preliminary robotic reaming system was developed based on a UR10 robot equipped with a reamer to cut acetabulum. A novel approach was proposed to cut through a 5 mm hole in femur such that the operation is less invasive to the patients.
RESULTS: The average error of the cutting hemisphere by the robotic reaming system is 0.1182 mm which is smaller than the average result reaming by hand (0.1301 mm).
CONCLUSION: The robotic reaming can help make THR procedures less invasive and more accurate. Moreover, the system is expected to be significantly less expensive than the robotic systems available in the market at present."
pub.1047813150,Anteroposterior and rotational stability in fixed and mobile bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty: a cadaveric study using the robotic force sensor system,"PURPOSE: Different bearing designs in unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) have been developed in order to influence the rate of polyethylene wear. Increased anteroposterior translation and rotation after UKA has been hypothesized due to changes in joint surface geometry. The mobile bearing design was expected to show increased anteroposterior translation compared to the fixed bearing and biconcave bearing design.
METHODS: Six human cadaver knees were used for the tests. Anteroposterior and rotational knee stability was analysed in 0°, 30°, 60°, 90° and 120° of knee flexion using a robotic testing system (KR 125, KUKA Robots Augsburg, Germany). Three forces and moments were measured in a Cartesian coordinate system with a resolution of 1.0 N and 0.1 Nm.
RESULTS: There was no difference between the native knees and the knees after UKA in AP translation and rotation in all knee flexion angles. The factor knee flexion angle had a significant impact on the anterior translation when the type of bearing was neglected (p ≤ 0.015).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the natural knee stability in AP translation and rotation can be preserved in UKA. The preserved knee stability in different planes after UKA underlines the advantage of UKA when surgery is required in osteoarthritic changes of the medial compartment."
pub.1142698713,Can a Reduction in Revision Rates Make Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty Cost Neutral With Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty at Ten-Year Follow-Up? An Episode Cost Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Advocates of robotic total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) suggest that its greater cost may be recaptured through a reduction in revision rates. We sought to determine what reduction in revision TKA would be required for RTKA to become cost neutral with manual TKA (MTKA).
METHODS: Episode costs were determined for 2392 RTKAs and 2392 MTKAs. Mean total cost of revision TKA in our health system was identified. Episode cost difference of the RTKA and MTKA cohorts was divided by the mean cost of revision TKA to estimate the reduction in revisions required to make RTKA cost neutral with MTKA. The National Joint Registry was consulted to determine the cumulative revision rate for the implant used in this study.
RESULTS: Episode cost for the RTKA cohort was $5.7M greater than MTKA. Mean acute stay cost for revision TKA was $20,972, but post-acute costs were not available. If post-acute costs for revision TKA are conservatively estimated at 50% of episode cost (ie, episode cost = $41,944), 131 revision TKAs would need to be prevented in the RTKA cohort to make it cost neutral with MTKA. The National Joint Registry cumulative revision rate for this implant is 3.37% at 10 years, thus only 81 revisions would be expected per cohort.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that it is not possible for RTKA to achieve cost parity with MTKA through a reduction in revision rate alone. Future price reductions may make the cost comparison more favorable. In addition, demonstration of improved patient outcomes would undeniably add value to RTKA and change the analysis."
pub.1145731752,UKA with a handheld robotic device results in greater surgeon physiological stress than conventional instrumentation,"PURPOSE: Poor ergonomics and acute stress can impair surgical performance and cause work-related injuries. Robotic assistance may optimize these psychophysiological factors during UKA. This study compared surgeon physiologic stress and ergonomics during robotic-assisted UKA (rUKA) and conventional UKA (cUKA).
METHODS: Cardiorespiratory and postural data from a single surgeon were recorded during 30 UKAs, (15 rUKAs, 15 cUKAs). Heart rate (HR), HR variability, respiratory rate (RR), minute ventilation and calorie expenditure were used to measure surgical strain. Intraoperative ergonomics were assessed by measuring flexion/extension/rotation of the neck and lumbar spine, and shoulder abduction/adduction.
RESULTS: Mean operative time was 32.0 ± 7 min for cUKA and 45.9 ± 9 min for rUKA (p < 0.001). Mean neck flexion was - 23.4° ± 13° for rUKA and - 49.1° ± 18 for cUKA (p < 0.001), while mean lumbar flexion was - 20.3° ± 30° for rUKA and - 0.4° ± 68° for cUKA (p = 0.313). Mean lumbar flexion was similar; however, a significantly greater percentage of time was spent in lumbar flexion > 20° during cUKA. Bilateral shoulder abduction was significantly higher for rUKA. Mean calorie expenditure was 154 cal for rUKA and 89.1 cal for cUKA (p < 0.001). Mean HR was also higher for rUKA (88.7 vs. 84.7, p = 0.019). HR variability was slightly lower for rUKA (12.4) than for cUKA (13.4), although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.056). No difference in RR or minute ventilation was observed.
CONCLUSION: rUKA resulted in less neck flexion but increased shoulder abduction, heart rate, and energy expenditure. The theoretical ergonomic and physiologic advantages of robotic assistance using a handheld sculpting device were not realized in this study.

pub.1090389643,Robotic-arm assisted partial knee arthroplasty: a single centre experience,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: UKA has proven to be an effective surgical procedure, but its survivorship is still negatively affected by inaccuracy in component component positioning, implant and limb alignment. Robotic surgery has been introduced in order to minimize such technical errors. The aim of the present paper was to evaluate clinical and surgical outcomes after a 3 years' experience of robotic assisted UKA with the Mako Robotic Arm.
METHODS: Seventy-three patients undergoing  UKA with robotic instrumentation (65 medial UKAs, 8 lateral UKAs) and with a clinical follow-up of 3 -37 months were included in the present study. A complete clinical evaluation with KOOS, FJS-12 and SF-12 was administered to all patients pre and post operatively. Post-operative HKA angle and surgical time were also recorded.
RESULTS: Mean post-operative KOOS score was 81.32 (SD 17.19), while the mean FJS-12 score was 75.51 (SD 30.12) and the mean SF-12 Physical Score 42.25 (SD 9.97). 91% to 88% of post-operative results were considered satisfactory. Only 1 UKA failure was reported (1.3%) caused by peri-prosthetic infection. In medial UKAs mean postoperative HKA angle in extension was 3.9° varus (SD 2.5°), with no case of overcorrection; in lateral UKAs mean postoperative HKA angle in extension was 1.9° valgus (SD 1.9°) with 1 case (13%) of overcorrection. Mean skin to skin surgical time decreased from 83.2 minutes (SD 13.0) to 70.0 minutes (SD 10.9) along the learning curve.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic UKA has provided an improvement both in clinical and technical results, determining satisfactory clinical outcomes and a low risk of post-operative complications."
pub.1149063989,Isolated Lateral Tibiofemoral Compartment Osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: Lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an excellent option to alleviate disability and restore function in patients with lateral compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of the present study was to determine the survivorship and long-term outcomes in both younger/middle-aged and older patients with lateral compartment OA following non-robotically-assisted, fixed-bearing lateral UKA and to determine if an acceptable symptom state can be achieved.
METHODS: All patients were managed with fixed-bearing lateral UKA by a single surgeon utilizing a lateral parapatellar approach without robotic assistance. The primary outcome variables were the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Sport subscale scores. In addition, the other KOOS subscores, the Lysholm score, the achievement of the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS), and the Veterans RAND (VR-12) Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and Mental Component Summary score (MCS) were collected. Failure was defined as conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients were divided into 2 cohorts: younger/middle-aged patients (<60 years of age) and older patients (≥60 years of age).
RESULTS: A cohort of 256 patients underwent medial (n = 193) or lateral (n = 63) UKA. Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. At mean of 10 years (range, 4 to 17 years) of follow-up, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of any patient-reported outcome measures (p > 0.05). The percentage of patients in whom PASS was achieved on the KOOS ADL and Sport subscores was 82% and 88%, respectively, in the younger cohort and 80% and 80%, respectively, in the older cohort. The mean survival estimate of the prothesis was 15.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5 to 16.2 years) for the entire cohort. The estimated rate of implant survival in the younger cohort was 100% at 5 and 10 years, and the estimated rate of implant survival in the older cohort was 98% at 5 years and 96% at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Lateral fixed-bearing, non-robotic UKA for the treatment of isolated lateral compartment OA resulted in >80% of patients reaching an acceptable symptom state in terms of both activities of daily living and sporting activities. UKA provides an excellent option that provides longevity with high PASS rates and return to activities with a low risk of complications and failure.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to assess the learning curve associated with CN-THA, both tracking a surgeon's performance across initial cases and comparing their performance to manual THA (M-THA).MethodsA search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar on June 16, 2023 to find research articles published after January 1, 2000 (PROSPERO registration: CRD4202339403) that investigated the learning curve associated with CN-THA. 655 distinct articles were retrieved and subsequently screened for eligibility. In the final analysis, nine publications totaling 847 THAs were evaluated. The Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) tool was utilized to evaluate the potential for bias, with the mean MINORS score of 21.3 ± 1.2.ResultsCN-THA showed early advantages to M-THA for component placement accuracy and radiographic outcomes but longer operative times (+ 3− 20 min). There was a learning curve required to achieve peak proficiency in these metrics, though mixed methodologies made the required caseload unclear.ConclusionsCN-THA offers immediate advantages to M-THA for component placement accuracy and radiographic outcomes, though CN-THA’s advantages become more pronounced with experience. Surgeons should anticipate longer operative times during the learning curve for CN-THA, which lessen following a modest caseload. A more thorough evaluation of novel computer-navigated technologies would be enhanced by adopting a more uniform method of defining learning curves for outcomes of interest.Registration PROSPERO registration of the study protocol: CRD42023394031, 27 June 2023."
pub.1092198359,Patient Satisfaction Outcomes after Robotic Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Short-Term Evaluation,"Abstract
                  Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) presents a potential, new added value for orthopedic surgeons. In today's health care system, a major determinant of value can be assessed by patient satisfaction scores. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to analyze patient satisfaction outcomes between RATKA and manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Specifically, we used the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) to compare (1) pain scores, (2) physical function scores, and (3) total patient satisfaction outcomes in manual and RATKA patients at 6 months postoperatively. In this study, 28 cemented RATKAs performed by a single orthopedic surgeon at a high-volume institution were analyzed. The first 7 days were considered as an adjustment period along the learning curve. Twenty consecutive cemented RATKAs were matched and compared with 20 consecutive cemented manual TKAs performed immediately. Patients were administered a WOMAC satisfaction survey at 6 months postoperatively. Satisfaction scores between the two cohorts were compared and the data were analyzed using Student's t-tests. A p-value < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. The mean pain score, standard deviation (SD), and range for the manual and robotic cohorts were 5 ± 3 (range: 0–10) and 3 ± 3 (range: 0–8, p < 0.05), respectively. The mean physical function score, SD, and range for the manual and robotic cohorts were 9 ± 5 (range: 0–17) and 4 ± 5 (range, 0–14, p = 0.055), respectively. The mean total patient satisfaction score, SD, and range for the manual and robotic cohorts were 14 points (range: 0–27 points, SD: ± 8) and 7 ± 8 points (range: 0–22 points, p < 0.05), respectively. The results from this study further highlight the potential of this new surgical tool to improve short-term pain, physical function, and total satisfaction scores. Therefore, it appears that patients who undergo RATKA can expect better short-term outcomes when compared with patients who undergo manual TKA."

The ingrowth process is facilitated when the surgeon achieves a satisfactory fit for the prosthesis. Clinically or roentgenographically visible failure and persistent thigh pain after cementless THA remain significant problems, both of which may be alleviated by more precise preparation of the femoral canal and selection of an appropriately sized prosthesis. The objective of this study was to obtain an exact fit for the prosthesis through the use of an image-directed surgical robot for femoral canal preparation."

METHODS: Adult TKAs from 2012 to 2020 were queried from the American Joint Replacement Registry. A total of 1,121,457 patients were available for analysis for surgical features and 1,068,210 patients for analysis of outcomes. Mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association of race with each individual surgical feature (unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA)) and 30- and 90-day readmission. A proportional subdistribution hazard model was used to model the risk of revision TKA.
RESULTS: On multivariate analyses, compared to White patients, Black (odds ratio (OR): 0.52 P < .0001), Hispanic (OR 0.75 P < .001), and Native American (OR: 0.69 P = .0011) patients had lower rates of UKA, while only Black patients had lower rates of RA-TKA (OR = 0.76 P < .001). White (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.8, P < .001), Asian (HR = 0.51, P < .001), and Hispanic-White (HR = 0.73, P = .001) patients had a lower risk of revision TKA than Black patients. Asian patients had a lower revision risk than White (HR = 0.64, P < .001) and Hispanic-White (HR = 0.69, P = .011) patients. No significant differences existed between groups for 30- or 90-day readmissions.
CONCLUSION: Black, Hispanic, and Native American patients had lower rates of UKA compared to White patients, while Black patients had lower rates of RA-TKA compared to White, Asian, and Hispanic patients. Black patients also had higher rates of revision TKA than other races."
pub.1181394618,Patient-Specific Acetabular Safe Zones in Total Hip Arthroplasty: External Validation of a Quantitative Approach to Preoperatively Templating Spinopelvic Parameters,"Background: Spinopelvic mechanics are critical in total hip arthroplasty; however, there is no established consensus for adjusting acetabular component positioning based on spinopelvic parameters. This study aimed to (1) validate a recently developed Patient-Specific acetabular safe-zone calculator that factors in spinopelvic parameters and (2) compare differences with hip-spine classification targets.
Methods: A total of 3750 patients underwent primary total hip arthroplasty across 3 academic referral centers, with 33 (0.88%) requiring revision for instability. Spinopelvic parameters were measured before initial total hip arthroplasty, and acetabular component position was measured following the index and revision procedures. Most operations employed either computer navigation or robotic assistance (94%). Surgical approaches included both anterior and posterior techniques. Utilizing our recently developed patient-specific safe-zone calculator, theoretical intraoperative positions were calculated and compared to true component positions before and after revision.
Results: Among 33 patients who underwent revision, none dislocated at an average follow-up of 5.1 years. In the external validation cohort, the average absolute differences between the patient-specific safe-zone and the median hip-spine classification recommendation were 3.8° ± 2.1° inclination and 5.0° ± 3.2° version. For the pooled cohort, the absolute differences between the patient-specific safe-zone targets and the prerevision component positions were 7.9° ± 5.1° inclination and 11.4° ± 6.9° version. After revision, the mean absolute differences decreased to 3.6° ± 3.1° inclination and 5.8° ± 3.5° version (<i>P</i> &lt; .001).
Conclusions: A patient-specific approach improved acetabular component positioning accuracy within 6° of version and 4° of inclination of stable, revised hips. Patient-specific safe zones provide quantitative targets for nuanced spinopelvic preoperative planning that may mitigate risk of instability and may indicate use of assisted technologies."

All patients underwent the same intensive hospital rehabilitation program of 14 daily sessions lasting 3 h. The following rating scales were administered: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Knee Society Score (KSS) and 12-Item Short Form Survey scale. Patient assessments were performed 1 week post-surgery (T0), 1 month post-surgery (T2), and 3 months post-surgery (T3). The primary outcomes were active knee extension and flexion and pain severity. The secondary outcomes were functional capacity and quality of life.ResultsUsing repeated measures ANOVA, we observed at T1 a statistically different difference for the treatment group compared to the control group about KSS (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.05), and knee flexion (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed for knee extension (p = 0.09) and the SF-12 scale (p = 0.52). At T2 instead, we observed a statistically significant difference for the treatment group compared to the control group as regards KSS (p < 0.05) and knee flexion (p < 0.05), while no statistically significant difference was observed for pain (p = 0.83), knee extension (p = 0.60), and the SF-12 scale (0.44).ConclusionsOur study has demonstrated that robot-NAVIO assisted knee prosthesis surgery, associated with a specific intensive rehabilitation treatment, in the short and medium term, determines good pain control, better flexion recovery and a improvement of functional capacity."
pub.1171170797,Optimizing Acetabular Positioning: A Comprehensive Review of Contemporary Strategies in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a widely practiced surgical intervention to alleviate pain and reinstate functionality in individuals afflicted with hip joint pathology. The positioning of the acetabulum assumes paramount significance in determining the efficacy of THA, exerting profound influences on biomechanical dynamics, stability, and the durability of outcomes over time. This comprehensive review meticulously evaluates contemporary methodologies for optimizing acetabular positioning in THA, encompassing advanced technologies such as computer-assisted navigation systems, patient-specific instrumentation, robotic-assisted surgical approaches, image-based planning techniques, and intraoperative fluoroscopy. Crucially, key discoveries underscore the pivotal role of precise acetabular alignment in mitigating complications such as dislocation, component wear, and impingement. Moreover, the implications for clinical practice accentuate the imperative of continuous education and training to ensure effective deployment of sophisticated methodologies. Recommendations for furthering research and enhancing practice development underscore the necessity of scrutinizing long-term prognoses, assessing cost-effectiveness, and embracing technological innovations perpetually refining THA outcomes. Collaborative endeavors among researchers, practitioners, and industry stakeholders emerge as indispensable drivers of advancement in this domain, fostering an environment conducive to elevating the standard of care for individuals undergoing THA."
pub.1169119092,Validating a Novel 2D to 3D Knee Reconstruction Method on Preoperative Total Knee Arthroplasty Patient Anatomies,"BACKGROUND: As advanced technology continues to evolve, incorporating robotics into surgical procedures has become imperative for precision and accuracy in preoperative planning. Nevertheless, the integration of three-dimensional (3D) imaging into these processes presents both financial considerations and potential patient safety concerns. This study aims to assess the accuracy of a novel 2D-to-3D knee reconstruction solution, RSIP XPlan.ai™ (RSIP Vision, Jerusalem, Israel), on preoperative total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patient anatomies.
METHODS: Accuracy was calculated by measuring the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between X-ray-based 3D bone models generated by the algorithm and corresponding CT bone segmentations (distances of each mesh vertex to the closest vertex in the second mesh). The RMSE was computed globally for each bone, locally for eight clinically relevant bony landmark regions, and along simulated bone cut contours. In addition, the accuracies of three anatomical axes were assessed by comparing angular deviations to inter- and intra-observer baseline values.
RESULTS: The global RMSE was 0.93 ± 0.25 mm for the femur and 0.88 ± 0.14 mm for the tibia. Local RMSE values for bony landmark regions were 0.51 ± 0.33 mm for the five femoral landmarks and 0.47 ± 0.17 mm for the three tibial landmarks. The RMSE along simulated cut contours was 0.75 ± 0.35 mm for the distal femur cut and 0.63 ± 0.27 mm for the proximal tibial cut. Anatomical axial average angular deviations were 1.89° for the trans epicondylar axis (with an inter- and intra-observer baseline of 1.43°), 1.78° for the posterior condylar axis (with a baseline of 1.71°), and 2.82° (with a baseline of 2.56°) for the medial-lateral transverse axis.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings demonstrate promising results regarding the accuracy of XPlan.ai™ in reconstructing 3D bone models from plain-film X-rays. The observed accuracy on real-world TKA patient anatomies in anatomically relevant regions, including bony landmarks, cut contours, and axes, suggests the potential utility of this method in various clinical scenarios. Further validation studies on larger cohorts are warranted to fully assess the reliability and generalizability of our results. Nonetheless, our findings lay the groundwork for potential advancements in future robotic arthroplasty technologies, with XPlan.ai™ offering a promising alternative to conventional CT scans in certain clinical contexts."
pub.1148581470,"Robotic-assisted surgery and kinematic alignment in total knee arthroplasty (RASKAL study): a protocol of a national registry-nested, multicentre, 2×2 factorial randomised trial assessing clinical, intraoperative, functional, radiographic and survivorship outcomes","INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) and kinematic alignment (KA) are being increasingly adopted to improve patient outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). There is uncertainty around the individual or combined effect of these concepts compared with computer-assisted surgery (CAS) and mechanical alignment (MA), respectively. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of RAS, KA or both to improve clinical outcomes, functional measures, radiographic precision and prosthetic survivorship when compared with current gold standards of surgical care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A national registry-nested, multicentre, double-blinded, 2×2 factorial, randomised trial will be undertaken with 300 patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA performed by 15 surgeons. The primary outcome will be the between-group differences in postoperative change over 2 years in the mean Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS-12), comparing first, RAS to CAS as its control, and second, KA to MA as its control. Secondary outcomes will include other knee-specific and general health patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), intraoperative pressure loads as a measure of soft tissue balance, 6-month postoperative functional outcomes, radiological precision using CT imaging, complications and long-term prosthetic survivorship. The contribution of each patient's unique coronal plane alignment of the knee phenotype to primary and secondary PROMs will be investigated. OMERACT-OARSI criteria and Patient Acceptable Symptom State outcome score thresholds for the KOOS-12 and Oxford Knee Score will be used in secondary analyses. Primary intention-to-treat and secondary per-protocol analyses will be performed. Statistical analysis will include a generalised linear mixed model for repeated measures for continuous KOOS-12 scores. Kaplan-Meier estimates with adjusted HRs of implant survivorship will be calculated.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from Sydney Local Health District-Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (Approval X20-0494 and 2020/ETH02896 10.24/DEC20). Results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented in national, state and international meetings.

pub.1147510438,Treatment of Medial Collateral Ligament Injury During Total Knee Arthroplasty With Internal Suture Brace Augmentation: A Cadaveric and Biomechanical Study.,"Intraoperative medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a serious complication. External bracing and/or conversion to a constrained implant has previously been studied. The technique of using an internal high-strength suture brace to augment an MCL repair has been evaluated in the nonarthroplasty patient and could provide an alternate solution. The goal of this study was to determine whether MCL repair with internal suture bracing restores stability of the implanted knee joint. A robotic simulator completed laxity testing on 5 cadaveric knee specimens in 4 sequential phases: (1) intact knee, (2) after implantation with TKA, (3) after sectioning of the MCL, and (4) after MCL repair with suture brace augmentation. Laxity was compared between the different test phases throughout range of motion. Subsequently, the internal brace was tested to failure under valgus load. The MCL repair with internal bracing was effective at restoring laxity in varus-valgus, internal-external, and medial-lateral degrees of freedom through midflexion, with limited support at deeper flexion angles and in anterior-posterior laxity. Rotational laxity was not significantly different than intact knee laxity. Generally, medial-lateral translations were less and anterior-posterior translations were greater and were significantly different at 30° to 45° and 90°, respectively. The mean failure moment was 46.4±9.1 Nm, with the primary mode of failure being MCL repair. Primary MCL repair with internal bracing using a high-strength suture augment showed the potential to provide adequate stability and strength to correct MCL incompetence in TKA without the use of an external knee brace or constrained implants.

pub.1132395842,Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty vs Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Nationwide Database Study,"BACKGROUND: As robot-assisted equipment is continuously being used in orthopaedic surgery, the past few decades have seen an increase in the usage of robotics for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Thus, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the differences between robotic TKA and nonrobotic TKA on perioperative and postoperative complications and opioid consumption.
METHODS: An administrative database was queried from 2010 to Q2 of 2017 for primary TKAs performed via robot-assisted surgery vs non-robot-assisted surgery. Systemic and joint complications and average morphine milligram equivalents were collected and compared with statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Patients in the nonrobotic TKA cohort had higher levels of prosthetic revision at 1-year after discharge (<i>P</i> &lt; .05) and higher levels of manipulation under anesthesia at 90 days and 1-year after discharge (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). Furthermore, those in the nonrobotic TKA cohort had increased occurrences of deep vein thrombosis, altered mental status, pulmonary embolism, anemia, acute renal failure, cerebrovascular event, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and urinary tract infection during the inpatient hospital stay (all <i>P</i> &lt; .05) and at 90 days after discharge (all <i>P</i> &lt; .05). All of these categories remained statistically increased at the 90-days postdischarge date, except pneumonia and stroke. Patients in the nonrobotic TKA cohort had higher levels of average morphine milligram equivalents consumption at all time periods measured (<i>P</i> &lt; .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the use of robotics for TKA found lower revision rates, lower incidences of manipulation under anesthesia, decreased occurrence of systemic complications, and lower opiate consumption for postoperative pain management. Future studies should look to further examine the long-term outcomes for patients undergoing robot-assisted TKA.

pub.1135172331,Robotic‐arm assisted total knee arthroplasty is associated with improved accuracy and patient reported outcomes: a systematic review and meta‐analysis,"This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to compare the accuracy of component positioning, alignment and balancing techniques employed, patient-reported outcomes, and complications of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) with manual TKA (mTKA) and the associated learning curve. Searches of PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar were performed in October 2020 using PRISMA guidelines. Search terms included ""robotic"", ""knee"" and ""arthroplasty"". The criteria for inclusion were published clinical research articles reporting the learning curve for RATKA and those comparing the component position accuracy, alignment and balancing techniques, functional outcomes, or complications with mTKA. There were 198 articles identified, following full text screening, 16 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria and reported the learning curve of rTKA (n=5), component positioning accuracy (n=6), alignment and balancing techniques (n=7), functional outcomes (n=7), or complications (n=5). Two studies reported the learning curve using CUSUM analysis to establish an inflexion point for proficiency which ranged from 7 to 11 cases and there was no learning curve for component positioning accuracy. The meta-analysis showed a significantly lower difference between planned component position and implanted component position, and the spread was narrower for RATKA compared with the mTKA group (Femur coronal: mean 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.55, p<0.00001; Tibia coronal: mean 1.56, 95% CI 1.32-1.81, p<0.00001). Three studies reported using different alignment and balancing techniques between mTKA and RATKA, two studies used the same for both group and two studies did not state the methods used in their RATKA groups. RATKA resulted in better Knee Society Score compared to mTKA in the short-to-mid-term follow up (95%CI [- 1.23,  - 0.51], p=0.004). There was no difference in arthrofibrosis, superficial and deep infection, wound dehiscence, or overall complication rates. RATKA demonstrated improved accuracy of component positioning and patient-reported outcomes. The learning curve of RATKA for operating time was between 7 and 11 cases. Future well-powered studies on RATKAs should report on the knee alignment and balancing techniques utilised to enable better comparisons on which techniques maximise patient outcomes.Level of evidence III."

Eighty-eight patients who underwent TKA were randomly assigned to a robot-assisted rehabilitation or traditional therapy group. The patients in the control group were treated with traditional manual rehabilitation therapy, while the patients in the experimental group were subjected to the robot-assisted rehabilitation program. Range of motion of the knee joint, Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Rating Score, and the modified Barthel Index were assessed on the first or second day after TKA (preintervention) and the discharge day (postintervention). Additionally, the length of hospital stay and related hospitalization expenses of the two groups were collected on the discharge day. Improvements in the active range of motion (p < 0.001), passive range of motion (p = 0.001), Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Rating Score (p < 0.001), and modified Barthel Index score (p = 0.004) were significantly better in the robot-assisted rehabilitation group than in the traditional therapy group. Interestingly, the length of hospital stay in the experimental group (9 days) was shorter than that in the control group (13 days), and the total cost of hospitalization was lower (p = 0.002). The robot-assisted rehabilitation training program is an effective intervention that significantly improves the daily activity ability and knee function of older adults following TKA."
pub.1149577871,Evaluation of Blood Loss in Conventional vs MAKOplasty Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: Primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been historically associated with considerable blood loss. Allogenic transfusions, the standard of care for blood loss following TKA, carry inherent risks. With the expanding use of robotic technology in TKA, one theoretical advantage is decreased blood loss and postoperative blood transfusions requirements. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative hemoglobin levels and the percentage of patients requiring a transfusion of allogenic packed red blood cells after conventional TKA (CTKA) vs robot-assisted TKA (RATKA).
Methods: This is a retrospective review of 486 consecutive patients undergoing either CTKA or RATKA between October 30, 2018, and June 25, 2020, by a single fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeon. Mako SmartRobotics (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI) was used for RATKA cases. Primary outcomes included preoperative vs postoperative hemoglobin values and postoperative blood transfusion rates between the 2 groups.
Results: The mean hemoglobin on postoperative day 1 was 10.7 gm/dl (±1.3) in the CTKA group and 10.9 gm/dl (±1.3) in the RATKA group, <i>P</i> = .24. The largest decline in hemoglobin from preoperative to within 2 days postoperatively was 3.1 gm/dl (±1.1) in the CTKA group and 3.1 gm/dl (±1.1) in the RATKA group, <i>P</i> = .92. The percentage of patients requiring a blood transfusion was 1.1% in the CTKA group and 1.3% in the RATKA group, <i>P</i> = .79.
Conclusions: RATKA and CTKA groups did not have significant differences in postoperative hemoglobin changes or the need for postoperative blood transfusions."

Still, questions remain on the clinical benefit of this technology.
METHODS: The purposes of the ongoing study were (1) to report on minimum 5-year outcomes in patients who underwent robotic-assisted primary THA (rTHA), (2) to compare those outcomes to a propensity score-matched manual primary THA (mTHA) control group, and (3) to compare radiographic measures between the groups regarding acetabular cup placement. Prospectively collected patient data were retrospectively reviewed for primary THA recipients during June 2008 to July 2013. Patients with minimum 5-year follow-up for Harris Hip Score, Forgotten Joint Score-12, Veterans RAND-12 Mental, Veterans RAND-12 Physical, 12-Item Short Form Survey Mental, 12-Item Short Form Survey Physical, visual analog scale, and satisfaction were included. Patient-reported outcomes, cup placement, and revision rate of the rTHA group were compared with those of a propensity score-matched mTHA control group.
RESULTS: Sixty-six rTHAs were matched to 66 mTHAs. The rTHA group reported significantly higher Harris Hip Score, Forgotten Joint Score-12, Veterans RAND-12 Physical, and 12-Item Short Form Survey Physical (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.002, P = 0.001). The acetabular implant placement by rTHA had a 9 and 4.7-fold reduced risk of placement outside the Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones, respectively (relative risk, 0.11 [95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.46]; P = 0.002; relative risk, 0.21 [95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.47]; P = 0.001). In addition, rTHA recipients had lesser absolute values of leg length discrepancy and global offset (P = 0.091, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received rTHA reported favorable outcomes at minimum 5-year follow-up. Furthermore, in comparison to a propensity score pair-matched mTHA group, rTHAs reported higher patient-reported outcome scores and had 89% reduced risk of acetabular implant placement beyond the Lewinnek safe zone and 79% reduced risk of placement beyond the Callanan safe zone.

pub.1042862798,Cruciate-retaining and cruciate-substituting total knee arthroplasty: An in vitro comparison of the kinematics under muscle loads,"The kinematics of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)-retaining (PCR) and PCL-substituting (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were compared directly in a robotic, in vitro study, and the forces in the PCL and cam-spine mechanism were measured from 0 degrees to 120 degrees of flexion. The forces in the PCL after PCR TKA and in cam-spine contact after PS TKA increased only at a flexion of > or =90 degrees. Posterior translation of the lateral femoral condyle was significantly greater than translation of the medial femoral condyle in the intact knees, consistent with femoral rollback and internal tibial rotation. The PCR and PS TKAs partially restored these kinematics when the knee flexed >60 degrees (ie, when the forces increased in the PCL and cam-spine mechanism), whereas the PCL-deficient TKA failed to do so. The results reflect the importance of the PCL and cam-spine mechanism after PCL retention and substitution in TKA and confirm the necessity for either one, if knee kinematics are to be restored even partially."
pub.1134090012,New Technologies in Knee Arthroplasty: Current Concepts,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment for severe osteoarthritis. Despite good survival rates, up to 20% of TKA patients remain dissatisfied. Recently, promising new technologies have been developed in knee arthroplasty, and could improve the functional outcomes. The aim of this paper was to present some new technologies in TKA, their current concepts, their advantages, and limitations. The patient-specific instrumentations can allow an improvement of implant positioning and limb alignment, but no difference is found for functional outcomes. The customized implants are conceived to reproduce the native knee anatomy and to reproduce its biomechanics. The sensors have to aim to give objective data on ligaments balancing during TKA. Few studies are published on the results at mid-term of these two devices currently. The accelerometers are smart tools developed to improve the TKA alignment. Their benefits remain yet controversial. The robotic-assisted systems allow an accurate and reproducible bone preparation due to a robotic interface, with a 3D surgical planning, based on preoperative 3D imaging or not. This promising system, nevertheless, has some limits. The new technologies in TKA are very attractive and have constantly evolved. Nevertheless, some limitations persist and could be improved by artificial intelligence and predictive modeling."

This retrospective study explored whether RUKA has more favorable overall outcomes than conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (CUKA). A total of 158 patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis were recruited, of which 85 had undergone RUKA with the Mako system and 73 had undergone CUKA. The accuracy of component positioning and bone anatomical alignment was compared using preoperative and postoperative radiograph. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using questionnaires, which the patients completed preoperatively and then postoperatively at six months, one year, and two years. In total, 52 patients from the RUKA group and 61 from the CUKA group were eligible for analysis. The preoperative health scores and Kellgren-Lawrence scores were higher in the RUKA group. RUKA exhibited higher implant positioning accuracy, thus providing a superior femoral implant angle, properly aligned implant placement, and a low rate of overhang. RUKA also achieved higher accuracy in bone anatomical alignment (tibial axis angle and anatomical axis angle) than CUKA, but surgical time was longer, and blood loss was greater. No significant differences were observed in the clinical outcomes of the two procedures."

Femoral coronal and sagittal angles (FCA, FSA), tibial coronal and sagittal angles (TCA, TSA), and implant overhang were radiologically measured to identify outliers.
RESULTS: When assessing the accuracy of RAUKAs, 91.6% of all alignment measurements and 99.2% of all overhang measurements were within the target range. All alignment and overhang targets were simultaneously met in 68.6% of RAUKAs. When comparing radiological outcomes between the RAUKA and MUKA groups, statistically significant differences were identified for combined outliers in FCA (2.3% vs 12.6%; p = 0.006), FSA (17.4% vs 50.2%; p < 0.001), TCA (5.8% vs 41.5%; p < 0.001), and TSA (8.1% vs 18.6%; p = 0.023), as well as anterior (0.0% vs 4.7%; p = 0.042), posterior (1.2% vs 13.4%; p = 0.001), and medial (1.2% vs 14.2%; p < 0.001) overhang outliers.
CONCLUSION: Robotic system navigation decreases alignment and overhang outliers compared to manual UKA. Given the association between component placement errors and revision in UKA, this strong significant improvement in accuracy may improve implant survival.

pub.1164875183,Relationship between femoral component placement and patient-specific anatomical rotational landmarks in robotic arm assisted total knee Arthroplasty- a multicentric study,"Introduction: Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common problem in the elderly, leading to severe morbidity. Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a widely validated surgery to provide a remarkable extent of knee function and simultaneously alleviates pain for knee osteoarthritis (OA). It is clearly understood that precision of the rotational alignment and accuracy of the technique in the placement of the femoral component is a prerequisite for excellent and successful outcomes of TKA. Advanced technology has now allowed surgeons to understand patient-specific variabilities in anatomical reference landmarks and the relationship of component positioning in relation to the reference landmarks to achieve accurate gap balancing with minimal soft tissue release.<sup>14</sup> Robotic Arm Assisted-Total Knee Arthroplasty (RAA-TKA) is a semi-automated system that enables us in replicating the same. Using this technology, the bony resections, component positions, probable component sizing and gap balancing can be tentatively planned preoperatively with CT Scan Analysis and executed intraoperatively. Hence this study was undertaken to estimate the relationship between femoral component placement to normal rotational landmarks such as the Posterior Condylar Axis (PCA) and to quantitatively evaluate coronal and sagittal plane correction obtained. Also, we aimed to use the data to detect any anatomical variations in the study population and evaluate the accuracy of predicted component sizing, including gender-based evaluation.
Materials and methods: A Prospective Observational Study of 1073 knees of patients of either sex above 50 years of age with Kellgren Lawrence Grade 4 Osteoarthritis of the knee which were confirmed with X-Ray undergoing RAA-TKA using MAKO Robotic System using Stryker Triathlon (Cruciate Substituting) CS Knee was conducted during the period between 2022 and 2023 in two South Indian hospitals specializing in joint replacement surgeries.
Results: We found a statistically significant difference between the native Posterior Condylar Axis (PCA) (4.82 ± 2.15°) and final femoral component external rotation (3.24 ± 1.29°) with a p-value of &lt;0.001 at 95% confidence interval. The accuracy of component size prediction was 99.8%. Also, analysis in our study has shown the most common implant sizes to be 4 in males and 2 in females. We also found no statistically significant difference based on age, size, laterality, or primary varus deformity.
Conclusions: RAA-TKA provides patient-specific alignment/restricted kinematic alignment which might further enhance the outcome for the patient. Reliable deformity correction in coronal and sagittal planes can be achieved. Accurate flexion and extension gap balancing can be done through component placement and with minimal soft tissue dissection. Irrespective of all the advantages noted in RAA-TKA, further follow-up and long-term outcome studies are required to properly gauge and analyze this new technology."
pub.1139698717,Assistive technologies in knee arthroplasty: fashion or evolution? Rate of publications and national registries prove the Scott Parabola wrong,"PurposeMost opponents of assistive technologies in orthopedic surgery consider them as a marketing ruse or fashion. Our hypothesis was that many innovations in modern knee arthroplasty are not following the Scott Parabola. This parabola represents the visual curve of a procedure or therapy showing great promise at the beginning, becoming the standard treatment after reports of encouraging results, only to fall into disuse due to adverse outcome reports. This study aimed to assess the interest in these assistive technologies by (1) their number of publications/year and (2) their actual surgical use reported in the National Joint Registries.MethodsThe search was performed through PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases from 1997 to 2021 inclusive to identify all available literature that described the use and results of assistive technologies or new surgical techniques in knee arthroplasty. In the Australian and Norwegian registries, the number of cases performed with these techniques in knee arthroplasty has been quantified year by year.ResultsFollowing the initial online search, a total of 4085 articles was found. After the assessment mentioned above, 2106 articles were included in the study. The orthopedic techniques assessed in this study are not following the “Scott’s parabola” in the literature. Computer-assisted knee arthroplasty and patient-specific instrumentation have increased quickly to have reached a plateau, with a stable number of publications over the last 6 years. The number of publications concerning robotic surgery, accelerometers and sensors continue to rise. In the Australian registry, the proportion of primary TKA performed by computer-assisted systems increased from 2.4% in 2003 to 32% in 2019. In the Norwegian registry, the proportion of computer-assisted TKA remained between 8 and 12% of primary TKA since 2007.ConclusionMost of the innovations in modern knee arthroplasty are not following the Scott Parabola. After a fast rise, these techniques do not disappear but continue to evolve. Their evolution is synergistic, and techniques appeared to be linked to each other’s. Despite persisting concerns about the cost-efficiency of assisting technologies in knee arthroplasties, the interest and use do not decrease and seems to be directly linked to an exponential increase in interest for a better understanding of alignment targets and improved functional recovery."
pub.1134902513,Periprosthetic Fractures Through Tracking Pin Sites Following Computer Navigated and Robotic Total and Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Use of computer-assisted navigation (CAN) and robotic-assisted (RA) surgery in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) both necessitate the use of tracking pins rigidly fixed to the femur and tibia. Although periprosthetic fractures through tracking pin sites are rare, there is a paucity of literature on this potential complication. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the current literature to assess the incidence and clinical outcomes of periprosthetic fractures through tracking pin sites following CAN and RA TKA and UKA.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases in April 2020. Studies were assessed for the presence of pin site fractures, fracture characteristics, and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Seventeen clinical studies (5 case series, 1 cohort study, and 11 case reports) involving 29 pin-related fractures were included for review. The overall incidence ranged from 0.06% to 4.8%. The mean time from index arthroplasty to fracture was 9.5 weeks (range, 0 to 40 weeks). The majority of fractures occurred in the femoral diaphysis (59%). Nineteen fractures (66%) were displaced and 10 (34%) were nondisplaced or occult. The majority of cases were atraumatic in nature or involved minor trauma and were typically preceded by persistent leg pain. A transcortical pin trajectory, large pin diameter (>4 mm), diaphyseal fixation, multiple placement attempts, and the use of non-self-drilling, non-self-tapping pins were the most commonly reported risk factors for pin-related periprosthetic fractures following CAN or RA TKA.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion for pin-related fractures in patients with ongoing leg or thigh pain after CAN or RA TKA in order to avoid fracture displacement and additional morbidity. As CAN and RA TKA have unique complication risks, the debate regarding the value of technology-assisted TKA and its cost-effectiveness continues.

pub.1164723751,Patient-reported and radiographic outcomes of a porous-coated acetabular cup in robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty at 2-year follow up,"Introduction: Several implant manufacturers have developed ultra-porous metal substrate acetabular components recently. Despite this, data on clinical and radiographic outcomes remain limited. Our study evaluated postoperative patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and radiographic analyses in patients fitted with a novel acetabular porous-coated component.
Methods: A total of 152 consecutive patients underwent a total hip arthroplasty by a single orthopaedic surgeon. All patients underwent surgery utilizing the same CT-scan based robotic-assisted device with the same porous cementless acetabular shell. They received standardized postoperative physical therapy, rehabilitation, and pain protocols. Preoperatively, first postoperative visit, 6-months, 1-year, and 2-years, patients were evaluated based on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, physical function, and total scores; 2) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-10 physical and mental scores; 3) Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)-Jr scores; as well as 4) acetabular component positions and 5) evidence of acetabular component loosening.
Results: Significant improvements were observed by 6 months in WOMAC pain, physical function, and total scores (p < 0.05), maintained at 1 and 2 years. PROMIS-10 physical scores also improved significantly from preoperative to 6 months postoperative and remained so at 1 and 2 years postoperative (p < 0.05). No significant changes were found in PROMIS-10 mental scores. HOOS-Jr scores significantly improved from preoperative to 6 months postoperative and remained so through 2 years (p < 0.05). At 6 months, slight changes were noted in abduction angle and horizontal and vertical offset. Radiolucencies, initially found in 3 shells, reduced to 1 shell with 2 new radiolucencies by 6 months, and remained stable with no subsequent operative interventions. At 1 year and 2 years, no radiographic abnormalities were noted, including complete resolution of prior radiolucencies as well as stable components.
Conclusion: This porous cementless acetabular shell, implanted with CT-scan-based robotic-assisted techniques, demonstrated excellent postoperative PROMs at 2 years. Stable radiolucencies suggest good component stability. The early stable clinical and radiographic results suggest promising long-term outcomes with this device.

pub.1164164387,Perioperative safety and efficacy of robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty in ERAS-managed patients: a pilot study,"AimsRobot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) boasts superior accuracy in implant placement, but there is a lack of effective assessment in perioperative management in the context of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of rTHA versus conventional total hip arthroplasty (cTHA) in ERAS-managed patients.MethodsIn this prospective trial, a total of 60 eligible patients aged between 18 and 80 years were randomly divided into two groups to undergo either rTHA or cTHA. The primary outcomes included blood loss parameters. Secondary outcomes were the duration of the operation, surgical time, WOMAC pain score, WOMAC stiffness score, WOMAC physical function score, Harris score, and postoperative complications.ResultsThe study cohort analyzed 59 eligible participants, 30 of whom underwent rTHA and 29 of whom underwent cTHA. Analysis could not be conducted for one patient due to severe anemia. Notably, the cTHA group had a significantly shorter surgical time than the rTHA group (69.49 ± 18.97 vs. 104.20 ± 19.63 min, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the rTHA and cTHA groups for blood loss parameters, including total blood loss (1280.30 ± 404.01 vs. 1094.86 ± 494.39 ml, P = 0.137) and drainage volume (154.35 ± 121.50 vs. 159.13 ± 135.04 ml, P = 0.900), as well as intraoperative blood loss (126.67 ± 38.80 vs. 118.52 ± 60.68 ml, P = 0.544) and hidden blood loss (982.43 ± 438.83 vs. 784.00 ± 580.96 ml, P = 0.206). Only one patient in the cTHA group required allogeneic blood transfusion. At 3 months postoperatively, both groups showed improvements in WOMAC pain score, WOMAC stiffness score, WOMAC physical function score, and Harris score, with no significant differences found between the two groups. Few complications were reported in both groups without significant differences.ConclusionsDespite the longer surgical time, rTHA did not negatively affect blood loss, pain, or functional recovery or lead to an increased risk of complications in ERAS-managed patients, suggesting that rTHA can be safely and effectively incorporated into an ERAS program for primary THA."
pub.1134952593,Initial Experience with the NAVIO Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Replacement—Coronal Alignment Accuracy and the Learning Curve,"One of the primary aim of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is restoration of the mechanical axis of the lower limb. Maintenance of the mechanical axis within 3 degrees of neutral has been shown to result in improved clinical results and implant longevity. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of this robotic-assisted system in coronal plane component positioning in TKA. We also describe the learning curve associated with adoption of this technology. A total of 72 total knee replacements were completed between November 2017 and September 2018 by a single surgeon using the robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system. Cases were recorded from the time the study surgeon first adopted this technology and represent the ""learning curve."" Pre- and postoperative coronal weight-bearing alignments were measured and intraoperative robotic-assisted registration data and duration of use were collected. Of the 72 TKAs in this series, 93.3% were corrected to the desired alignment of within 3 degrees of neutral. The knees that were not corrected to neutral had a mean preoperative alignment of 11.57 degrees of deformity as compared with 4.29 degrees for those that were corrected to neutral. A learning curve effect during adoption of this new technology was not found when analyzing RAS usage time. The RAS system produced accurate coronal alignment in TKA in more than 93% of cases with no learning curve effect. Our study suggests that this system is easily adopted, safe, and accurate."
pub.1064455166,Active constraint control for image-guided robotic surgery,"The concept of active constraint control for image-guided robotic surgery is introduced, together with its benefits and a short outline of its history. The clinical use of active constraint control in orthopaedic surgery is discussed, together with the outcomes of a clinical trial for unicondylar knee replacement surgery. The evolution of the robotic design from large costly structures towards simpler, more cost-effective systems is also presented, leading to the design of the Acrobot 'Sculptor' system. A new approach to the achievement of robotic total knee replacement is also presented, in which a high-speed rotary cutter is used to slice through the bone to achieve a speedy resection. The control concept is presented, together with the results of trials on animal bones and a cadaver, showing that it is possible to remove large quantities of bone both quickly and accurately."
pub.1143980660,Does robotic-assisted surgery improve outcomes of total hip arthroplasty compared to manual technique? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an emerging technology that claims to position implants with very high accuracy. However, there is currently limited data in literature on whether this improved accuracy leads to better long-term clinical outcomes. This systematic review compares the outcomes of THA done with the help of robotic assistance (RA) to those done with conventional manual techniques (MTs).
METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for eligible articles that directly compared robot-assisted THA to manual THA and had data on the radiological or clinical outcomes of both. Data on various outcome parameters were collected. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: A total of 17 articles were found eligible for inclusion, and 3600 cases were analysed. Mean operating time in the RA group was significantly longer than in the MT group. RA resulted in significantly more acetabular cups being placed inside Lewinnek's and Callanan's safe zones (p<0.001) and had significantly reduced limb length discrepancy compared with MT. There were no statistically significant differences in the two groups in terms of incidence of perioperative complications, need for revision surgery and long-term functional outcome.
CONCLUSION: RA leads to highly accurate implant placement and leads to significantly reduced limb length discrepancies. However, the authors do not recommend robot-assisted techniques for routine THAs due to lack of adequate long-term follow-up data, prolonged surgical times and no significant differences in the rate of complications and implant survivorship compared with conventional MTs."
pub.1126149301,A retrospective study comparing a single surgeon's experience on manual versus robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty after the learning curve of the latter procedure – A cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) has the potential of improving cup positioning. However, there is an associated learning curve with robot. This study aimed to determine one surgeon's learning curve with robot-assisted THA and whether robot could achieve similar accuracy in cup positioning as manual THA.
METHODS: The first 100 robot-assisted THA operated by one experienced surgeon on manual THA was respectively reviewed. The operating time and robotic complications were recorded to calculate the learning curve through cumulative summation analysis. The demographics, operating time, cup positioning, leg length discrepancy, hip offset, robotic complications and hip Harris score between proficient robot-assisted THA and manual THA in the same period were also compared.
RESULTS: The average operating time of robot-assisted THA was 95.92 ± 15.64 min, ranging from 68 to 145 min. Robot-assisted THA was associated with a learning curve of 14 cases for operating time. The duration of acetabular registration and cup implantation between two phases (1-14 and 15-100 case) had significant differences. There were 92% proficient robot-assisted THA and 82% manual THA respectively locating within the Lewinnek's safe zone. The variation of inclinations in proficient robot-assisted THA was significantly less than that in manual THA.
CONCLUSION: In the surgeon's series, it took 14 cases' learning curve to be proficient in robot-assisted THA. In the proficiency phase, robot had an advantage in cup positioning than manual technique."
pub.1112073867,Robotic‐assisted unicompartmental knee replacement offers no early advantage over conventional unicompartmental knee replacement,"PURPOSE: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is effective for treating degenerative joint disease in a single compartment. Robotic-arm-assisted arthroplasty (RAA) has gained popularity and has theoretical benefits of improved outcomes over conventional (CONV) UKA due to the technical precision of bone preparation. This study compares the short-term clinical outcomes, including survivorship and patient-reported functional outcomes, for a series of medial UKAs performed with RAA and CONV.
METHODS: One hundred seventy-six consecutive fixed-bearing medial UKAs were retrospectively identified with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. One hundred and eighteen CONV and 58 RAA were performed. Pre- and post-operative SF12, WOMAC, and KSS Functional Questionnaires were available for all patients.
RESULTS: At 2 years, both groups improved in all functional outcomes, with no significant difference between the RAA and CONV cohorts. However, the RAA cohort had a significantly longer operative time (p < 0.001) and a higher early revision rate than the CONV group (7 [12.0%] vs. 7 [6.8%]; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that at short-term follow-up of 2 years, RAA was not superior to CONV in terms of functional scores and instead was associated with greater operative time and cost and lower survivorship. Therefore, at this time usage of RAA in UKA is not recommended compared to conventional UKA. Longer term studies are necessary to draw conclusions about the overall outcomes of RAA compared to CONV.

pub.1063354495,Early experiences with robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty using the DigiMatch™ ROBODOC® surgical system.,"INTRODUCTION: The use of robotics in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been shown to minimise human error, as well as improve the accuracy and precision of component implantation and mechanical axis alignment. The present study aimed to demonstrate that robot-assisted TKA using ROBODOC® is safe and capable of producing a consistent and accurate postoperative mechanical axis.
METHODS: We prospectively recruited 27 consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted TKA between May and December 2012. Two patients were excluded from the study due to intraoperative technical problems with the robot. Long-leg radiography and computed tomography were performed prior to surgery, and used for mechanical axis measurements and component sizing. DigiMatch™ ROBODOC® Surgical System software version 4.3.6 (Curexo Technology Corp, Fremont, CA, USA) was used in all cases to perform bone cuts in accordance with the preoperative plan.
RESULTS: The postoperative coronal mechanical alignment was within 3 degrees, with a mean alignment of -0.4 ± 1.7 degrees, confirming the accuracy of the preoperative surgical plan and bone cuts. The mean operating time was 96 ± 15 min, and preoperative planning yielded 100% implant sizing accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Robotics has the potential to enable surgeons to consistently attain ideal postoperative alignment. The use of bone movement monitors and an integrated navigation system enhances the safety profile of ROBODOC® by minimising errors. However, the role of the surgeon in TKA is still vital, as the surgeon is ultimately in charge of planning the surgery, its execution and ensuring soft tissue balance during TKA."
pub.1147859086,"An anatomo‐functional implant positioning technique with robotic assistance for primary TKA allows the restoration of the native knee alignment and a natural functional ligament pattern, with a faster recovery at 6 months compared to an adjusted mechanical technique","PURPOSE: An anatomo-functional implant positioning (AFIP) technique in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) could restore physiological ligament balance (symmetric gap in extension, asymmetric gap in flexion). The purposes were to compare (1) ligament balancing in extension and flexion after TKA in the AFIP group, (2) TKA alignment, implant positioning and patellar tracking between AFIP and adjusted mechanical alignment (aMA) techniques, (3) clinical outcomes between both groups at 12 months.
METHODS: All robotic-assisted TKA with an AFIP technique were included (n = 40). Exclusion criteria were genu valgum (HKA angle > 183°), extra-articular deformity more than 10°, and patellar maltracking (high-grade J-sign). One control patient with a TKA implanted by an aMA technique was matched for each case, based on age, body mass index, sex, and knee alignment. Ligament balancing (medial and lateral gaps in millimeters) in full extension and at 90° of flexion after TKA in the AFIP group was assessed with the robotic system. TKA alignment (HKA angle), implants positioning (femoral and tibial coronal axis, tibial slope, joint-line orientation), patellar tracking (patellar tilt and translation) and the Knee Society Score (KSS) at 6 and 12 months were compared between both groups. The ligament balancing was compared using a t test for paired samples in the AFIP group. The radiographic measurements and KSS scores were compared between groups using a t test for independent samples.
RESULTS: In the AFIP group, there was no significant difference between the medial and lateral gap laxity in extension (NS). A significant opening of the lateral gap was observed in flexion compared to extension (mean: + 2.9 mm; p < 0.0001). The mean postoperative HKA angle was comparable between both groups (177.3° ± 2.1 in the AFIP group vs 176.8° ± 3.2; NS). In the AFIP group, the femoral anatomy was restored (90.9° ± 1.6) and the tibial varus was partially corrected (87.4° ± 1.8). The improvement of Knee and Function KSS at 6 months was better in the AFIP group (59.3 ± 11.9 and 51.7 ± 20, respectively, versus 49.3 ± 9.7 and 20.8 ± 13; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The AFIP concept allowed the restoration of the native knee alignment and a natural functional ligament pattern. With a more physiological target for ligament balancing, the AFIP technique had equivalent clinical outcomes at 12 months compared to aMA, with a faster recovery.

pub.1121105563,Feasibility of supplemental robot-assisted knee flexion exercise following total knee arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: The Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is a robotic exoskeleton designed to support impaired limbs.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether active exercise using a single-joint HAL (HAL-SJ) following total knee arthroplasty can facilitate the recovery of knee flexion.
METHODS: Twenty-two patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty were randomly allocated to the HAL-SJ group (n= 12) or conventional physical therapy (CPT) group (n= 10). On postoperative day 5, patients performed active knee flexion exercises either with or without HAL-SJ assistance every second day. Outcome measures included active and passive knee flexion range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, and pain intensity, as assessed by the visual analog scale, and were assessed on postoperative days 5 (pre-treatment) and 10 (post-treatment). Active ROM was measured at 6 months postoperatively; further long-term follow-up was performed by telephone interview.
RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvement between postoperative days 5 and 10 in all outcome measures. Improvements in active ROM (p< 0.01), passive ROM (p< 0.01), muscle strength (p< 0.01), and pain (p< 0.01) were significantly greater in the HAL-SJ group than in the CPT group. Long-term outcomes were also significantly better in the HAL-SJ group.
CONCLUSIONS: HAL therapy enables patients to perform painless active movements and facilitates the recovery of knee function."
pub.1172939930,Precise Calibration of Femoral Component Rotation Using the Posterior Condylar Axis as a Reference during Image-free Robot-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Technical Note,"Introduction: The use of image-free robotic systems for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is gaining popularity. Although the surgical transepicondylar axis (sTEA) is considered the optimal femoral rotational reference during TKA, it is difficult to define intra-operatively. Conventional and image-free robot-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) therefore rely on the use of Whiteside's axis (WSA) or the posterior condylar axis (PCA) as surrogate references. The PCA is considered to be associated with less variability than the WSA. The authors present a simple technique to permit calibration of femoral component rotation (FCR) using the PCA as a reference for image-free robotic systems that do not permit this option.
Technique: The image-free robotic systems used by the authors (Navio and CORI, Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA) permit calibration of FCR only when the perpendicular to WSA is used as a reference. When the PCA is selected as a reference, a fixed 3° of external rotation is set by the robot. The technique proposed by the authors involves the use of the former setting, followed by internal rotation of the perpendicular to the WSA to co-align it with the PCA. The planning menu subsequently permits virtual surgical planning using the PCA as the femoral rotational reference and permits adjustments in rotational positioning of the femoral component while displaying the effect of rotation on bony resection and vice versa in real time. In addition, coaligning the perpendicular to the anatomic trans-epicondylar axis (aTEA) displays the internal rotation of the PCA with respect to the aTEA. This information can be used for setting rotational boundaries with respect to the PCA while using various alternate alignment strategies, like functional alignment, since the relation between the aTEA and sTEA is less likely to be affected by dyplasia and wear when compared with the PCA or WSA.
Conclusion: This simple technique permits optimally calibrated rotational positioning of the femoral component during image-free RA-TKA, using the PCA as a reference. It can be applied for optimizing surgery in knees with altered or outlier anatomy, as well as routinely, especially when alternate alignment strategies are used."
pub.1132113329,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty demonstrates decreased postoperative pain and opioid usage compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty,"AIMS: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has been introduced to provide accurate bone cuts and help achieve the target knee alignment, along with symmetric gap balancing. The purpose of this study was to determine if any early clinical benefits could be realized following TKA using robotic-assisted technology.
METHODS: In all, 140 consecutive patients undergoing RA-TKA and 127 consecutive patients undergoing conventional TKA with minimum six-week follow-up were reviewed. Differences in visual analogue scores (VAS) for pain at rest and with activity, postoperative opiate usage, and length of stay (LOS) between the RA-TKA and conventional TKA groups were compared.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing RA-TKA had lower average VAS pain scores at rest (p = 0.001) and with activity (p = 0.03) at two weeks following the index procedure. At the six-week interval, the RA-TKA group had lower VAS pain scores with rest (p = 0.03) and with activity (p = 0.02), and required 3.2 mg less morphine equivalents per day relative to the conventional group (p < 0.001). At six weeks, a significantly greater number of patients in the RA-TKA group were free of opioid use compared to the conventional TKA group; 70.7% vs 57.0% (p = 0.02). Patients in the RA-TKA group had a shorter LOS; 1.9 days versus 2.3 days (p < 0.001), and also had a greater percentage of patient discharged on postoperative day one; 41.3% vs 20.5% (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing RA-TKA had lower pain levels at both rest and with activity, required less opioid medication, and had a shorter LOS."

The purpose of this cadaveric study was to examine whether robot-assisted minimally invasive procedures improve TKA alignment after modifying the robotic techniques and instruments. Total knee arthroplasties were performed on 10 pairs of fresh cadaveric femora. Ten knees were replaced using the robot-assisted minimally invasive technique and 10 using the conventional minimally invasive technique. After prosthesis implantation, limb and prosthesis alignments were investigated by measuring mechanical axis deviation, femoral and tibial sagittal and coronal inclination, and femoral rotational alignment with 3-dimensional computed tomography scans. Postoperative alignment accuracy of the implanted prostheses was better in the robot-assisted minimally invasive TKA group than in the conventional minimally invasive TKA group as judged by the rotational alignment of the femoral component (0.7°±″.3° vs 3.6°±2.2°, respectively) and the tibial component sagittal angle (7.8°±1.1° vs 5.5°±3.6°, respectively). One sagittal inclination outlier for the tibial side existed in the robotic minimally invasive TKA group, and 2 outliers for the mechanical axis, 2 for the tibial side sagittal inclination, and 2 for the femoral rotational alignment existed in the conventional minimally invasive TKA group. Higher implanted prostheses accuracy and fewer outliers in postoperative radiographic alignments can be attained with robot-assisted TKA. Minimally invasive TKA in combination with an improved robot-assisted technique is an alternative option to compensate for the shortcomings of conventional minimally invasive TKA."
pub.1144044972,Robotic Versus Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty in High Volume Surgeons: A Comparison of Cost and Quality Metrics,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) was introduced to improve surgical accuracy and patient outcomes. However, RTKA may also increase operating time and add cost to TKA. This study sought to compare the differences in cost and quality measures between manual TKA (MTKA) and RTKA METHODS: All MTKAs and RTKAs performed between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019, by 6 high volume surgeons in each cohort, were retrospectively reviewed. Cohorts were propensity score matched. Operative time, length of stay (LOS), total direct cost, 90-day complications, utilization of postacute services, and 30-day readmissions were studied.
RESULTS: After one-to-one matching, 2392 MTKAs and 2392 RTKAs were studied. In-room/out-of-room operating time was longer for RTKA (139 minutes) than for MTKA (107 minutes) P < .0001, as was procedure time (RTKA 78 minutes; MTKA 70 minutes), P < .0001. Median LOS was equal for MTKA and RTKA (33 hours). Total cost per case was greater for RTKA ($11,615) than MTKA ($8674), P < .0001. Home health care was utilized more frequently after RTKA (38%) than MTKA (29%), P < .0001. There was no significant difference in 90-day complication rates. Thirty-day readmissions occurred more often after MTKA (4.9%) than RTKA (1.2%), P < .0001.
CONCLUSION: RTKA was a longer and costlier procedure than MTKA for experienced surgeons, without clinically significant differences in LOS or complications. Home health care was utilized more often after RTKA, but fewer readmissions occurred after RTKA. Longer term follow-up and functional outcome studies are required to determine if the greater cost of RTKA is offset by lower revision rates and/or improved functional results."
pub.1132059096,Short-Term Outcomes Are Comparable between Robotic-Arm Assisted and Traditional Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) was developed to provide for increased accuracy of component placement compared with conventional manual TKA (mTKA). Whether or not rTKA is cost-effective in a bundled payment model has yet to be addressed. The purpose of this comparative study was to evaluate the short-term clinical outcomes of rTKA and mTKA. We retrospectively reviewed a series of 4,086 consecutive primary TKA performed by one of five surgeons across six different hospitals at our institution from January 2016 to December 2018. Outcomes for rTKA cases (<i>n</i> = 581) and mTKA cases (<i>n</i> = 3,505) were compared using unmatched multivariate analysis and a matched cohort. We analyzed 90-day outcomes, episode-of-care claims data, and short form (SF-12) outcome scores to 2 years postoperatively. In matched bivariate analysis, there was no difference in episode-of-care costs, postacute care costs, complications, 90-day readmission rates, emergency department/urgent care visits, reoperations, and mortality between rTKA and mTKA patients (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Matched patients undergoing rTKA did have a shorter hospital length of stay (1.46 vs. 1.80 days, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and decreased rates of discharge to rehabilitation facilities (5.5 vs. 14.8%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). SF-12 scores were clinically similar. Multivariate analysis demonstrated no differences in any 90-day outcome. We conclude that patients undergoing rTKA have comparable costs, 90-day outcomes, and clinically similar improvements in functional outcome scores compared with mTKA patients. Further study is needed to determine whether rTKA will result in improved implant survivorship and long-term functional outcomes (Level of evidence III)."

The criteria for inclusion was any published full<b>-</b>text article or abstract assessing image<b>-</b>free hand-held robotic knee arthroplasty and reporting learning curve, implant positioning, functional outcome or implant survival for clinical or non-clinical studies.There were 22 studies included. Five studies reported the learning curve: all were for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) - no learning curve for accuracy, operative time was reduced after five to 10 cases and a steady surgical time was achieved after eight cases.There were 16 studies reporting accuracy: rate of outliers was halved, higher rate of joint line and mechanical axis restoration, supported by low root mean square error values.Six studies reported functional outcome: all for UKA, improvement at six to 52 weeks, no difference from manual UKA except when assessed for lateral UKA which showed improved clinical outcomes.Two studies reported survivorship: one reported an unadjusted revision rate of 7% at 20 months for medial UKA and the other found a 99% two-year survival rate for UKA.There was evidence to support more accurate implant positioning for UKA, but whether this is related to superior functional outcomes or improved implant survivorship was not clear and further studies are required.

pub.1015319401,HyBAR: hybrid bone‐attached robot for joint arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: A number of small bone-attached surgical robots have been introduced to overcome some disadvantages of large stand-alone surgical robots. In orthopaedics, increasing demand on minimally invasive joint replacement surgery has also been encouraging small surgical robot developments. Among various technical aspects of such an approach, optimal miniaturization that maintains structural strength for high speed bone removal was investigated.
METHODS: By observing advantages and disadvantages from serial and parallel robot structures, a new hybrid kinematic configuration was designed for a bone-attached robot to perform precision bone removal for cutting the femoral implant cavity during patellofemoral joint arthroplasty surgery. A series of experimental tests were conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the new robot, especially with respect to accuracy of bone preparation.
RESULTS: A miniaturized and rigidly-structured robot prototype was developed for minimally invasive bone-attached robotic surgery. A new minimally invasive modular clamping system was also introduced to enhance the robotic procedure. Foam and pig bone experimental results demonstrated a successful implementation of the new robot that eliminated a number of major design problems of a previous prototype.
CONCLUSIONS: For small bone-attached surgical robots that utilize high speed orthopaedic tools, structural rigidity and clamping mechanism are major design issues. The new kinematic configuration using hinged prismatic joints enabled an effective miniaturization with good structural rigidity. Although minor problems still exist at the prototype stage, the new development would be a significant step towards the practical use of such a robot."

pub.1146005045,Increased Accuracy in Templating for Total Knee Arthroplasty Using 3D Models Generated from Radiographs,"Templating prior to total hip arthroplasty is a widely adopted practice that aims to improve operative efficiency and reduce clinical outliers. Predicting implant size before total knee arthroplasty (TKA), although less common, could increase operating room efficiency by reducing necessary equipment needed for the procedure. This study compared templating accuracy in TKA using two-dimensional (2D) digital radiographs to a novel imaging technology that generates a three-dimensional (3D) model from these 2D radiographs. Two hundred and two robotic-assisted primary TKA surgical cases using Persona Knee System (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) were retrospectively analyzed. For all cases, 3D templating was completed preoperatively using a novel radiographic image acquisition protocol. Using the same radiographs, the knee was templated using a 2D digital templating program. All surgeons were blinded to the final implant sizes, and all templating was done independently. The accuracy of predictions within ± 1 from the final implant size was determined for the femoral and tibial components. The accuracy (within 1 size) of tibial size predictions was comparable between attending surgeons and residents (87 vs. 82%, <i>p</i> = 0.08), but attending surgeons more accurately predicted the femoral size (77 vs. 60%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The 2D to 3D imaging technology more accurately predicted both tibial and femoral sizes compared with the attending surgeons (99.5 vs. 87%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; 84% vs. 77%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). However, the imaging technology, attending surgeons, and residents were all more likely to overestimate femur size (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the 3D imaging technology predicted the exact tibial component size in 93.1% of cases, which was significantly greater compared with residents (40%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and attending surgeons (53%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The 2D to 3D imaging technology more accurately predicted tibial and femoral component sizes compared with 2D digital templating done by surgeons. All templating predictions were more accurate for the tibial implant size than for the femoral size. The increased accuracy of implant size predictions from this 3D templating technology has the potential to improve intraoperative efficiency and minimize costs and surgical time."
pub.1039984345,Obesity has no effect on outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: Although obesity has historically been described as a contraindication to UKA, improved outcomes with modern UKA implant designs have challenged this perception. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of obesity on the outcomes of UKA with a robotic-assisted system at a minimum follow-up of 24 months with the hypothesis that obesity has no effect on robotic-assisted UKA outcomes.
METHODS: There were 746 medial robotic-assisted UKAs (672 patients) with a mean age of 64 years (SD 11) and a mean follow-up time of 34.6 months (SD 7.8). Mean overall body mass index (BMI) was 32.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 6.5), and patients were stratified into seven weight categories according to the World Health Organization classification.
RESULTS: Patient BMI did not influence the rate of revision surgery to TKA (5.8 %) or conversion from InLay to OnLay design (1.7 %, n.s.). Mean postoperative Oxford knee score was 37 (SD 11) without correlation with BMI (n.s.). The type of prosthesis (InLay/OnLay) regardless of BMI had no influence on revision rate (n.s.). BMI did not influence 90-day readmissions (4.4 %, n.s.), but showed significant correlation with higher opioid medication requirements and a higher number of physical therapy session needed to reach discharge goals (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BMI does not influence clinical outcomes and readmission rates of robotic-assisted UKA at mid-term. The classic contraindication of BMI &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> may not be justified with the use of modern UKA designs or techniques.

pub.1169777715,Alignment is only part of the equation: High variability in soft tissue distractibility in the varus knee undergoing primary TKA,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the in vivo medial and lateral joint laxities across various total knee arthroplasty (TKA) alignment categories correlated to (1) hip-knee-ankle angle, (2) proximal tibial angle and (3) distal femoral angle in a consecutive group of patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA.
METHODS: Using ligament tensions acquired during 805 robotic-assisted TKA with a dynamic ligament tensor under a load of 70-90 N, the relationship between medial and lateral collateral ligament laxity and overall limb alignment was established. Only knees with neutral or mechanical varus alignment were included and divided into five groups: neutral (0°-3°), varus 3°-5°, varus 6°-9°, varus 10°-13° and varus ≥14°. Groups were further subdivided by the intraoperative medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA). The distraction of the medial and lateral sides was compared across the various alignments using an analysis of variance.
RESULTS: The ability to distract the medial collateral ligament in extension and flexion was proportional to the degree of varus deformity, increasing from 4.0 ± 2.3 mm in the neutral group to 8.7 ± 3.2 mm in the varus ≥14° group (p < 0.0001). On the lateral side, the distraction of the lateral collateral ligament decreased in both extension (2.2 ± 2.4 vs. 1.2 ± 2.7, p < 0.0001) and flexion (2.8 ± 2.8 to 1.7 ± 3.0, p < 0.0001) with increasing native varus deformity. MPTA and LDFA had similar effects, where increasing MPTA varus and LDFA valgus increased medial distractibility in extension and flexion. There was significant variability of the stretch of the ligaments within and across all alignment categories, in which the standard deviation of the groups ranged from 2.0 to 3.0 mm.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates increased medial ligament distractibility with increasing varus deformity. However, there was significant variability in ligamentous laxity within various limb alignment categories suggesting the anatomy and soft tissue identity of the knee is complex and highly variable. TKAs seeking to be more anatomic will not only need to restore alignment but also native soft tissue tensions.

pub.1150073529,Is it prime time for robotic-assisted TKAs? A systematic review of current studies,"Introduction: Less-than-optimum positioning of femoral and tibial components and improper soft tissue tension, with abnormal loads and reduced range of motion, may cause lower patient satisfaction rates. To reduce surgeon-related variables during TKA, technology-assisted TKA was introduced, including computer navigation and robotic-assisted surgery (RATKA). Although several studies show promising short- and long-term functional and radiological outcomes of RATKA, there are still concerns related to its absolute superiority over conventional TKA.
Methods: This review aims to provide an updated insight into the most recent articles reporting on outcomes (functional, radiological, and complications) of RATKA through a systematic search of major databases. A comprehensive English literature search was performed by both authors through four databases (Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus). The full text of the final eligible studies was evaluated for inclusion, resulting in 13 studies that are included in this review.
Results: There were 2112 knees in the 13 studies, with a follow-up ranging from three months to 13 years; only three were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and nine directly compared the results of RATKA with CTKA technique. Seven studies reported the operative time ranging from 76.8 to 156 min; six reported a longer operative time with RATKA. Length of hospital stay (LOS) was reported in six studies which ranged from 0.48 to 2.1 days; in four studies the LOS was shorter with RATKA. In seven of the nine studies comparing RATKA with CTKA, no difference in functional outcomes was found. Four out of six studies reported that the overall alignment had mechanical alignment within ±3° of neutral alignment in all RATKA patients with an HKA ranging from -0.3 to 1.8°. Only one study reported better radiological outcomes in the RATKA group. In six comparative studies, no difference was found in the incidence of complications between RATKA and CTKA.
Conclusion: Although robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty is a promising technology that provides better component alignment and superior early functional outcomes, the justification for its widespread adoption needs more robust evidence through well-designed and better long-term studies demonstrating superior, predictable, and durable clinical results compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty techniques."
pub.1175371181,Functional Outcome in Obese Patients Undergoing Image-Based Cruciate Retaining Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Using the Subvastus Approach: A Short-Term Study,"Introduction Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease that significantly affects quality of life, especially among obese and morbidly obese individuals. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment for end-stage OA, but it presents unique challenges in obese patients. The mini-subvastus approach (SA) and robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) are emerging techniques that may address these challenges. This study evaluates the clinical and radiological outcomes of cruciate-retaining (CR) RA-TKA using the mini-subvastus approach in obese and morbidly obese patients. Methods This study included 114 obese patients (215 knees) with primary OA who underwent CR RA-TKA (Maxx Meril CR knee, USA) using the Cuvis Joint® robotic system. Patients had a BMI of ≥30 kg/m² (n=101) and morbid obesity with a BMI ≥40 kg/m² (n=13). Preoperative planning involved CT scans and the J-planner for optimal implant size and positioning. Surgery was performed without tourniquets, and patients were mobilized postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the American Knee Society Score (AKSS) at three and six months. Results The study included 85 females and 29 males with an average age of 61.8 years. Satisfactory knee exposure was achieved in all cases using SA, with no major complications such as wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, or component misalignment. Intraoperative challenges were managed effectively, including two cases of medial collateral ligament avulsion and one partial patellar tendon avulsion. Postoperative VAS scores showed significant pain reduction from pre-op (6.54) to post-op day 3 (1.3). AKSS improved from a pre-op average of 33.9 to 70.7 at three months and 80.9 at six months. Most patients (80%) achieved exceptional range of motion (ROM) ≥120° at six months. Discussion The mini-subvastus approach in RA-TKA offers several advantages, including reduced postoperative pain, faster recovery, and improved quadriceps strength, even in obese patients. The use of robotic assistance ensures accurate component positioning and alignment, mitigating the challenges typically associated with obese patients undergoing TKA. Conclusion The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of CR RA-TKA using the mini-subvastus approach in obese and morbidly obese patients. This technique provides adequate exposure, reduces pain, and promotes early mobilization and recovery with satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes. The findings support the potential for wider adoption of this approach in managing knee OA in obese populations, though further studies with longer follow-up are warranted."
pub.1124285602,Flexion Space Balancing Through Component Positioning and Its Relationship to Traditional Anatomic Rotational Landmarks in Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The use of the femoral component position to balance the flexion space and its relationship to the transepicondylar axis (TEA) and posterior condylar angle (PCA) has not been thoroughly evaluated.
METHODS: A total of 233 patients undergoing robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty were evaluated. Native TEA and PCA were established on preoperative computed tomography scans. Femoral component rotation was set in the axial plane to match the native trochlea and native medial femoral condyle to set the flexion gap. Knee flexion space gaps and component position were recorded. The relationship of the femoral component to the native TEA, PCA, and preoperative radiographic landmarks was evaluated.
RESULTS: The intraoperative measured medial flexion space gap did not significantly correlate with the relationship of the femoral component to the PCA or TEA in varus or valgus knees. In varus knees, the preoperative mechanical axis alignment had a positive relationship to femoral component position when compared to the PCA (P = .04) and TEA (P = .002). In valgus knees, there was a positive correlation between the preoperative lateral distal femoral angle and component position when compared to the PCA (P = .04) only.
CONCLUSION: Intraoperative measured flexion space balance through femoral component positioning did not correlate with its relationship to the native TEA or PCA. In varus knees, the preoperative mechanical axis alignment correlated with an increase in femoral component external rotation to the TEA and PCA. In valgus knees, the severity of preoperative lateral distal femoral angle correlated with the rotational relationship of the femoral component to the PCA only."
pub.1011764697,Robotic bone preparation does not increase cement penetration into the proximal femur,"In a cadaver study, we prepared 20 matched pairs of human femora using chipped-tooth broaches and robotic milling with the same geometry. For robotic bone preparation the CASPAR robotic system with a rotating milling head was used. Cancellous bone was irrigated with 1 liter of pulsed lavage and the specimens were embedded in specially-designed pots. After vacuum mixing, bone cement was introduced in a retrograde manner and subjected to a standard pressure protocol with a constant force of 3,000 N. Radiographs were taken and horizontal sections were obtained at predefined levels, using a diamond saw. Microradiographs of the bone slices were taken, digitized and analyzed to assess cement penetration into cancellous bone. No femoral fractures or fissures occurred with either preparation technique. The microradiographic evaluation showed no morphometric differences between chipped-tooth broaches and robotic milling as regards cement penetration into cancellous bone. Therefore, in the presence of pulsed lavage, we conclude that robotic bone preparation does not increase cement penetration into cancellous bone of the proximal end of the femur."
pub.1064886544,Robotic systems in orthopaedic surgery.,"Robots have been used in surgery since the late 1980s. Orthopaedic surgery began to incorporate robotic technology in 1992, with the introduction of ROBODOC, for the planning and performance of total hip replacement. The use of robotic systems has subsequently increased, with promising short-term radiological outcomes when compared with traditional orthopaedic procedures. Robotic systems can be classified into two categories: autonomous and haptic (or surgeon-guided). Passive surgery systems, which represent a third type of technology, have also been adopted recently by orthopaedic surgeons. While autonomous systems have fallen out of favour, tactile systems with technological improvements have become widely used. Specifically, the use of tactile and passive robotic systems in unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) has addressed some of the historical mechanisms of failure of non-robotic UKR. These systems assist with increasing the accuracy of the alignment of the components and produce more consistent ligament balance. Short-term improvements in clinical and radiological outcomes have increased the popularity of robot-assisted UKR. Robot-assisted orthopaedic surgery has the potential for improving surgical outcomes. We discuss the different types of robotic systems available for use in orthopaedics and consider the indication, contraindications and limitations of these technologies."
pub.1149537163,Early Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes of Robot‐Assisted Versus Conventional Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Study,"OBJECTIVE: Robot-assisted surgery has been promoted worldwide in recent years. The development of a domestic orthopaedic robot and its clinical application are therefore of great significance. This study aimed to compare the early clinical and radiographic outcomes of domestic robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) with conventional manual total knee arthroplasty (CM-TKA).
METHODS: A total of 77 patients who underwent primary single-sided TKA from June to December 2020 were prospectively enrolled; resulting in the inclusion of 72 patients. The patients were randomly divided into the RA-TKA group (37 cases, with TKA being assisted by the Yuanhua Orthopaedic Robotic System) and the CM-TKA group (35 cases, with TKA being performed using conventional tools). Knee function was evaluated by the knee range of motion (ROM), the American Knee Society Score (KSS), and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Postoperative radiographic results were evaluated by full-length weight-bearing X-rays of the lower limb and anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of the knee were obtained preoperatively and at 90 days postoperative. The operative duration, blood loss, postoperative knee function, radiographic outcomes, and incidence of complications were compared by Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or chi-square test. Serum levels of inflammatory markers before the operation and 1, 3, and 30 days after the operation were recorded and compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The operation was significantly longer in the RA-TKA group than in the CM-TKA group (154.3 vs 115.2 min, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in blood loss (933 vs 863 ml, p = 0.519) between the two groups. The knee ROM, KSS, and WOMAC were significantly improved in both groups 90 days after the operation compared with before the operation (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences between the two groups (p > 0.05). The incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis was not statistically different between the two groups. In the radiographic findings at 90 days postoperatively we found the frequency of lateral tibial component (LTC) angle outliers was significantly lower in the RA-TKA group (3.0% vs 29.4%, p = 0.003). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly lower in the RA-TKA group than in the CM-TKA group on day 1 after surgery (9.9 vs 12.7, p = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: RA-TKA requires more time than CM-TKA, which may be related to the learning curve and intraoperative registration. The short-term postoperative knee functional outcomes had no differences between the two groups, and RA-TKA improved the accuracy of tibial component alignment. Further follow-up studies are required to investigate the long-term outcomes."
pub.1132447329,Robotic‐assisted TKA leads to a better prosthesis alignment and a better joint line restoration as compared to conventional TKA: a prospective randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: Correct positioning and alignment of the prosthesis is a very important factor for durability of prosthesis and implant survival which is improved with the use of technology in total knee arthroplasty. However, the long-term functional outcomes and survivorship are unclear. For this study, it was hypothesized that mechanical axis alignment of lower limb, post-operative joint line restoration, femoral and tibial component alignment is more accurate with the new handheld semi-active robotic-assisted TKA.
METHOD: From April-2019 to March-2020, 60 patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis who underwent total knee arthroplasties were included in this prospective randomised controlled study. Computer generated randomization was used. Study included 48 female patients and 12 male patients. Pre-operative and post-operative radiographic measurements were done and compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between two groups with respect to mechanical axis deviation, joint line deviation and coronal alignment of femoral and tibial prosthesis. Mechanical axis deviation > 3° was seen in eight cases (28.5%) in C-TKA group compared to one case (3.1%) in RA-TKA (p 0.019). Joint line deviation of 3.5 mm was noted in C-TKA group as compared to 0.9 mm in RA-TKA group (p < 0.001) which was statistically significant. However, whether this difference of 2.6 mm of joint line elevation between C-TKA and RA-TKA leads to any difference in clinical outcome in terms of knee kinematics and knee flexion needs to be investigated with further studies. Clinically restoring normal joint line is important for improved knee function after primary TKA. No significant difference was noted in femoral component rotation on post-operative computed tomography (CT) scan.
CONCLUSION: The novel imageless, handheld semi-autonomous robotic system for TKA is highly accurate with respect to component positioning in coronal plane and mechanical alignment as compared to conventional TKA. Joint line is elevated in conventional TKA but is accurately restored using the robotic-assisted TKA which may lead to better patellofemoral kinematics.

pub.1119916296,Improved mediolateral load distribution without adverse laxity pattern in robot‐assisted knee arthroplasty compared to a standard manual measured resection technique,"PURPOSE: Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) remains in its infancy, is expensive but offers the promise of improved kinematic performance through precise bone cuts, with minimal soft tissue disruption, based on pre-resection soft tissue behaviour. This cadaveric study examined load transfer, soft tissue performance and radiographic indices for conventional (sTKA) versus rTKA. The null hypothesis was there would be no difference between the two modes of implantation.
METHODS: Whole (ten) cadaveric limbs were randomised to receive either robotic (rTKA, N = 5) or conventional measured resection (sTKA, N = 5) knee arthroplasty. Laxity patterns were established using validated fixed sensors (Verasense) with manual maximum displacement for six degrees of freedom. Tibiofemoral load and contact points were determined dynamically using remote sensor technology for medial and lateral compartments through a functional arc of motion (0-110 degrees of motion). Final component position was assessed using pre- and post-implantation CT.
RESULTS: No significant intergroup differences for laxity were found (n.s.). The rTKA group exhibited consistently balanced mediolateral load throughout the full arc with significantly reduced overall total load across the joint (for distinct points of measurement, p < 0.05). Despite using flexion-extension and mediolateral gap balancing with measured resection, the sTKA group failed to achieve balance in at least three points of the flexion arc. Post-operative CT confirmed satisfactory component alignment with no significant differences for positioning between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: This work found improved load sharing for rTKA when compared to conventional surgery for same donor knees. Laxity and CT determined final component positioning was not significantly different. The work supports the contention that robot-assisted TKA delivers improved tibiofemoral load sharing in time zero studies under defined conditions but such offers the promise of improved clinical performance and reduced implant wear."
pub.1144499786,Robotic assisted artificial hip and knee arthroplasty is an inevitable trend in the future,"Artificial joint arthroplasty, such as total hip and total knee arthroplasty, is one of the most successful procedures in orthopedics. The quality of life of these patients can be improved significantly through relieving pain, correcting the deformity and improving joint function. Although hip and knee arthroplasty currently are routine surgeries for patients with late stage joint diseases, post-operative complications like leg length discrepancy, dislocation or instability, limp and uncertain reason pain are still common. The position of the implants plays important roles in all these complications. Robotic assisted joint arthroplasty can not only provide 3D pre-operative visual planning, but also can assist to fulfill the pre-operation plan perfectly. But the current joint arthroplasty robots cannot carry out automatic personalized pre-operation planning, and also have the shortcomings of low efficiency and high cost etc. However, based on their current performance and with the help of artificial intelligence and better algorithm, we believe that joint arthroplasty will be more and more precisive, intelligent and minimally invasive, which is an inevitable trend in the development of joint surgery."

Advocates of robot-assisted systems describe better patient outcomes through improved pre-operative planning and enhanced execution of surgery. However, costs, limited availability, a lack of evidence regarding the efficiency and safety of such systems and an absence of long-term high-impact studies have restricted the widespread implementation of these systems. We have reviewed the literature on the efficacy, safety and current understanding of the use of robotics in orthopaedics."
pub.1175203509,Minimized Soft Tissue Release in Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Retrospective Review of 100 Cases,"Aim For a successful total knee arthroplasty (TKA), bone cuts and soft tissue envelope must be balanced to ensure equal flexion and extension gaps. The study aims to assess if preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and planning software reduce soft tissue release. Methodology A retrospective analysis was conducted for the first 100 consecutive robotic-assisted (RA) TKA (RA-TKA) patients between March 2022 and May 2023. All patients underwent preoperative leg CT scans utilizing a fully automated Cuvis Joint robot. Planning software determined implant sizes and bone resections to achieve a 180° hip-knee-ankle axis. A posterior-stabilized knee design was implanted during surgery by the same surgical team using a medial parapatellar approach. The study hypothesis was, that RA-TKA with preoperative CT scans and planning does not reduce soft tissue release incidence, comparing it with the historical control cohort using chi-square tests (<i>P </i>&lt; 0.05 considered significant). Results The study consisted of 89 women and 11 males, with an average age of 65.3 ± 12 years. The average body mass index of the patients was 27.4 ± 5.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Ninety-four individuals had varus knees, while six had valgus knee deformity. Varus deformity ranged between 7° and 18°, and valgus knee deformity ranged from 6° to 14° preoperatively. Twelve patients (12.77%) of 94 varus knees (versus historic control 29%, <i>P</i>-value = 0.0047) and one out of 6 (16.67%) valgus knees (versus historic control 84%, <i>P </i>&lt; 0.0001) required posteromedial and posterolateral release for appropriate knee balance. Conclusions The study negates the null hypothesis and indicates that RA-TKA with preoperative CT scans and planning reduces the incidence of soft tissue releases to achieve a well-balanced knee."
pub.1128921964,"Robotic Surgery in Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Survey of the AAHKS Membership to Understand the Utilization, Motivations, and Perceptions of Total Joint Surgeons","BACKGROUND: In the past decade, the popularity of robot arm assistance in total joint arthroplasty has outpaced the reporting of long-term data. This study aimed to understand the motivations for use and perceptions of the technology among total joint surgeons.
METHODS: An online survey was distributed to the membership of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. The questions were asked for respondent's motivations for utilization of the technology, perceptions regarding outcomes and training, and personal characteristics that may have influenced responses.
RESULTS: Increased precision was the primary reason for users (73.1%) to utilize robot arm assistance in total joint procedures. Nonusers were just as likely to consider adopting the technology because of increase precision and marketing (P = .590). Nonclinical reasons such as marketing, administrative pressure, and peer pressure were primary motivators for 19.7% of users of the technology. Respondents regardless of financial interest and use of the technology felt that robot arm assistance increased operative time (76.5%) and was not more cost-effective than traditional methods (78.7%). Most American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons members felt that 20-40 surgical cases were needed to become competent with the technique (54.1%). A unique finding of this study is that a larger proportion of orthopedic surgeons considered themselves ""innovators"" or ""early adopters,"" based on Roger's diffusion of innovations, than was expected for the general population.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the decision to adopt robot arm assistance in total joint arthroplasty is multifactorial and may have a significant contribution from nonclinical factors and inherent surgeon characteristics. Continued evaluation of surgeon perceptions will be valuable as new evidence emerges regarding long-term outcomes."
pub.1157273580,Selective Use of Dual-Mobility Did Not Significantly Reduce 90-Day Readmissions or Reoperations After Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Selective use of dual mobility (DM) implants in total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients at high dislocation risk has been proposed. However, evidence-based utilization thresholds have not been defined. We explored whether surgeon-specific rates of DM utilization correlate with rates of readmission and reoperation for dislocation.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 14,818 primary THA procedures performed at a single institution between 2011 and 2021, including 14,310 fixed-bearing (FB) and 508 DM implant constructs. Outcomes including 90-day readmissions and reoperations were compared between patients who had FB and DM implants. Cases were then stratified into 3 groups based on the attending surgeon's rate of DM utilization (≤ 1, 1 to 10, or > 10%) and outcomes were compared.
RESULTS: There were no differences in 90-day outcomes between FB and DM implant groups. Surgeon frequency of DM utilization ranged from 0% to 43%. There were 48 surgeons (73%) who used DM in ≤ 1% of cases, 11 (17%) in 1% to 10% of cases, and 7 (10%) in > 10% of cases. The 90-day rates of readmission (7.3% versus 7.6% versus 7.2%, P = .7) and reoperation (3.4% versus 3.9% versus 3.8%, P = .3), as well as readmission for instability (0.5% versus 0.6% versus 0.8%, P = .2) and reoperation for instability (0.5% versus 0.5% versus 0.8%, P = .6), did not statistically differ between cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Selective DM utilization did not reduce 90-day readmissions or reoperations following primary THA. Other dislocation-mitigation strategies (ie, surgical approach, computer navigation, robotic assistance, and large diameter FBs) may have masked any benefits of selective DM use."
pub.1145745651,"Implantation of the Femoral Component Relative to the Tibial Component in Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Clinical, Radiological, and Biomechanical Study","BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a procedure with low morbidity and fast recovery. Anatomic implants or robotic-assisted UKA has been proposed to improve outcomes with precise positioning. Femoral component position (FCP) relative to the tibial insert could be a factor influencing the contact stresses. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the FCP relative to the tibial insert on clinical outcomes and stress distribution after medial UKA.
METHODS: Sixty-two medial fixed-bearing UKAs were evaluated at a minimum two-year follow-up using the Knee Society Score. Postoperative radiological evaluation performed on frontal X-rays classified the FCP relative to the tibial insert into the following: group M (medial), group C (central), and group L (lateral). A finite element model was developed to evaluate the biomechanical effects of the FCP relative to the tibial component.
RESULTS: The postoperative radiological evaluation showed 9 cases in group M, 46 cases in group C, and 7 cases in group L. The maximum knee flexion angle and the 2-year postoperative ""symptom"" and ""patient satisfaction"" scores of the Knee Society Score were significantly higher in group C. Compared with central positioning, a shift along the mediolateral axis leads to a displacement of the contact pressure center.
CONCLUSION: The FCP relative to the tibial insert may increase patient outcomes at a minimum follow-up of two years after fixed-bearing medial UKA. Accordance between FCP and contact stresses on the polyethylene insert could be a contributing factor of long-term survival of UKA."
pub.1147079981,Decreased patient comorbidities and post‐operative complications in technology‐assisted compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The use of computer-assisted and robotic surgery was developed to improve component position and outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The goal of this study is to identify differences in patient demographics, comorbidities, and complications between technology-assisted and conventional TKA.
METHODS: A Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients who underwent technology-assisted and conventional TKA from 2016 to 2018. Analysed variables include demographics, length of stay (LOS), payer-status, geographic region, comorbidities, complications, and mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify differences between both groups.
RESULTS: The analysis includes 2,208,434 TKA patients, of which 2,054,879 (93.05%) were conventional and 153,555 (6.95%) were technology assisted. Patients undergoing technology-assisted TKA were more likely to be older than 65 years, had higher median income quartile, and had surgery in urban teaching hospitals. Patients were less likely to undergo technology-assisted TKA if they were female gender, had Medicare payer status, were black race, were obese, were living in rural location, or had higher Charlson comorbidity score and baseline comorbidities. Technology-assisted TKA patients had shorter LOS, and fewer pulmonary and infection complications.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing technology-assisted TKA are being carefully selected with less baseline comorbidities, improved health, and living in urban areas. Subsequently, those carefully selected patients are discharged home, have a shorted hospital LOS, and have fewer complications compared to conventional TKA. Rural patients, black race and female gender are less likely to undergo technology-assisted TKA, further emphasizing the healthcare disparity for that segment of the population.

pub.1145783924,Effect of Posterior Osteophytes on Total Knee Arthroplasty Coronal Soft Tissue Balance: Do They Matter?,"BACKGROUND: Achieving coronal plane balance in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is of paramount importance. There is concern that obtaining balancing before removal of posterior osteophytes may lead to asymmetrical extension balance once removed. We hypothesized that there is a particular posterior osteophyte size and location that does not result in significant change in coronal gap balancing.
METHODS: In this study of 245 robotic arm-assisted TKAs, the size and location of posterior osteophytes were obtained from preoperative computer tomography scans. Gap measurements at 10°-25° and 90° flexion after removal of medial and lateral osteophytes, before and after posterior osteophyte removal and bone resection were compared with respect to the size and location of posterior osteophytes.
RESULTS: The largest size posterior osteophytes measured >10 mm in 8.2% of cases, 5-10 mm in 34.7%, <5 mm in 23.7%, and 23.7% had no osteophytes. The mean osteophyte size was 5.7 mm. The cohorts with and without posterior osteophytes were both found to have significant but similar changes in all gaps after osteophyte removal and bone resection (mean 0.8-1.4 mm, P < .0001 and mean 0.7-1.7 mm, P < .0001, respectively). Osteophyte size and location had no significant effect on the change in postresection gaps. This included osteophytes greater than 10 mm, but their incidence was small.
CONCLUSION: There is a small significant change in gaps between initial assessment and subsequent TKA bone resections, with or without posterior osteophytes. Our study found that where the surgeon thoroughly removes the medial and lateral osteophytes on initial exposure, posterior osteophytes <10 mm can be ignored during initial knee coronal balancing."
pub.1145122612,Head-to-Head Comparison of Kinematic Alignment Versus Mechanical Alignment for Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Seeing as there are many alignment strategies for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), we need to determine differences between them in a rigorous scientific way. Therefore, we sought to compare perioperative and postoperative functional outcomes in patients undergoing TKA for varus osteoarthritis with a mechanical alignment target vs a kinematic alignment target, both executed with the same implant and same technological guidance.
METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients who underwent TKA using a mechanical alignment technique were 1:1 matched to 100 patients who underwent TKA using a kinematic alignment (KA) technique, using the same implant and robotic technology. Patient-reported outcomes were measured postoperatively at 1 and 2 years. Power analysis revealed 94 patients to detect a significant difference.
RESULTS: Mean Visual Analog Scale scores were higher in the mechanical alignment group during the first 6 weeks (P = .04), but statistically similar at 1 year. Six-week Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey mental and physical components were statistically similar (P = .1). Patients did not differ in 6-week or 1-year knee range of motion (P > .43). Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Joint Replacement was significantly better in the KA group at 6 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years (P = .09). Forgotten Joint Score at 1 and 2 years postoperatively were significantly higher in the KA group (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing TKA with KA experienced less pain in 6 weeks after surgery, and higher Forgotten Joint Scores at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Alternative TKA alignment and balancing strategies should be considered to increase patient satisfaction."
pub.1132798102,Opioid Use in Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Comparison to Conventional Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"INTRODUCTION: Opioids are frequently prescribed in the postoperative management of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with multiple factors influencing postoperative opioid use. Robotic-arm-assisted TKA (raTKA) was developed with the goal of improving alignment and outcomes while decreasing soft tissue injury. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative opioid consumption in raTKA and conventional manual TKA (mTKA) cohorts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of unilateral primary TKAs performed 1/1/16 to 12/31/17 were included. Patients with major procedures requiring opioids occurring within one year of TKA were excluded. A single-surgeon raTKA cohort of 127 patients (Group 1) was compared to a same-surgeon cohort of 119 mTKAs (Group 2) using the same cemented implant design and a two-surgeon cohort of 410 mTKA (Group 3). Groups were subdivided into opioid naïve (ON) and opioid exposed (OE). Length of hospitalization and postoperative opioid utilization up to one year were compared between groups and collectively without separating raTKA and mTKA. Statistical analysis included Chi-square, Student's t-test, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.
RESULTS: For both ON and OE patients, Group 1 demonstrated reduced inpatient mean daily oral morphine milligram equivalent (MME) compared to Group 3 (ON p=0.007; OE p=0.034), a shorter hospitalization compared to Group 2 (ON p=0.02; OE p=0.012), and fewer opioids prescribed at discharge compared to Group 2 (ON p=0.005; OE p=0.081) and Group 3 (ON p<0.001; OE p=0.036). No differences in opioid prescriptions were seen at three months or after. Regardless of surgical technique OE patients had higher inpatient opioid utilization (p<0.001) as well as cumulative outpatient prescription quantity (MME 1050 ON, 2660 OE) and duration (ON 0.5%; OE 28.3%) at one year (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Less opioids were prescribed at discharge and used during hospitalization in raTKA compared to mTKA though no differences in opioid use were seen at further time points. Preoperative opioid use remains a dominant factor in postoperative opioid utilization regardless of TKA surgical technique."
pub.1172817963,Trochlea morphology demonstrates variability but no gender difference in osteoarthritic patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, coronal lower leg alignment has received significant attention. Two classifications recently described the variability in both femoral and tibial morphology, resulting in differing native lower limb alignment. The native trochlea and the variability in morphology has received less attention.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 200 patients undergoing robotically assisted TKA. Preoperative transverse CT scans were used to determine the posterior condylar axis (PCA), transepicondylar axis (TEA), lateral trochlear inclination (LTI), the sulcus angle (SA) and the anterior trochlear line (ATL). Outliers were defined as values > 1.5 IQR from median value. Trochlea dysplasia was defined as LTI < 12°. Gender differences were compared.
RESULTS: In total, 99 patients were female (49.4%). SA had a median of 137.0° (IQR 12°), ATL 4° (IQR 4), LTI 18° (IQR 7°). Median TEA-PCA was 5° external (IQR 3°). There were 5.0% outliers in SA, 3.0% of outliers in ATL, 3.5% outliers in LTI and 4.5% outliers in the TEA-PCA. Trochlear dysplasia was present in 11.5% of the measurements. There was no difference in any of the angles between the genders.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates no difference in trochlea morphology between the genders, rather a significant number of overall outliers in trochlear morphology. Larger cohorts but also, more investigations, are needed to better understand the trochlear morphology of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. The personalized alignment strategies and implants need to account for this variability in the population."
pub.1051764285,Hands-on robotic unicompartmental knee replacement,"We performed a prospective, randomised controlled trial of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty comparing the performance of the Acrobot system with conventional surgery. A total of 27 patients (28 knees) awaiting unicompartmental knee arthroplasty were randomly allocated to have the operation performed conventionally or with the assistance of the Acrobot. The primary outcome measurement was the angle of tibiofemoral alignment in the coronal plane, measured by CT. Other secondary parameters were evaluated and are reported. All of the Acrobot group had tibiofemoral alignment in the coronal plane within 2 degrees of the planned position, while only 40% of the conventional group achieved this level of accuracy. While the operations took longer, no adverse effects were noted, and there was a trend towards improvement in performance with increasing accuracy based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and American Knee Society scores at six weeks and three months. The Acrobot device allows the surgeon to reproduce a pre-operative plan more reliably than is possible using conventional techniques which may have clinical advantages."
pub.1043219846,Robotic Joint Replacement Surgery,"Osteoarthritis is a common disease that leads patients to seek total joint replacement (TJR). Component misalignment leads to failure of TJR. Computer navigation enhances the precision of component alignment, but the addition of robotic guidance can boost TJR to a higher level of accuracy. Some 29 English-language peer-reviewed articles from 2002 to 2013 and 1 Web site were reviewed. A conceptual framework was adapted to explain benefits and barriers of adoption of robotic TJR. A total of 10 studies were reviewed with focus on more precise alignment, outcomes, length of stay, and costs. Cost to obtain robotic surgical equipment was found to be about $1 million with maintenance costs approaching $350 000. Robotic techniques compared with conventional orthopedic surgery showed slight variances in favor of robotic procedures. Although hospitals have the potential to reduce costs and improve outcomes with robotic TJR, the expenditure and maintenance have not been proven a clear return on investment. As surgical robotic technology evolves in accuracy and accessibility, joint replacement surgery may benefit from improved precision and decreased health care costs. However, equipment purchase and upkeep costs and surgeon training may impede use to its full potential in orthopedic surgery in the United States. "
pub.1130231015,Personalized Cup Positioning Guides Improved Cup Positioning and Hip Ranges of Motion in Robotic Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty,"OBJECTIVE: Precise hip cup positioning is essential for the prevention of component impingement and dislocation in robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA). Currently, the robotic system uses a mechanical alignment guide (MAG) for cup placement, which is one-size-fits-all, and the optimal cup positioning is controversial. Robotic assisted THA has not used any personalized cup positioning guides. The goal of this study was to identify an optimal guide for cup placement in robotic assisted THA to improve prognosis and life quality after THA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pelvis and femoral CT data of 47 participants were retrospectively collected for preoperative planning of robotic THA. The universal MAG guide and three personalized guides, including acetabular rim labrum guide (ARLG), transverse acetabular ligament guide (TALG), and ischiatic-pubis line guide (IPLG), were used to pose cups in the acetabulum of each participant. The position of cups was evaluated by inclination and anteversion; the function of hip joints was evaluated by hip ranges of motion, including abduction, adduction, extension, flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation.
RESULTS: In terms of cup positioning, ARLG provided a bigger cup inclination (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), while IPLG and TALG provided smaller cup inclination (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than MAG; the three personalized guides provided larger cup anteversion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) than MAG. In terms of HROMs, compared with the use of MAG, the use of three personalized guides significantly decreased abduction (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), extension (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and external rotation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), but increased significantly flexion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and internal rotation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001); the use of ARLG significantly reduced adduction (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), but the use of IPLG and TALG increased adduction (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Compared with MAG, personalized guides provided greater flexion and internal rotation, which may reduce the risk of posterior dislocation. Among the three personalized guides, IPLG is the most reliable one for the preoperative planning of robotic assisted THA."
pub.1172109134,Preservation of prearthritic coronal knee phenotype and prearthritic coronal alignment yielded improved Kujala scores following ligament‐guided medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: There is a lack of literature evaluating outcomes of the ligament-guided approach in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). An improved comprehension of the distribution of coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) phenotypes and sagittal tibial wear patterns and their associations with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and implant survivorship could provide insights into its further application in daily practice.
METHODS: A registry was reviewed for patients with a minimal 2-year follow-up who underwent robotic-assisted, ligament-guided, medial UKA between 2008 and 2016. Survivorship and postoperative PROMs were collected. CPAK phenotypes and sagittal tibial wear patterns were determined. Survivorship, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Kujala and patient satisfaction were compared between phenotypes and sagittal tibial wear patterns.
RESULTS: A total of 618 knees were included at a mean follow-up of 4.1 [2.0-9.6] years. Four-year conversion to the TKA survival rate was 98.9% [98.4%-99.3%] and 94.3% [93.3%-95.3%] for all-cause revision. Patients with preservation of the CPAK phenotype (84.5 ± 14.9, 81.8 ± 15.5, p = 0.033) and restoration of prearthritic coronal alignment (84.1 ± 14.9, 81.7 ± 15.9, p = 0.045) had a significantly higher Kujala score. No other significant differences in survivorship or PROMs were observed between phenotypes or sagittal tibial wear patterns. Additionally, no difference in survival rates was observed between preserved or altered phenotypes.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that preservation of CPAK phenotype and preservation of prearthritic coronal alignment yielded a significantly higher Kujala score. No other significant differences in PROMs or implant survivorship were observed, suggesting that robotic-assisted, ligament-guided medial UKA provides equal outcomes for all observed phenotypes and sagittal tibial wear patterns in medial compartment OA as long as preoperative CPAK phenotype is preserved postoperatively.

pub.1144929220,Restricted kinematic alignment achieves similar relative lateral laxity and greater joint line obliquity compared to gap balancing TKA,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare ligament balance and laxity profiles achieved throughout flexion in restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) and gap balancing (GB). rKA and GB both aim to improve soft tissue balance and reduce ligament releases in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: One surgeon performed 68 rKA, another performed 73 GB TKAs using the same CR implant and robotic system. rKA limited femoral valgus and tibial varus to 6°, with tibial recuts performed to achieve balance. GB limited tibial varus and femoral valgus to 2°, with femoral resections adjusted to achieve mediolateral balance throughout flexion using predictive-gap planning software. Final joint laxity was measured using a robotic ligament tensioner. Statistical analyses were performed to compare differences in mediolateral balance and joint laxity throughout flexion. Further analyses compared alignment, joint line elevation and orientation (JLO), and frequency of ligament releases and bone recuts.
RESULTS: Both techniques reported greater lateral laxity throughout flexion, with GB reporting improved mediolateral balance from 10° to 45° flexion. GB resected 1.7 mm more distal femur (p ≤ 0.001) and had greater overall laxity than rKA throughout flexion (p ≤ 0.01). rKA increased JLO by 2.5° and 3° on the femur and tibia (p ≤ 0.001). Pre-operative and post-operative coronal alignment were similar across both techniques. rKA had a higher tibial recut rate: 26.5% vs 1.4%, p < 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: rKA and GB both report lateral laxity but with different JLO and elevation. Use of a predictive-gap GB workflow resulted in greater mediolateral gap symmetry with fewer recuts.

pub.1171240736,Enhancing robotic precision in medial UKA: Image‐based robot‐assisted system had higher accuracy in implant positioning than imageless robot‐assisted system across 292 knees,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the degree of accuracy in implant positioning and limb alignment offered by two robot-assisted (RA) systems: an image-based robot-assisted (IBRA) versus an imageless robot-assisted (ILRA) system for the treatment of medial knee osteoarthritis with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA).
METHODS: This retrospective radiographic study included medial UKAs performed between 2011 and 2023. Radiographic measurements taken preoperatively and at 1-year postoperative control visit focusing on hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), posterior tibial slope (PTS), tibial component coronal alignment relative to Cartier's angle and restoration of proper joint line (JL) height were analyzed. Outliers for postoperative measurements were defined as follows: HKA <175° or >180°, PTS <2° or >8°, >3° or <-3° alterations in Cartier's angle and ±2 mm changes in the height of the joint line.
RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 292 medial UKAs: 95 (32.5%) with an IBRA system and 197 (67.5%) with an ILRA system. Implant positioning and limb alignment were more accurate in the group of patients treated with IBRA, HKA (77.9% vs. 67.5%, p = 0.07), PTS (93.7% vs. 82.7%, p = 0.01), restoration of tibial varus relative to Cartier's angle (87.4% vs. 65%, p < 0.001) and restoration of JL height (81.1% vs. 69.5%, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Medial UKA surgery using an IBRA system was associated with a higher degree of accuracy in implant positioning and postoperative limb alignment as compared to an ILRA system. This is a valuable contribution to help communicate the advantages of using this surgical technique and improve its reproducibility.

pub.1169666063,Virtual range of motion is a safe and acceptable alternative to intra-operative manual range of motion testing in direct anterior robotic total hip arthroplasty,"Introduction: In robotic total hip arthroplasty (THA), virtual range of motion (VROM) modeling allows the surgeon to account for spinopelvic motion and create an impingement-free range of motion that is patient-specific. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of dislocation in patients undergoing direct anterior THA using VROM rather than manual ROM trialing.
Methods: Prospectively collected data was reviewed retrospectively of all consecutive anterior THAs performed by a single fellowship-trained surgeon. No patients were excluded from the study. VROM identified bone and implant impingement, which was recorded in degrees of hip external rotation(ER) at 0° of hip extension (standing), and in degrees of hip internal rotation(IR) at 90° of hip flexion (sitting). No patients had manual ROM trialing performed. Dislocation events were recorded during the first 3 months of follow-up. 362 patients, with a mean age of 67 and mean BMI of 28.8, were included.
Results: This cohort, including 154 patients (42.5%) with abnormal spinopelvic motion, demonstrated zero dislocations using VROM. The average ER impingement occurred at 60.9° ER (range 20-90°), and 50.8° IR (range 25-90°). Patients with ER impingement <55° had significantly less acetabular anteversion (16.4° ±3.3°, p < 0.001). Compared to the entire cohort, anteversion of the acetabulum was also decreased in the stuck-sitting subgroup (17.4° ±3.3°, p < 0.001) and increased in the stuck standing subgroup (20.5° ±3.6°, p < 0.001). ER impingement was a stronger predictor of acetabular anteversion than spinopelvic motion category (r = 0.458). Patients with ER impingement <45° (6.4%) or IR impingement <35° (6.6%) were ""early impingers"".
Conclusion: In this cohort of anterior THA patients with a high proportion of abnormal spinopelvic motion, a technique utilizing only VROM produced no dislocations. An impingement-free zone of 45° ER standing and 35° IR sitting is recommended."
pub.1158049066,"Robotic-arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: the Relationship between Bone Resection, Gap Balancing and Resultant Implant Alignment","Objectives: The primary aim was to assess the association between bone resection and the resultant flexion and extension gaps in the medial and lateral compartments of the knee when performing robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). The secondary aims were to compare medial and lateral bone resections and the influence on limb alignment, and whether the amount of bone resection that resulted in equal gaps was predictable.
Methods: A prospective study of 22 consecutive patients with a mean age of 66 years undergoing rTKA was conducted. The femoral component was mechanically aligned, and the alignment of the tibial component was adjusted (+/-3degrees of the mechanical axis) to obtain equal extension and flexion gaps. All knees underwent soft tissue balancing using sensor-guided technology. The final compartmental bone resection, gaps, and implant alignment were obtained from the robot data archive.
Results: There was a correlation between bone resection and the resultant gap in the medial (r=0.433, p=0.044) and lateral (r=0.724, p<0.001) compartments of the knee. There were no differences in bone resection from the distal femur and posterior condyles in the medial (p=0.941) or lateral compartments (p=0.604) or for the resultant gaps (p=0.341 and p=0.542, respectively). There was more bone removed from the medial compartment compared to the lateral aspect: 0.9mm (p=0.005) in extension and 1.2mm (p=0.026) flexion. The differential bone resection changed the knee alignment by one degree of varus. There were no significant differences between the actual and predicted medial (difference 0.05, p=0.893) or lateral (difference 0.00, p=0.992) tibial bone resection.
Conclusion: There was a direct association between bone resection and resultant compartment joint gap when using rTKA, which was predictable. Gap balancing was achieved when less bone was resected from the lateral compartment which resulted in an estimated one-degree varus alignment of the knee."

It was hypothesized that patients who receive robotic-arm-assisted UKA will have high survivorship rates and satisfactory clinical results.
METHODS: Between 2013 and 2016, 437 patients (470 knees) underwent robotic-arm-assisted medial and lateral UKAs at two centres. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Forgotten Joint Score 12 (FJS-12) and Short-Form Physical and Mental Health Summary Scales (SF-12) were administered to estimate patients' overall health status pre- and post-operatively. Results were dichotomized as 'excellent' and 'poor' if KOOS/FJS-12 were more than or equal to 90 and SF-12 was more or equal to 45. Associations between patients' demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes were investigated. Post-operative complications and pain persistence were recorded.
RESULTS: Following exclusions and losses to follow-up, 338 medial and 67 lateral robotic-arm-assisted UKAs were assessed at a mean follow-up of 33.5 and 36.3 months, respectively. Three medial UKAs were revised, resulting in a survivorship of 99.0%. No lateral implants underwent revision (survivorship 100%). On average, significant improvement in all clinical scores was reported in both medial and lateral UKA patients. In medial UKA patients, male gender was associated with higher probability of better scores in overall KOOS, FJS-12 and in specific KOOS subscales. No other associations were reported between biometric parameters and outcome for either medial or lateral UKA.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted medial and lateral UKAs demonstrated satisfactory clinical outcomes and excellent survivorship at 3-year follow-up. Continued patient follow-up is needed to determine the long-term device performance and clinical satisfaction.

pub.1050561008,A Hand-Eye Robotic Model for Total Knee Replacement Surgery,"This paper presents a hand-eye robotic model for total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Unlike existent robot assisted TKR surgery, the proposed model is a surgical robot that combines with a movable hand-eye navigation system, which would use the full potential of both computer-assisted systems. Without using CT images and landmark pins in the patient’s bones, it can directly measure the mechanical axis with high precision. This system provides a new approach of the minimally invasive surgery. Experiment results show that the proposed model is promising in the future application."

In the next decade, CAS products have the potential to transform as many as 25% of all orthopedic surgical procedures from techniques that largely depend on line of sight and traditional instruments to techniques that use integrated surgical instruments and computer technology. This technology could revolutionize orthopedic surgery, the lives of patients, and the work of perioperative staff members during the next decade."
pub.1175619791,The Accuracy of CT-Based Three-Dimensional Templating in Predicting Implant Sizes in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BackgroundComputed tomography (CT) based three-dimensional templating is increasingly being used to predict implant sizes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, the existing data is heterogeneous, and the majority of studies lack adequate statistical power. This study investigated whether preoperative CT-based planning in robot-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) helps in predicting the accurate size of implant used.MethodsThis is a single-center retrospective study of 632 consecutive RA-TKA surgeries. All surgeries were performed using a fully automatic Cuvis RA-TKA system. Cohen’s Kappa (κ) coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between the predicted and the final implant sizes.ResultsA total of 632 knees were operated on 384 patients. A total of 136 unilateral cases whereas 248 patients had both knees operated on. For the tibial component, in 21.7% cases a bigger implant size was used while in 11.8% cases a smaller size was used. For the femoral component, in 5.1% cases a bigger implant size was used while in 4.9% cases a smaller size was used. The agreement between the predicted and actual implant sizes was moderate for the tibial component [κ = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.51 to 0.61); p < 0.001] and almost perfect for the femoral component [κ = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84 to 0.90); p < 0.001].ConclusionThis study suggests that planning of RA-TKA using a CT-based model can be valuable to surgeons in accurately predicting the component size for femur and to a lesser degree for tibia. Future studies should investigate the potential predictors of discordance between the predicted and actual tibial implant sizes."
pub.1151522092,An automatic extraction method on medical feature points based on PointNet++ for robot‐assisted knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Image registration is a crucial technology in robot-assisted knee arthroplasty, which provides real-time patient information by registering the pre-operative image data with data acquired during the operation. The existing registration method requires surgeons to manually pick up medical feature points (i.e. anatomical points) in pre-operative images, which is time-consuming and relied on surgeons experience. Moreover, different doctors have different preferences in preoperative planning, which may influence the consistency of surgical results.
METHODS: A medical feature points automatic extraction method based on PointNet++ named Point_RegNet is proposed to improve the efficiency of preoperative preparation and ensure the consistency of surgical results. The proposed method replaces the classification and segmentation layer of PointNet++ with a regression layer to predict the position of feature points. The comparative experiment is adopted to determine the optimal set of abstraction layers in PointNet++.
RESULTS: The proposed network with three set abstraction layers is more suitable for extracting feature points. The feature points predictions mean error of our method is less than 5 mm, which is 1 mm less than the manual marking method. Ultimately, our method only requires less than 3 s to extract all medical feature points in practical application. It is much faster than the manual extraction way which usually requires more than half an hour to mark all necessary feature points.
CONCLUSION: Our deep learning-based method can improve the surgery accuracy and reduce the preoperative preparation time. Moreover, this method can also be applied to other surgical navigation systems."
pub.1145699975,What Is the Alignment and Balance of a Total Knee Arthroplasty Performed Using a Calipered Kinematic Alignment Technique?,"METHODS: We simulated calipered kinematic alignment total knee arthroplasty (cKATKA) using alignment data and ligament tensions acquired during 607 consecutive robotic-assisted TKAs performed using a dynamic ligament tensor. The distal femur was resected parallel to the native joint line accounting for cartilage loss. The proximal tibial resection necessary to achieve extension gap balance was calculated for each knee. Similarly, symmetric posterior condylar resections prescribed by this method were simulated and the tibial resection needed to achieve a balanced flexion gap calculated. Finally, the resultant limb alignment and degree of joint balance in both flexion and extension of each knee were determined and categorized according to the preoperative knee alignment.
RESULTS: Increasing preoperative varus deformity required a greater tibial varus cut to achieve a balanced extension gap (P < .0001). There was no correlation between tibial varus angle and flexion gap balance (P > .1). For mild varus deformities 81% and 95% of knees could be balanced and have an overall limb alignment within 3° and 5° from the mechanical axis respectively. For knees with moderate-severe varus, only 37% and 74% could be balanced within these alignment boundaries (P < .01). Overall, 95% of these simulated knees could be balanced with an overall alignment within 0° ± 5°. However, 50% of the simulated TKAs had looser medial gaps in flexion compared to the lateral gap.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of the cKATKA method can yield TKAs within 0° ± 5° of mechanical axis alignment by simply adjusting the proximal tibial resection without ligament releases. However, an undesirable flexion gap balance was predicted in nearly 50% of the TKAs."
pub.1145694981,Increased Prevalence of Posterior Cruciate Ligament Dysfunction Noted With 3-Dimensional Intraoperative Kinematic Evaluation in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Poor restoration of cruciate-driven kinematics after total knee arthroplasty may result from technical difficulties, but the ligament may also be functionally compromised by the presence of arthritis. We asked whether the function of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) could be assessed intraoperatively to predict the quality of the resulting posterior cruciate kinematics.
METHODS: PCL integrity was assessed using intraoperative infrared trackers to monitor knee kinematics in 73 patients. Three-dimensional images of the femur and tibia were projected onto a screen, allowing the surgeon to visualize kinematic relationships in real time. We measured femoral rollback (distance of femoral contact as a percentage of antero-posterior tray width) from images captured by the robotic system during initial kinematic assessment, gap balancing, and assessment of the final construct and from lateral flexion radiographs obtained 2 years after surgery. Associations were characterized using Pearson's correlation and graphical methods.
RESULTS: Thirty-six knees (49%) showed rollback <60% during gap balancing, indicative of PCL insufficiency. The rollback during gap balancing was positively correlated with that seen in the final cruciate retaining constructs (r = 0.60, P < .001), which in turn predicted rollback 2 years after surgery on lateral flexion X-rays (r = 0.50, P = .006).
CONCLUSION: Intraoperative functional evaluations can allow the surgeon to identify cases where rollback is not consistent with desirable knee kinematics, and posterior stabilization may lead to a better outcome for those patients."
pub.1078724748,"Brief report: total knee arthroplasty performed with patient-specific, pre-operative CT-guided navigation.","The clinical success and long-term outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are dependent not only on the biomaterials within the prosthetic implant, but also on the surgeon's ability to correctly position the implants onto the bone. Intra-operative computer navigation and robotic surgery have emerged as options to increase the accuracy of implant placement and enhance the outcomes of TKA, with mixed clinical results to date. Pre-operative CT-guided, patient-specific navigation is a unique method for planning TKA surgery to achieving consistent implant positioning, especially for patients with retained surgical hardware or unusual bony anatomy. This technology has been used in Rhode Island in a limited series of patients to assess the utility of the technique and represents an interesting advance for both orthopaedic surgeons and their patients."
pub.1071720121,"Computer-assisted TKA: greater precision, doubtful clinical efficacy: affirms.","Component and limb alignment are essential surgical variables that influence the long-term performance of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Total knee arthroplasty failure remains multifactorial, and computer-assisted surgical techniques may address only part of the failure pathophysiology. Despite attempting to use computer-assisted surgical techniques to improve TKA alignment, recent evidence has reported that the entire nature of the computer-assisted experience is not particularly forgiving, as significant increases in time and complications remain problematic. It appears computer-assisted surgical techniques are not yet ""ready for primetime"" with reproducible and proven long-term benefits for patients. Further studies are needed to better determine the precise target toward which to aim computer-assisted surgery efforts."
pub.1145890448,Posterior Tibial Slope in Computer-Navigated Total Knee Arthroplasty: The Transmalleolar Sagittal Axis Underestimates Slope Compared to Traditional Intramedullary Axis,"BACKGROUND: Tibial slope in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) impacts knee flexion, balance, and ligament strain. Implants were initially designed with tibial slope recommendations based on the intramedullary axis. However, technology-assisted TKA, such as robotics or navigation, determines slope from the ankle-knee axis connecting the center of the transmalleolar line to the proximal exit point of the tibial shaft axis. We sought to quantify the difference in tibial slope between the traditional intramedullary and transmalleolar sagittal tibial axes.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 40 TKAs with preoperative computed tomography scans. We reconstructed the 3-dimensional geometry of the tibia and fibula and determined the intramedullary axis as the best fit cylinder to the tibial shaft. We defined the transmalleolar axis according to accepted industry standards. We measured the angular difference between both axes in the sagittal plane.
RESULTS: The transmalleolar axis was radiographically posterior to the intramedullary axis in 39 knees. Utilizing the transmalleolar axis to set posterior tibial slope would reduce the posterior tibial slope by a mean of 1.9° ± 1.3° compared to the intramedullary axis. Furthermore, the posterior slope would be reduced between 0° and 2° in 24 knees (60%), between 2° and 4° in 10 knees (25%), and more than 4° in 5 knees (13%).
CONCLUSION: Tibial components implanted with technology assistance referencing the transmalleolar axis to set posterior slope will show an average of 1.9° less posterior slope when measured in sagittal plain radiographs, potentially concerning for knee kinematics."
pub.1164930109,"Functional alignment is associated with increased incidence of pre-balance, reduced soft-tissue release, and post-operative pain compared to mechanical alignment in patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral robotic-assisted TKA","This study aimed to compare two alignment strategies in the same patient undergoing simultaneous bilateral robotic-assisted TKA (SB-RATKA): mechanical alignment (MA), the gold-standard, and functional alignment (FA), a balance-driven, personalized alignment strategy. The outcome measures included quantitative assessment of soft-tissue release, incidence of knee balance, and post-operative pain. This was a prospective, self-controlled, randomized-controlled trial involving 72 patients who underwent SB-RATKA using the MAKO® robotic system with comparable grades of deformity and pain in both knees. 65 patients were finally included with one alignment strategy done per knee, with the patients blinded to the strategy used. The study recorded the additional soft-tissue releases required, incidence of pre-balance, and daily post-operative VAS pain scores. The mean age of the study population was 57.95 years, with a female preponderance (N = 53, 81.6%). MA group had significantly more medial compartment tightness in both flexion (MA-15.6 ± 1.8; FA-17 ± 1.3) and extension (MA-14.9 ± 1.9; FA-17 ± 1.1) (p < 0.0001) compared to the FA group after dynamic balancing. 66% of knees in the FA group (N = 43) achieved pre-balance compared to 32.3% in the MA group (N = 21) (p < 0.0001). VAS scores showed a significant reduction in pain in the FA group up to 72 h post-surgery (p < 0.0001). The requirement for posteromedial release (PM), posterior capsular (PC) release, tibial reduction osteotomy (TRO), and superficial MCL pie crusting (sMCL) were significantly lower in FA (PM-22, PC-13, TRO-8, sMCL-2) compared to MA (PM-44, PC-29, TRO-18, sMCL-8). Functional alignment strategy consistently resulted in a higher incidence of knee balance with a significant reduction in soft-tissue releases and immediate post-operative pain when compared to MA in the same patient undergoing SB-RATKA.

pub.1165809070,Recent advances in the direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty: a surgeon’s perspective,"INTRODUCTION: The direct anterior approach (DAA) has its origins in the first and oldest approach for hip replacement in the literature, but at the same time it would not be fanciful to suggest its increasing popularity as the latest approach for hip replacement procedures, especially among younger surgeons. However, in a geographical context, the DAA is not considered the major approach in most countries. Moreover, the term DAA encompasses numerous variations in terms of technique.
AREAS COVERED: In this narrative review, we describe our recent experience of advances in the DAA in terms of improved techniques and devices, along with some of its disadvantages. Also, we express our perspective on its future application.
EXPERT OPINIONS: The DAA is established as one of exemplary approaches to THA. The use of fluoroscopy, the traction table, and appropriate soft tissue management has become essential in the DAA for a safe and trouble-free procedure with adequate patient comfort. With the combination of recent technologies such as robotics, three-dimensional preoperative planning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based surgeon assist systems, we can look forward to the DAA being performed more efficiently in the future."
pub.1175300944,The current role of CT in total knee arthroplasty,"Advanced 3D imaging and CT-based navigation have emerged as valuable tools to use in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), for both preoperative planning and the intraoperative execution of different philosophies of alignment. Preoperative planning using CT-based 3D imaging enables more accurate prediction of the size of components, enhancing surgical workflow and optimizing the precision of the positioning of components. Surgeons can assess alignment, osteophytes, and arthritic changes better. These scans provide improved insights into the patellofemoral joint and facilitate tibial sizing and the evaluation of implant-bone contact area in cementless TKA. Preoperative CT imaging is also required for the development of patient-specific instrumentation cutting guides, aiming to reduce intraoperative blood loss and improve the surgical technique in complex cases. Intraoperative CT-based navigation and haptic guidance facilitates precise execution of the preoperative plan, aiming for optimal positioning of the components and accurate alignment, as determined by the surgeon's philosophy. It also helps reduce iatrogenic injury to the periarticular soft-tissue structures with subsequent reduction in the local and systemic inflammatory response, enhancing early outcomes. Despite the increased costs and radiation exposure associated with CT-based navigation, these many benefits have facilitated the adoption of imaged based robotic surgery into routine practice. Further research on ultra-low-dose CT scans and exploration of the possible translation of the use of 3D imaging into improved clinical outcomes are required to justify its broader implementation."
pub.1150692014,"Understanding rates, risk factors, and complications associated with manipulation under anesthesia after total knee arthroplasty (TKA): An analysis of 100,613 TKAs","BACKGROUND: Considering the growing adoption of technology-assisted total knee arthroplasties (TKA), previous database studies evaluating post-operative stiffness may be outdated. The present study aimed to: (1) evaluate the incidence of manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) after primary TKA; (2) determine independent risk factors for MUA; and (3) assess complications after MUA.
METHODS: Primary TKAs, with at least 6-month follow-up, were identified from the Florida State Inpatient Database (January 2016-June 2018) and linked to outpatient records from the Florida State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to compare patient factors and complications (e.g., mechanical, non-mechanical, infectious) associated with MUA, while adjusting for baseline demographics, comorbidities, use of robotic- and computer-technologies, time to MUA (0-3, 3-12, or >12 months), and need for repeat MUA (one-time vs >1).
RESULTS: The MUA rate was 2.8% (2821 of 100,613). Being younger, a woman, Black or Hispanic; having private or self-pay insurance; and conventional TKA were associated with significantly higher odds of undergoing MUA. Higher rates of mechanical complications and acute posthemorrhagic anemia were observed in the MUA cohort. Time to MUA, repeat MUA, and baseline demographics were not associated with complication rates among the MUA cohort.
CONCLUSION: Overall, 1 in 36 patients underwent MUA after primary TKA. Several non-modifiable patient characteristics, such as Black or Hispanic race, female sex, and younger age were associated with an increased risk of MUA. However, technology-assisted TKA might help to decrease the risk of MUA."
pub.1168042928,Short-term functional outcomes of robotic-assisted TKA are better with functional alignment compared to adjusted mechanical alignment,"INTRODUCTION: Ligament balancing is essential to the functional outcome of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The optimal method of alignment remains a controversial issue. The primary objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of TKA between functional and adjusted mechanical alignment techniques. The secondary objectives were to compare bone resection, robotic alignment, and radiological assessment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control series comparing TKA performed with functional alignment (FA) and adjusted mechanical alignment (aMA). Sixty-four FA subjects were matched with 64 aMA controls. These two groups were matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), surgeon, and type of frontal deformity. Both surgical procedures were performed using the MAKO<sup>®</sup> haptic robotic system. Functional scores (Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), Knee Society Score (KSS), and Oxford Knee Score (OKS)) were measured at the final postoperative follow-up. A radiographic evaluation was performed at the same time.
RESULTS: Mean FJS were respectively 63.4 ± 25.1 [0-100] and 51.2 ± 31.8 [0-100] in FA versus aMA group (p = 0.034). Mean OKS were respectively 40.8 ± 6.3 [21-48] and 34.9 ± 11.8 [3-48] in FA versus aMA group (p = 0.027). Mean KSS were respectively 184.9 ± 17.0 [126-200] and 175.6 ± 23.1 [102-200] in FA versus aMA group (p = 0.02). The main residual symptom was ""none"" for 73.0% versus 57.8%, ""instability"" for 6.4% versus 21.9%, ""Pain"" for 19.1% versus 12.5%, and ""effusion"" for 1.6% and 7.8% respectively for FA and aMA group (p = 0.016). There were 4 complications in the FA group versus 5 in the aMA group (p &gt; 0.999). Mean postoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) robotic assessment were respectively 177.3° ± 2.0 [172-180] and 178.2° ± 2.0 [173-180] for FA and aMA group (p = 0.018). The median difference between HKA robotic and HKA radiological was -3.0° (IQR = 3.0; p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: With greater residual deformity and without release, functional alignment showed a statistically significantly better short-term clinical outcome than adjusted mechanical alignment. This difference may not be clinically significant."
pub.1132289394,Biomechanical evaluation of total ankle arthroplasty. Part I: Joint loads during simulated level walking,"In total ankle arthroplasty, the interaction at the joint between implant and bone is driven by a complex loading environment. Unfortunately, little is known about the loads at the ankle during daily activities since earlier attempts use two- or three-dimensional models to explore simplified joint mechanics. Our goal was to develop a framework to calculate multi-axial loads at the joint during simulated level walking following total ankle arthroplasty. To accomplish this, we combined robotic simulations of level walking at one-quarter bodyweight in three cadaveric foot and ankle specimens with musculoskeletal modeling to calculate the multi-axial forces and moments at the ankle during the stance phase. The peak compressive forces calculated were between 720 and 873 N occurring around 77%-80% of stance. The peak moment, which was the internal moment for all specimens, was between 6.1 and 11.6 N m and occurred between 72% and 88% of the stance phase. The peak moment did not necessarily occur with the peak force. The ankle joint loads calculated in this study correspond well to previous attempts in the literature; however, our robotic simulator and framework provide an opportunity to resolve the resultant three-dimensional forces and moments as others have not in previous studies. The framework may be useful to calculate ankle joint loads in cadaveric specimens as the first step in evaluating bone-implant interactions in total ankle replacement using specimen specific inputs. This approach also provides a unique opportunity to evaluate changes in joint loads and kinematics following surgical interventions of the foot and ankle."
pub.1142394528,"After 25 years of computer-navigated total knee arthroplasty, where do we stand today?","BackgroundLimb and implant alignment along with soft tissue balance plays a vital role in the outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Computer navigation for TKA was first introduced in 1997 with the aim of implanting the prosthetic components with accuracy and precision. This review discusses the technique, current status, and scientific evidence pertaining to computer-navigated TKA.BodyThe adoption of navigated TKA has slowly but steadily increased across the globe since its inception 25 years ago. It has been more rapid in some countries like Australia than others, like the UK. Contemporary, large console-based navigation systems help control almost every aspect of TKA, including the depth and orientation of femoral and tibial resections, soft-tissue release, and customization of femoral and tibial implant positions in order to obtain desired alignment and balance. Navigated TKA results in better limb and implant alignment and reduces outliers as compared to conventional TKA. However, controversy still exists over whether improved alignment provides superior function and longevity. Surgeons may also be hesitant to adopt this technology due to the associated learning curve, slightly increased surgical time, fear of pin site complications, and the initial set-up cost. Furthermore, the recent advent of robotic-assisted TKA which provides benefits like precision in bone resections and avoiding soft-tissue damage due to uncontrolled sawing, in addition to those of computer navigation, might be responsible for the latter technology taking a backseat.ConclusionThis review summarizes the current state of computer-navigated TKA. The superiority of computer navigation to conventional TKA in improving accuracy is well established. Robotic-assisted TKA provides enhanced functionality as compared to computer navigation but is significantly more expensive. Whether robotic-assisted TKA offers any substantive advantages over navigation is yet to be conclusively proven. Irrespective of the form, the use of computer-assisted TKA is on the rise worldwide and is here to stay."
pub.1044449670,A Safe Overhang Limit for Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasties Based on Medial Collateral Ligament Strains An In Vitro Study,"Excessive tibial component overhang during unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) may cause medial collateral ligament (MCL) impingement, which, in turn, may lead to medial knee pain [Chau et al. Tibial component overhang 226 following unicompartmental knee replacement-does it matter? The Knee. 2009;16(5):310-3]. This study examines MCL loads in 6 human cadaveric knees for different levels of overhang using a robotic testing system. The results indicated no statistically significant difference between the baseline MCL load (no overhang) and the 2-mm overhang (P = .261). However, there were significant differences in MCL load between 2- vs 4-mm (P = .012) and 2- vs 6-mm overhang (P = .022). The loads were almost doubled from 2 to 4 mm of overhang. We conclude that, to minimize pain from excessive MCL loading, surgeons should avoid tibial component overhang greater than 2 mm in unicompartmental knee arthroplasties."
pub.1126655292,Early Economic Evaluation Demonstrates That Noncomputerized Tomography Robotic‐Assisted Surgery Is Cost‐Effective in Patients Undergoing Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty at High‐Volume Orthopaedic Centres,"BACKGROUND: For over fifty years, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been used to treat single-compartment osteoarthritis of the knee and is considered a safe alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The development and use of robotic-assisted surgery (r-UKA) have made the execution of the procedure more precise, and various studies have reported improved radiographic outcomes and implant survival rates; however, its cost-effectiveness is unknown. This study aimed at assessing the cost-effectiveness of noncomputerized tomography (non-CT) r-UKA compared to the traditional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (t-UKA) method in patients with unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis from the UK payer's perspective.
METHODS: We developed a 5-year four-state Markov model to evaluate the expected costs and outcomes of the two strategies in patients aged 65 years. Failure rates for t-UKA were taken from the British National Joint Registry while data for non-CT r-UKA were obtained from a 2-year observational study. Cost was obtained from the NHS reference cost valued at 2018/19 GBP£, and a discount rate of 3.5% was applied to both costs and benefits.
RESULTS: For a high-volume orthopaedic centre that performs 100 UKA operations per year, non-CT r-UKA was more costly than t-UKA but offered better clinical outcomes, and the estimated cost per QALY was £2,831. The results were more favourable in younger patients aged less than 55 and sensitive to case volumes and follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Non-CT r-UKA is cost-effective compared with t-UKA over a 5-year period. Results are dependent on case volumes and follow-up period and favour younger age groups."
pub.1127816358,A systematic review of MAKO‐assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), which has many potential advantages compared with total knee arthroplasty, was widely used across the world in recent years. The introduction of the robot systems greatly makes up for the defects of the conventional UKA surgery such as higher complication rates and revision rates. MAKO system, a new image-guided robot system relies on a preoperative computed tomography scan to assist in preoperative mapping and planning, offers an opportunity to improve the outcome of UKA surgeries. In order to have a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of MAKO-assisted UKA, the studies on MAKO-assisted UKA were summarized. MAKO-assisted UKA is better than conventional UKA surgery on implant accuracy, soft tissue balance, patient function scores and satisfaction, complications rates, and learning curve in short-term outcome; however, the mid-term and long-term outcomes of MAKO-assisted UKA need to be further studied."

The average follow-up term was 38 months.ResultsPostoperatively, the Japanese Orthopedic Association hip scores were significantly better in the DigiMatch group than in pin-based group. The accuracy of postoperative stem alignment of the DigiMatch technique was comparable with that of pin-based method.ConclusionsNo need for prior pin implantation surgery and no concern for pin related knee pain were the advantages of DigiMatch technique. Short-term follow-up clinical results showed that DigiMatch ROBODOC THA was safe and effective."

pub.1151074177,Efficacy of the Pre-operative Three-Dimensional (3D) CT Scan Templating in Predicting Accurate Implant Size and Alignment in Robot Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BackgroundNearly 20% of Total knee Arthroplasty patients remain dissatisfied. This is a major concern in twenty-first century arthroplasty practice. Accurate implant sizing is shown to improve the implant survival, knee balance and patient reported outcome. Aim of the current study is to assess the efficacy of pre-operative three-dimensional (3D) CT scan templating in a robot-assisted TKA in predicting the correct implant sizes and alignment.Materials and methodsProspectively collected data in a single center from 30 RA-TKAs was assessed. Inclusion criterion was patients with end stage arthritis (both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) undergoing primary TKA. Patients undergoing revision TKA and patients not willing to participate in the study were excluded. Preliminary study of ten patients had indicated almost 100% accuracy in determining the implant size and position. Sample size was estimated to be 28 for 90% reduction in implant size and position error with α error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.20 with power of study being 80. Post-operative radiographs were assessed by an independent observer with respect to implant size and position. The accuracy of femoral and tibial component sizing in the study was compared with the historic control with Chi-squared test. The p value < 0.05 was considered significant.ResultsThe pre-operative CT scan 3D templating accuracy was 100% (30 out of 30 knees) for femoral component and 96.67% (29 out of 30 knees) for tibial component. The implant position and limb alignment was accurate in 100% of patients. The accuracy of femoral component and tibial component sizing is statistically significant (Chi-squared test, p value 0.0105 and 0.0461, respectively).ConclusionThe study results show the effectiveness of pre-operative 3 D CT scan planning in predicting the implant sizes and implant positioning. This may have a potential to improve the implant longevity, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction."
pub.1077629703,Hip motion analysis using multi phase (virtual and physical) simulation of the patient-specific hip joint dynamics.,"In total hip arthroplasty (THA), the patient-specific bone geometry or the characteristics of the skeletal movement should be considered during treatment in order to prevent complications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the analysis of joints which combines the patient-specific virtual and physical simulation. The patient-specific anatomical structure and hip motion was obtained from CT and optical motion capture. The virtual simulation was conducted by integrating these data using virtual reality technique. The physical simulation was achieved by using plaster models of the patient's pelvis and femur and robotic manipulator. The plaster models were driven by two robotic manipulators to reproduce the hip motion. The accuracy of the robot movement was 0.245 mm over the working area according to the validation by an optical tracking system. By combining this system with linear actuators that reproduce the muscle functions, patient-specific muscle function can be simulated, thereby helping clinicians to diagnose and make a treatment plan."
pub.1090915215,Computer assisted navigation in total knee and hip arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Computer assisted surgery was pioneered in early 1990s. The first computer assisted surgery (CAS) total knee replacement with an imageless system was carried out in 1997. In the past 25 years, CAS has progressed from experimental in vitro studies to established in vivo surgical procedures.
METHODS: A comprehensive body of evidence establishing the advantages of computer assisted surgery in knee and hip arthroplasty is available. Established benefits have been demonstrated including its role as an excellent research tool. Its advantages include dynamic pre-operative and per-operative assessment, increased accuracy in correction of deformities, kinematics and mechanical axis, a better alignment of components, better survival rates of prostheses and a better functional outcome. Adoption of computer navigation in the hip arthroplasty is still at an early stage compared to knee arthroplasty, though the results are well documented. Evidence suggests improved accuracy in acetabular orientation, positioning, hip offset and leg length correction.
RESULTS: Among the orthopaedic surgeons, navigated knee arthroplasty is gaining popularity though slowly. The uptake rates vary from country to country. The Australian joint registry data shows increased navigated knee arthroplasty from 2.4% in 2003 to 28.6% in 2015 and decreased revision rates with navigated knee arthroplasty in comparison with traditional instrumented knee arthroplasty in patient cohort under the age of 55 years.
CONCLUSION: Any new technology has a learning curve and with practice the navigation assisted knee and hip arthroplasty becomes easy. We have actively followed the evidence of CAS in orthopaedics and have successfully adopted it in our routine practice over the last decades. Despite the cautious inertia of orthopaedic surgeons to embrace CAS more readily; we are certain that computer technology has a pivotal role in lower limb arthroplasty. It will evolve to become a standard practice in the future in various forms like navigation or robotics."
pub.1157733064,Clinical evaluation of the first semi-active total knee arthroplasty assisting robot made in China: a retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study,"OBJECTIVE: The precision of overall alignment and knee morphotype after robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty has been fully confirmed. This study aims to conduct a clinical evaluation of the first China-made semi-active total knee arthroplasty assisting robot.
METHODS: After a 1 : 2 propensity score matching, that is, a matched cohort study, patients were matched to the robot group (52 cases) and the conventional group (104 cases). The robot group received osteotomy according to preoperative planning, while the conventional group adopted preoperative planning based on the full-length radiograph and received conventional osteotomy. Perioperative clinical indicators, such as operation time, tourniquet time, hospitalization days, intraoperative bleeding, and hemoglobin level of the two groups were recorded; radiological indicators of postoperative prosthesis position, including hip-knee-ankle angle, frontal femoral component angle, frontal tibial component angle, lateral femoral component angle, and lateral tibial component angle were also recorded; deviations and outliers of the radiological indicators were calculated.
RESULTS: Compared with the conventional group, the operation time and tourniquet time of the robot group were longer, and the postoperative hemoglobin level decreased less, the differences were statistically significant; the lateral tibial component angle of the conventional group was 80.9°±3.6°, which was smaller than 86.7 °±2.3° of the robot group, the difference was statistically significant ( P <0.001); except for lateral femoral component angle, the absolute deviations of the radiological indicators in the robot group were significantly smaller than that in the conventional group ( P ≤0.001); the outliers of the radiological indicators in the robot group were significantly smaller than that in the conventional group with a statistical difference ( P <0.05).
CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional group, the operation time of the robot group was relatively longer, but the perioperation blood loss was less. The robot group could better control the posterior inclination of the tibial prosthesis, and the absolute deviations and outliers of the prosthesis position were relatively smaller. There was no difference in short-term clinical score between the two groups."
pub.1154880206,Hip Abduction Can Be Considered the Sole Posterior Precaution Strategy to Lower the Rate of Impingement After Posterior Approach Total Hip Arthroplasty With Large Femoral Head: A Computer Simulation Study,"BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that posterior hip precautions are unnecessary after total hip arthroplasty; however, many surgeons and patients choose to follow these precautions to some extent. In this study, we hypothesized that 20° of hip abduction would be sufficient to prevent impingement and dislocation in motions requiring hip flexion when using larger prosthetic heads (≥36 mm) when the acetabular implant is placed within a reasonable orientation (anteversion:15-25° and inclination: 40-60°).
METHODS: Using a robotic hip platform, we investigated the effect of hip abduction on prosthetic and bony impingement in 43 patients. For the flexed seated position, anterior pelvic tilt angles of 10 and 20° were chosen, while anterior pelvic tilt angles of 70 and 90° were chosen for the bending forward position. An additional 10° of hip external rotation and 10 or 20° of hip internal rotation were also added to the simulation. One hip received a 32-mm head; otherwise, 36-, 40-mm, or dual-mobility heads were used. The study power was 0.99, and the effect size was 0.644.
RESULTS: In 65% of the cases, bone-bone impingement between the calcar and anterior-inferior iliac spine was the main type of impingement. The absolute risk of impingement decreased between 0 and 16.3% in both tested positions with the addition of 20° hip abduction.
CONCLUSION: With modern primary total hip arthroplasty stems (low neck diameter) and an overall acceptable cup anteversion angle, small degrees of hip abduction may be the only posterior hip precaution strategy required to lower the risk of dislocation among patients. Future studies can potentially investigate the concept of personalized hip precautions based on preoperative computer simulations, utilized implants, hip-spine relations, and final implant orientation."
pub.1165749195,Using sequential bone cutting to titrate soft tissue balance in total knee arthroplasty effectively minimizes soft tissue release,"BackgroundAchieving soft tissue balance while maintaining limb alignment within acceptable boundaries is crucial for successful total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We proposed a sequential bone cutting (SBC) technique to titrate the soft tissue balance in robot-assisted TKA to achieve the desired balance with minimum soft tissue release.MethodsIn total, 106 robot-assisted TKAs using the SBC technique were included. The preoperative hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) was < 10° in 76 and ≥ 10° in 30 knees. The gaps were initially balanced with the help of the pre-resection balancing provided by the robotic system. Soft tissue balance and alignment were quantitatively measured after the initial bone cutting and final bone cutting. Additional adjustments (bone recuts and soft tissue releases) required to address soft tissue imbalance after initial bone cutting were recorded. The frequencies of soft tissue releases, soft tissue balance, and resultant alignment ≤ 3° were compared between non-severe (HKA < 10°) and severe deformity (HKA ≥ 10°) groups.ResultsSoft tissue balance was achieved in 45 knees (42.5%) after initial bone cutting and in 93 knees (87.7%) after final balancing. The postoperative alignment was within 3° from neutral in 87 knees (82.1%) and 3–5° in 17 knees (16.0%). For unbalanced knees (n = 61) after initial bone cutting, soft tissue release was avoided by SBC in 37 knees (60.7%) and was deemed necessary in 24 knees (39.3%). Soft tissue release was more likely to be avoided in the non-severe deformity cohort (86.8% [33 of 38]) than in the severe deformity cohort (17.4% [4 of 23]; p < 0.001). The non-severe deformity cohort showed a significantly higher rate of resultant alignment ≤ 3° from neutral than the severe deformity cohort (90.8% vs. 60.0%; p < 0.001).ConclusionPre-resection balancing is inappropriate to ensure soft tissue balance. The SBC technique is effective in minimizing soft tissue release while maintaining overall alignment within acceptable boundaries."
pub.1175317925,Robotic Assisted TKA achieves adjusted mechanical alignment targets more consistently compared to manual TKA without improving outcomes,"Introduction: Robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA), with its purported advantages of more accurate alignment, greater functional outcomes and patient satisfaction, is gaining popularity in patients undergoing TKA. The purpose of our study was to compare these parameters along with gait pattern and kneeling ability in a cohort of patients who underwent simultaneous TKA with manual instrumentation (mTKA) and rTKA in contralateral knees at a 1-year follow-up.
Methods: This was a retrospective review of 135 consecutive patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral TKA using robotic assistance on one side and manual instrumentation on the contralateral side between January 2022 and June 2022. The target alignment in both cohorts was adjusted mechanical. Patients were followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months to assess and compare alignment, range of motion (ROM) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) data. Gait parameters and kneeling ability were assessed at 1-year follow-up.
Results: While adjusted mechanical alignment was achieved in all rTKA patients, we recorded five outliers (≥3° with relation to 180° HKA axis) in the mTKA cohort (three varus and two valgus). There were no significant differences between both cohorts with regards to ROM, PROM scores, gait analysis parameters and kneeling ability at 1-year follow-up.
Conclusion: rTKA helps in achieving the adjusted mechanical alignment more consistently than mTKA. This, however, does not contribute to better functional outcomes and patient satisfaction at 1-year follow-up.

pub.1125331753,The three-year survivorship of robotically assisted versus non-robotically assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,"AIM: There has been a significant reduction in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) procedures recorded in Australia. This follows several national joint registry studies documenting high UKA revision rates when compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With the recent introduction of robotically assisted UKA procedures, it is hoped that outcomes improve. This study examines the cumulative revision rate of UKA procedures implanted with a newly introduced robotic system and compares the results to one of the best performing non-robotically assisted UKA prostheses, as well as all other non-robotically assisted UKA procedures.
METHODS: Data from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Arthroplasty Registry (AOANJRR) for all UKA procedures performed for osteoarthritis (OA) between 2015 and 2018 were analyzed. Procedures using the Restoris MCK UKA prosthesis implanted using the Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted System were compared to non-robotically assisted Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee System (ZUK) UKA, a commonly used UKA with previously reported good outcomes and to all other non-robotically assisted UKA procedures using Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship.
RESULTS: There was no difference in the rate of revision when the Mako-assisted Restoris UKA was compared to the ZUK UKA (zero to nine months: HR 1.14 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.83; p = 0.596) vs nine months and over: HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.02; p = 0.058)). The Mako-assisted Restoris had a significantly lower overall revision rate compared to the other types of non-robotically assisted procedures (HR 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.79); p < 0.001) at three years. Revision for aseptic loosening was lower for the Mako-assisted Restoris compared to all other non-robotically assisted UKA (entire period: HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.65); p = 0.001), but not the ZUK prosthesis. However, revision for infection was significantly higher for the Mako-assisted Restoris compared to the two comparator groups (ZUK: entire period: HR 2.91 (95% CI 1.22 to 6.98; p = 0.016); other non-robotically assisted UKA: zero to three months: HR 5.57 (95% CI 2.17 to 14.31; p < 0.001)).
CONCLUSION: This study reports comparable short-term survivorship for the Mako robotically assisted UKA compared to the ZUK UKA and improved survivorship compared to all other non-robotic UKA. These results justify the continued use and investigation of this procedure. However, the higher rate of early revision for infection for robotically assisted UKA requires further investigation.

pub.1101562409,Zero surgical site infection in primary knee arthroplasty with multidisciplinary intervention: is it possible?,"Surgical site infections (SSI) are among the most important complications in knee arthroplasty. In this article we aim to retrospectively evaluate effects of preoperative multidisciplinary assessment and treatment of focal infections in primary knee arthroplasty patients operated by a single surgeon in a single center. A total of 93 patients undergoing 120 primary knee arthroplasty operations were included in the study. In the preoperative assessment all patients were consulted by infectious diseases, otorhinolaryngology (ENT) and dentistry departments, and female patients additionally by gynecology departments to evaluate and treat possible focal infections. Decolonization protocols were implemented for the bacterial growths detected in nasal and urine cultures. Patients received one of four surgical interventions, namely unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA), unilateral robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RUKA), bilateral RUKA or unilateral TKA and unilateral RUKA. No patients received bilateral TKA in a single session. Out of 93 patients 70 (75.3%) were female, mean age was 67.7 ± 9.9 years, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were < 3 for 93.5% of the study group. Fifty-two (55.9%) of the patients received RUKA. Mean value for the duration of operations was 150.7 ± 67 minutes, for hospitalization it was 5.9 ± 2.8 days, and postoperative follow-up was 25.7 ± 8.8 months. None of the patients developed SSI in the follow-up period. Many factors are associated with SSI after knee arthroplasty. Total absence of SSI in our study group may be attributable to meticulous patient selection, multidisciplinary preoperative assessment, and the performance of RUKA by a single surgeon in a single center."
pub.1034856712,Knee biomechanics after UKA and its relation to the ACL—a robotic investigation,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has regained popularity in recent years. However, limited data exist on how UKA affects knee biomechanics. The role of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after fixed bearing UKA remains controversial. In this study, a robotic testing system was used to apply a quadriceps/hamstrings load to cadaveric knee specimens in the intact state, after medial UKA, and after transection of the ACL in UKA. The load was applied to the knee from full extension to 120 degrees of flexion in 30 degrees increments. UKA generally did not affect anterior-posterior (AP) femoral position, but did cause external tibial rotation and variations in varus-valgus rotation compared to the intact knee. ACL transection after UKA shifted the femur posteriorly compared to the intact and UKA knees and increased internal tibial rotation compared to the UKA knee at low flexion. The AP motion of the articular contact position in the implant was increased after ACL transection. These data might help explain the mechanism of tibial component loosening and provide insight into further investigations of polyethylene wear in UKA. Based on the kinematic data, the ACL should be functional to provide patients the greatest opportunity for long-term success after medial UKA."
pub.1166622330,"Multicenter, prospective cohort study: immediate postoperative gains in active range of motion following robotic-assisted total knee replacement compared to a propensity-matched control using manual instrumentation","BackgroundRange of motion (ROM) following total knee replacement (TKR) has been associated with patient satisfaction and knee function, and is also an early indicator of a successful procedure. Robotic-assisted TKR (raTKR) is considered to reproduce more precise resections, and, as a result, may be associated with improved early patient satisfaction compared to manual TKR (mTKR). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early postoperative active ROM (aROM) between raTKR and mTKR.MethodsA total of 216 mTKR patients were propensity-matched, in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, and BMI, to 216 raTKR cases. Intraoperative and immediate postoperative adverse events were collected. Knee flexion and extension aROM were measured preoperatively and at one- and three months after operation.ResultsChanges in flexion aROM were significantly greater in raTKR vs. mTKR at one- (6.9°, 95% CI: 3.5, 10.4°) and three months (4.9°, 95% CI: 2.1, 7.7°). Flexion aROM was greater at three postoperative months compared to preoperative aROM only in the raTKR group, and raTKR patients had higher odds of achieving ≥ 90° of flexion at one month after operation (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.16, 3.99). There were no significant differences between groups in intraoperative (P > 0.999) or postoperative adverse events.ConclusionsCompared with mTKR, raTKR resulted  in less loss of aROM immediately after operation and a faster recovery of aROM within three months after operation.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov (NCT# 03737149)."
pub.1150356662,Unsatisfactory accuracy of recent robotic assisting system ROSA for total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to quantify accuracy of a recently FDA-approved robotic-assisted device.
METHODS: Thirty-seven patients underwent TKA with the Robotic Surgical Assistant (ROSA) by the same operating surgeon and team over the course of 3 months. Intra-operative mechanical axis measurements, composed of alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), and delta (δ) angles, and the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) were calculated by the ROSA. Post-operative mechanical implant angles were taken from 36″ stitched post-op films and measured in the PACS imaging system. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the percentage of postoperative long length films within 2° and 3° of the ROSA intra-operative plan.
RESULTS: The ROSA system accurately calculated the HKA, α, and β angles (95% CI), but was inaccurate in calculating both γ and δ angles. Using a window of ± 3° accuracy, the HKA, α and β angles were accurate at levels of 89, 100 and 92% respectively. In contrast, the sagittal relationships were considerably less accurate at 77 and 74% for the γ and δ angles respectively. Subsequently, the proportion of cases within 2 and 3 degrees of the intra-operative plan for resection angles was considered accurate for HKA (73% within 2°, 89% within 3°), α (92% within 2°, 100% within 3°), and β (76% within 2°, 92% within 3°) angles, but considered inaccurate for γ (51% within 2°, 77% within 3°) and δ angles (57% within 2°, 74% within 3°).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that while the ROSA system seems to accurately predict coronal plane resections in TKA, it falls short in the sagittal plane. Further research in these deficiencies can provide insight into the overall efficacy of robotic assisted surgery in TKA.

pub.1139128538,Medial Tibial Plateau Stress Fracture Following Navigated Total Knee Arthroplasty: Two Case Reports,"BACKGROUND Computer navigation in total knee arthroplasty has been gaining worldwide interest among orthopedic surgeons. While there is controversial data regarding its potential better clinical outcomes compared to conventional total knee arthroplasty, it has been shown to improve component and limb alignment reliability at a potential cost of increased complications. We present 2 case reports of medial tibial stress fracture through navigated tibial cutting block pinhole sites. CASE REPORT Both cases involved morbidly obese patients who underwent a navigated total knee arthroplasty. During surgery, there were no intraoperative concerns. Both knees were well aligned postoperatively and no unusual pain was reported. At 6 months after total knee arthroplasty, a periprosthetic fracture was initiated at a cutting block pinhole site with varus collapse of the tibial component. In both cases, the pinhole site was close to the medial tibial cortex and the primary tibial component collapsed into the varus, requiring revision to a stemmed component with allograft bone. For both patients, the revision arthroplasty continues to perform well. We believe cutting block design in combination with small tibias and elevated body mass index contributed to this complication. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted total knee replacement has been shown to improve precision in component alignment. We caution against placing cutting block pinholes close to the medial tibial cortex, especially in morbidly obese patients with small tibias."
pub.1139970628,Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty in Patients Who Have Developmental Hip Dysplasia.,"INTRODUCTION: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the setting of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) presents more inherent complexities than routine primary THA for osteoarthritis. These include acetabular bone deficiency, limb length discrepancy (LLD), and abnormal femoral anteversion. Three-dimensional planning and robot-assisted (RA) bone preparation may simplify these complex procedures and make them more reproducible. The purpose of this study was to evaluate radiographic and clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients who had DDH and underwent an RA THA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 26 DDH patients who underwent RA THA by a single surgeon between 2013 and 2019. Their mean age was 54 years (range, 29 to 72 years) and mean follow up was approximately two years. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinical scores, Crowe classifications, and complications. There were thirteen Crowe I and seven Crowe II DDH hips, who were routinely managed with primary cementless implants. Two patients who had Crowe III and four patients who had Crowe IV DDH were also identified. All hips were reconstructed with cementless hemispherical acetabular components with or without the use of screws, but no acetabular augments or bulk allografts. Implants allowing control of femoral anteversion were selected in 23.1% of cases, including all six cases with Crowe III or IV dysplasia, and the need for these implants was uniformly identified using preoperative information about femoral version provided by the three-dimensional planning software. No patient was managed with a shortening femoral osteotomy. Postoperative radiographs were examined for LLD, center of rotation (COR), cup position (inclination and anteversion), and component osseous-integration.
RESULTS: Mean radiographic LLD was 1.7mm (range, -9 to +14) in patients who had Crowe I DDH, and there was no clinical LLDs greater than 5mm observed. Although patients who had Crowe II and greater DDH had a mean radiographic LLD of -11.6mm (range, -26 to +2.2), again no clinical LLD greater than 5mm was observed other than one patient who had bilateral Crowe II DDH in whom 10mm of clinical lengthening was accepted at the index arthroplasty with the plan to match lengths when her contralateral THA was performed. There were no cases of dislocation or acetabular fixation failure. One patient who had a femoral deformity and an intra-osseous blade plate from a prior femoral osteotomy suffered a failure of femoral osseous-integration, resulting in revision. A 32-point increase in mean modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) was found (p=0.002), from 48 points preoperatively to 80 points postoperatively.
DISCUSSION: RA THA provides an excellent option for the arthroplasty surgeon to both preoperatively localize and characterize the acetabular deficiency, while providing a targeted, optimal, and secure placement of the components intraoperatively. Our results suggest favorable outcomes when compared to "
pub.1104170993,[Research development of computer assisted navigation and robotics in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty].,"Objective: To summarize the computer assisted navigation and robotics in the classification of knee surgery, and the development, surgical indications and contraindication, effectiveness, and the research progress of computer assisted navigation and robotics in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA).
Methods: The related literature on computer assisted navigation and robotics in UKA was extensively reviewed, summarized, and analyzed.
Results: Recently, satisfactory results have been achieved in UKA for the treatment of single compartmental knee osteoarthritis. With the rapid development of computer navigation and robotic technology gradually combined with clinical practice, the great precision and accuracy of implant have been improved in computer navigation and robotics in UKA surgery. Postoperative function is well recovered, meanwhile, prosthesis survival can be significantly increased.
Conclusion: Computer assisted navigation and robotics in UKA can greatly improve the accuracy of the implant when compared with traditional UKA. The early effectiveness is satisfactory, but the long-term effectiveness still needs to be further observed."
pub.1135777450,Differences in Immediate Postoperative Outcomes Between Robotic-Assisted TKA and Conventional TKA,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a growing technique in adult reconstruction. The variations between robotic-assisted and conventional TKA could lead to changes in immediate postoperative outcomes. We aimed to evaluate for differences in postoperative pain, discharge day, as well as post-hospital disposition (home vs subacute rehabilitation facility [SAR]) between robotic-assisted and conventional TKA.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 2 cohorts of patients who underwent either conventional or robotic-assisted TKA between January 2019 and July 2019. Their average pain scores from postoperative day 0, day 1, and day 2 were recorded. Their postoperative discharge day was recorded, as well as their disposition to either home or a SAR. Preoperatively, all patients are offered robotic-assisted TKA, and only those who want the procedure and undergo a preoperative CT scan receive the robotic-assisted surgery. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six patients were identified with 83 in each cohort. No differences between age, race, and gender were found. Despite minor variations in pain levels, the overall postoperative pain score analysis did not strongly favor one technique over the other. The robotic-assisted group had a significantly higher amount of patients discharged to home instead of a SAR and also had a shorter time to discharge than the conventional group.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted TKA has similar postoperative pain scores compared with conventional TKA. The robotic-assisted cohort demonstrated other benefits including earlier discharge and are more likely to be discharged home instead of a SAR."
pub.1132991185,Current concepts in robotic total hip arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Total hip replacement provides mostly fair functional and clinical results. Many factors play an essential role in hip stability and long-term outcomes. Surgical positioning remains fundamental for obtaining accurate implant fit and prevent hip dislocation or impingement. Different categories of robotic assistance have been established throughout the previous years and all of the technologies target accuracy and reliability to reduce complications, and enhance clinical outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An overview is proposed over the principles of robotic assistance in hip arthroplasty surgery. Accuracy, reliability, management of the bone stock, clinical outcomes, constraints and limits of this technology are reported, based on recent literature.
RESULTS: Potential advantages regarding pre-operative planning accuracy, cup positioning, maintenance of the center of rotation, preservation of an adequate bone stock nay clinical short- and mid-term outcomes are balanced with some reported disadvantages and limits like hip anatomical specificity, cost-effectiveness, engineering dependence.
DISCUSSION: The use of robotic-assisted THA presents clear and evident benefits related to accurate implant positioning and maintenance of a minimal bone while allowing. For some authors, an early improvement in functional results and patient's recovery. This technology demonstrated a shorter surgical time and a short learning curve required to optimize its use and this technology presents promising outcomes and results and potential use in routine clinical application but its limitation of use is still present especially the cost of the robot, the need for the presence of an engineer during the surgery, its availability of use in all hospitals as well as the difficulty presented in dysplastic or dysmorphic hip joints."
pub.1011012772,Differences in knee joint kinematics and forces after posterior cruciate retaining and stabilized total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) retaining (CR) and -sacrificing (PS) total knee arthroplasties (TKA) are widely-used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee joint. The PS design substitutes the function of the PCL with a cam-spine mechanism which may produce adverse changes to joint kinematics and kinetics.
METHODS: CR- and PS-TKA were performed on 11 human knee specimens. Joint kinematics were measured with a dynamic knee simulator and motion tracking equipment. In-situ loads of the PCL and cam-spine were measured with a robotic force sensor system. Partial weight bearing flexions were simulated and external forces were applied.
RESULTS: The PS-TKA rotated significantly less throughout the whole flexion range compared to the CR-TKA. Femoral roll back was greater in the PS-TKA; however, this was not correlated with lower quadriceps forces. Application of external loads produced significantly different in-situ force profiles between the TKA systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the PS-design significantly alters kinematics of the knee joint. Our data also suggest the cam-spine mechanism may have little influence on high flexion kinematics (such as femoral rollback) with most of the load burden shared by supporting implant and soft-tissue structures."
pub.1129791174,Robotic arm‐assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: high survivorship and good patient‐related outcomes at a minimum five years of follow‐up,"PURPOSE: Robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RA-UKA) has been shown to improve component placement, reduce intraoperative variability, increase patient satisfaction and improve short-term survivorship results. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of revision and the clinical performance at a minimum of 5-year follow-up for a cohort of patients who received a medial RA-UKA.
METHODS: Between April 2011 and July 2013, a total of 254 patients underwent medial RA-UKA at a single centre. Clinical performance was investigated using the Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) and a 5-level Likert scale made of five items to assess joint perception and patient satisfaction. Kaplan-Meier implant survivorship was calculated and reasons for revision were collected. The effect of age, gender and body mass index (BMI) on the probability of reporting high FJS-12 and satisfaction were assessed.
RESULTS: After considering exclusion criteria and loss to follow-up, a total of 216 patients (224 medial RA-UKAs) were assessed at a mean 5.9 years of follow-up. Five RA-UKAs underwent implant revision, resulting in an overall Kaplan-Meier survivorship of 97.8%. Unexplained knee pain (0.9%) was the most common reason for RA-UKA revision. Good-to-excellent FJS-12 scores and high satisfaction levels were reported at mid-term follow-up. Male patients had higher probability of having FJS-12 > 90 (p < 0.05) and high satisfaction levels (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: RA-UKAs demonstrated high survivorship and good-to-excellent patient-reported outcome measures and satisfaction levels at minimum 5-year follow-up. Results for male patients had improved clinical performance when compared to female subjects.

pub.1139210845,Preoperative Osteoarthritic Grade Affects Forgotten Joint Status and Patient Acceptable Symptom State After Robotic Arm-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: This retrospective observational study was designed to investigate the association between radiographic Ahlbäck osteoarthritis (OA) grade and postoperative joint perception in a cohort of patients undergoing medial robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RA-UKA), using the Forgotten Joint Status and Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) as outcomes.
METHODS: Between January 2014 and May 2019, 660 patients (719 knees) underwent medial RA-UKA at 2 centers. Ahlbäck OA grade was measured on preoperative knee radiographs. Postoperatively, patients were administered the Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) and 5-level Likert scale to assess patients' satisfaction. Correlations were described among FJS-12, satisfaction, and Ahlbäck OA grade by means of logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 547 patients (602 knees) were assessed at a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (standard deviation 1.4). A total of 293 cases were graded as Ahlbäck 1 (Group A) and 309 knees were graded as Ahlbäck>1 (Group B). Statistically significant difference was detected in mean FJS-12 (P < .001), but not in the postoperative satisfaction level (P = .06) between the 2 groups. Patients in Group B had a significantly higher probability of attaining a ""forgotten knee"" after the operation, compared to Group A (P < .05). Cases in Group A had a significantly lower probability of achieving the PASS (P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Patients with higher grades of OA (Ahlbäck>1) were more likely to attain a ""forgotten knee,"" while patients with less severe OA (Ahlbäck 1) were less likely to achieve the PASS after RA-UKA. Although patients with less severe OA reported fairly good outcome, cases in which the results will be poorer are currently difficult to predict."
pub.1130695921,How Does Robotic-Arm Assisted Technology Influence Total Knee Arthroplasty Implant Placement for Surgeons in Fellowship Training?,"Implant malalignment during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may lead to suboptimal postoperative outcomes. Accuracy studies are typically performed with experienced surgeons; however, it is important to study less experienced surgeons when considering teaching hospitals where younger surgeons operate. Therefore, this study assessed whether robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA) allowed for more accurate and precise implant position to plan when compared with manual techniques when the surgery is performed by in-training orthopaedic surgical fellows. Two surgeons, currently in their fellowship training and having minimal RATKA experience, performed a total of six manual TKA (MTKA) and six RATKAs on paired cadaver knees. Computed tomography scans were obtained for each knee pre- and postoperatively. These scans were analyzed using a custom autosegmentation and autoregistration process to compare postoperative implant position with the preoperative planned position. Mean system errors and standard deviations were compared between RATKA and MTKA for the femoral component for sagittal, coronal, and axial planes and for the tibial component in the sagittal and coronal planes. A 2-Variance testing was performed using an <i>α</i> = 0.05. Although not statistically significant, RATKA was found to have greater accuracy and precision to plan than MTKA for: femoral axial plane (1.1° ± 1.1° vs. 1.6° ± 1.3°), coronal plane (0.9° ± 0.7° vs. 2.2° ± 1.0°), femoral sagittal plane (1.5° ± 1.3° vs. 3.1° ± 2.1°), tibial coronal plane (0.9° ± 0.5° vs. 1.9° ± 1.3°), and tibial sagittal plane (1.7° ± 2.6° vs. 4.7° ± 4.1°). There were no statistical differences between surgical groups or between the two surgeons performing the cases. With limited RATKA experience, fellows showed increased accuracy and precision to plan for femoral and tibial implant positions. Furthermore, these results were comparable to what has been reported for an experienced surgeon performing RATKA."
pub.1156777002,Favourable mid-term outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty with wider patient selection: A single-centre experience,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine surgical outcomes of robotic-assisted UKAs utilizing a wider set of indications than traditionally utilized. Additionally, we seek to determine alternate predictive factors as potential surgical indications and contraindications.
METHODS: A prospectively maintained institutional joint registry was queried at a single academic centre for all patients that underwent robotic-assisted UKA between January 2010-December 2016. Surgical indication included isolated medial or lateral compartment degenerative disease with a stable knee based on physical exam. In 2013, haemoglobin A1C levels over 7.5% were considered contraindications, which was lowered to 7.0% in 2015. Preoperative alignment, age, activity level and degree of pain were not contraindications for surgery. Preoperative demographics, Oxford scores, radiographic (joint space), comorbidities and operative data were collected and reviewed to determine factors related to conversion to TKA and survivorship of the primary implant.
RESULTS: In total, 1878 cases were performed; however, excluding multi-joint knees, there were a total of 1186 knees in 1014 patients with a minimum 4-year follow-up. The mean age was 63.4 ​± ​10.7 years and mean follow-up was 76.4 ​± ​17.4 months. Mean BMI was 32.3 ​± ​6.5 ​kg/m<sup>2</sup>. (52.9% females, 47.1% males). There were 901 patients undergoing medial UKA, 122 patients undergoing lateral UKA and 69 patients undergoing patellofemoral UKA. In total, 85 (7.2%) knees underwent conversion to TKA. Preoperative factors such as the degree of preoperative valgus deformity (p ​= ​0.01), greater operative joint space (p ​= ​0.04), previous surgery (p ​= ​0.01), inlay implant (p ​= ​0.04) and pain syndrome (p ​= ​0.01) were associated with increased risk of revision surgery. Factors associated with decreased implant survivorship included patients with history of previous surgery (p ​&lt; ​0.01), history of pain syndrome (p ​&lt; ​0.01) and greater preoperative joint space (&gt;2 ​mm) (p ​&lt; ​0.01). There was no association of BMI to conversion to TKA.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted UKA with wider patient selection demonstrated favourable outcomes at 4 years with survivorship greater than 92%. The present series agree with emerging indications that do not exclude patients based on age, BMI, or degree of deformity. However, increased operative joint space, inlay design, history of surgery and coexistence of pain syndrome are factors that increase risk of conversion to TKA.

pub.1138654272,"Incidence, temporal trends and potential risk factors for aseptic loosening following primary unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: A meta-analysis of 96,294 knees","BACKGROUND: Aseptic loosening (AL) is among the major reasons for revision of failed primary unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). There is an ongoing temporal increase in the use of UKA with a resultant increase in the revision burden. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of, temporal trends and risk factors for AL.
METHODS: Longitudinal studies reporting the incidence of AL following primary UKA were sought from MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library up to 6th April 2020. Incidence and relative risks (RR) (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated.
RESULTS: We identified 62 studies for inclusion. Overall, 96,294 primary UKA procedures accounting for 1752 AL cases were included. AL incidence ranged from 0.00% to 22.70% over a 7.7 year weighted mean follow-up. The pooled random effects incidence (95% CI) was 1.77% (1.34-2.25) in the same follow-up period. The annual rate of AL was 0.10% (0.02-0.22). AL incidence increased with length of follow-up, but there was a temporal decrease from the 1970s onwards. Tibial loosening was more common than femoral component loosening: incidence (95% CI) of 1.63% (0.96-2.44) and 0.58% (0.20-1.09) respectively over a weighted follow-up of 6.6 years. Fixed bearing implant design and cemented fixation were both associated with increased AL risk, whereas robotic-assisted surgery was associated with decreased risk.
CONCLUSION: The overall incidence of AL following primary UKA is primarily driven by tibial component loosening and there is a temporal decline in rates. The use of mobile bearing, uncemented implants inserted with robotic assisted surgery may reduce the risk of AL."
pub.1132409230,Does the Use of Intraoperative Technology Yield Superior Patient Outcomes Following Total Knee Arthroplasty?,"INTRODUCTION: There is debate regarding whether the use of computer-assisted technology, such as navigation and robotics, has any benefit on outcomes or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aims to report on the association between intraoperative use of technology and outcomes in patients who underwent primary TKA.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 7096 patients who underwent primary TKA from 2016-2020. Patients were stratified depending on the technology utilized: navigation, robotics, or no technology. Patient demographics, clinical data, Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS), and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR) were collected at various time points up to 1-year follow-up. Demographic differences were assessed with chi-square and ANOVA. Clinical data and PROMs were compared using univariate ANCOVA, controlling for demographic differences.
RESULTS: A total of 287(4%) navigation, 367(5%) robotics, and 6442(91%) manual cases were included. Surgical-time significantly differed between the three groups (113.33 vs 117.44 vs 102.11; P < .001). Discharge disposition significantly differed between the three groups (P < .001), with more manual TKA patients discharged to a skilled nursing facility (12% vs 8% vs 15%; P < .001) than those who had technology utilized. FJS scores did not statistically differ at three-months (P = .067) and one-year (P = .221). We found significant statistical differences in three-month KOOS, JR scores (59.48 vs 60.10 vs 63.64; P = .001); however, one-year scores did not statistically differ between all groups (P = .320).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates shorter operative-time in cases with no utilization of technology and clinically similar PROMs associated with TKAs performed between all modalities. While the use of technology may aid surgeons, it has not currently translated to better short-term outcomes.

pub.1111488484,Revision Analysis of Robotic Arm–Assisted and Manual Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate hospital admissions for revision surgeries associated with robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (rUKA) vs manually instrumented UKA (mUKA) procedures.
METHODS: Patients ≥18 years of age who received either a mUKA or a rUKA procedure were candidates for inclusion and were identified by the presence of appropriate billing codes. Procedures performed between March 1, 2013 and July 31, 2015 were used to calculate the rate of surgical revisions occurring within 24-months of the index procedure. Following propensity matching, 246 rUKA and 492 mUKA patients were included. Revision rates and the associated costs were compared between the two cohorts. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables, and Fisher's exact tests was used to analyze discrete categorical variables.
RESULTS: At 24 months after the primary UKA procedure, patients who underwent rUKA had fewer revision procedures (0.81% [2/246] vs 5.28% [26/492]; P = .002), shorter mean length of stay (2.00 vs 2.33 days; P > .05), and incurred lower mean costs for the index stay plus revisions ($26,001 vs $27,915; P > .05) than mUKA patients. Length of stay at index and index costs were also lower for rUKA patients (1.77 vs 2.02 days; P = .0047) and ($25,786 vs $26,307; P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The study results demonstrate that patients who underwent rUKA had fewer revision procedures, shorter length of stay, and incurred lower mean costs (although not statistically different) during the index admission and at 24 months postoperatively. These results could be important for payers as the prevalence of end-stage knee osteoarthritis increases alongside the demand for cost-efficient treatments."
pub.1174595759,Predictive Accuracy Analysis of a Novel Robotic-Assisted System for Total Knee Arthroplasty:A Prospective Observational Study,"Background: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has been reported to enhance operative decision-making. The purpose of this study was intended to assess the predictive accuracy of bone cuts, lower limb alignment, and component size of a novel system for RATKA preoperatively and intraoperatively.
Methods: Preoperatively planned bone cuts, limb alignment, and component size were projected using a reconstructed 3D model. Intraoperative bone cuts and postoperative limb alignment were measured. Errors between planned and real bone cuts, limb alignment, and component size were compared.
Results: The mean absolute errors for bone cuts and alignment were within 1.40mm/1.30° with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.96mm/1.12°. For all errors of bone cuts and alignment compared with the plan, there were no statistically significant differences except for the lateral distal of femoral cuts (<i>P</i>=0.004). The accuracy for predicting the femoral, tibial, and polyethylene component sizes was 100% (48/48), 90% (43/48), and 88% (42/48), respectively. Regarding all mean absolute errors of bone cuts and alignments, no significant differences were observed among surgeons.
Conclusion: The novel robotically-assisted system for RATKA donated reliable operative decision-making based on the predictive accuracy regardless of the surgeon's level of experience."
pub.1019214597,Preserving the Abductor Mechanism in Robotic THR: The Influence of Stem Design and Cutterpath,"OBJECTIVE: The tip of the greater trochanter is the attachment site for the abductor muscles of the hip joint. Its preservation in robotic and conventional THR is important for normal gait. The effect of different stem designs and robotic cutterpaths on the preservation of the trochanter tip is examined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One anatomical stem, one straight stem, and one stem specifically designed for robotic THR were implanted virtually in CT scans of osteoarthrotic hip joints using the Torch preoperative planning unit (URS-ortho). In transverse sections of the trochanter tip, dimensions of the trochanter area removed by the milling tool were recorded for each stem design and different cutterpaths (3-axis versus 5-axis milling).
RESULTS: Five-axis milling showed significantly better results than 3-axis milling. For straight stems, more bone was removed than for anatomic stems. The most favorable results were achieved with 5-axis milling and a curved stem specifically designed for robotic THR.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of 5-axis milling in robotic THR is an improvement of the technique and makes preservation of the abductor mechanism at the tip of the greater trochanter easier for the surgeon."

Characteristically, affected patient will have dark urine and blackish discoloration of connective tissue, especially cartilage and bone and hence it is known as black bone disease.
PRESENTATION OF THE CASE: The reported case is for 49 years old gentleman, known to have hypertension, hypothyroidism and Alkaptunurea. He presented to our facility with long standing bilateral knee pain (more in the left) with difficulty in doing daily activities. He presented to our tertiary facility after failure of previous treatment measures. The patient underwent uncomplicated Robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty that resulted in significant improvement of his pain and function.
CONCLUSION: Knee arthroplasty is a reliable and reproducible modality in treating Ochronotic knee arthropathy and it would result in pain reduction and better function of patients with such condition."
pub.1142569120,Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty improves preoperative planning and intraoperative decision-making,"BackgroundThe reliability of robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has been previously reported. In this study, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of the RA-TKA system in determining the required bone resection and implant size preoperatively and its effect on intraoperative decision-making.MethodsData on the outcomes of RA-TKA procedures performed in our department were prospectively collected. A three-dimensional model of the femur, tibia, and fibula was reconstructed using standard computed tomography (CT) images. The model was used preoperatively to predict bone required resection for the femur and tibia and implant size. Intraoperatively, the images were registered to the local anatomy to create a patient-specific model for decision-making, including real-time measurement of the medial-to-lateral difference in the extension/flexion gap and TKA component alignment. Differences between predicted and real bone resections and implant size were evaluated, and the post-TKA mechanical axis of the lower limb and difference in medial-to-lateral flexion/extension gap were measured.ResultsThe analysis was based on the data of 28 patients who underwent TKA to treat severe osteoarthritis. The RA-TKA system successfully predicted the femoral and tibial component within one implant size in 28/28 cases (100%). For the 168 bone resections performed, including both femoral and tibial cuts, the resection was within 1 mm of the predicted value in 120/168 (71%) of the cuts. The actual versus predicted bone resection was statistically different only for the lateral tibial plateau (p = 0.018). The medial-to-lateral gap difference was between − 1 and 1 mm, except in one case. The achieved lower limb alignment was accurate overall, with the alignment being within < 1.0° of the neutral mechanical axis in 13/28 cases (46%) and within < 3.0° in 28/28 cases (100%).ConclusionsThe RA-TKA system provided considerable pre- and intraoperative surgical assistance to achieve accurate bone resection, appropriate component sizing, and postoperative alignment after RA-TKA."
pub.1011127272,Varus/valgus alignment of the tibial component in total knee arthroplasty,"The varus/valgus alignment of the tibial components of 350 total knee arthroplasties was assessed radiologically. All the tibial components were implanted using an extramedullary guide under the supervision of the senior author. Of components, 96.3% were implanted within 2 degrees of the perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tibia. In order to validate our X-ray assessment, a subgroup of 40 knees was re-assessed using a CT scanogram. Analysis of this subgroup showed a close correlation between the results using the two different methods (mean difference 0.88 degrees, S.D. 0.75). We believe that with anticipated future advances in robotic and computer assisted surgery it is important to set the benchmark for what can be achieved with current technology."
pub.1130476570,Improved Component Placement Accuracy with Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Component position of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been shown to influence prosthetic survivorships and clinical outcomes. Our objective was to compare the three-dimensional accuracy to plan of robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA) with conventional TKA for component position. We conducted a nonrandomized, prospective study comparing 143 RATKA with 86 conventional TKA operated at four U.S. centers between July 2016 and October 2018. Computed tomography (CT) scans obtained approximately 6 weeks postoperatively were analyzed using anatomical landmarks. Absolute deviation from surgical plans were defined as the absolute value of the difference between the CT measurements and surgeons' femoral and tibial component mechanical varus/valgus alignment, tibial component posterior slope, and femoral component internal/external rotation. Differences of absolute deviations were tested using stratified Wilcoxon's tests that controlled for study center. Patient-reported outcome measures collected through 1 postoperative year were modeled using multiple regression controlling for age, sex, body mass index, study center, and the preoperative score. RATKA demonstrated greater accuracy for tibial component alignment (median [25th, 75th percentiles] absolute deviation from plan of all centers combined for conventional vs. RA, 1.7 [0.9, 2.9] vs. 0.9 [0.4, 1.9] degrees, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), femoral component rotation (1.5 [0.9, 2.5] vs. 1.3 [0.6, 2.5] degrees, <i>p</i> = 0.015), and tibial slope (2.9 [1.5, 5.0] vs. 1.1 [0.6, 2.0] degrees, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In multivariable analyses, RATKA showed significantly greater Veterans RAND 12-item health survey (VR-12) physical component scores (adjusted mean difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.4 [0.2, 4.5] points, <i>p</i> = 0.034) and qualitatively greater Knee Society (KS) composite functional scores (3.5 [-1.3, 8.2] points, <i>p</i> = 0.159), though not statistically significant. Compared with conventional instrumentation, RATKA demonstrated greater three-dimensional accuracy to plan for various component positioning parameters and clinical improvements in physical status and function with no major safety concerns during the first postoperative year. These results may be attributed to the preoperative CT scan planning, real-time intraoperative feedback, and stereotactic-guided cutting that takes into consideration patient-specific bony anatomy. These findings support the use of RATKA for enhanced arthroplasty outcomes."
pub.1120769104,"Health Care Utilization and Payer Cost Analysis of Robotic Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty at 30, 60, and 90 Days","This study performed a health care utilization analysis between robotic arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) and manual total knee arthroplasty (mTKA) techniques. Specifically, we compared (1) index costs and (2) discharge dispositions, as well as (3) 30-day (4) 60-day, and (5) 90-day (a) episode-of-care costs, (b) postoperative health care utilization, and (c) readmissions. The 100% Medicare Standard Analytical Files were used for rTKAs and mTKAs performed between January 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017. Based on strict inclusion-exclusion criteria and 1:5 propensity score matching, 519 rTKA and 2,595 mTKA patients were analyzed. Total episode payments, health care utilization, and readmissions, at 30-, 60-, and 90-day time points were compared using generalized linear model, binomial regression, log link, Mann-Whitney, and Pearson's chi-square tests. The rTKA versus mTKA cohort average total episode payment was US$17,768 versus US$19,899 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) at 30 days, US$18,174 versus US$20,492 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) at 60 days, and US$18,568 versus US$20,960 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) at 90 days. At 30 days, 47% fewer rTKA patients utilized skilled nursing facility (SNF) services (13.5 vs. 25.4%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and had lower SNF costs at 30 days (US$6,416 vs. US$7,732; <i>p</i> = 0.0040), 60 days (US$6,678 vs. US$7,901, <i>p</i> = 0.0072), and 90 days (US$7,201 vs. US$7,947, <i>p</i> = 0.0230). rTKA patients also utilized fewer home health visits and costs at each time point (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, 31.3% fewer rTKA patients utilized emergency room services at 30 days postoperatively and had 90-day readmissions (5.20 vs. 7.75%; <i>p</i> = 0.0423). rTKA is associated with lower 30-, 60-, and 90-day postoperative costs and health care utilization. These results are of marked importance given the emphasis to contain and reduce health care costs and provide initial economic insights into rTKA with promising results."
pub.1147898627,THA with Use of Patient-Specific Resurfacing Jigs and a Novel Customized Implant Design,"»: Conventional total hip arthroplasty (THA) largely remains an unguided procedure dependent on the ability and experience of the surgeon. New technologies, such as patient-specific instrumentation and robotics, have shown promising results in improving implant positioning, which has the potential to improve patient outcomes.
»: The use of off-the-shelf (OTS) implant designs, however, limits the success of the technological advances since they are unable to recreate the native anatomy of the joint. The inability to restore femoral offset and version or the presence of implant-related leg-length discrepancies often lead to suboptimal surgical results that increase the risk of dislocation, fractures, and component wear, compromising postoperative functional outcomes and implant longevity.
»: A customized THA system, whereby the femoral stem is designed to restore patient anatomy, has recently been introduced. The THA system uses computed tomography (CT)-derived 3D imaging to create a custom stem, patient-specific component placement, and patient-specific instrumentation that matches the patient's native anatomy.
»: The purpose of this article is to provide information on the design and manufacturing process of this new THA implant, to illustrate the associated preoperative planning, and to describe the surgical technique; 3 surgical cases are presented."

The aim of this study was to identify ranges of implant alignment and bone resections with RA-TKA. We retrospectively reviewed 484 primary RA-TKA cases, stratified by preoperative coronal alignment. Demographics and intraoperative data were collected and compared using Chi-square and ANOVA tests. Planned limb, femoral, and tibial alignment became increasingly varus in a progressive order from valgus to neutral to the highest in varus knees (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Planned external transverse rotation relative to the TEA was lowest in the valgus cohort; relative to the PCA, whereas the varus cohort was highest (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, both). Planned resections of the lateral distal femur and of the medial posterior femur were greater in the varus group compared to neutral and valgus (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There were significant differences between cohorts in planned tibia resections, laterally and medially. Varus knees demonstrated higher variability, while valgus and neutral had more metrics with low variability. This study demonstrated trends in intraoperative planned alignment and resection metrics across various preoperative coronal knee alignments. These findings contribute to the understanding of RA-TKA and may inform surgical decision-making."

METHODS: We used 20 sawbone models of the femur and 20 sawbone models of the tibia and fibula to evaluate the osteotomy effect of 'Skywalker' robot-assisted TKA.
RESULTS: The maximal movement of the cutting jig was less than 0.25 mm at each osteotomy plane. The mean and standard deviation values of the angle deviation between the planned osteotomy plane and the actual osteotomy plane at each osteotomy plane were not more than 1.03° and 0.55°, respectively. The mean and standard deviation values of absolute error of resection thickness at each osteotomy position were less than 0.78 and 0.71 mm, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The 'Skywalker' system has good osteotomy accuracy, can achieve the planned osteotomy well and is expected to assist surgeons in performing accurate TKA in clinical applications in future."
pub.1134811666,Cementless knee arthroplasty: a review of recent performance,"Cementless knee arthroplasty has seen a recent resurgence in popularity due to conceptual advantages, including improved osseointegration providing biological fixation, increased surgical efficiency, and reduced systemic complications associated with cement impaction and wear from cement debris. Increasingly younger and higher demand patients are requiring knee arthroplasty, and as such, there is optimism cementless fixation may improve implant survivorship and functional outcomes. Compared to cemented implants, the National Joint Registry (NJR) currently reports higher revision rates in cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but lower in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). However, recent studies are beginning to show excellent outcomes with cementless implants, particularly with UKA which has shown superior performance to cemented varieties. Cementless TKA has yet to show long-term benefit, and currently performs equivalently to cemented in short- to medium-term cohort studies. However, with novel concepts including 3D-printed coatings, robotic-assisted surgery, radiostereometric analysis, and kinematic or functional knee alignment principles, it is hoped they may help improve the outcomes of cementless TKA in the long-term. In addition, though cementless implant costs remain higher due to novel implant coatings, it is speculated cost-effectiveness can be achieved through greater surgical efficiency and potential reduction in revision costs. There is paucity of level one data on long-term outcomes between fixation methods and the cost-effectiveness of modern cementless knee arthroplasty. This review explores recent literature on cementless knee arthroplasty, with regards to clinical outcomes, implant survivorship, complications, and cost-effectiveness; providing a concise update to assist clinicians on implant choice.

pub.1165383957,Current outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral arthritis – A narrative review,"Patellofemoral (PFJ) arthritis can be primary, or secondary to underlying trochlea dysplasia and patellofemoral malalignment. Although primary PFJ osteoarthritis affects an older patient population, just like tibiofemoral arthritis, it is common for younger patients to present with isolated PFJ arthritis secondary to an abnormal PFJ. PFJ arthroplasty (PFJA) has many benefits including being less invasive, associated with lower blood loss, is more cost-effective, and leaves the kinematics of the tibiofemoral joint undisturbed. As a result, there are arguably better functional outcomes associated with PFJA, however the historical revision rate of this procedure is high. Although registry outcome data associated with the first generation of PFJ implants shows a higher revision rate compared to TKA, the comparison of PFJ outcomes with TKA is not always age-matched and there is limited comparison on functional and patient-reported outcomes, something which is more important and relevant in a younger patient cohort. Improvements in implant design, instrumentation, surgical technique, and better patient selection has now resulted in outcomes which are comparable to that of TKA, and in some cases even better. This narrative review outlines the current outcomes of PFJA including highlighting factors which need to be considered in optimising outcomes, as well as discussing advanced techniques of robotic assisted PFJA."

As obesity and age rates continue to rise in the U.S., the demand for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is expected to grow significantly by 2030. Advanced techniques such as robotic-assisted (RA-TKA) aim to address this growing concern and improve patient quality-of-life. Since utilization of RA-TKA increased from 2010 to 2018, it is important to compare RA-TKA to conventional TKA (C-TKA) performance. This study compares RA-TKA to C-TKA in patient-reported WOMAC scores and objective range of motion (ROM) scores in eligible short-term (one-year or less) and long-term (one-year to fifteen-years) postoperative follow-up studies.
Methods: A systematic review using the PubMed database was performed to identify articles including RA-TKA, CA-TKA, C-TKA, WOMAC scores, and ROM scores.
Results: Between RA-TKA and C-TKA, weighted analysis found significant effects in short-term (15.45, 95% CI: 4.96-25.94) and long-term (2.62, 95% CI: 0.62-4.61) WOMAC scores.
Conclusion: As approximately 7-20% of C-TKA surgeries result in poor subjective outcomes, and with revision rates and the demand for TKA set to rise, our analysis suggests that patient quality-of-life and cost effectiveness may be significantly improved by RA-TKA over C-TKA."
pub.1174584978,Different intraoperative joint laxity patterns do not impact clinical outcomes in robotic‐assisted medial unicompartmental knee replacement with 1‐to‐1 surface reconstruction,"PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted technology in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (mUKA) allows for customized adjustments of joint laxity through virtual preoperative component positioning before bone preparation. Nevertheless, the optimal balancing curve has yet to be delineated. This study sought to investigate if varying intraoperative knee laxity patterns had any impact on postoperative patient outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on prospectively collected data from 326 fixed-bearing RAUKA procedures performed between 2018 and 2022 with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Patients were categorized into three cohorts based on intraoperative joint laxity patterns (millimetres of joint gap during valgus stress) imparted at 20°, 60°, 90° and 120° of knee flexion: cohort 1 < +0.5 mm (tight); cohort 2 between 0.6 and 1.9 mm (physiologic); cohort 3 > 2 mm (loose). Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to assess patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) improvements and preoperative and postoperative differences across the cohorts. A Spearman's test evaluated the correlation between knee balance at all degrees of flexion and preoperative and postoperative HKA.
RESULTS: No differences in preoperative and postoperative PROMs were identified across the cohorts (p > 0.05). All three cohorts with different joint laxity patterns showed a significant improvement in the postoperative PROMS (p < 0.05). The preoperative or postoperative limb alignment did not significantly affect clinical outcomes relative to different laxity patterns.
CONCLUSION: No differences were found in the outcomes across different joint laxity patterns in robotic-assisted medial UKA using fixed-bearing mUKAs. There was no evident advantage for maintaining a closer to physiologic laxity compared to tighter or looser balancing.

pub.1164982479,Correction of Coronal Deformity and Intercompartmental Imbalance through Bone Resection,"This review discusses the correction of coronal deformity and intercompartmental imbalance through bone resection in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). To achieve functional knee balance, coronal, rotational, and sagittal alignment are critical to successful patient outcomes. Though variations in coronal alignment are debated as a correlate to positive results, advancements in utilizing implant position, alignment, and soft tissue balance to improve patient outcomes and function are an evolving discussion. This study draws upon existing literature, clinical studies, and surgical techniques related to TKA, including advancements in navigation and robotics. The study highlights the importance of individualized alignment strategies for varus and valgus knees. While mechanical neutral alignment has shown excellent long-term data, reevaluating the anatomic recreation of the patient's joint line obliquity is now being studied extensively. Sensor data and navigation systems contribute to improved outcomes and patient satisfaction. The evolution of navigation and robotics has led surgeons to achieve their target angles consistently and accurately; now, the discussion is around the most effective alignment targets. The classification of various phenotypes assists in the proposed starting points for implant position, but soft tissue tension is required in the input data to achieve global balance and stable motion. Each approach's advantages and limitations are considered. In conclusion, achieving optimal coronal alignment, joint line obliquity, and soft tissue balance is crucial for successful TKA outcomes. Personalized alignment philosophies, supported by three-dimensional data and sensor technology, are evolving to minimize critical errors and enhance functional results. Robotic assistance and future advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning hold promise for further improving TKA outcomes in the quest for soft tissue stabilization."
pub.1113299785,Patient-Reported Functional and Satisfaction Outcomes after Robotic-Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: Early Results of a Prospective Multicenter Investigation,"The purpose of this study was to perform a 3-month interim comparative analysis on outcomes between robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) and manual TKA patients. Specifically, we evaluated (1) patient self-reported symptoms, (2) expectations and satisfaction, and (3) functional activities, based on the 2011 Knee Society Scoring System. Between June 1, 2016, and March 31, 2018, 252 patients (102 manual and 150 robotic) were enrolled into a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter comparative cohort study. Functional activity scores, patient-reported symptoms, as well as satisfaction and expectation scores were obtained from the 2011 Knee Society Scoring System preoperatively, at 4 to 6 weeks, and at 3 months postoperatively. Student's <i>t</i>-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and chi-square tests with α set at 0.05 were used to compare between-group mean improvements from baseline. At 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively, RATKA patients were found to have significantly larger improvements in walking and standing (1.4 vs. -1.2 points; <i>p</i> = 0.019). RATKA patients were also found to have larger improvements in advanced activities (1.3 vs. 2.3 points), pain with walking (3.3 vs. 3.2 points), satisfaction score (12.4 vs. 12 points), and expectations score (5.1 vs. 4.4 points) when compared with manual TKA patients. At 3 months, RATKA patients were also found to have larger improvements in walking and standing (6.0 vs. 4.8 points), standard activities (11.4 vs. 10.1 points), advanced activities (6.2 vs. 4.6 points), functional activities total score (22.8 vs. 21.2 points), pain with walking (4.3 vs. 4.1 points), total symptoms score (10.5 vs. 10.3 points), satisfaction score (17.0 vs. 15.5 points), expectations score (4.8 vs. 4.0 points) when compared with manual TKA patients. The data indicate RATKA patients to have equal or greater improvements in 9 out of 10 of the Knee Society Scoring System components assessed at 3 months postoperatively, though not all findings were statistically significant. Since this is an early results report, this study will be continued for a longer follow-up, but we are encouraged by these interim results."
pub.1030875034,Modular design of a miniaturized surgical robot system,"Currently, there are only a small number of robotic systems used in various surgical fields. As modified industrial robot systems have shown significant limitations in the past, specialized kinematic solutions have been proposed for specific surgical applications. The majority of these systems are designed for specific applications in only a limited number of cases. The acquisition and operating costs are high, hindering the dissemination and broad clinical application of such systems. To address this problem, a modular mini-robot system is proposed, which can be easily adapted to different application-specific requirements. Therefore, the requirements of different applications have been categorized and clustered to a standardized requirement profile. Next, a modular robot based on a hybrid kinematic module structure has been developed. This concept has been implemented and tested in in vitro studies for different applications, such as revision total hip replacement and unicondylar knee arthroplasty. User-orientated tests of the intraoperative handling, as well as accuracy tests, proved the feasibility of the concept."
pub.1129307436,Comparative Cost Analysis of Robotic-Assisted and Jig-Based Manual Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Excellent durability with traditional jig-based manual total knee arthroplasty (mTKA) has been noted, but substantial rates of dissatisfaction remain. Robotic-assisted TKA (raTKA) was introduced to improve clinical outcomes, but associated costs have not been well studied. The purpose of our study is to compare 90-day episode-of-care (EOC) costs for mTKA and raTKA. A retrospective review of an institutional database from 4/2015 to 9/2017 identified consecutive mTKAs and raTKAs using a single implant system performed by one surgeon. The raTKA platform became available at our institution in October 2016. Prior to this date, all TKAs were performed with mTKA technique. After this date, all TKAs were performed using robotic-assistance without exception. Sequential cases were included for both mTKA and raTKA with no patients excluded. Clinical and financial data were obtained from medical and billing records. Ninety-day EOC costs were compared. Statistical analysis was performed by departmental statistician. One hundred and thirty nine mTKAs and 147 raTKAs were identified. No significant differences in patient characteristics were noted. Total intraoperative costs were higher ($10,295.17 vs. 9,998.78, respectively, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and inpatient costs were lower ($3,893.90 vs. 5,587.40, respectively, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) comparing raTKA and mTKA. Length of stay (LOS) was reduced 25% (1.2 vs. 1.6 days, respectively, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and prescribed opioids were reduced 57% (984.2 versus 2240.4 morphine milligram equivalents, respectively, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) comparing raTKA with mTKA. Ninety-day EOC costs were $2,090.70 lower for raTKA compared with mTKA ($15,629.94 vs. 17,720.64, respectively; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The higher intraoperative costs associated with raTKA were offset by greater savings in postoperative costs for the 90-day EOC compared with mTKA. Higher intraoperative costs were driven by the cost of the robot, maintenance fees, and robot-specific disposables. Cost savings with raTKA were primarily driven by reduced instrument pan reprocessing fees, shorter LOS, and reduced prescribed opioids compared with mTKA technique. raTKA demonstrated improved value compared with mTKA based on significantly lower average 90-day EOC costs and superior quality exemplified by reduced LOS, less postoperative opioid requirements, and reduced postdischarge resource utilization."
pub.1123967461,Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty has a greater early functional outcome when compared to manual total knee arthroplasty for isolated medial compartment arthritis,"AIMS: The primary aim of the study was to compare the knee-specific functional outcome of robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (rUKA) with manual total knee arthroplasty (mTKA) for the management of isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis. Secondary aims were to compare length of hospital stay, general health improvement, and satisfaction between rUKA and mTKA.
METHODS: A powered (1:3 ratio) cohort study was performed. A total of 30 patients undergoing rUKA were propensity score matched to 90 patients undergoing mTKA for isolated medial compartment arthritis. Patients were matched for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and preoperative function. The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) were collected preoperatively and six months postoperatively. The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) and patient satisfaction were collected six months postoperatively. Length of hospital stay was also recorded.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the preoperative demographics (p ⩾ 0.150) or function (p ⩾ 0.230) between the groups. The six-month OKS was significantly greater in the rUKA group when compared with the mTKA group (difference 7.7, p < 0.001). There was also a greater six-month postoperative EQ-5D (difference 0.148, p = 0.002) and FJS (difference 24.2, p < 0.001) for the rUKA when compared to the mTKA. No patient was dissatisfied in the rUKA group and five (6%) were dissatisfied in the mTKA, but this was not significant (p = 0.210). Length of stay was significantly (p < 0.001) shorter in the rUKA group (median two days, interquartile range (IQR) 1 to 3) compared to the mTKA (median four days, IQR 3 to 5).
CONCLUSION: Patients with isolated medial compartment arthritis had a greater knee-specific functional outcome and generic health with a shorter length of hospital stay after rUKA when compared to mTKA.Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint Res</i> 2019;9(1):15-22."
pub.1040607909,Accuracy of a freehand sculpting tool for unicondylar knee replacement,"BACKGROUND: Unicondylar knee replacement is technically challenging and malalignment of the implant components is one of the factors that results in high failure rates. Surgical robotics with navigation is emerging as a potential solution to improve the accuracy of implant placement.
METHODS: The accuracy of performing unicondylar knee replacement using a freehand sculpting, semi-active robotic tool was investigated using 20 synthetic femurs and tibia. Resultant femoral and tibial implant placement was compared to the planned implant position.
RESULTS: The maximum rotational error was 3.2(o) and RMS angular error was 1.46(o) across all orientations, for both the tibia and femoral implants. The maximum translational error was 1.18 mm and the RMS translational error across all directions was 0.61 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: The freehand sculpting tool produced accurate implant placement with small errors comparable to those reported by other robotic-assistive devices on the market for unicondylar knee replacement."
pub.1156183076,Comparable accuracy of femoral joint line reconstruction in different kinematic and functional alignment techniques,"PURPOSE: A key part of kinematic alignment (KA) and functional alignment (FA) is to restore the natural femoral joint line, in particular the medial joint line. KA is known to reproduce the femoral joint line accurately; however, direct comparisons with other surgical techniques such as FA are currently lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences of alignment parameters in KA and FA techniques with a special focus given to the femoral joint line.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective radiological analysis of pre- and postoperative long leg radiographs of 221 consecutive patients with varus or neutral leg alignment, who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures from 2018 to 2020. Patients were assigned to one of four groups: (1) FA: image-based robotic-assisted TKA, (2) FA: imageless robotic-assisted TKA, (3): restricted KA: 3D cutting block-assisted (patient-specific instruments, PSI) TKA, (4): unrestricted KA: calipered technique. Patients' radiographs were (re)-analyzed for overall limb alignment, medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), as well as medial and lateral femoral joint line alteration. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired t testing (FA vs. KA group) and one-way ANOVA (subgroup analyses).
RESULTS: Comparisons of KA vs. FA, as well as individual subgroups of KA and FA did not show any differences in the accuracy of medial joint line reconstruction (< 2 mm, p = 0.384, p = 0.744, respectively) and LDFA alteration (< 2°, p = 0.997, 0.921, respectively). Correction of MPTA (3.4° vs. 2.2°) and lateral femoral joint line (2.1 mm vs. 1.5 mm) was higher for FA and FA subgroups compared to KA and KA subgroups (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Kinematic and functional alignments showed a comparable accuracy in reconstruction of the medial femoral joint line and femoral joint line orientation. Increased correction of MPTA and lateral femoral joint line was recorded with FA techniques.

pub.1145744984,"Effect of tourniquet use on blood loss, pain, functional recovery, and complications in robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial","BackgroundRobot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been largely studied to confirm its advantages in terms of accurate component positioning, microembolus formation, less blood loss, and so on, but is currently usually performed under tourniquet due to its longer operative time than conventional TKA. The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of tourniquet use in robot-assisted TKA on blood loss, pain, functional recovery, and complications.MethodsPatients scheduled for robot-assisted TKA were prospectively randomized into a tourniquet or non-tourniquet group (each n = 14). The primary outcome measure was blood loss. The secondary outcome measures were operation time; visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores; time to achieve the first straight-leg raise; swelling of the thigh, knee, and calf; range of motion; Hospital for Special Surgery score; length of stay; and postoperative complications.ResultsThere was no significant difference in total blood loss between the tourniquet and non-tourniquet groups (738.57 ± 276.158 vs. 866.85 ± 243.422 ml, P = 0.061). The tourniquet group showed significantly lower intraoperative blood loss (P < 0.001), but higher hidden blood loss (P = 0.002). The non-tourniquet group showed better knee range of motion on postoperative days (PODs) 1–3 (all P < 0.001), less thigh swelling on PODs 2 and 3 (P < 0.05), earlier straight-leg raising (P = 0.044), and shorter length of stay (P = 0.044). Thigh pain VAS score at 1 month after surgery was significantly greater in the tourniquet group (P < 0.001), as was knee pain during activity and at rest on PODs 2–3 (all P < 0.05). The tourniquet group also showed a significantly higher rate of tension blisters (28.8% vs. 7.1%, P = 0.038).ConclusionsTourniquet use during robot-assisted TKA does not reduce total blood loss, and it appears to increase postoperative pain, aggravate muscle injury, and prolong postoperative recovery.Trial registration ChiCTR, ChiCTR2100041800.

pub.1159712985,Learning curve and short-term clinical outcomes of a new seven-axis robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty system: a propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study,"ObjectiveThe purpose of the present study was to determine the learning curve for a novel seven-axis robot-assisted (RA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) system and to explore whether it could provide superior short-term clinical and radiological outcomes compared with conventional surgery.MethodsIn the present retrospective study, 90 patients who underwent RA-TKA were included in robot-assisted system (RAS) group and 90 patients who underwent conventional TKA were included in the conventional group. The duration of surgery and robot-related complications were recorded to evaluate the learning curve through cumulative sum and risk-adjusted cumulative sum methods. The demographic data, preoperative clinical data, preoperative imaging data, duration of surgery, alignment of the prosthesis, lower limb force line alignment, Knee Society score, 10-cm visual analog scale pain score and range of motion were compared between the RAS and conventional groups. In addition, the proficiency group was compared with the conventional group using propensity score matching.ResultsRA-TKA was associated with a learning curve of 20 cases for the duration of surgery. There was no significant difference in indicators representing the accuracy of the prosthetic installation between the learning and proficiency phases in RA-TKA group patients. A total of 49 patients in the proficiency group were matched with 49 patients from the conventional group. The number of postoperative hip–knee–ankle (HKA) angle, component femoral coronal angle (CFCA), component tibial coronal angle (CTCA), and sagittal tibial component angle (STCA) outliers in the proficiency phase was lower than that in the conventional group, while deviations of the HKA angle, CFCA, CTCA, and STCA in the proficiency phase were significantly lower than those in the conventional group (P < 0.05).ConclusionIn summary, from the learning curve data, 20 cases are required for a surgeon using a novel seven-axis RA-TKA system to enter the proficiency phase. In the proficiency group, compared with the conventional group using propensity score matching, the RAS was found to be superior to the conventional group in prosthesis and lower limb alignment."
pub.1140335167,Augmented-Reality-Assisted K-Wire Placement for Glenoid Component Positioning in Reversed Shoulder Arthroplasty: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"The accuracy of the implant's post-operative position and orientation in reverse shoulder arthroplasty is known to play a significant role in both clinical and functional outcomes. Whilst technologies such as navigation and robotics have demonstrated superior radiological outcomes in many fields of surgery, the impact of augmented reality (AR) assistance in the operating room is still unknown. Malposition of the glenoid component in shoulder arthroplasty is known to result in implant failure and early revision surgery. The use of AR has many promising advantages, including allowing the detailed study of patient-specific anatomy without the need for invasive procedures such as arthroscopy to interrogate the joint's articular surface. In addition, this technology has the potential to assist surgeons intraoperatively in aiding the guidance of surgical tools. It offers the prospect of increased component placement accuracy, reduced surgical procedure time, and improved radiological and functional outcomes, without recourse to the use of large navigation or robotic instruments, with their associated high overhead costs. This feasibility study describes the surgical workflow from a standardised CT protocol, via 3D reconstruction, 3D planning, and use of a commercial AR headset, to AR-assisted k-wire placement. Post-operative outcome was measured using a high-resolution laser scanner on the patient-specific 3D printed bone. In this proof-of-concept study, the discrepancy between the planned and the achieved glenoid entry point and guide-wire orientation was approximately 3 mm with a mean angulation error of 5°."
pub.1022716188,A novel toolpath force prediction algorithm using CAM volumetric data for optimizing robotic arthroplasty,"PurposeRobotic total hip arthroplasty is a procedure in which milling operations are performed on the femur to remove material for the insertion of a prosthetic implant. The robot performs the milling operation by following a sequential list of tool motions, also known as a toolpath, generated by a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. The purpose of this paper is to explain a new toolpath force prediction algorithm that predicts cutting forces, which results in improving the quality and safety of surgical systems.MethodsWith a custom macro developed in the CAM system’s native application programming interface, cutting contact patch volume was extracted from CAM simulations. A time domain cutting force model was then developed through the use of a cutting force prediction algorithm. The second portion validated the algorithm by machining a hip canal in simulated bone using a CNC machine. Average cutting forces were measured during machining using a dynamometer and compared to the values predicted from CAM simulation data using the proposed method.ResultsThe results showed the predicted forces matched the measured forces in both magnitude and overall pattern shape. However, due to inconsistent motion control, the time duration of the forces was slightly distorted. Nevertheless, the algorithm effectively predicted the forces throughout an entire hip canal procedure.ConclusionThis method provides a fast and easy technique for predicting cutting forces during orthopedic milling by utilizing data within a CAM software."
pub.1164112788,Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Has Similar Rates of Prosthetic Noise Generation as Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: Noise has been reported to occur with relatively high frequency after conventional total knee arthroplasty (C-TKA), and this may impact the incidence of patient satisfaction and function. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of patient-reported prosthetic noise generation after robotically-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) and C-TKA.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted of unilateral primary RA-TKAs and C-TKAs performed between 2018 and 2021. Patients completed a survey consisting of 4 Likert scale questions related to prosthetic noise generation and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score Joint Replacement and Forgotten Joint Score were assessed prospectively preoperatively and at a minimum of 1-year of clinical follow-up. Statistical analysis was done utilizing T-tests and chi-square tests, with statistical significance defined as a <i>P</i>-value &lt; .05.
Results: One hundred sixty-two RA-TKAs and 320 C-TKAs with similar baseline characteristics and functions were included. There were no significant differences in hearing or feeling grinding, popping, clicking, or clunking (40.7% vs 38.1%; <i>P</i> = .647) between groups. Most RA-TKAs and C-TKAs were not dissatisfied regarding noise generation (70.4% vs 73.1%; <i>P</i> = .596). In both cohorts, patients who reported noise generation had lower average Forgotten Joint Scores (45.5 vs 66.1; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and lower postoperative Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score Joint Replacement scores (72.0 vs 81.4; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) than those who did not experience noise generation.
Conclusions: While RA-TKA may facilitate soft tissue balancing, there were no differences in prosthetic noise generation between RA-TKA and C-TKA. However, those who experience implant-generated noise have lower functional outcome scores."
pub.1160296211,Optimizing Asymmetric Native Knee Flexion Gap Balance Promotes Superior Outcomes in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Replicating native knee kinematics remains the ultimate goal of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Technology, such as robotics, provides robust intraoperative data; however, no evidence-based targets currently exist for improved clinical outcomes. Furthermore, some surgeons target a rectangular flexion space in TKA unlike the native knee. This study evaluated the effect of in vivo flexion gap asymmetry on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in contemporary TKA.
METHODS: In vivo tibiofemoral joint space dimensions were measured during 129 TKAs using a calibrated tension device before and after complete posterior cruciate ligament resection. PROMs were compared based on the final dimensions and the change in flexion gap dimensions at 90° of flexion: (1) equal laxity, (2) lateral laxity, and (3) medial laxity. Groups did not differ by demographics ( P ≥ 0.347), clinical follow-up ( P = 0.134), tibiofemoral alignment ( P = 0.498), or preoperative PROMs ( P ≥ 0.093). Mean follow-up for the cohort was 1.5 years (range, 1-3).
RESULTS: Pain with climbing stairs, pain while standing upright, and knees ""always feeling normal"" scores were superior for patients with equal or lateral laxity compared with medial laxity ( P ≤ 0.064). Pain with level walking, University of California Los Angeles activity level, KOOS JR, and satisfaction scores also tended to be superior for patients with equal or lateral laxity, although it lacked statistical significance ( P ≥ 0.111).
DISCUSSION: Results of this study suggest that patients with either an equally tensioned rectangular flexion space or with later-flexion lateral laxity after posterior cruciate ligament resection may achieve superior PROMs. Findings support the clinical benefit of facilitating posterolateral femoral roll back in flexion, which mimics native knee kinematics and further helps define targets for advanced technology."
pub.1145783928,Avoiding Femoral Canal Instrumentation in Computer-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty With Contemporary Blood Management Had Minimal Differences in Blood Loss and Transfusion Rates Compared to Conventional Techniques,"BACKGROUND: Computer-assisted surgery that does not utilize femoral canal instrumentation is theorized to have less blood loss. However, there is a paucity of data on this, particularly in the era of tranexamic acid use. We sought to analyze the association of computer navigation with total calculated blood loss and transfusion rate in patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: We identified 14,890 patients who underwent unilateral primary TKA at a single institution from 2016 to 2020. Computer-assisted surgery in the form of an accelerometer or robotics was utilized in 4,165 TKAs (28%). Drains were utilized in 4,860 TKAs (32%). We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine if computer navigation reduced the rate of blood transfusion and linear regression analysis to determine the impact of computer navigation on blood loss.
RESULTS: In total, 542 patients (3.6%) underwent a transfusion. The average change in hemoglobin (Hgb) was 2.1 g/dL (standard deviation [SD] 0.91) and average total calculated blood loss was 310 mL (SD = 154). In a multivariate regression model, computer navigation was not protective of transfusion (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, P = .73). Preoperative Hgb <10 (OR 10.5, P < .0001) and drain use (OR 2.25, P < .0001) were the most significant risk factors for transfusion. In a linear regression model, computer navigation reduced blood loss by 19 mL (SD 2.94, P < .0001) per case.
CONCLUSION: In this large retrospective cohort analysis of contemporary TKA patients, computer-assisted surgery that eliminates intramedullary femoral canal instrumentation during primary TKA was not associated with reduced transfusion rates and had minimal differences in overall blood loss."
pub.1157252167,Maintaining Joint Line Obliquity Optimizes Outcomes of Functional Alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients With Constitutionally Varus Knees,"BACKGROUND: Functional alignment (FA) strives to balance the knee soft-tissue envelope during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using implant alignment adjustments rather than soft-tissue releases. There is a debate on how best to achieve FA. We compared minimum two-year outcomes between FA with a mechanical alignment plan [FA(m)] and FA with a kinematic alignment plan [FA(k)]. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in outcomes between FA(m) and FA(k).
METHODS: Prospective data was collected from 300 consecutive robotic-assisted FA TKAs [135 FA(m) and 165 FA(k)]. Patient reported outcomes were obtained preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. The coronal plane alignment of the knee classification was used to classify knee alignment phenotypes.
RESULTS: Overall limb alignment was equivalent between groups. Final implant alignment was different between FA(m) and FA(k) groups, with FA(k) TKAs having higher tibial varus (P < .01), higher femoral valgus (P < .01), and higher joint line obliquity (P < .01). Patients reported higher Forgotten Joint Score-12 scores with FA(k) TKAs (79.4 versus 71.6, P = .018) and greater range of motion (125 versus 121°; P = .003). Patients who had constitutional varus reported the greatest improvement with FA(k) technique (Forgotten Joint Score at minimum 2 years of 89 versus 65; P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Utilizing an individualized alignment plan [FA(k)] led to a final implant position with greater joint line obliquity, yet the same overall limb alignment. This was associated with improved outcomes at 2 years post-TKA in patients who had constitutional varus. Three-dimensional component position and joint line obliquity affect the outcomes following TKA independently of coronal limb alignment."
pub.1147661909,Impact of Component Alignment and Soft Tissue Release on 2-Year Outcomes in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of alignment and soft tissue release on patient outcomes following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: In a multicenter study, soft tissue releases during TKA were prospectively documented in 330 robotic-assisted TKAs. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were captured postoperatively. Delphi analysis was used to determine inlier and outlier component alignment boundaries: Tibia Coronal (TC): ±3°, Femur Coronal (FC): ±3°, Femoral Axial (FA): 3°Int-6°Ext, Hip-Knee-Ankle (HKA): 3°Val-4°Var, and Tibiofemoral Axial (TFA): 3°Int-6°Ext. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance tests were used to compare groups.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between any individual or grouped inlier and outlier alignment criterion and KOOS at any timepoint. Outlier alignment frequencies were: TC: 0%, FC: 12%, FA: 8%, HKA: 9%, TFA: 8%, and Any: 23%. Soft tissue releases were performed in 18% of cases. Knees with soft tissue releases reported significantly worse KOOS scores at: 6M: Symptoms (80.0 versus 75.3, P = .03), activities of daily living (ADL) (86.2 versus 80.8, P = .030), quality of life (70.1 versus 60.9, P = .008), 12M ADL (90.0 versus 85.1, P = .023), and 24M ADL (91.9 versus 87.2, P = .016). A higher proportion of patients achieved Minimal Clinically Important Difference for pain at 6 months for those having no releases versus released (92.3% versus 81.0%, P = .021). No significant associations were found between preoperative deformity and preoperative or postoperative KOOS.
CONCLUSION: The addition of soft tissue releases after bony cuts is associated with worse KOOS scores out to 2 years and was more prevalent in knees with worse deformity, while no such association was found for alignment."
pub.1173902327,The influence of implant factors on patient outcomes in primary total knee arthroplasty,"Background: The influence of implant factors on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has previously been studied but findings are often inconsistent, restricted in scope and biased by confounding factors. This study aims to determine the association between implant-related factors and early post-operative PROMs after TKA.
Methods: Using data from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) PROMs program, the study included 9487 primary TKA procedures performed in 43 hospitals from July 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020. Data included baseline demographic data, surgical details and PROMs collected pre- and 6 months post-operatively. Seven prosthesis characteristics were incorporated in the multivariable model, with proportional odds ordinal regression analysis used to assess their effects on post-operative Oxford knee score (OKS) and joint pain. Adjustments were made for pre-operative OKS and joint pain, as well as potential patient confounders.
Results: At six months, fixed bearing implants showed higher odds of better OKS compared to mobile bearing implants (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.37. p < 0.004). Similar findings were found with the use of image derived instrumentation (IDI) (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI 1.11-1.46, p < 0.001), robotic assisted vs. non-navigated knees (OR = 1.21, 95 % CI 1.06-1.38, p < 0.005) and no patella resurfacing (OR = 1.10, 95 % CI 1.01-1.20, p < 0.032). For lower pain scores at six months, the use of highly crosslinked polyethylene (OR = 1.12, 95 % CI 1.02-1.22, p < 0.015), cemented femoral components (OR = 1.11, 95 % CI 1.01-1.22, p < 0.024), IDI (OR = 1.20, 95 % CI 1.05-1.37, p < 0.009) or no patella resurfacing (OR = 1.10, 95 % CI 1.01-1.20, p < 0.034) were associated.
Conclusion: Utilizing a fixed bearing or robotic assistance correlated with improved OKS scores, whereas highly crosslinked polyethylene or cemented femoral components were associated with improved pain scores. At six months, the use of IDI compared to non-navigated TKA, and patellar resurfacing showed both improved OKS and pain scores."
pub.1170371151,Patient-reported outcome differences for navigated and robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty frequently do not achieve clinically important differences: a systematic review,"INTRODUCTION: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) using computer-assisted navigation (N-THA) and robot-assisted surgery (RA-THA) has been increasingly adopted to improve implant positioning and offset/leg-length restoration. Whether clinically meaningful differences in patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) compared to conventional THA (C-THA) are achieved with intraoperative technology has not been established. This systematic review aimed to assess whether published relative PROM improvements with technology use in THA achieved minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs).
METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE/Cochrane Library were systematically reviewed for studies comparing PROMs for primary N-THA or RA-THA with C-THA as the control group. Relative improvement differences between groups were compared to established MCID values. Reported clinical and radiographic differences were assessed. Review of N-THA and RA-THA literature yielded 6 (<i>n</i> <i>=</i> 2580) and 10 (<i>n</i> <i>=</i> 2786) studies, respectively, for analyses.
RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in postoperative PROM scores were reported in 2/6 (33.3%) studies comparing N-THA with C-THA, though only 1 (16.7%) reported clinically significant relative improvements. Statistically significant improvements in postoperative PROMs were reported in 6/10 (60.0%) studies comparing RA-THA and C-THA, though none reported clinically significant relative improvements. Improved radiographic outcomes for N-THA and RA-THA were reported in 83.3% and 70.0% of studies, respectively. Only 1 study reported a significant improvement in revision rates with RA-THA as compared to C-THA.
CONCLUSIONS: Reported PROM scores in studies comparing N-THA or RA-THA to C-THA often do not achieve clinically significant relative improvements. Future studies reporting PROMs should be interpreted in the context of validated MCID values to accurately establish the clinical impact of intraoperative technology."
pub.1174719588,Is it feasible to develop a supervised learning algorithm incorporating spinopelvic mobility to predict impingement in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty?,"Aims: Precise implant positioning, tailored to individual spinopelvic biomechanics and phenotype, is paramount for stability in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Despite a few studies on instability prediction, there is a notable gap in research utilizing artificial intelligence (AI). The objective of our pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of developing an AI algorithm tailored to individual spinopelvic mechanics and patient phenotype for predicting impingement.
Methods: This international, multicentre prospective cohort study across two centres encompassed 157 adults undergoing primary robotic arm-assisted THA. Impingement during specific flexion and extension stances was identified using the virtual range of motion (ROM) tool of the robotic software. The primary AI model, the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM), used tabular data to predict impingement presence, direction (flexion or extension), and type. A secondary model integrating tabular data with plain anteroposterior pelvis radiographs was evaluated to assess for any potential enhancement in prediction accuracy.
Results: We identified nine predictors from an analysis of baseline spinopelvic characteristics and surgical planning parameters. Using fivefold cross-validation, the LGBM achieved 70.2% impingement prediction accuracy. With impingement data, the LGBM estimated direction with 85% accuracy, while the support vector machine (SVM) determined impingement type with 72.9% accuracy. After integrating imaging data with a multilayer perceptron (tabular) and a convolutional neural network (radiograph), the LGBM's prediction was 68.1%. Both combined and LGBM-only had similar impingement direction prediction rates (around 84.5%).
Conclusion: This study is a pioneering effort in leveraging AI for impingement prediction in THA, utilizing a comprehensive, real-world clinical dataset. Our machine-learning algorithm demonstrated promising accuracy in predicting impingement, its type, and direction. While the addition of imaging data to our deep-learning algorithm did not boost accuracy, the potential for refined annotations, such as landmark markings, offers avenues for future enhancement. Prior to clinical integration, external validation and larger-scale testing of this algorithm are essential."
pub.1169526978,Are robotic-assisted and computer-navigated total hip arthroplasty associated with superior outcomes in patients who have hip dysplasia?,"Introduction: Robotic-assisted (RA) and computer-navigated (CN) total hip arthroplasty (THA) have been demonstrated to improve component placement accuracy compared to manual THA (mTHA) for primary osteoarthritis. As hip dysplasia presents several additional challenges in component placement accuracy and leg length discrepancy (LLD) correction during THA, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate whether utilizing these platforms may be associated with superior outcomes over mTHA in patients who have hip dysplasia.
Methods: PubMed, Medline, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar were searched on September 13, 2023 to identify comparative studies published after January 1, 2000 that evaluated outcomes of RA-THA or CN-THA in patients who have hip dysplasia. The query yielded 197 unique articles, which were screened for alignment with the study aims. After screening, 10 studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria, comprising 946 patients. Risk of bias was evaluated via the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies tool, and the mean score was 21.2 ± 1.5.
Results: Both RA-THA and CN-THA were not associated with improved acetabular anteversion and inclination when evaluating Crowe I-IV types altogether compared to mTHA, but studies reported improved accuracy for each Crowe I and II cases when assessed individually. While studies reporting acetabular cup placement within the Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones consistently found higher odds of accurate positioning for RA-THA versus mTHA, accuracy in achieving targeted center of rotation was mixed. Also, studies reported no difference in LLD restoration for RA-THA and CN-THA compared to mTHA. While operative time may be increased when utilizing these platforms, they may also expedite specific sequences, offsetting most of the increase in operative time.
Conclusion: This review highlights the advantages of RA-THA and CN-THA for patients who have DDH, particularly when treating Crowe I and II types as superior radiographic outcomes were achieved with these intraoperative technologies. However, there remains a need for studies to investigate whether this results in patient-reported outcome measures."
pub.1166257185,Cost-utility analysis of robotic arm-assisted medial compartment knee arthroplasty,"Aims: To perform an incremental cost-utility analysis and assess the impact of differential costs and case volume on the cost-effectiveness of robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (rUKA) compared to manual (mUKA).
Methods: This was a five-year follow-up study of patients who were randomized to rUKA (n = 64) or mUKA (n = 65). Patients completed the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) preoperatively, and at three months and one, two, and five years postoperatively, which was used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Costs for the primary and additional surgery and healthcare costs were calculated.
Results: rUKA was associated with a relative 0.012 QALY gain at five years, which was associated with an incremental cost per QALY of £13,078 for a unit undertaking 400 cases per year. A cost per QALY of less than £20,000 was achieved when ≥ 300 cases were performed per year. However, on removal of the cost for a revision for presumed infection (mUKA group, n = 1) the cost per QALY was greater than £38,000, which was in part due to the increased intraoperative consumable costs associated with rUKA (£626 per patient). When the absolute cost difference (operative and revision costs) was less than £240, a cost per QALY of less than £20,000 was achieved. On removing the cost of the revision for infection, rUKA was cost-neutral when more than 900 cases per year were undertaken and when the consumable costs were zero.
Conclusion: rUKA was a cost-effective intervention with an incremental cost per QALY of £13,078 at five years, however when removing the revision for presumed infection, which was arguably a random event, this was no longer the case. The absolute cost difference had to be less than £240 to be cost-effective, which could be achieved by reducing the perioperative costs of rUKA or if there were increased revision costs associated with mUKA with longer follow-up."
pub.1165283150,The invasiveness of robot-assisted total hip replacement is similar to that of conventional surgery,"Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (R-THA) is increasingly being performed throughout the world. The invasiveness of this operation is unknown. We retrospectively reviewed the cohort of consecutive osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) patients who received primary R-THA or manual THA (M-THA) from January 2020 to January 2022 in our institution. One experienced surgeon performed all procedures. We calculated the propensity score to match similar patients in different groups by multivariate logistic regression analysis for each patient. We included confounders consisting of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and operation time. Preoperative serum markers and Harris hip scores (HHS), postoperative serum markers at first day and third day, complications rate, postoperative HHS and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) at 6 months after surgery of different cohorts were compared. We analyzed 218 ONFH patients treated with THA (98 R-THA patients, and 120 M-THA patients). After propensity score matching, we generated cohorts of 95 patients in R-THA and M-THA groups. We found no significant difference in preoperative serum markers and HHS. In the R-THA cohort, the PLT count was significantly lower on the postoperative day 1 (192.36 ± 41.72 × 109/L Vs 210.47 ± 72.85 × 109/L, p < 0.05). The Hb level was significantly lower on the postoperative third day in the R-THA cohort (98.52 ± 12.99 g/L Vs 104.74 ± 13.15 g/L, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the other serum markers between the cohorts on postoperative day 1 and 3 (p > 0.05). The FJS was significantly higher in the R-THA than M-THA group (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the postoperative HHS or complication rate between the groups (p > 0.05). The R-THA is not associated with a serious invasiveness compared to M-THA. Patients who underwent R-THA had a better early function compared to those who underwent M-THA."
pub.1171995740,Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients Who Have Skeletal Dysplasia: A Center’s Experience With a Mean 9-Year Follow-Up,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients who have skeletal dysplasia (SD) is a technically challenging surgery due to deformity, joint contracture, and associated comorbidities. Patients presenting with this condition have traditionally been treated with conservative measures, leading to poor outcomes. The aim of this study was to follow-up on patients who had SD following TKA, specifically with regards to clinical outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 31 knees (22 patients) with SD that had undergone TKA in our institution were included in our study. The mean follow-up from index surgery was 110.3 months (range: 20 to 291). The type of dysplasia, implant used, and clinical outcomes with patient-reported outcome measures are presented.
RESULTS: There were 8 patients (36.3%) who had a diagnosis of achondroplasia, followed by multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (31.8%) and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (22.7%). There were 14 men and 8 women who had a mean age of 51 years (range: 28 to 73). Custom implants were required in 12 cases (38.7%), custom jigs were used in 6 cases (19.4%), and robotic-assisted surgery was used in 2 (6.5%) TKAs. Hinged prostheses were used in 17 cases (54.8%), posterior-stabilized in 9 (29.0%), and cruciate-retaining implants in 5 (16.1%). There was 1 patient who sustained an intraoperative medial tibial plateau fracture treated with concomitant open reduction and internal fixation. There was 1 revision that occurred during the follow-up period with a patella resurfacing for continued anterior knee pain. Postoperatively, Oxford Knee Scores improved on average by 12.2 points. The 10-year and 20-year all-cause revision-free survival was 96.8, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the technical challenges and complexity associated with this unique patient cohort, we demonstrated excellent implant survivorship and clinical outcomes post-TKA with mid-term to long-term follow-up of more than 20 years. We recommend preoperative cross-sectional imaging for precise planning and implant templating with multidisciplinary team decision-making. Despite our results, functional outcomes remain inferior to primary arthroplasty within the general population, although we still recommend this treatment modality to appropriately counseled patients.

pub.1173873194,Trends and epidemiology in robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty: Reduced complications and shorter hospital stays,"INTRODUCTION: This study provides an in-depth analysis of the immediate postoperative outcomes and implications or robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) compared with conventional TKA (C-TKA), particularly with regard to mortality, complications, hospital stay and costs, drawing from a comprehensive nationwide data set.
METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, the largest all-payer inpatient healthcare database in the United States, was used to identify all patients who underwent RA-TKA or C-TKA from 2016 to 2019. A total of 527,376 cases, representing 2,638,679 patients who underwent elective TKA were identified, of which 88,415 had RA-TKA. To mitigate potential variations and selection bias in baseline characteristics between the two groups, a propensity score-matched analysis was employed to further balance and refine our data set, resulting in 176,830 patients evenly distributed between the groups. Analysis was performed according to demographics, immediate post-operative complications, and economic data, including payor class, length of stay and total charges.
RESULTS: There was a marked shift towards RA-TKA, from an initial 0.70% in 2016 to a notable 7.30% by 2019. Patients who underwent RA-TKA were slightly younger (66.2 ± SD years), compared to the C-TKA group (66.7 ± SD years). Hospital stay was 1.89 days and 2.29 days for RA-TKA and C-TKA, respectively. Charges metrics revealed slightly higher charges for RA-TKA. Less postoperative complications were found in the RA-TKA group, such as blood loss, anaemia, acute kidney injury, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and surgical wound complication. Even following the propensity score matching, these findings remained consistent and statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: RA-TKA use in the United States has grown substantially in the last few years and has been associated with significantly reduced immediate post-operative complications and length of hospital stay compared to C-TKA, offering safer surgical management for TKA patients. Further studies on the short- and long-term outcomes of RA-TKA would improve the understanding of the full potential of this technology.

pub.1172721901,Effect of Posterior Cruciate Ligament Resection on Gap Balancing in Robot‐assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"OBJECTIVE: Retention or sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is one of the most controversial issues while performing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of PCL resection on flexion-extension gaps, femoral component rotation, and bone resection amounts during robot-assisted TKA.
METHODS: This prospective study included 40 patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent robot-assisted posterior-stabilized (PS) TKA between September 2021 and February 2022. Of the patients, 75% were women (30/40) with a mean age and BMI of 72.6 years and 27.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The guidance module and camera stand assembly were used to capture gaps before and after PCL resection. Measurements of femoral component rotation and bone resection amounts were made in cruciate-retaining (CR) TKA mode and PS-TKA mode.
RESULTS: After PCL resection, the mean change in the medial and lateral compartments of flexion gaps increased by 2.0 and 0.6 mm, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Compared with the CR-TKA mode group, the bone resection amounts of the medial posterior condyle and the lateral posterior condyle in the PS-TKA mode group decreased by 2.0 ± 1.1 and 1.1 ± 1.1 mm, respectively, and the external rotation of the femoral prosthesis relative to the posterior condylar axis and trans-epicondylar line was reduced by 1.0° ± 1.3° and 1.2° ± 1.6°, respectively (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The release of the PCL did not affect the extension gap, but significantly increased the flexion gap. Moreover, the increases in the medial flexion gap were greater than those of the lateral flexion gap. After PCL resection, less external rotation of the femoral prosthesis and fewer bone cuts of the posterior femur were needed in PS-TKA."
pub.1075264892,Irregular rotation and shift of computer-assisted femoral stem implantation in THA – an experimental study,"Introduction. The two available computer-assisted surgery robotic systems consist of a preoperative planning computer workstation and an industrial robot with a high speed milling device. During the computed tomography (CT) scan of the hip and the ipsilateral knee for planning the hip arthroplasty, the patient's movements are registered by a bar that is fixed at the patient's leg along its axis. Despite the companies' claim that a high accuracy of implant position can be achieved by this method, misplacements of implants are reported in the literature.Materials and methods. In an experimental study, a cadaver femoral bone was rotated during the CT scan strictly around this bar to simulate a rotational movement of the patient. Using the CT data, the planning of the hip stem and the following preparation of the femur by the robot was possible without detection of the patient's movements by the system. According to the system manual, the computer should stop the planning or give a warning in case of patient movement during the CT scan.Results. The postoperative CT scan of the cadaver femoral bone revealed a rotary deviation and a shift of the stem compared with the original planning, caused by the rotation during the CT scan. Conclusion. We propose using a second bar during the CT scan to detect these movements and thus avoiding misplacement of the implant."
pub.1157784919,Restoration or relative overcorrection of pre‐arthritic coronal alignment leads to improved results following medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: A pre-arthritic alignment strategy for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) aims to restore a patient's native lower limb alignment which may translate into improved outcomes. This study aimed to assess whether patients with pre-arthritically aligned knees versus patients with non-pre-arthritically aligned knees demonstrated improved mid-term outcomes and survivorship following medial UKA. The hypothesis was that pre-arthritic alignment in medial UKA would lead to better postoperative outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 537 robotic-assisted fixed-bearing medial UKA was conducted. During this procedure, the surgical goal was to restore pre-arthritic alignment guided by re-tensioning of the medial collateral ligament (MCL). For study purposes, coronal alignment was retrospectively evaluated using the mechanical hip-knee-ankle angle (mHKA). Pre-arthritic alignment was estimated through the arithmetic hip-knee-ankle (aHKA) algorithm. Knees were grouped according to the difference between postoperative mHKA and estimated pre-arthritic alignment (i.e., mHKA - aHKA) as Group 1 (pre-arthritically aligned: mHKA restored within 2.0° of the aHKA), Group 2 (mHKA > 2.0° overcorrected relative to the aHKA), or Group 3 (mHKA > 2.0° undercorrected relative to the aHKA). Outcomes included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritic Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR), Kujala, proportions of knees achieving the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) for these scores, and survivorship. PASS thresholds for KOOS, JR and Kujala were determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve method.
RESULTS: A total of 369 knees were categorized as Group 1, 107 as Group 2, and 61 as Group 3. At 4.4 ± 1.6 years follow-up, mean KOOS, JR was comparable among groups, while Kujala was significantly worse in Group 3. The proportion of knees achieving the PASS for Kujala (76.5 points) was lower in Group 3 (n = 32; 59%) compared to Group 1 (n = 260; 74%) (p = 0.02). 5-year survivorship was higher in Group 1 and Group 2 (99% and 100%, respectively) compared to Group 3 (91%) (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Pre-arthritically aligned knees and knees with relative overcorrection from their pre-arthritic alignment following medial UKA demonstrated improved mid-term outcomes and survivorship compared to knees with relative under correction from their pre-arthritic alignment. These results encourage restoring or relatively overcorrecting pre-arthritic alignment to optimize outcomes following medial UKA, and caution against under correction from the pre-arthritic alignment.

pub.1163499961,Some Offset Restoration Options Can Paradoxically Lead to Decreased Range of Motion in Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty: A 3-Dimensional Computer Simulation Study,"BACKGROUND: In total hip arthroplasty (THA), femoral offset restoration results in optimal biomechanics and range of motion (ROM) without bone-bone impingement. We hypothesized that differences in implant design features significantly affect bone-bone impingement risk in primary THA.
METHODS: This retrospective computer simulation study included a cohort of 43 primary robotic arm-assisted THA. Considering sagittal pelvic tilt, we measured the maximum external rotation at 0° hip flexion and the maximum internal rotation at both 90° and 100° hip flexion before any bone-bone impingement occurred. To influence the offset, we included neutral or extended polyethylene liners, neutral or plus prosthetic heads, standard or high-offset stems, and stems with 132° or 127° neck angles.
RESULTS: Extended polyethylene liner use resulted in decreased bone-bone impingement for both stems but also decreased prosthetic ROM in hip extension (mean -4.5 to 5°, range -10 to 0°) and hip flexion (mean -3 to 3.7°, range -10 to 0°) due to decreases in head diameter. Using a plus head or different stem offset/neck angle options resulted in either (1) no improvement in ROM (stem 1: 60%; stem 2: 28%) or (2) a paradoxical increase in bone-bone impingement (stem 1 with 127°: 19% and stem 2 with high offset option: 7%).
CONCLUSION: Counterintuitively, a subset of patients experience a paradoxical increase in bone-bone impingement when transitioning from standard to high-offset or varus necks due to the pelvic and proximal femoral bone shape. For this group of patients, preoperative personalized 3-dimensional modeling may help guide implant choice for optimizing outcomes."
pub.1163476322,Predicting Factors for Blood Transfusion in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty Using a Machine Learning Method,"INTRODUCTION: Acute blood loss anemia requiring allogeneic blood transfusion is still a postoperative complication of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aimed to use machine learning models for the prediction of blood transfusion after primary TKA and to identify contributing factors.
METHODS: A total of 2,093 patients who underwent primary TKA at our institution were evaluated using data extracted from the hospital quality improvement database to identify patient demographics and surgical variables that may be associated with blood transfusion. A multilayer perceptron neural network (MPNN) machine learning algorithm was used to predict risk factors for blood transfusion and factors associated with increased length of stay. Statistical analyses including bivariate correlate analysis, Chi-Square test, and Student t-test were performed for demographic analysis and to determine the correlation between blood transfusion and other variables.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated important factors associated with transfusion rates, including preoperative hemoglobin level, preoperative creatinine level, length of surgery, simultaneous bilateral surgeries, tranexamic acid usage, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status score, preoperative albumin level, ethanol usage, preoperative anticoagulation medications, age, and TKA type (conventional versus robotic-assisted). Patients who underwent a blood transfusion had a markedly greater length of stay than those who did not. The MPNN machine learning model achieved excellent performance across discrimination (AUC = 0.894).
DISCUSSION: The MPNN machine learning model showed its power as a statistical analysis tool to predict the ranking of factors for blood transfusion. Traditional statistics are unable to differentiate importance or predict in the same manner as a machine learning model.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that MPNN for the prediction of patient-specific blood transfusion rates after TKA represented a novel application of machine learning with the potential to improve preoperative planning for treatment outcomes."
pub.1148035837,Predictive Gap-balancing Reduces the Extent of Soft-tissue Adjustment Required After Bony Resection in Robot-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty—A Comparison With Simulated Measured Resection,"Background: To understand the extent and frequency of soft-tissue adjustment required to achieve mediolateral (ML) balance in measured resection (MR) vs gap-balancing (GB) total knee arthroplasty, this study compared ML balance and joint laxity throughout flexion between the 2 techniques. The precision of predictive GB in achieving ML balance and laxity was also assessed.
Methods: Two surgeons performed 95 robot-assisted GB total knee arthroplasties with predictive balancing, limiting tibial varus to 3° and adjusting femoral positioning to optimize balance. A robotic ligament tensioner measured joint laxity. Planned MR (pMR) was simulated by applying neutral tibial and femoral coronal resections and 3° of external femoral rotation. ML balance, laxity, component alignment, and resection depths were compared between planned GB (pGB) and pMR. ML balance and laxity were compared between pGB and final GB (fGB).
Results: The proportion of knees with &gt;2 mm of ML imbalance in flexion or extension ranged from 3% to 18% for pGB vs 50% to 53% for pMR (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Rates of ML imbalance &gt;3 mm ranged from 0% to 9% for pGB and 30% to 38% for MR (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The mean pMR laxity was 1.9 mm tighter medially and 1.1 mm tighter laterally than pGB throughout flexion. The mean fGB laxity was greater than the mean pGB laxity by 0.5 mm medially and 1.2 mm laterally (<i>P</i> &lt; .001).
Conclusion: MR led to tighter joints than GB, with ML gap imbalances &gt;3 mm in 30% of knees. GB planning improved ML balance throughout flexion but increased femoral posterior rotation variability and bone resection compared to MR. fGB laxity was likely not clinically significantly different than pGB."
pub.1168743064,What Is the Correlation between Coronal Plane Alignment Measured on Pre- and Postoperative Weight-bearing Radiographs and Intraoperative Navigation When Stress Is Applied to the Knee?,"This study examines the correlation between the weight-bearing (WB) long leg radiograph (LLR)-derived hip-knee-ankle angle (HKAA) and intraoperative supine computer-assisted surgery (CAS)-derived HKAA measurements at the beginning and end of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The primary aim of the study was to determine if WB alignment could be mimicked or inferred based on intraoperative alignment findings. We conducted a prospective analysis from a cohort of 129 TKAs undergoing a CAS TKA at a single center by a single surgeon. The HKAA was recorded using the CAS navigation system immediately postregistration of navigation data and after implantation of the prosthesis. The intraoperative HKAA was recorded in both the supine ""resting"" position of the knee and also while the knee was manipulated in an effort to replicate the patient's WB alignment. These measurements were compared with the HKAA recorded on pre- and postoperative WB LLRs. There was a strong correlation between the preoperative WB LLR HKAA and the intraoperative preimplant CAS-derived stressed HKAA (<i>R</i> = 0.946). However, there was no correlation between the postoperative WB LLR HKAA and the postimplant insertion HKAA as measured intraoperatively via CAS for either a ""resting"" or ""stressed"" position of the operated knee (<i>R</i> = 0.165 and <i>R</i> = 0.041, respectively). Thus, the interpretation of intraoperative alignment data is potentially problematic. Despite technological advances in the development and utilization of computer navigation and robotics in arthroplasty to help obtain the optimal alignment, it would seem apparent from our study that this alignment does not correlate to upright stance postoperatively. Surgeons should apply caution to the strength of assumptions they place on intraoperative coronal plane alignment findings."

This study aimed to quantify the magnitude of leg-length change, prevalence of postoperative LLD, and their clinical implications following medial UKA.
METHODS: Leg length and mechanical hip-knee-ankle angle (mHKA) were retrospectively measured in 332 patients following unilateral robotic-arm assisted medial UKA for medial compartment osteoarthritis, using calibrated long-leg radiographs. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Otcome Score for Joint Replacement and patient satisfaction were analyzed to assess impact of leg-length change and LLD on outcomes.
RESULTS: Following medial UKA, median leg-length change was 2.0 mm (interquartile range, -1.0 to 5.0 mm; P < .001) with a mean correction in mHKA of 4.4° ± 2.7 (P < .001). A total of 158 patients (48%) had a leg-length increase by 0 to 5 mm, 64 (19%) by 6 to 10 mm, and 11 (3%) by >10 mm. Leg-length change was positively correlated with mHKA correction (R = 0.44, P < .001). Postoperatively, moderate (5 to 10 mm) and substantial LLD (≥10 mm) were present in 49% and 17% of patients, respectively. Four-year Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement were comparable between patients with and without substantial postoperative LLD (P = .976). Proportions of satisfied patients were similar between groups (P = .687).
CONCLUSION: Following medial UKA, the majority of patients had a moderate increase in leg length, the magnitude of which was positively correlated to the correction in mechanical alignment. Postoperative substantial LLD was not uncommon (17% prevalence); however, it had no significant impact on patient-reported outcomes or satisfaction at 4 years follow-up."
pub.1031647054,Knee pain caused by a fiducial marker in the medial femoral condyle: A clinical and anatomic study of 20 cases,"After 2-pin-based ROBODOC hip arthroplasty procedures, 10 of 18 patients reported persistent severe pain at the site of pin implantation in the medial femoral condyle. In a cadaver study, we found that the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve, the saphenous nerve and the anterior cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve had been injured by the pins. At least one of these nerves was injured in 11 of the 20 specimens examined. Our findings indicate that the knee-pain may be partly caused by injuries to these nerves."
pub.1071720538,The economics of new age arthroplasty: can we afford it?,"New technology in joint replacement design and materials adds cost that must be documented by improved outcomes. This is not always the case as the recent metal/metal data has shown. The current economics of arthroplasty have put increasing financial pressure on hospitals and will progress under new health care legislation. New technology must be cost-effective and this will be increasingly difficult in an era of outstanding long-term results with current designs. Cost may necessitate less expensive alternatives, eg, generic implants, in arthroplasty patients. Joint replacement surgery has evolved over the past 4 decades into a highly successful surgical procedure. Earlier designs and materials that demonstrated inferior functional and long-term results have disappeared in a Darwinian fashion. Through this evolutionary process many of the current designs have proven efficacy and durability. Current outcome data indicates that hip and knee designs demonstrate 90% to 95% success rates at 15-year follow-up. Technologic advances are necessary to improve implant design and materials, however, only in an environment of reduced reimbursement to hospitals can the increase cost be justified."
pub.1045115204,Computer-Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery and Robotic Surgery in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Various systems of computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) in total hip arthroplasty (THA) were reviewed. The first clinically applied system was an active robotic system (ROBODOC), which performed femoral implant cavity preparation as programmed preoperatively. Several reports on cementless THA with ROBODOC showed better stem alignment and less variance in limb-length inequality on radiographic evaluation, less incidence of pulmonary embolic events on transesophageal cardioechogram, and less stress shielding on the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis than conventional manual methods. On the other hand, some studies raise issues with active systems, including a steep learning curve, muscle and nerve damage, and technical complications, such as a procedure stop due to a bone motion during cutting, requiring re-registration and registration failure. Semi-active robotic systems, such as Acrobot and Rio, were developed for ease of surgeon acceptance. The drill bit at the tip of the robotic arm is moved by a surgeon's hand, but it does not move outside of a milling path boundary, which is defined according to three-dimensional (3D) image-based preoperative planning. However, there are still few reports on THA with these semi-active systems. Thanks to the advancements in 3D sensor technology, navigation systems were developed. Navigation is a passive system, which does not perform any actions on patients. It only provides information and guidance to the surgeon who still uses conventional tools to perform the surgery. There are three types of navigation: computed tomography (CT)-based navigation, imageless navigation, and fluoro-navigation. CT-based navigation is the most accurate, but the preoperative planning on CT images takes time that increases cost and radiation exposure. Imageless navigation does not use CT images, but its accuracy depends on the technique of landmark pointing, and it does not take into account the individual uniqueness of the anatomy. Fluoroscopic navigation is good for trauma and spine surgeries, but its benefits are limited in the hip and knee reconstruction surgeries. Several studies have shown that the cup alignment with navigation is more precise than that of the conventional mechanical instruments, and that it is useful for optimizing limb length, range of motion, and stability. Recently, patient specific templates, based on CT images, have attracted attention and some early reports on cup placement, and resurfacing showed improved accuracy of the procedures. These various CAOS systems have pros and cons. Nonetheless, CAOS is a useful tool to help surgeons perform accurately what surgeons want to do in order to better achieve their clinical objectives. Thus, it is important that the surgeon fully understands what he or she should be trying to achieve in THA for each patient."
pub.1101351648,A comparison of gait one year post operation in an RCT of robotic UKA versus traditional Oxford UKA,"Robot-assisted unicompartmental knee surgery has been shown to improve the accuracy of implant alignment. However, little research has been conducted to ascertain if this results in a measureable improvement in knee function post operatively and a more normal gait. The kinematics of 70 OA knees were assessed using motion analysis in an RCT (31 receiving robotic-assisted surgery, and 39 receiving traditional manual surgery) and compared to healthy knees. Statistically significant kinematic differences were seen between the two surgical groups from foot-strike to mid-stance. The robotic-assisted group achieved a higher knee excursion (18.0°, SD 4.9°) compared to the manual group (15.7°, SD 4.1°). There were no significant difference between the healthy group and the robotic assisted group, however there was a significant difference between the healthy group and the manual group (p < 0.001). Hence robotically-assisted knee replacement with Mako Restoris Implants appears to lead not only to better implant alignment but also some kinematic benefits to the user during gait."
pub.1141916014,Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is associated with earlier discharge from physiotherapy and reduced length-of-stay compared to conventional navigated techniques,"IntroductionComputer-assisted surgery (CAS) has been used to improve intraoperative accuracy to restore patient’s anatomy and joint kinematics. It is not yet known whether robotic systems provide significant benefits over established navigation techniques.Materials and methodsThirty-one patients underwent robotic-assisted UKA (RA-UKA) over a 14-month period. Length of operation, transfusion requirements, time to discharge, range-of-motion and analgesia requirements were compared to a similar cohort of 31 patients who had received UKA using computer-assisted surgery (CAS-UKA).ResultsAll patients in the RA-UKA and CAS-UKA groups underwent surgery without conversion to conventional techniques. Both cohorts were similar apart from mean BMI (RA-UKA-group 28.5 vs 32.2; p < 0.05). There was a higher percentage of females in the CAS-UKA group (68% vs 45%, p = 0.12). Minor complication rates were the same in both groups (4/31, 12.9%). Mean operating time was longer in the RA-UKA group (104.8 vs 85.6 min; p < 0.001). No patients required post-operative transfusion in either group and there was no significant difference in haemoglobin level drop or analgesia requirements at any time point. Patients in the RA-UKA group achieved straight leg raise without lag sooner (23 vs 37.5 h; p = 0.004) and demonstrated increased range-of-motion on discharge (81.4° vs 64.5°; p < 0.001). Patients in the RA-UKA group were discharged from physiotherapy services earlier than the CAS-UKA group (42.5 vs 49 h; p = 0.02) and discharged from hospital significantly sooner (46 vs 74 h; p = 0.005).ConclusionsRA-UKA is safe and reproducible, comparable to traditional navigation. Patients undergoing RA-UKA achieve straight leg raise and discharge from physiotherapy sooner than with navigation alone.Level of evidence: III (Therapeutic) Retrospective Cohort Study."
pub.1157003750,Setting the Tibial Component Rotation Based on Femoral Landmarks Allows Congruent Knee Kinematics in Robotic-Assisted Medial Unicompartmental Knee Replacement,"The accurate positioning of the prosthetic components is essential for achieving successful results in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (mUKA). The tibial component rotation in image-based robotic-assisted UKA is usually based on tibial bony landmarks matched to the pre-operative CT model. The study aimed to evaluate whether setting the tibial rotation on femoral CT-based landmarks allows congruent knee kinematics. We retrospectively analyzed data from 210 consecutive image-based robotic-assisted mUKA cases. In every case, we set the tibia rotation landmark parallel to the posterior condylar axis and centered it on the trochlea groove defined on the preoperative CT scan. The implant positioning was primarily set parallel to this rotation landmark and then adjusted based on tibial sizes avoiding component over- or under-hang. During surgery, we recorded the knee kinematics under valgus stress to reduce the arthritic deformity. A femoral-tibial contact point was recorded over the entire range of motion and displayed as a tracking profile on the tibia implant. The femoro-tibial tracking angle (FTTA) was then calculated based on a tangent line to the femoro-tibial tracking-points and the difference to the femur-based rotation landmark. In 48% of the cases, we could position the tibia component exactly to the femoral rotation landmark, whereas in 52% of cases, minimal adjustments were made to avoid component's under- or over-hang. The mean tibia component rotation (TRA) with reference to our femur-based landmark was +0.24° (SD ± 2.9°). The femur-based tibia rotation landmark showed a high correspondence to the FTTA with 60% of the cases having less than 1° of deviation. Mean FTTA was +0.7° (SD ± 2.2°). The mean difference between the absolute value of the TRA and the FTTA (|TRA| - |FTTA|) was -0.18° (SD ± 2°). Setting the tibial component rotation based on CT scan femoral landmarks and not on tibial anatomical landmarks is a reliable method to obtain congruent knee kinematics during image-based robotic-assisted medial UKA with less the 2° deviations on average."
pub.1046566936,Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Accurately Restores the Joint Line and Mechanical Axis. A Prospective Randomised Study,"Robot-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) improves the accuracy and precision of component implantation and mechanical axis (MA) alignment. Joint-line restoration in robot-assisted TKA is not widely described and joint-line deviation of>5mm results in mid-flexion instability and poor outcomes. We prospectively randomised 60 patients into two groups: 31 patients (robot-assisted), 29 patients (conventional). No MA outliers (>±3° from neutral) or notching was noted in the robot-assisted group as compared with 19.4% (P=0.049) and 10.3% (P=0.238) respectively in the conventional group. The robot-assisted group had 3.23% joint-line outliers (>5mm) as compared to 20.6% in the conventional group (P=0.049). Robot-assisted TKA produces similar short-term clinical outcomes when compared to conventional methods with reduction of MA alignment and joint-line deviation outliers. "
pub.1131287740,The Cost of Robot-assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: Comparing Safety and Hospital Charges to Conventional Total Hip Arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Utilization of robotic assistance is increasing for total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, few studies have directly examined the efficacy of this technique at reducing complications. This research aims to compare the rates of perioperative complications of robotic-assisted THA (RA-THA) with conventional THA (C-THA).
METHODS: This study screened more than 35 million hospital discharges between 2010 to 2014 using the National Inpatient Sample. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes were used to identify 292,836 patients who underwent C-THA (ICD 81.51) and 946 patients who underwent RA-THA (ICD 81.51 and ICD 17.41, 17.49). Perioperative complications were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. Patient mortality was determined using the Uniform Bill patient disposition. The RA-THA cohort was statistically matched 1:1 to C-THA about patient age, sex, race, comorbidities, hospital type, and calendar year. Mean cost and length of stay (LOS) for each cohort were calculated and compared using the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Logistic regression was used to compare the risks of major and minor complications between the cohorts.
RESULTS: We matched 758 (80.13%) RA-THA patients with 758 patients who underwent C-THA. No patient in our sample died. When compared with the conventional group, multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of major complications was similar in RA-THA patients (odds ratio = 0.698, 95% confidence interval = 0.282 to 1.727). In addition, although the rate of minor complications was higher in the RA-THA cohort (21.6% versus 12.5%, P = 0.004), no difference was observed on multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 1.248, 95% confidence interval = 0.852 to 1.829). The average inpatient hospital cost of a RA-THA was $20,046 (SD = 6,165) compared with $18,258 (SD = 6,147) for C-THA (P < 0.001). The average LOS was for RA-THA was 2.69 days (SD = 1.25) compared with 2.82 days for C-THA (SD = 1.18, P < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: In a statistically matched cohort, the risk of perioperative complication in patients who underwent RA-THA versus C-THA patients were similar. However, RA-THA was costlier despite shorter LOS.

pub.1125564975,"Errors in femoral anteversion, femoral offset, and vertical offset following robot‐assisted total hip arthroplasty","The objectives were to determine errors in femoral anteversion (FA), femoral offset (FO), and vertical offset (VO) with robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) and how consistently these errors are within clinically desirable limits of ±5° and ±5 mm. After preoperative planning, robot-assisted THAs were performed on twelve cadaveric specimens. The error between achieved and planned component placements was used to determine bias (mean error) and precision (SD of error). The percent of the population within clinically desirable limits was determined. Bias of 1.5° and 2.7 mm occurred for FA and VO, respectively. Precision was 1.2° for FA and better than 1.5 mm for FO and VO. The percent of population within clinically desirable limits was at least 95% for FA and at least 99% for FO. With limits of ±7 mm, at least 95% of the population was within these limits for VO. Robot-assisted THA may improve clinical outcomes."

The goal of our bone-mounted robot, named Praxiteles, is to precisely position a surgical bone-cutting guide in the appropriate planes surrounding the knee, so that the surgeon can perform the planar cuts manually using the guide. The robot architecture is comprised of 2 motorized degrees of freedom (DoF) whose axes of rotation are arranged in parallel, and are precisely aligned to the implant cutting planes with a 2 DoF adjustment mechanism. Two prototypes have been developed and tested on saw bones and cadavers--an initial one for open TKA surgery and a new version for MIS TKA, which mounts on the side of the knee. A novel bone-milling technique is also presented that uses passive guide and a side milling tool."
pub.1134296626,Adoption of Robotic-Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Is Associated with Decreased Use of Articular Constraint and Manipulation under Anesthesia Compared to a Manual Approach,"Haptic robotic-arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) seeks to leverage three-dimensional planning, intraoperative assessment of ligament laxity, and guided bone preparation to establish and achieve patient-specific targets for implant position. We sought to compare (1) operative details, (2) knee alignment, (3) recovery of knee function, and (4) complications during adoption of this technique to our experience with manual TKA. We compared 120 RATKAs performed between December 2016 and July 2018 to 120 consecutive manual TKAs performed between May 2015 and January 2017. Operative details, lengths of stay (LOS), and discharge dispositions were collected. Tibiofemoral angles, Knee Society Scores (KSS), and ranges of motion were assessed until 3 months postoperatively. Manipulations under anesthesia, complications, and reoperations were tabulated. Mean operative times were 22 minutes longer in RATKA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) for this early cohort, but decreased by 27 minutes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) from the first 25 RATKA cases to the last 25 RATKA cases. Less articular constraint was used to achieve stability in RATKA (93 vs. 55% cruciate-retaining, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; 3 vs. 35% posterior stabilized (PS), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; and 4 vs. 10% varus-valgus constrained, <i>p</i>_ = _0.127). RATKA had lower LOS (2.7 vs. 3.4 days, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Discharge dispositions, tibiofemoral angles, KSS, and knee flexion angles did not differ, but manipulations were less common in RATKAs (4 vs. 17%, <i>p</i> = 0.013). We observed less use of constraint, shorter LOS, and fewer manipulations under anesthesia in RATKA, with no increase in complications. Operative times were longer, particularly early in the learning curve, but improved with experience. All measured patient-centered outcomes were equivalent or favored the newer technique, suggesting that RATKA with patient-specific alignment targets does not compromise initial quality. Observed differences may relate to improved ligament balance or diminished need for ligament release."
pub.1141077602,Consideration of pelvic tilt at the time of preoperative planning improves standing acetabular position after robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately half of dislocating total hip arthroplasties (THAs) demonstrate acetabular component position within traditional safe zones. It is unclear if postoperative functional acetabular position can be reliably improved by considering preoperative pelvic tilt. We investigated whether standing cup position targets could be more accurately achieved by considering preoperative standing pelvic tilt in addition to bone landmarks when planning for robot-assisted THA.
METHODS: We reviewed 146 THAs performed by a single surgeon using computed tomography-based 3-dimensional planning and robotic technology to guide acetabular reaming and component insertion. Planning for 73 consecutive cases started at 40° of inclination and 22° of anteversion relative to the supine functional plane and was adjusted to better match native hip anatomy. Planning for the next 73 cases was modified to consider standing pelvic position based on standing preoperative radiographs. We compared groups to determine the rate when cups were placed outside our standing targets of 15-30° anteversion and 35-50° inclination.
RESULTS: Cup position proved to be reliable in both groups, with 83% of cups in the anatomic planning cohort and 90% of cups in the functional planning cohort achieving standing targets for both anteversion and inclination (<i>p</i> = 0.227). Variances were lower in the functional planning group: 9.4° versus 15.8° of inclination (<i>p</i> = 0.079) and 18.3° versus 26.1° of anteversion (<i>p</i> = 0.352). The range of functional positions was narrower in the functional planning group: 35.7-47.5° versus 31.8-54.9° of inclination and 16.7-35.0° versus 10.1-35.9° of anteversion.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest enhanced planning that considers pelvic tilt, when coupled to a precision tool to achieve the plan, can reliably achieve target standing component positions. Considering preoperative functional pelvic position may improve postoperative functional acetabular component placement in THA, but the clinical benefit of this has yet to be confirmed."
pub.1128103912,CT planning studies for robotic total knee arthroplasty.,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyze the true costs associated with preoperative CT scans performed for robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) planning and to determine the value of a formal radiologist's report of these studies.
METHODS: We reviewed 194 CT reports of 176 sequential patients who underwent primary RATKA by a single surgeon at a suburban teaching hospital. CT radiology reports were reviewed for the presence of incidental findings that might change the management of the patient. Payments for the scans, including the technical and professional components, for 330 patients at two hospitals were also recorded and compared.
RESULTS: There were 82 incidental findings in 61 CT studies, one of which led to a recommendation for additional testing. Across both institutions, the mean total payment for a preoperative scan was $446 ($8 to $3,870). The mean patient payment was $71 ($0 to $2,690). There was wide variation in payments between the institutions. In Institution A, the mean total payment was $258 ($168 to $264), with a mean patient payment of $57 ($0 to $100). The mean technical payment in this institution was $211 ($8 to $856), while the mean professional payment was $48 ($0 to $66). In Institution B, the mean total payment was $636 ($37 to $3,870), with a mean patient payment of $85 ($0 to $2,690).
CONCLUSION: The total cost of a CT scan is low and a minimal part of the overall cost of the RATKA. No incidental findings identified on imaging led to a change in management, suggesting that the professional component could be eliminated to reduce costs. Further studies need to take into account the patient perspective and the wide variation in total costs and patient payments across institutions and insurances.

pub.1135334871,Robotic-assisted vs conventional surgery in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a clinical and radiological study,"BackgroundThe use of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has increased and new technologies have been developed to improve patient survival and satisfaction, soft tissue balance, alignment, and component size. Robot-assisted systems offer an increase in surgical precision and accuracy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the precision of component position using five radiological parameters in conventional and robotic-assisted medial UKA using the NAVIO system.MethodsA cohort study was designed for patients who underwent medial UKA between April 2017 and March 2019 in a single center. Patients were allocated in the conventional (UKA-C) or robotic-assisted (UKA-R) group. The variables analyzed were age, gender, affected knee side, length of hospital stay, surgical time, and radiological measurements such as anatomical medial distal femoral angle (aMDFA), anatomical medial proximal tibial angle (aMPTA), tibial slope, the sagittal femoral angle, and the component size. A target was defined for each measurement, and a successful UKA was defined if at least four radiological measures were on target after surgery. Also, patients’ reported outcomes were evaluated using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and a numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain.ResultsThirty-four patients were included, 18 of them underwent UKA-R. The success rate for UKA in the UKA-R group was 87%; meanwhile, in the UKA-C group this was 28%, this difference was significant and powered (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.001; 1 − β = 0.95). Also, a 5-point difference in favor of the UKA-R group in the median OKS (p = 0.01), and a significantly lower median NRS for pain (p < 0.000) were found after surgery.ConclusionsUKA-R achieved more precision in the radiological parameters’ measure in this study. Also, UKA-R has a trend towards a better OKS and a lower NRS for pain at short-term follow-up."
pub.1139752846,The Accuracy and Clinical Success of Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"<i>Background</i>: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) has emerged as a patient-specific customizable tool that enables 3-dimensional preoperative planning, intraoperative adjustment, robotic-assisted bone preparation, and soft-tissue protection. Haptic rTKA may enhance component positioning, but only a few small studies have examined patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes after haptic rTKA. <i>Purpose</i>: In patients who underwent haptic rTKA, we sought to evaluate (1) the discrepancy in alignment between the executed surgical plan and implanted alignment in the coronal and sagittal planes 1 year postoperatively and (2) patient-reported outcomes 2 years postoperatively. <i>Methods</i>: From a prospectively collected database, we reviewed 105 patients who underwent haptic rTKA from August 2016 to May 2017. Two fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons independently reviewed hip-to-ankle standing biplanar radiographs to measure overall limb alignment and individual tibial and femoral component alignment relative to the mechanical axis and compared this to the executed surgical plan. Patient-reported outcomes were collected preoperatively and at 2 years postoperatively using the Lower Activity Extremity Score (LEAS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Junior (KOOS Jr.), and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). <i>Results</i>: Mean patient age was 62.4 years, and mean body mass index was 30.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Interobserver reliability was significant with a κ of 0.89. Absolute mean deviations in postoperative coronal alignment compared to intraoperative alignment were 0.625° ± 0.70° and 0.45° ± 0.50° for the tibia and femur, respectively. Absolute mean deviations in postoperative tibial sagittal alignment were 0.47° ± 0.76°. Overall mechanical alignment was 0.97° ± 1.79°. Outcomes in LEAS, KOOS Jr., and NPRS changed from 8 to 10, 78 to 88.3, and 8 to 1, respectively. <i>Conclusions</i>: Haptic rTKA demonstrated high reliability and accuracy (less than 1°) of tibial coronal, femoral coronal, and tibial sagittal component alignment postoperatively compared to the surgical plan. Patient-reported outcomes improved, as well. A more rigorous study on long-term outcomes is warranted."

Using a prospectively collected institutional database, patients who underwent RA- and manual TKA were the nearest neighbor propensity score matched 3:1 (255 manual TKA:85 RA-TKA), accounting for various preoperative characteristics. Data were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson's Chi-squared, and Fisher's exact tests, when appropriate. Postoperative pain scores, opioid use, ED visits, readmissions, and 1-year PROMs were similar between the cohorts. Manual TKA patients achieved higher maximum flexion ROM (120.3 ± 9.9 versus 117.8 ± 10.2, <i>p</i> = 0.043) with no statistical differences in other ROM parameters. Manual TKA had shorter operative time (105 vs.113 minutes, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and fewer PT visits (median [interquartile range] = 10.0 [8.0-13.0] vs. 11.5 [9.5-15.5] visits, <i>p</i> = 0.014). RA-TKA had shorter LOS (0.48 ± 0.59 vs.1.2 ± 0.59 days, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and higher proportion of home discharges (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). RA-TKA and manual TKA had similar postoperative complications and 1-year PROMs. Although RA-TKA patients had longer operative times, they had shorter LOS and higher propensity for home discharge. In an era of value-based care models and the steady shift to outpatient TKA, these trends need to be explored further. Long-term and randomized controlled studies may help determine potential added value of RA-TKA versus manual TKA. This study reflects level of evidence III."
pub.1132273231,"Robot‐assisted total knee arthroplasty is associated with a learning curve for surgical time but not for component alignment, limb alignment and gap balancing","PURPOSE: The application of robotics in the operating theatre for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains controversial. As with all new technology, the introduction of new systems is associated with a learning curve and potentially associated with extra complications. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify and predict the learning curve of robot-assisted (RA) TKA.
METHODS: A RA TKA system (MAKO) was introduced in April 2018 in our service. A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients receiving a TKA with this system by six surgeons. Operative times, implant and limb alignment, intraoperative joint balance and robot-related complications were evaluated. Cumulative summation (CUSUM) analyses were used to assess learning curves for operative time, implant alignment and joint balance in RA TKA. Linear regression was performed to predict the learning curve of each surgeon.
RESULTS: RA TKA was associated with a learning curve of 11-43 cases for operative time (p < 0.001). This learning curve was significantly affected by the surgical profile (high vs. medium vs. low volume). A complete normalisation of operative times was seen in four out of five surgeons. The precision of implant positioning and gap balancing showed no learning curve. An average deviation of 0.2° (SD 1.4), 0.7° (SD 1.1), 1.2 (SD 2.1), 0.2° (SD 2.9) and 0.3 (SD 2.4) for the mLDFA, MPTA, HKA, PDFA and PPTA from the preoperative plan was observed. Limb alignment showed a mean deviation of 1.2° (SD 2.1) towards valgus postoperatively compared to the intraoperative plan. One tibial stress fracture was seen as a complication due to suboptimal positioning of the registration pins.
CONCLUSION: RA TKA is associated with a learning curve for surgical time, which might be longer than reported in current literature and dependent on the profile of the surgeon. There is no learning curve for component alignment, limb alignment and gap balancing.

pub.1155380602,Is the femoral intramedullary alignment already actual in total knee arthroplasty?,"Clinical outcomes and overall alignment after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) depend on femoral component positioning in the sagittal and the coronal plane, making choice of the distal femoral cutting guide crucial. Currently, there is no consensus on the potential advantage of an extramedullary (EM) guide compared to an intramedullary (IM) guide in TKA. The IM guide is the most widely used system for making the distal femoral cut although evidence for its superiority over the EM guide is lacking. However, inaccuracies arising with the IM guide include location of the rod entry point in the coronal plane, femoral canal diameter, femoral bowing, and structural features of the rod. Furthermore, the invasive procedure is associated with increased risk of postoperative blood loss, thromboembolic complications, and intraoperative fractures. While the EM guide has no such difficulties, its accuracy depends on the instruments used. Studies have reported results not inferior to the IM guide and a lower number of postoperative complications. Patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) and robotic and computer-assisted TKA have achieved excellent clinical and radiographic results and can overcome the problems inherent to the IM and the EM guide. Authors performed a systematic review of the literature and proposed a narrative review to summarize the characteristics of the IM and the EM guide and compare the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as their limitations in comparison with new technologies. Authors also expressed their expert opinion."
pub.1122659810,New Technology for Total Knee Arthroplasty Provides Excellent Patient-Reported Outcomes: A Minimum Two-Year Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty has been demonstrated to help increase various patient-reported, clinical, and surgical outcome metrics (PROMs). However, the current literature is limited regarding PROMs data for longer follow-up periods beyond one year. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1) report multicenter patient-reported outcomes with multiple metrics, as well as 2) postoperative surgeon-specific outcomes at a minimum two-year follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five fellowship-trained, high-volume surgeons performed a total of 188 total knee arthroplasty surgeries using the enhanced preoperative planning and real-time intraoperative feedback of a robotic-assisted device. Patients from all surgeons followed similar postoperative rehabilitation beginning on postoperative day one. Patients were evaluated based on the Short Form-12 Questionnaire (SF-12), the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), and Knee Society total and subscores (KSS). The SF-12 was subdivided into two components: mental composite score (MCS) and physical composite score (PCS). The KSS was subdivided into functional and knee scores. Additionally, surgical outcomes from the latest follow-up visit were evaluated. All patients were evaluated at a minimum of two years follow-up time.
RESULTS: All patients reported excellent postoperative outcomes for all three PROMs. The mean postoperative SF-12 MCS and PCS scores were both 57 points, with 50 as the threshold for norm-based scoring (MCS range: 42 to 69 points; PCS range: 41 to 68 points). The mean FJS was 75 points (range: 14 to 100 points). The mean KSS functional score was 84 points (range: 20 to 100) while the mean Knee Score was 92 points (range: 40 to 100). Similarly, we found that the aseptic revision rates were low (n=2, 1.06%, one for unexplained pain, and another for a post-traumatic tibial fracture) with few other postoperative complications (n=7 patients [3.7%]) in our cohort.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis found that patients had excellent outcomes across multiple PROM metrics. Future work can build on these results with large patient populations over longer follow-up intervals. Nevertheless, these results provide the foundation and evidence to support the continued use of this innovative technology for total knee arthroplasties."
pub.1122239513,Less iatrogenic soft-tissue damage utilizing robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty when compared with a manual approach,"OBJECTIVES: The use of the haptically bounded saw blades in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) can potentially help to limit surrounding soft-tissue injuries. However, there are limited data characterizing these injuries for cruciate-retaining (CR) TKA with the use of this technique. The objective of this cadaver study was to compare the extent of soft-tissue damage sustained through a robotic-assisted, haptically guided TKA (RATKA) <i>versus</i> a manual TKA (MTKA) approach.
METHODS: A total of 12 fresh-frozen pelvis-to-toe cadaver specimens were included. Four surgeons each prepared three RATKA and three MTKA specimens for cruciate-retaining TKAs. A RATKA was performed on one knee and a MTKA on the other. Postoperatively, two additional surgeons assessed and graded damage to 14 key anatomical structures in a blinded manner. Kruskal-Wallis hypothesis tests were performed to assess statistical differences in soft-tissue damage between RATKA and MTKA cases.
RESULTS: Significantly less damage occurred to the PCLs in the RATKA <i>versus</i> the MTKA specimens (p &lt; 0.001). RATKA specimens had non-significantly less damage to the deep medial collateral ligaments (p = 0.149), iliotibial bands (p = 0.580), poplitei (p = 0.248), and patellar ligaments (p = 0.317). The remaining anatomical structures had minimal soft-tissue damage in all MTKA and RATKA specimens.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that less soft-tissue damage may occur when utilizing RATKA compared with MTKA. These findings are likely due to the enhanced preoperative planning with the robotic software, the real-time intraoperative feedback, and the haptically bounded saw blade, all of which may help protect the surrounding soft tissues and ligaments.Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint Res</i> 2019;8:495-501."
pub.1155027753,The Current Role of Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) improves the accuracy of component alignment compared with patient-specific instruments (PSI) and conventional TKA (C-TKA), although clinically there is no difference between them in terms of postoperative outcomes. RA-TKA still has significant limitations that advise against its widespread use, such as high installation costs, additional radiation exposure, a steep learning curve, the small number of implant designs that are compatible with robotic technology, the lack of long-term results and the large heterogeneity of available systems."
pub.1136043922,Can robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty be a cost-effective procedure? A Markov decision analysis,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a frequently and increasingly performed surgery in the treatment of disabling knee osteoarthritis. The rising number of procedures and related revisions pose an increasing economic burden on health care systems. In an attempt to lower the revision rate due to component malalignment and soft tissue imbalance in TKA, robotic assistance (RA) has been introduced in the operating theatre. The primary objective of this study is to provide the results of a theoretical, preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis of RA TKA.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was designed to model the health status of sixty-seven-year-old patients in need of TKA due to primary osteoarthritis over a twenty-year period following their knee joint replacement. Transitional probabilities and independent variables were extracted from existing literature.
RESULTS: The value attributed to the utility both for primary and revision surgery has the biggest impact on the ICER, followed by the rate of successful primary surgery and the cost of RA-technology. Only 2.18% of the samples yielded from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis proved to be cost-effective (threshold set at $50000/QALY). A calculated surgical volume of at least 253 cases per robot per year is needed to prove cost-effective taking the predetermined parameter values into account.
CONCLUSION: Based upon transitional probabilities and independent variables derived from existing studies, RA TKA may be cost-effective at a surgical volume of 253 cases per robot per year when compared to conventional TKA."
pub.1016062679,Short-term outcomes of robotically assisted patello-femoral arthroplasty,"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes in patients treated with robotically assisted patello-femoral arthroplasty (PFA).MethodsThis technique offers a safe, reliable, and reproducible way of obtaining correct implant positioning in patello-femoral arthroplasty, and as a result, reduces revision surgery due to implant malalignment. We evaluated 30 knees in 29 patients who underwent robotically assisted patello-femoral arthroplasty between June 2009 and May 2011. Mean follow-up was 15.9 months. This was a retrospective study that involved chart reviews and radiographic analysis. Radiographic analysis included pre-operative and postoperative plain films for implant positioning. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), range of motion, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) patient activity-level ratings, visual analog pain scale (VAS), and the Knee Society Score (KSS).ResultsThe patients had an average OKS of 21.7 pre-operatively and reached an average of 33.5 postoperatively (p = 0.0033). Pre-operative UCLA patient activity-level ratings was 3.1, compared with 4.8 postoperatively. Average VAS pre-operatively was 8 and postoperatively it decreased to 2.1 (p = 0.0033). The average KSS final score pre-operatively was 56 and postoperatively it increased to 68.3 while the functional score pre-operatively was 47.2 compared to 68.1 postoperatively (p = 0.011). As a result, patello-femoral arthroplasty is an emerging knee resurfacing technique that is an alternative to the total knee arthroplasty.ConclusionsThe early retrospective data for robotically-assisted PFA show encouraging results. Advantages of this technique include a smaller incision, faster rehabilitation, preservation of bone stock, and implantation without malalignment."
pub.1078797843,Robotic Tensor Device for Optimal Soft Tissue Balance in TKA,"Soft tissue balance measurement is necessary for effective total knee arthroplasty (TKA). If optimal ligament balance is not achieved during surgery, it results in laxity of the knee or repeat surgery. In this paper, a newly developed robotic tensor system for measurement of soft tissue balance during TKA is described. The development concepts of the system were to measure collateral ligament balance (joint gap distance and varus angle) after cutting of the tibia and femur and to generate arbitrary lifting force to the knee joint during surgery. The system was created according to the development concepts. The prototype system has an active prismatic joint and a passive rotation joint to assess the joint gap and varus angle. The maximum lifting force is 250 N, the measurement range of the joint gap is 30 mm, and the varus angle is ± 15°. To confirm the force control ability, a basic experiment was performed. The input target force was 100, 150, 200, 250 N, and the output result showed an error within 3N. This experimental result shows that the newly developed system appears to have better accuracy than previous instrumental methods."

An integrated robotic system for accurately machining the bone surfaces in TKR surgery is described. Details of the system, comprising an ""active constraint"" robot, called Acrobot, a ""gross positioning"" robot, and patient clamps, are provided. The intraoperative protocol and the preoperative, CT-based, planning system are also described. A number of anatomical registration and cutting trials, using plastic bones, are described, followed by results from two preliminary clinical trials, which demonstrate the accuracy achieved in the anatomical registration. Finally, the first clinical trial is described, in which the results of the anatomical registration and bone cutting are seen to be of high quality. The Acrobot system has been successfully used to accurately register and cut the knee bones in TKR surgery. This demonstrates the great potential of a ""hands-on"" robot for improving accuracy and increasing safety in surgery."
pub.1021329162,Robot‐assisted total knee arthroplasty in haemophilic arthropathy,"INTRODUCTION: Execution of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in end-stage haemophilic arthropathy is challenging because of soft tissue fibrosis, flexion contractures, poor quality of the bone, and the altered bony anatomy. Restoring the lower limb alignment and achieving range of motion (ROM) is difficult. Robots have been used in TKA to reduce the chances of malalignment and improve accuracy and precision. However, there has been no report in literature on use of robots for TKA in haemophilic arthropathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether robot-assisted TKA can be successfully carried out in haemophilic arthropathy and what precision could be obtained.
METHODS: Thirty-two robot-assisted TKA were evaluated in 29 haemophilia patients. The mean follow up period was 5 years (range, 3-7 years). Hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis, component angles, and radiographic loosening were evaluated. Clinically ROM, Knee Society scores (KSS) and SF-36 were assessed.
RESULTS: The HKA axis was within a range of 0 ± 3° in 30 knees (93.8%). The alignment of the components also presented satisfying results. KSS were improved from 27.1 to 82.8 postoperatively (P < 0.001). The ROM was improved from 70.7 to 84.7 postoperatively (P = 0.006). Complications included early haematoma in three knees, heterotopic ossification in three knees, periprosthetic infection in two knees.
CONCLUSIONS: Though robotic TKA gives excellent accuracy of lower limb and component alignment, expensive cost, additional preparation time, longer operation time with similar clinical results in haemophilic arthropathy should be concerned."
pub.1004632752,Unicompartmental knee arthroplasties: Robot vs. patient specific instrumentation,"BACKGROUND: The technical reliability demonstrated by semi active robots in implant placement could render unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKAs) more favourable than they are currently. The relatively untested method using patient specific instrumentation (PSI), however, has the potential to match the accuracy produced by robots but without the barriers that have prevented them from being used more widely in clinical practice, namely operative time. Therefore this study took a step towards comparing the accuracy and time taken between the two technologies.
METHODS: Thirty-six UKAs were carried out on identical knee models, 12 with the Sculptor, 12 with PSI and 12 conventionally under timed conditions. Implant placement in these knees was then judged against that in a pre-operative plan.
RESULTS: Tibial implant orientations and femoral implant positions and orientations were significantly more accurate in the PSI group with mean errors of 6°, 2 mm and 4° respectively, than the conventional group which had means of 9°, 4 mm and 10°. There was no significant difference between the robot and PSI generally except in tibial implant orientation (mean robotic error 3°) and tibial implant position did not vary significantly across all three groups. It was also found that use of PSI and conventional methods took half the time taken by the robot (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: With further development, PSI can match and possibly surpass the accuracy of the robot, as it does with the conventional method, and achieve planned surgery in less time.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This work sets the foundation for clinical trials involving PSI."
pub.1130657948,The Use of Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty in Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an effective operation for patients with hip osteoarthritis; however, patients with hip dysplasia present a particular challenge. Our novel study examined the effect of robot-assisted THA in patients with hip dysplasia.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip undergoing primary THA using robotic arm assistance at 2 institutions from January 2010 to January 2017. Patients undergoing revision arthroplasty were excluded. Preoperatively, all patients underwent a computed tomography scan so that 3-dimensional templating could be performed. Hip range of motion (ROM) and clinical leg length discrepancy were recorded preoperatively. Two independent observers calculated Crowe and Hartofilakidis grades for each operative hip. At the final follow-up, hip ROM, postoperative complications, and modified Harris Hip scores were obtained.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients underwent THA because of degenerative joint disease in the setting of developmental dysplasia of the hip. There were 56 females and 23 males with a mean age of 45 years (range: 26-64 years). We found that components were placed according to the preoperative plan, that there was an improvement in the modified Harris hip score from 29 to 86 (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), an improvement in the hip ROM (flexion improvement from 66° to 91°, <i>P</i> &lt; .0001), and a correction of leg length discrepancy (17.1 vs 4 mm, <i>P</i> &lt; .0002). There were no complications during the short-term interim follow-up (mean: 3.1 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted THA can be a useful method to ensure adequate component positioning and excellent outcomes in patients with hip dysplasia.

pub.1121971381,Comparison of Patient Demographics and Utilization Trends of Robotic-Assisted and Non-Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RAUKA) is an emerging area of interest. The purpose of this study was to compare (1) different patient demographic profiles; (2) annual primary and revision utilization rates; (3) risk factors for revision procedures; and (4) survivorship between RAUKA and manual UKA (MUKA). Using the PearlDiver database, patients who underwent RAUKA or MUKA between 2005 and 2014 within the Medicare database were identified, yielding a total of 35,061 patients (RAUKA = 13,617; manual = 21,444). Patient demographics (age, gender, comorbidities, Charlson-Comorbidity Index, and geographic region) were compared between cohorts. Annual primary and revision utilization rates as well as risk factors for revision procedures were also compared. Kaplan-Meier survivorship was also calculated. The Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to test for significance in patient demographics, whereas the Welch <i>t</i>-test was used to compare the incidence of revisions as well as the revision burden (proportion of revisions to total sum of primary and revision procedures). Multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis was performed to compare risk factors for revision procedures. There were statistically significant differences in RAUKA versus MUKA patients with respect to age (<i>p &lt; </i>0.001), gender (<i>p &lt; </i>0.001), and region (<i>p &lt; </i>0.001). RAUKA procedures performed increased over 12-fold compared with manual, which increased only 4.5-fold. RAUKA procedures had significantly lower revision incidence (0.99 vs. 4.24%, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and revision burden (0.91 vs. 4.23%, <i>p</i> = 0.005) compared with manuals. For patients undergoing RAUKA, normal (19-24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (30-39 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) body mass index (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), congestive heart failure (<i>p</i> = 0.004), hypothyroidism (<i>p &lt; </i>0.001), opioid dependency (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and rheumatoid arthritis (<i>p &lt; </i>0.001) were risk factors for a revision procedure. Kaplan-Meier survival curve 3 years following the index procedure to all-cause revisions demonstrated that RAUKA patients maintained nearly 100% survivorship compared with manual patients who had 97.5% survivorship. The data demonstrate increased utilization of RAUKA in the United States. The current data indicated that RAUKA has significantly lower revision rates and improved survivorship compared with patients undergoing non-RAUKA within Medicare patients."

pub.1023321181,3D navigated implantation of the glenoid component in reversed shoulder arthroplasty. Feasibility and results in an anatomic study,"BACKGROUND: Reversed shoulder arthroplasty is an alternative to total shoulder arthroplasty for various indications. The long-term results depend on stable bone fixation, and correct positioning of the glenoid component. The potential contribution of image guidance for reversed shoulder arthroplasty procedures was tested in vitro.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 27 positioning procedures (15 navigated, 12 non-navigated) of the glenoid baseplate in reverse shoulder arthroplasty were performed by a single experienced orthopaedic surgeon. A Kirschner wire was placed freehand or with the use of a navigated drill guide. For the navigated procedures, a flat detector 3D C-arm with navigation system was used. The Kirschner wire was to be inserted 12 mm from the inferior glenoid, with an inferior tilt of 10° and centrally in the axial scapular axis. The insertion point in the glenoid as well as the position of the K-wire in the axial and sagittal planes were measured. For statistical analysis, t-tests were performed with a significance level of 0.05.
RESULTS: The inferior glenoid drilling distance was 14.1 ± 3.4 mm for conventional placement and 15.1 ± 3.4 mm for the navigated procedure (P = 0.19). The inferior tilt showed no significant difference between the two methods (conventional 7.4 ± 5.2°, navigated 7.7 ± 4.9°, P = 0.63). The glenoid version in the axial plane showed significantly higher accuracy for the navigated procedure, with a mean deviation of 1.6 ±4.5° for the navigated procedure compared with 11.5 ± 6.5° for the conventional procedure(P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Accurate positioning of the glenoidal baseplate in the axial scapular plane can be improved using 3D C-arm navigation for reversed shoulder arthroplasty. However, computer navigation may not improve the inferior tilt of the component or the position in the inferior glenoid to avoid scapular notching. Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm these findings in the clinical setup."

pub.1048576087,Comparison of robot-assisted and conventional total knee arthroplasty: A controlled cadaver study using multiparameter quantitative three-dimensional CT assessment of alignment,"INTRODUCTION: A functional total knee replacement has to be well aligned, which implies that it should lie along the mechanical axis and in the correct axial and rotational planes. Incorrect alignment will lead to abnormal wear, early mechanical loosening, and patellofemoral problems. There has been increased interest of late in total knee arthroplasty with robotic assistance. This study was conducted to determine whether robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty is superior to the conventional surgical method with regard to the precision of implant positioning.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty knee replacements, comprising ten robot-assisted procedures and ten conventional operations, were performed on ten cadavers. Two experienced surgeons performed the surgeries. Both procedures on each cadaver were performed by the same surgeon. The choice of which procedure was to be performed first was randomized. Following implantation of the prosthesis, the mechanical axis deviation, femoral coronal angle, tibial coronal angle, femoral sagittal angle, tibial sagittal angle, and femoral rotational alignment were measured via 3D CT scanning. These variables were then compared with the preoperatively planned values.
RESULTS: In the knees that underwent robot-assisted surgery, the mechanical axis deviation ranged from -1.94° to 2.13° (mean: -0.21°), the femoral coronal angle from 88.08° to 90.99° (mean: 89.81°), the tibial coronal angle from 89.01° to 92.36° (mean: 90.42°), the tibial sagittal angle from 81.72° to 86.24° (mean: 83.20°), and the femoral rotational alignment from 0.02° to 1.15° (mean: 0.52°) in relation to the transepicondylar axis. In the knees that underwent conventional surgery, the mechanical axis deviation ranged from -3.19° to 3.84° (mean: -0.48°), the femoral coronal angle from 88.36° to 92.29° (mean: 90.50°), the tibial coronal angle from 88.15° to 91.51° (mean: 89.83°), the tibial sagittal angle from 80.06° to 87.34° (mean: 84.50°), and the femoral rotational alignment from 0.32° to 4.13° (mean: 2.76°) in relation to the transepicondylar axis. In the conventional knee replacement group, there were two instances of outliers outside the range of 3° varus/valgus for the mechanical axis deviation. The robot-assisted knee replacements showed significantly superior femoral rotational alignment results compared with conventional surgery (p = 0.006). There was no statistically significant difference between robot-assisted and conventional total knee arthroplasty with regard to the other variables. All the measurements showed high intra-observer and inter-observer reliability.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty showed excellent precision in the sagittal and coronal planes of the 3D CT scan. In particular, the robot-assisted technique showed better accuracy in femoral rotational alignment compared to the conventional surgery, despite the fact that the surgeons who performed the operations were more experienced and familiar with the con"

This study aimed to analyze the utilization density of digital tools, the preferred alignment strategies, and the obstacles and benefits of implementing these technologies in German-speaking countries.Materials and methodsAn online survey with 57 questions about digital tools in primary knee arthroplasty and their usage was conducted among members of the Arthroplasty Working Group (AE). The survey included questions on navigation, robotics, patient-specific instruments, individualized implants, and augmented reality.ResultsThe survey revealed that 18% of hospitals use navigation and 17% use robotic systems in primary total knee arthroplasty surgery. The main reasons for not implementing supportive technologies were high acquisition and ongoing costs, as well as longer surgical duration. Patient-specific instruments and individualized implants currently play a minor role. Patient-specific alignment strategies, such as kinematic (navigation: 35%; robotics: 44%) and functional alignment (navigation: 15%; robotics: 35%), are preferred in this context. With conventional instrumentation predominantly mechanical alignment was applied (79%).DiscussionThe results indicate a relatively high utilization density of digital tools, which are mainly used to perform personalized alignment strategies in primary knee arthroplasty in German-speaking countries. This was particularly evident in high-volume hospitals. Economic aspects were the main reasons for not using these technologies. Future developments should aim to simplify the systems and thus achieve improved cost efficiency."
pub.1021253216,Validation of patient specific surgical guides in total hip arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The validation of patient-specific surgical guides (PSGs) by their design and the comparison of planned and actual PSG setting in total hip arthroplasty (THA) have not previously been reported.
METHODS: The errors between preoperative planning and computed tomography (CT)-based PSG setting (E1), and between preoperative planning and implantation (E2) were evaluated using CT in 16 fresh cadaveric hips.
RESULTS: E2 was significantly smaller with the wide-base-contact resurfacing-THA PSG than with the narrow-base-contact type (P<0.05). E1/E2 of the wide-base-contact neck-cut PSG was 1.6±0.7°/2.4±1.1° for the coronal plane and 1.2±0.8 mm/0.7±0.5mm for the medial neck-cut height. E1/E2 of the wide-base-contact cup-impaction PSG was 1.0±0.9°/3.4±1.9° for inclination and 1.7±1.1°/6.6±4.4° for anteversion.
CONCLUSIONS: The wide-base-contact PSG in resurfacing-THA and the PSG for neck-cut in THA could be applied clinically. Although cup-impaction PSG setting was acceptable, errors were made due to the impaction process during cup implantation."
pub.1142921902,[ROBOTIC TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY].,"INTRODUCTION: Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common operations performed in the orthopaedic surgery field. TKA is usually performed as a result of primary osteoarthritis which causes pain and a major decrease in the patient's quality of life. TKA is considered a successful operation with a success rate of 80-85%. In recent years, orthopaedic surgeons have started to perform robotic assisted TKA. In Israel, these operations have been performed since 2019. In this article we reviewed this topic and the latest clinical data comparing a conventional TKA and robotic assisted TKA. In the world, there are several robotic systems in use. Four systems are in use in Israel. The robotic system assists in the pre-operative and intra-operative planning, in order to perform precise cuts of the femur and tibia. The precision helps to achieve better soft tissue balance reconstruction of the lower limb axis. While robotic surgery performed in Israel has been rising since the technology came into use in 2019, the clinical data are not showing a significant advantage to either one of the operations. Recent studies have shown evidence of better imaging results in the robotic-assisted operation, however, the clinical benefits are still in doubt, due to the lack of large and long-term studies."
pub.1123295801,Operative Times Have Remained Stable for Total Hip Arthroplasty for >15 Years,"Understanding trends in operative times has become increasingly important in light of total hip arthroplasty (THA) being added to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 2019 Potentially Misvalued Codes List. The purpose of this review was to explore the mean THA operative times reported in the literature in order (1) to determine if they have increased, decreased, or remained the same for patients reported on between 2000 and 2019 and (2) to determine what factors might have contributed to the difference (or lack thereof) in THA operative time over a contemporary study period.
METHODS: The PubMed and EBSCOhost databases were queried to identify all articles, published between 2000 and 2019, that reported on THA operative times. The keywords used were ""operative,"" ""time,"" and ""total hip arthroplasty."" An article was included if the full text was available, it was written in English, and it reported operative times of THAs. An article was excluded if it did not discuss operative time; it reported only comparative, rather than absolute, operative times; or the cohort consisted of total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) and THAs, exclusively of revision THAs, or exclusively of robotic THAs. Data on manual or primary THAs were extracted from studies including robotic or revision THAs. Thirty-five articles reporting on 630,675 hips that underwent THA between 1996 and 2016 met our criteria.
RESULTS: The overall weighted average operative time was 93.20 minutes (range, 55.65 to 149.00 minutes). When the study cohorts were stratified according to average operative time, the highest number fell into the 90 to 99-minute range. Operative time was stable throughout the years reported. Factors that led to increased operative times included increased body mass index (BMI), less surgical experience, and the presence of a trainee.
CONCLUSIONS: The average operative time across the included articles was approximately 95 minutes and has been relatively stable over the past 2 decades. On the basis of our findings, we cannot support CMS lowering the procedural valuation of THA given the stability of its operative times and the relationship between operative time and cost."
pub.1137573590,Robotic‐Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty for Distal Femur Fracture with Lateral Knee Osteoarthritis,"<i>Introduction.</i> Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of compound fractures around the knee in elderly patient raise concerns about long-term postoperative external fixation and complications. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been proposed as an alternative solution. We report a case where robotic-assisted (RA) TKA was used to treat lateral knee osteoarthritis (OA) with distal femur fracture. <i>Case Presentation</i>. A 90-year-old female visited our hospital with complications of sustained knee pain after a fall at home. Fracture line from the trochlea to the intercondylar notch was diagnosed on plain radiographs, and prior to this injury, the patient was receiving conservative treatment for lateral OA. We selected a conventional TKA over ORIF because the latter is associated with residual pain and the need for long-term immobilization, which can lead to other complications. However, the fracture site was the entry point for intramedullary rod, and there was concern that the fracture site would be displaced by conventional TKA. Therefore, the unique aspect of the case is that the technique utilized involved robotic milling using the Navio system while temporarily stabilizing the fracture using two tracker pins. RA TKA could determine osteotomy and implant placement by predicting the postoperative patient's soft tissue balance for no medial loosening and lateral contracture. The arthritic cartilage and bone were then methodically removed using the handheld sculptor. After immobilizing the fracture site with a bone grasper before removing the pin tracker, reaming of the femur and insertion of a stem prosthesis with semiconstrained were performed. Primary RA TKA is a viable option for intra-articular fractures in elderly patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis."
pub.1112703883,Trends in computer navigation and robotic assistance for total knee arthroplasty in the United States: an analysis of patient and hospital factors,"BACKGROUND: Computer navigation and robotic assistance technologies are used to improve the accuracy of component positioning in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), with the goal of improving function and optimizing implant longevity. The purpose of this study was to analyze trends in the use of technology-assisted TKA, identify factors associated with the use of these technologies, and describe potential drivers of cost.
METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients who underwent TKA using conventional instrumentation, computer navigation, and robot-assisted techniques between 2005 and 2014. Variables analyzed include patient demographics, hospital and payer types, and hospital charges. Descriptive statistics were used to describe trends. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify differences between conventional and technology-assisted groups.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified 6,060,901 patients who underwent TKA from 2005 to 2014, of which 273,922 (4.5%) used computer navigation and 24,084 (0.4%) used robotic assistance. The proportion of technology-assisted TKAs steadily increased over the study period, from 1.2% in 2005 to 7.0% in 2014. Computer navigation increased in use from 1.2% in 2005 to 6.3% in 2014. Computer navigation was more likely to be used in the Western United States, whereas robot-assisted TKAs were more likely to be performed in the Northeast. Increased hospital charges were associated with the use of technology assistance ($53,740.1 vs $47,639.2).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of computer navigation and robot-assisted TKA steadily increased over the study period, accounting for 7.0% of TKAs performed in the United States in 2014. Marked regional differences in the use of these technologies were identified. The use of these technologies was associated with increased hospital charges."
pub.1048272804,Does haptic robot‐assisted total hip arthroplasty better restore native acetabular and femoral anatomy?,"BACKGROUND: The objective was to evaluate whether total hip arthroplasty (THA) using haptic robot assistance restores hip geometry better than the free-hand technique.
METHODS: Twelve robot-assisted and 14 free-hand unilateral THA patients underwent CT scan for three-dimensional (3D) hip models. The anteversion, inclination and hip joint centre locations of the native and implanted hips in each patient were quantified and compared.
RESULTS: Significant increase of combined anteversion by 19.1 ± 11.7° and 23.5 ± 23.6° and decrease of cup inclination by 16.5 ± 6.0° and 10.2 ± 6.8° were observed in the robot-assisted and the free-hand THAs, respectively. Less variation in the difference of the component orientations (max 11.1 vs 18.3°) and the femoral head centre (max 4.5 vs 6.3 mm) were found in the robot-assisted group.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that neither robot-assisted nor free-hand THAs had fully restored native hip geometry. However, the higher precision of the robot-assisted THA suggested that it has potential utility in restoring the native hip geometry. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
pub.1140498022,Robotics improves alignment accuracy and reduces early revision rates for UKA in the hands of low-volume UKA surgeons,"PurposeIt is known that in uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) low-volume surgeons have a higher complication and revision rate than high-volume surgeons. Further, robotic-assisted UKA leads to lower early revision rate as well as fewer limb and joint line outliers compared to conventional UKA. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outliers’ and revision rate of low-volume UKA surgeons with different robotic systems at short-term follow-up.MethodsIn this case–control study, 103 robotic-assisted UKAs were included. The procedures were performed between 2016 and 2019 from two low-volume UKA surgeons with an imageless (IL) (63 patients) and image-based (IB) (40 patients) robotic system. Alignment outliers, joint line (JL) reconstruction, complication and revision rates of the two different robotic systems were analyzed. The minimum follow-up was two years. Outliers were defined as a postoperative valgus malalignment greater than 182°. The surgery time for all procedures was evaluated.ResultsThe overall revision rate was 3.9% (4 of 103). Two occurred in the IB group (5.0%) and two in the IL group (3.2%). No valgus malalignment outliers were observed in both groups. The mean JL was not distalized by more than 2 mm in both groups (IL: 1.3 ± 1.6 mm vs. IB: 1.8 ± 0.9 mm, p value 0.08). The IL procedures had a significant lower mean surgery time (55 ± 13 min vs. 68 ± 14, p value 0.001).ConclusionRobotic-assisted UKA is a safe procedure in the hand of low-volume UKA surgeons. Robotic-assisted UKA minimizes overcorrection into valgus mal-alignment. Low revision rates are observed at short-term follow-up for robotic-assisted UKA. The choice of the different robotic systems has no impact on the outcome."
pub.1000309245,Robotic‐assisted TKA Reduces Postoperative Alignment Outliers and Improves Gap Balance Compared to Conventional TKA,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown mechanical alignment influences the outcome of TKA. Robotic systems have been developed to improve the precision and accuracy of achieving component position and mechanical alignment.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined whether robotic-assisted implantation for TKA (1) improved clinical outcome; (2) improved mechanical axis alignment and implant inclination in the coronal and sagittal planes; (3) improved the balance (flexion and extension gaps); and (4) reduced complications, postoperative drainage, and operative time when compared to conventionally implanted TKA over an intermediate-term (minimum 3-year) followup period.
METHODS: We prospectively randomized 100 patients who underwent unilateral TKA into one of two groups: 50 using a robotic-assisted procedure and 50 using conventional manual techniques. Outcome variables considered were postoperative ROM, WOMAC scores, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee scores, mechanical axis alignment, flexion/extension gap balance, complications, postoperative drainage, and operative time. Minimum followup was 41 months (mean, 65 months; range, 41-81 months).
RESULTS: There were no differences in postoperative ROM, WOMAC scores, and HSS knee scores. The robotic-assisted group resulted in no mechanical axis outliers (> ± 3° from neutral) compared to 24% in the conventional group. There were fewer robotic-assisted knees where the flexion gap exceeded the extension gap by 2 mm. The robotic-assisted procedures took an average of 25 minutes longer than the conventional procedures but had less postoperative blood drainage. There were no differences in complications between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted TKA appears to reduce the number of mechanical axis alignment outliers and improve the ability to achieve flexion-extension gap balance, without any differences in clinical scores or complications when compared to conventional manual techniques."
pub.1057301585,Comparison of Robot Surgery Modular and Total Knee Arthroplasty Kinematics,"The kinematics of seven knee specimens were measured from 0 to 120 degrees flexion using an up-and-down crouching machine. Motion was characterized by the positions of the centers of the lateral and medial femoral condyles in the anterior-posterior direction relative to a fixed tibia. A modular unicompartmental knee, trochlea flange, and patella resurfacing (multicompartmental knee [MCK] system) were implanted using a surgeon-interactive robot system that provided accurate surface matching. The MCK was tested, followed by standard cruciate retaining (CR) and posterior stabilized (PS) knees. The motion of the MCK was close to anatomic, especially on the medial side, in contrast to the CR and PS knees that showed abnormal motion features. Such a modular knee system, accurately inserted, has the potential for close to normal function in clinical application. "
pub.1174399972,‘Extended’ restricted kinematic alignment results in decreased residual medial gap tightness among osteoarthritic varus knees during robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"Aims: The aims of this study were: 1) to describe extended restricted kinematic alignment (E-rKA), a novel alignment strategy during robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA); 2) to compare residual medial compartment tightness following virtual surgical planning during RA-TKA using mechanical alignment (MA) and E-rKA, in the same set of osteoarthritic varus knees; 3) to assess the requirement of soft-tissue releases during RA-TKA using E-rKA; and 4) to compare the accuracy of surgical plan execution between knees managed with adjustments in component positioning alone, and those which require additional soft-tissue releases.
Methods: Patients who underwent RA-TKA between January and December 2022 for primary varus osteoarthritis were included. Safe boundaries for E-rKA were defined. Residual medial compartment tightness was compared following virtual surgical planning using E-rKA and MA, in the same set of knees. Soft-tissue releases were documented. Errors in postoperative alignment in relation to planned alignment were compared between patients who did (group A) and did not (group B) require soft-tissue releases.
Results: The use of E-rKA helped restore all knees within the predefined boundaries, with appropriate soft-tissue balancing. E-rKA compared with MA resulted in reduced residual medial tightness following surgical planning, in full extension (2.71 mm (SD 1.66) vs 5.16 mm (SD 3.10), respectively; p < 0.001), and 90° of flexion (2.52 mm (SD 1.63) vs 6.27 mm (SD 3.11), respectively; p < 0.001). Among the study population, 156 patients (78%) were managed with minor adjustments in component positioning alone, while 44 (22%) required additional soft-tissue releases. The mean errors in postoperative alignment were 0.53 mm and 0.26 mm among patients in group A and group B, respectively (p = 0.328).
Conclusion: E-rKA is an effective and reproducible alignment strategy during RA-TKA, permitting a large proportion of patients to be managed without soft-tissue releases. The execution of minor alterations in component positioning within predefined multiplanar boundaries is a better starting point for gap management than soft-tissue releases."
pub.1145265825,A novel bone registration method using impression molding and structured‐light 3D scanning technology,"Accurate bone registration is critical for computer navigation and robotic surgery. Existing registration systems are expensive, cumbersome, limited in accuracy and/or require intraoperative radiation. We recently reported a novel method of registration utilizing an inexpensive, compact, and X-ray-free structured-light 3D scanner. However, this technique is not always practical in a real surgical setting where soft tissue and blood can obstruct the continuous line-of-sight required for structured-light technology. We sought to remedy these limitations using a novel technique using rapid-setting impression molding to capture bone surface features and scan the undersurface of the mold with a structured-light scanner. The photonegative of this mold is compared to the preoperative computed tomography (CT)-scan to register the bone. A registration accuracy study was conducted on 36 CT-scanned femur sawbones, simulating typical exposure in hip/knee arthroplasty and bone tumor surgery. A cadaver experiment was also conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using the impression molding in a more realistic operating room setting. The registration accuracy of the proposed technique was 0.50 ± 0.19 mm. This was close to the reported accuracy of 0.43 ± 0.18 mm using a structured-light scanner without impression molding (p = 0.085). In comparison, historical values for ""paired-point"" and intraoperative CT image-based registration methods currently used in modern robotic/computer-navigation systems were 0.68 ± 0.14 mm (p = 0.004) and 0.86 ± 0.38 mm, respectively. The registration accuracy of the cadaver experiment was consistent with that of sawbone experiments. Although future studies are needed to extend to human subjects, this study shows that the impression molding method can produce comparable or better registration accuracy than the existing techniques."
pub.1072758606,Recent advances and future directions in the management of knee osteoarthritis: Can biological joint reconstruction replace joint arthroplasty and when?,"In this article, a concise description of the recent advances in the field of osteoarthritis management is presented. The main focus is to highlight the most promising techniques that emerge in both biological joint replacement and artificial joint arthroplasty. A critical view of high quality evidence regarding outcome and safety profile of these techniques is presented. The potential role of kinematically aligned total knee replacement, navigation, and robotic-assisted surgery is outlined. A critical description of both primary and stem cell-based therapies, the cell homing theory, the use of biologic factors and recent advancements in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is provided. Based on the current evidence, some thoughts on a realistic approach towards answering these questions are attempted. "
pub.1031208796,Load balance in total knee arthroplasty: an in vitro analysis,"BACKGROUND: One of the goals of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is to balance the loads between the compartments of the knee. An instrumented load cell that measures compartment loads in real time is utilized to evaluate conventional, qualitative methods of achieving this balance.
METHODS: TKA was performed on 10 cadaveric knees. Prior to and after load balancing, compartment forces were measured at flexion angles of 0-90 degrees. Knees were randomly assigned into one of two groups, based upon whether or not the surgeons could visualize the load cell's output during balancing.
RESULTS: Prior to attempting load balance, there were significant differences between the medial and lateral compartment loads for all knees (p < 0.05). After attempting balance with the aid of the load cell, there was equal load balance at all angles studied. Without the aid of the load cell, balance was not consistently achieved at every angle.
CONCLUSIONS: Conventional load balancing techniques in TKA are not perfect."
pub.1101370689,Prevention of Dislocation After Total Hip Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Prevention of dislocation after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) begins with patient preoperative assessment and planning.
METHODS: We performed a literature search to assess historical perspectives and current strategies to prevent dislocation after primary THA. The search yielded 3458 articles, and 154 articles are presented.
RESULTS: Extremes of age, body mass index &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, lumbosacral pathology, surgeon experience, and femoral head size influence dislocation rates after THA. There is mixed evidence regarding the effect of neuromuscular disease, sequelae of pediatric hip conditions, and surgical approach on THA instability. Sex, simultaneous bilateral THA, and restrictive postoperative precautions do not influence the dislocation rates of THA. Navigation, robotics, lipped liners, and dual-mobility acetabular components may improve dislocation rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Risks for dislocation should be identified, and measures should be taken to mitigate the risk. Reliance on safe zones of acetabular component positioning is historical. We are in an era of bespoke THA surgery."
pub.1172947351,Impact of Offset and Leg Length on Functional Outcomes Post-Total Hip Arthroplasty: How Accurate Should Coronal Reconstruction Be?,"BACKGROUND: Accurate hip reconstruction is associated with improved biomechanical behavior following total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, whether this is associated with improved patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is unknown.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: This study aimed to: 1) describe the ability to reconstruct coronal geometry during THA without advanced technology; 2) assess whether restoration of global offset (GO) and leg length (LL) is associated with improved PROs; and 3) investigate whether increased femoral offset (FO) to compensate for reduced acetabular offset (AO) influences PROs.
METHOD: This was a prospective, multicenter, consecutive cohort study of 500 patients treated with primary THA without robotics or navigation. The Oxford Hip score (OHS) was obtained preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up. Supine anteroposterior pelvic radiographs were analyzed to determine AO, FO, GO, and LL relative to the native contralateral side. Contour plots for ΔOHS based on ΔLL and ΔGO were created, and ΔOHS was calculated within and outside various ranges (±2.5, ±5, or ±10 mm).
RESULTS: In the operated hip, mean FO increased by 3 ± 6 mm (range, -16 to 27), while AO decreased by 2 ± 4 mm (range, -17 to 10). The contour graph for ±2.5 mm zones showed the best outcomes (ΔOHS >25) with GO and LL centered on 0 ± 2.5 mm (P < .01). However, only 10% achieved such reconstruction. When GO and LL differences were within ±10 mm, ΔOHS was superior when both AO and FO were within ±5 mm (mean: 24 ± 10; range, -5 to 40) compared with when FO was above 5 mm to compensate for a reduction in AO (mean: 22 ± 11; range, -10 to 46; P = .040).
CONCLUSIONS: The PROs were associated with biomechanical reconstruction, and the best clinical improvement can be expected when GO and LL differences are both within 2.5 mm. Maintenance of AO is important, as compensation by increasing FO is associated with inferior OHS."
pub.1145425642,Comparison of Utilization and Short-term Complications Between Technology-assisted and Conventional Total Hip Arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Although technology-assisted total hip arthroplasty (TA-THA) may improve implant positioning, it remains unknown whether TA-THA confers improved clinical outcomes. We sought to examine national TA-THA utilization trends and compare clinical outcomes between TA-THA and unassisted THA (U-THA).
METHODS: Patients who underwent primary, elective THA from 2010 to 2018 were identified using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Demographic, perioperative, and 30-day outcomes were queried and collected. Patients were stratified based on whether they underwent TA-THA, which included computer navigation or robotics, and U-THA. Propensity score matching paired patients undergoing TA-THA or U-THA on a 1:1 basis.
RESULTS: Of the 238,755 THA patients, 3,149 cases (1.3%) were done using TA-THA. Comparing the unmatched TA-THA and U-THA groups, race distribution (P < 0.001) and baseline functional status (P < 0.001) differed. Propensity score matching yielded 2,335 TA-THA and U-THA pairs. Perioperatively, the TA-THA cohort had longer mean surgical times (101.0 ± 34.0 versus 91.9 ± 38.8 minutes, P < 0.001), but lower transfusion rates (5.7% versus 7.8%, P = 0.005). As compared with the U-THA group, the TA-THA group had a shorter mean hospital length of stay (2.0 ± 1.1 versus 2.5 ± 2.0 days, P < 0.001) and a higher proportion of patients discharged home (85.8% versus 75.7%, P < 0.001). Notably, the TA-THA cohort had higher readmission rates (3.8% versus 2.4%, P < 0.001). Major complication and revision surgery rates did not markedly differ between groups.
DISCUSSION: TA-THA utilization rates remain low among orthopaedic surgeons. As compared with U-THA, TA-THA yield mixed perioperative and 30-day outcomes. Surgeons must consider the clinical benefits and drawbacks of TA-THA when determining the proper surgical technique and technology for each patient. Clinical trials assessing long-term functional and clinical outcomes between U-THA and TA-THA are required to further elucidate the utility of assistive technologies in THA.

pub.1172308666,"How Has the Total Hip Arthroplasty Patient Population Changed? A Ten-Year Analysis of Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients from 2013 to 2022: A Retrospective, Single-Center Study","BACKGROUND: Over the past decades, utilization of total hip arthroplasty (THA) has steadily increased. Understanding the demographic trends of THA patients can assist in projecting access to care. This study sought to assess the temporal trends in THA patient baseline characteristics and socioeconomic factors.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 16,296 patients who underwent primary elective THA from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022. Demographic data, including age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index, insurance, and socioeconomic status, as determined by median income by patients' zip code, were collected. The trends of these data were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test.
RESULTS: Over the past decade at our institution, patient age (2013: 62.1 years to 2022: 65.1 years, P = .001), BMI (2013: 29.0 to 2022: 29.5, P = .020), and mean Charlson comorbidity index (2013: 2.4 to 2022: 3.1, P = .001) increased. The proportion of Medicare patients increased from 48.4% in 2013 to 54.9% in 2022 (P = .001). The proportion of African American patients among the THA population increased from 11.3% in 2013 to 13.0% in 2022 (P = .012). Over this period, 90-day readmission and 1-year revision rates did not significantly change (2013: 4.8 and 3.0% to 2022: 3.4 and 1.4%, P = .107 and P = .136, respectively). The proportion of operations using robotic devices also significantly increased (2013: 0% to 2022: 19.1%; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the past decade, the average age, BMI, and comorbidity burden of THA patients have significantly increased, suggesting improved access to care for these populations. Similarly, there have been improvements in access to care for African American patients. Along with these changes in patient demographics, we found no change in 90-day readmission or 1-year revision rates. Continued characterization of the THA patient population is vital to understanding this demographic shift and educating future strategies and improvements in patient care."
pub.1175738372,Effect of inverse kinematic alignment total knee arthroplasty on coronal alignment of the ankle joint in patients with varus knee deformity,"IntroductionVarus or valgus knee deformities influence ankle coronal alignments. The impact of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) on ankle joint alignment has not been entirely illustrated. Inverse Kinematic Alignment (iKA) is a surgical philosophy that aims to restore soft tissue balance, function, and native anatomy within validated boundaries to restore restrictive native kinematics. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the postoperative association of patient-specific alignment on the coronal alignment of the ankle in patients with varus knee deformity who underwent iKA TKA. We hypothesized that greater preoperative varus malalignments would correlate with significant postoperative ankle coronal alignment changes.MethodsThis retrospective study of a prospective collected cohort assessed patients who underwent imageless navigation assisted robotic TKA using a single implant design for primary osteoarthritis between January 2022 and August 2023. Preoperative and postoperative full-length standing anteroposterior X-ray imaging was used to measure Hip-Knee-Ankle (HKA), Tibial Plafond Inclination (TPI), Talar inclination (TI), and Tibiotalar Tilt (TTT) angles. Patients were subsequently divided into groups of neutral varus) < 10°) and severe varus (≥ 10°) according to the preoperative HKA angle.ResultsSignificant changes in preoperative and postoperative HKA angles were found in the severe varus (14.5° vs. 6.4°, p < 0.001) group. Changes were also significant between preoperative and postoperative TPI and TI angles in the severe varus group; however, TTT did not reach statistical significance. Delta change from pre- to postoperative HKA was significantly higher for the severe varus group (8.1° vs. 0.8°, p < 0.019). Delta change of TPI, TI and TTT did not differ between groups.ConclusionCoronal knee alignment after TKA affects coronal alignment of the ankle. iKA technique in TKA for varus knee deformity preserves or minimizes substantial coronal alignment changes of the ankle joint. These findings may add to the benefits reported for patient specific alignment TKA techniques.Level of evidenceIII."
pub.1163448760,THA-Net: A Deep Learning Solution for Next-Generation Templating and Patient-specific Surgical Execution,"BACKGROUND: This study introduces THA-Net, a deep learning inpainting algorithm for simulating postoperative total hip arthroplasty (THA) radiographs from a single preoperative pelvis radiograph input, while being able to generate predictions either unconditionally (algorithm chooses implants) or conditionally (surgeon chooses implants).
METHODS: The THA-Net is a deep learning algorithm which receives an input preoperative radiograph and subsequently replaces the target hip joint with THA implants to generate a synthetic yet realistic postoperative radiograph. We trained THA-Net on 356,305 pairs of radiographs from 14,357 patients from a single institution's total joint registry and evaluated the validity (quality of surgical execution) and realism (ability to differentiate real and synthetic radiographs) of its outputs against both human-based and software-based criteria.
RESULTS: The surgical validity of synthetic postoperative radiographs was significantly higher than their real counterparts (mean difference: 0.8 to 1.1 points on 10-point Likert scale, P < .001), but they were not able to be differentiated in terms of realism in blinded expert review. Synthetic images showed excellent validity and realism when analyzed with already validated deep learning models.
CONCLUSION: We developed a THA next-generation templating tool that can generate synthetic radiographs graded higher on ultimate surgical execution than real radiographs from training data. Further refinement of this tool may potentiate patient-specific surgical planning and enable technologies such as robotics, navigation, and augmented reality (an online demo of THA-Net is available at: https://demo.osail.ai/tha_net)."
pub.1158602037,Robotic‐assisted mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty does not lead to better clinical and radiological outcomes when compared to conventional TKA: a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials,"PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (R-TKA) has emerged as an alternative to improve the results of the conventional manual TKA (C-TKA). The aim of this study was to analyse the high-level studies comparing R-TKA and C-TKA in terms of clinical outcomes, radiological results, perioperative parameters, and complications.
METHODS: The literature search was conducted on three databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science) on 1 February 2023 according to the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Inclusion criteria were: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), written in English language, published in the last 15 years, focusing on the comparison of C-TKA and R-TKA results. The quality of each article was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials version 2 (RoB 2). The statistical analysis was carried out using random effects (DerSimonian & Laird) for weighted mean difference (MD) of the continuous variables and Peto method for odds ratios of the dichotomous variables.
RESULTS: Among the 2905 articles retrieved, 14 RCTs on 12 series of patients treated with mechanically aligned implants were included. A total of 2255 patients (25.1% males and 74.9% females; mean age 62.9 ± 3.0; mean BMI 28.1 ± 1.3) were analysed. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that R-TKA did not provide overall superior results compared to C-TKA in mechanically aligned implants in terms of clinical and radiological outcomes. R-TKA showed longer operative time (MD = 15.3 min, p = 0.004) and similar complication rates compared to C-TKA. A statistically significant difference in favour of R-TKA was found in the posterior-stabilized subgroup in terms of radiological outcomes (hip-knee-ankle angle MD = 1.7, p < 0.001) compared to C-TKA, although without resulting in appreciable difference of clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSION: R-TKA did not provide overall superior results compared to C-TKA in terms of clinical and radiological outcomes, showing longer operative time and similar complication rates.

The aim of this study was to evaluate 90-day complication and cost of navigation-assisted TKAs (NTKA) compared to conventional TKAs (CTKA) using a national database.
METHODS: A retrospective review of national database was conducted on all patients who underwent TKA from 2010 and 2017. The cohort was stratified into NTKA and CTKA subcohorts, excluding cases utilizing robotics.
RESULTS: NTKA was associated with a significant decrease in 90-day postoperative major and minor complications. NTKA was also associated with a decrease in 90-day hospital utilization with lower rates of emergency department visits and readmissions. The cost of hospitalization and total 90-day costs were lower in NTKA, with an average savings of $800.
CONCLUSION: The adoption of navigation in TKA is safe and efficaceous compared to CTKA.

We aimed to evaluate the postoperative radiographic outcomes of robot-assisted (RAS-THA) versus manual (M-THA) total hip arthroplasty.MethodsThis multicenter RCT was performed from March 1, 2021 to December 1, 2021. Patients were randomly assigned to routine M-THA or to RAS-THA that used the TRex-RS orthopedic joint surgical navigation system. The primary outcome was to compare the acetabular component orientation, femoral stem alignment, femoral canal fill ratio, and leg length discrepancy between RAS-THA and M-THA using postoperative radiography. Subgroup analyses of the two groups stratified by surgical approach, gender, and BMI were also conducted.ResultsSeventy-three participants were randomly allocated to the RAS-THA group, while seventy-two participants were assigned to the M-THA group. Compared to the M-THA group, the RAS-THA group exhibited less variability in the preoperative planning of the vertical center of rotation (VCOR; P < 0.001), demonstrated a significant advantage in femoral stem alignment (P = 0.004), and showed pronounced decreases in inequality and in the variability in leg length discrepancy (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the Lewinnek safe-zone ratio (P = 0.081) and the femoral canal fill ratio (P > 0.05) between the two groups. Further subgroup analysis also showed that the RAS-THA group had fewer horizontal center of rotation (HCOR) and leg length differences when stratified by surgical approach, gender, and overweight status.ConclusionThis RCT found that, regardless of the surgical approach, gender, or body mass index, RAS-THA can effectively improve the postoperative VCOR and significantly reduce the variability of leg length difference. RAS-THA should be considered an effective method to enhance surgical precision by achieving less variability in challenging patients with leg length discrepancies.Trial registration: ChiCTR2100044124."
pub.1150148483,Comparison of Premium Technology Utilization in Total Hip Arthroplasty Between Safety-net Hospitals and Non–safety-net Hospitals,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of our study was to investigate the association of safety-net hospital (SNH) status with the use of premium technologies in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons American Joint Replacement Registry.
METHODS: Premium technology was defined as having one or more of the following three characteristics: ceramic femoral head, dual mobility (DM) bearing, or surgery conducted with robotic assistance (RA). Patients of all ages were included and subdivided into ceramic femoral head, DM, and RA cohorts. SNH status (based on disproportionate share data), patient demographics, geographical region, hospital size, and teaching affiliation were assessed. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyze any notable associations.
RESULTS: A total of 624,933 THAs between SNHs and non-SNHs were available for analysis. Based on the three different premium technology categories, there were 551,838 THAs for ceramic femoral head utilization analysis, 601,223 THAs for DM utilization analysis, and 199,250 THAs for RA utilization analysis. SNHs were associated with less use of DM and RA (odds ratio [OR] 0.53 P < 0.0001, 0.39 P < 0.0001, respectively). No difference was observed in ceramic femoral head utilization between SNHs and non-SNHs. Patient age was significantly associated with less utilization of all three premium THA technologies (ceramic: OR 0.43 P < 0.0001; DM: OR 0.93 P < 0.0001, RA: OR 0.89 P < 0.001). Teaching hospitals were significantly associated with increased utilization of premium THA technologies (ceramic: OR 1.23 P < 0.0001, DM: OR 1.62 P < 0.0001, RA: OR 5.33 P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Premium THA technologies are becoming increasingly used across the US healthcare system; however, that growth is not equal in hospitals with marginalized patient populations. The utilization of ceramic femoral heads is becoming increasingly common across healthcare systems suggesting that ceramic femoral heads may no longer be considered premium technology but rather standard THA care.

pub.1125112370,Kinematically Aligned Total Knee Arthroplasty with Patient-Specific Instrument,"Kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a new alignment technique. Kinematic alignment corrects arthritic deformity to the patient's constitutional alignment in order to position the femoral and tibial components, as well as to restore the knee's natural tibial-femoral articular surface, alignment, and natural laxity. Kinematic knee motion moves around a single flexion-extension axis of the distal femur, passing through the center of cylindrically shaped posterior femoral condyles. Since it can be difficult to locate cylindrical axis with conventional instrument, patient-specific instrument (PSI) is used to align the kinematic axes. PSI was recently introduced as a new technology with the goal of improving the accuracy of operative technique, avoiding practical issues related to the complexity of navigation and robotic system, such as the costs and higher number of personnel required. There are several limitations to implement the kinematically aligned TKA with the implant for mechanical alignment. Therefore, it is important to design an implant with the optimal shape for restoring natural knee kinematics that might improve patient-reported satisfaction and function."
pub.1169286804,Personalized alignment techniques better restore the native trochlear groove compared to systematic alignment techniques in total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The relationship between constitutional coronal alignment and implant positioning on trochlear groove restoration in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether the choice of alignment philosophy significantly affects the restoration of the trochlea groove.
METHODS: Sixty-one imageless robotic TKAs performed by a single orthopaedic surgeon were retrospectively reviewed. In each case, the entire native trochlea was digitized to generate the native femoral anatomy, and implants were planned according to a functional alignment (FA) technique. Final implant position was recorded using the validated bone resection planes from the navigation system. Simulated femoral component positions were generated according to previously described alignment techniques: mechanical alignment (MA), gap balancing (GB), kinematic alignment (KA), restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) and restricted inverse kinematic alignment (riKA). Trochlear angle (TA), trochlear under/overstuffing and mediolateral sulcus offset were compared between the six simulated alignment techniques, as well as the final implanted technique. Further analyses investigated the effect of preoperative coronal alignment on trochlear position. Comparisons were assessed with an analysis of variance and Welch's t-tests or Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests with Bonferroni corrections.
RESULTS: The implanted and simulated techniques all resulted in greater TA valgus compared to the native groove (p < 0.001). The implanted technique, KA and rKA were closer to the native TA than GB, MA and riKA (p > 0.001). All alignment philosophies understuffed the native trochlea groove. KA and rKA understuffed less than all other techniques (p < 0.001), and GB understuffed more than all other techniques (p < 0.001). In extension, all techniques shifted the trochlear sulcus laterally, while in flexion, they medialized it. These effects were most prominent in GB and MA.
CONCLUSION: Personalized alignment techniques such as KA and rKA, which consider variations in individual anatomy, best restore the native patellar groove compared to systematic alignment techniques when using a standardized femoral component.

pub.1158532083,Simulating movements of daily living in robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty with 3D modelling,"Aims: Computer-assisted 3D preoperative planning software has the potential to improve postoperative stability in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Commonly, preoperative protocols simulate two functional positions (standing and relaxed sitting) but do not consider other common positions that may increase postoperative impingement and possible dislocation. This study investigates the feasibility of simulating commonly encountered positions, and positions with an increased risk of impingement, to lower postoperative impingement risk in a CT-based 3D model.
Methods: A robotic arm-assisted arthroplasty planning platform was used to investigate 11 patient positions. Data from 43 primary THAs were used for simulation. Sacral slope was retrieved from patient preoperative imaging, while angles of hip flexion/extension, hip external/internal rotation, and hip abduction/adduction for tested positions were derived from literature or estimated with a biomechanical model. The hip was placed in the described positions, and if impingement was detected by the software, inspection of the impingement type was performed.
Results: In flexion, an overall impingement rate of 2.3% was detected for flexed-seated, squatting, forward-bending, and criss-cross-sitting positions, and 4.7% for the ankle-over-knee position. In extension, most hips (60.5%) were found to impinge at or prior to 50° of external rotation (pivoting). Many of these impingement events were due to a prominent ischium. The mean maximum external rotation prior to impingement was 45.9° (15° to 80°) and 57.9° (20° to 90°) prior to prosthetic impingement. No impingement was found in standing, sitting, crossing ankles, seiza, and downward dog.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that positions of daily living tested in a CT-based 3D model show high rates of impingement. Simulating additional positions through 3D modelling is a low-cost method of potentially improving outcomes without compromising patient safety. By incorporating CT-based 3D modelling of positions of daily living into routine preoperative protocols for THA, there is the potential to lower the risk of postoperative impingement events."
pub.1173403606,Personalized total knee arthroplasty in patients with extra-articular deformities,"Over the years, with a better understanding of knee anatomy and biomechanics, superior implant designs, advanced surgical techniques, and the availability of precision tools such as robotics and navigation, a more personalized approach to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has emerged. In the presence of extra-articular deformities, performing personalized TKA can be more challenging and specific considerations are required, since one has to deal with an acquired pathological anatomy. Performing personalized TKA surgery in patients with extra-articular deformities, the surgeon can: (1) resurface the joint, omitting the extra-articular deformity; (2) partially compensate the extra-articular deformity with intra-articular correction (hybrid technique), or (3) correct the extra-articular deformity combined with a joint resurfacing TKA (single stage or two-stage procedure). Omitting the acquired lower limb malalignment by resurfacing the knee has the advantages of respecting the joint surface anatomy and preserving soft tissue laxities. On the other hand, it maintains pathological joint load and lower limb kinematics with potentially detrimental outcomes. The hybrid technique can be performed in most cases. It circumvents complications associated with osteotomies and brings lower limb axes closer to native alignment. On the other hand, it creates some intra-articular imbalances, which may require soft tissue releases and/or constrained implants. Correcting the extra-articular deformity (through an osteotomy) in conjunction with joint resurfacing TKA represents the only true kinematic alignment technique, as it aims to reproduce native knee laxity and overall lower limb axis."
pub.1170088592,Contribution of the Medial Iliofemoral Ligament to Hip Stability After Total Hip Arthroplasty Through the Direct Anterior Approach,"BACKGROUND: Dislocation after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a primary reason for THA revision. During THA through the direct anterior approach (DAA), the iliofemoral ligament, which provides the main resistance to external rotation (ER) of the hip, is commonly partially transected. We asked: (1) what is the contribution of the medial iliofemoral ligament to resisting ER after DAA THA? and (2) how much resistance to ER can be restored by repairing the ligament?
METHODS: A fellowship-trained surgeon performed DAA THA on 9 cadaveric specimens. The specimens were computed tomography scanned before and after implantation. Prior to testing, the ER range of motion of each specimen to impingement in neutral and 10° of extension was computationally predicted. Each specimen was tested on a 6-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator. The pelvis was placed in neutral and 10° of extension. The femur was externally rotated until it reached the specimen's impingement target. Total ER torque was recorded with the medial iliofemoral ligament intact, after transecting the ligament, and after repair. Torque at extremes of motion was calculated for each condition. To isolate the contribution of the native ligament, the torque for the transected state was subtracted from both the native and repaired conditions.
RESULTS: The medial iliofemoral ligament contributed an average of 68% (range, 34 to 87) of the total torque at the extreme of motion in neutral and 80% (58 to 97) in 10⁰ of extension. The repaired ligament contributed 17% (1 to 54) of the total torque at the extreme of motion in neutral and 14% (5 to 38) in 10⁰ of extension, restoring on average 18 to 25% of the native resistance against ER.
CONCLUSIONS: The medial iliofemoral ligament was an important contributor to the hip torque at the extreme of motion during ER. Repairing the ligament restored a fraction of its ability to generate torque to resist ER."
pub.1044533581,Onlay Tibial Implants Appear to Provide Superior Clinical Results in Robotic Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an increasingly popular option for the treatment of single-compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA) in adults. Two options for tibial resurfacing during UKA are (1) all-polyethylene inlays and (2) metal-backed onlays.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The aim of this study was to determine whether there are any differences in clinical outcomes with inlay versus onlay tibial components.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 39 inlays and 45 onlays, with average 2.7- and 2.3-year follow-up, respectively, from a prospective robotic-assisted surgery database. The primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index (WOMAC), subcategorized by the pain, stiffness, and function subscores, at 2 years postoperatively. The secondary outcome was the need for secondary or revision surgery.
RESULTS: Postoperative WOMAC pain score was 3.1 for inlays and 1.6 for onlays (p = 0.03). For 25 inlays and 30 onlays with both preoperative and postoperative WOMAC data, pain score improved from 8.3 to 4.0 for inlays versus from 9.2 to 1.7 for onlays (p = 0.01). Function score improved from 27.5 to 12.5 for inlays versus from 32.1 to 7.3 for onlays (p = 0.03). Four inlays and one onlay required a secondary or revision procedure (p = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS: We advise using metal-backed onlays during UKA to improve postoperative clinical outcomes."
pub.1101839198,Analysis and optimization of bone machining for robotic orthopedic surgeries,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted joint replacement surgery is becoming increasingly more common worldwide, therefore it is important to characterize and improve the bone-cutting mechanics of surgical tools.
METHODS: Linear coefficients relating cutting force and chip thickness were derived for a surgical spindle. The cutting coefficients were integrated into an analytical simulation which calculated cutting forces, torque, and power consumption. An optimization experiment was performed. High speed video was taken at various tool parameter settings.
RESULTS: Varying machining parameters resulted in lower cutting forces. The surgical spindle stalled at the current spindle speed used in surgery, but did not for the new, optimized conditions. Multiple anomalies were identified in the videos that confirmed observations from the cutting force data.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved surgical performance and accuracy were achieved using slower spindle speeds, decreased cutting depth, and increased feed rates, as well as improving motor torque to ensure a smooth cutting process."
pub.1169505744,Kombination von Knieteilprothesen bei intaktem vorderem Kreuzband – ein Zukunftsmodell?,"BackgroundPreserving both cruciate ligaments in knee prosthetics enables approximately physiological joint kinematics. In this way, faster rehabilitation and a higher return-to-sports rate can be achieved. Accordingly, there are considerations to preserve both cruciate ligaments by combining two partial prostheses in the case of symptomatic bicompartmental (BiCom) knee osteoarthritis.MethodsThis article summarizes the literature on BiCom arthroplasty and describes our own experiences from 54 consecutive cases with robotic-assisted technology.ResultsAccording to current data, BiCom arthroplasty shows good clinical results, without being able to demonstrate a clear advantage over conventional TKA. The revision risk is slightly increased in the short-term interval, which could be positively addressed with robotic-assistance. The disadvantages are the increased implant costs and the risk of subsequent osteoarthritis. Accordingly, patients who may potentially take advantage of this treatment must be critically selected."
pub.1122625867,Improved Patient Satisfaction following Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Approximately 20% of the patients are dissatisfied with their total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Computer technology has been introduced for TKA to provide real time intraoperative information on limb alignment and exact flexion/extension gap measurements. The purpose of this study was to determine if patient satisfaction could be improved with the use of robotic-assisted (RA) technology following primary TKA. A total of 120 consecutive patients undergoing RA-TKA with real time intraoperative alignment and gap balancing information were compared with a prospective cohort of 103 consecutive patients undergoing TKA with manual jig-based instruments during the same time period. There were no differences between groups with age, gender, baseline Knee Society Score (KSS) knee and function scores, follow-up, and ASA scores. TKAs were performed using same technique, implant design, anesthesia, and postoperative treatment protocols. Patient satisfaction survey using KSS and Likert scoring system were obtained at 1-year follow-up. Likert scoring system demonstrated 94% of the patients in the RA group were either very satisfied or satisfied versus 82% in the manual instruments TKA group (<i>p</i> = 0.005). RA-TKA group had better average scores of all five satisfaction questions although not significant. RA-TKA group had a better average overall satisfaction score of 7.1 versus 6.6 in the manual instrument group, <i>p</i> = 0.03. KSS function scores were significantly better at 6 weeks and 1 year postoperatively (<i>p</i> = 0.02, 0.005), and KSS knee scores were significantly better at 1 year postoperatively (<i>p</i> = 0.046). There are multiple reasons for patient dissatisfaction following primary TKA. Using intraoperative computer technology with RA surgery for patients undergoing a primary TKA, a significant improvement in patient satisfaction was demonstrated compared with TKA using conventional manual jig-based instruments. RA surgery provides several advantages in TKA including real time information in millimeters to help obtain balanced gaps, accurate bone cuts, reduced soft tissue injury, and achieve the target alignment which may lead to improved patient satisfaction."
pub.1130204267,"Overview of Randomized Controlled Trials in Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty (34,020 Patients): What Have We Learnt?","AIM: To provide an overview of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in primary total hip arthroplasty summarizing the available high-quality evidence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA), we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2020, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase. We excluded nonrandomized trials, trials on neck of femur fractures or revision surgery, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Trials that met our inclusion criteria were assessed using a binary outcome measure of whether they reported statistically significant findings. These were then classified according to the intervention groups (surgical approach, fixation, and component design use, among others).
RESULTS: Three hundred twelve RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were included. The total number of patients in those 312 RCTs was 34,020. Sixty-one RCTs (19.5%) reported significant differences between the intervention and the control groups. The trials were grouped into surgical approach 72, fixation 7, cement 16, femoral stem 46, head sizes 5, cup design 18, polyethylene 25, bearing surfaces 30, metal-on-metal 30, resurfacing 20, navigation 15, robotics 3, surgical technique 12, and closure/drains/postoperative care 13 RCTs.
DISCUSSION: The evidence reviewed indicates that for the vast majority of patients, a standard conventional total hip arthroplasty with a surgical approach familiar to the surgeon using standard well-established components and highly cross-linked polyethylene leads to satisfactory clinical outcomes. This evidence also offers arthroplasty surgeons the flexibility to use the standard and cost-effective techniques and achieve comparable outcomes."
pub.1113299793,One-Year Patient Outcomes for Robotic-Arm-Assisted versus Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Although there are many studies on the alignment advantages when using the robotic arm-assisted (RAA) system for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there have been questions regarding patient-reported outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use this index to compare: (1) total, (2) physical function, and (3) pain scores for manual versus RAA patients. We compared 53 consecutive RAA to 53 consecutive manual TKAs. No differences in preoperative scores were found between the cohorts. Patients were administered a modified Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index satisfaction survey preoperatively and at 1-year postoperatively. The results were broken down to: (1) total, (2) physical function, and (3) pain scores. Univariate analysis with independent samples <i>t</i>-tests was used to compare 1-year postoperative scores. Multivariate models with stepwise backward linear regression were utilized to evaluate the associations between scores and surgical technique, age, sex, as well as body mass index (BMI). Statistical analyses were performed with a <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 to determine significance. The RAA cohort had significantly improved mean total (6 ± 6 vs. 9 ± 8 points, <i>p</i> = 0.03) and physical function scores (4 ± 4 vs. 6 ± 5 points, <i>p</i> = 0.02) when compared with the manual cohort. The mean pain score for the RAA cohort (2 ± 3 points [range, 0-14 points]) was also lower than that for the manual cohort (3 ± 4 points [range, 0-11 points]) (<i>p</i> = 0.06). On backward linear regression analyses, RAA was found to be significantly associated with more improved total (β coefficient [β] -0.208, standard error [SE] 1.401, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), function (β = 0.216, SE = 0.829, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and pain scores (β -0.181, SE = 0.623, <i>p</i> = 0.063). The RAA technique was found to have the strongest association with improved scores when compared with age, gender, and BMI. This study suggests that RAA patients may have short-term improvements at minimum 1-year postoperatively. However, longer term follow-up with greater sample sizes is needed to further validate these results."
pub.1157490432,Virtual Joint Motion Simulator Accurately Predicts Effects of Femoral Component Malalignment during TKA,"Component alignment accuracy during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been improving through the adoption of image-based navigation and robotic surgical systems. The biomechanical implications of resulting component alignment error, however, should be better characterized to better understand how sensitive surgical outcomes are to alignment error. Thus, means for analyzing the relationships between alignment, joint kinematics, and ligament mechanics for candidate prosthesis component design are necessary. We used a digital twin of a commercially available joint motion simulator to evaluate the effects of femoral component rotational alignment. As anticipated, the model showed that an externally rotated femoral component results in a knee which is more varus in flexion, with lower medial collateral ligament tension compared to a TKA knee with a neutrally aligned femoral implant. With the simulation yielding logical results for this relatively simple test scenario, we can have more confidence in the accuracy of its predictions for more complicated scenarios."

pub.1139805015,Patient expectations and satisfaction in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a prospective two-year outcome study,"IntroductionThe impact of fulfillment of patient expectations throughout recovery on satisfaction in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is not well understood. Utilizing a standardized TKA method with a robotically assisted (RA) platform, we investigated the impact of expectation fulfillment at 3-month (M) and 6-M on 1-year (Y) and 2-Y satisfaction. We hypothesize that early fulfillment of patient expectations is associated with improved midterm patient satisfaction. We also compare improvements in outcomes with RA-TKA to those of a recent large national TKA cohort study to determine whether RA-TKA meets or exceeds the current standard of care.Materials and methodsOne hundred six patients were prospectively enrolled and underwent robotic-assisted TKA by a single surgeon using the OMNIBotics system. Patients completed KOOS and New Knee Society Score (KSS) preoperatively and at 3M, 6M, 1Y, and 2Y postoperatively. Expectation fulfillment was subdivided into patients who were below or above the average expectation score pre-operatively, or fulfillment of expectation score at 3M and 6M post TKA. The satisfaction of each group was then compared at 1Y and 2Y post TKA. Study cohort outcomes were compared to contemporary literature from the Function and Outcomes Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement (FORCE–TJR) database.ResultsPatients with greater than average KSS expectation fulfillment at 3M reported significantly higher KSS satisfaction scores at 1Y (34.9 ± 5.3 vs 30.6 ± 6.7, p = 0.0012), and patients with greater than average 6M expectation fulfillment reported improved satisfaction at 1Y (33.9 ± 5.9 vs 31.1 ± 6.7, p = 0.0330) and 2Y (35.2 ± 4.8 vs 32.4 ± 6.8, p = 0.0323). When compared to the FORCE-TJR database, no significant differences in post-operative KOOS outcomes were observed except for Sports and Recreation, for which the RAS group demonstrated higher scores (65.5 ± 30.0 vs 53.0 ± 27.1 p < 0.0001); however, the study cohort reported significantly greater improvements in KOOS Pain, Symptoms, Sports and Recreation, and Quality of Life at multiple time points up to 2 years post TKA.ConclusionHigh early-expectation fulfillment was associated with improved satisfaction at 1Y and 2Y, indicating the importance of managing patient-specific post-operative care to ensure patients reach their pre-operative goals. Greater improvements in all KOOS sub-scores and in absolute Sports and Recreation at 1Y and 2Y were observed in this robotic-assisted cohort compared to a large contemporary database, indicating that RAS meets or exceeds current standard of care benchmarks for patient-reported outcomes."
pub.1064454936,Ligament balancing in computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty: Improved clinical results with a spring-loaded tensioning device,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains one of the most successful procedures in orthopaedic surgery. Complications certainly exist and are often related to failure of knee ligament balance. This asymmetry subsequently leads to component mal-alignment and loosening often secondary to deviation of the lower extremity mechanical axis. Understanding knee mechanics is essential, and recent technological advances have begun to minimize postoperative problems. A tensioning device that respects the native patellofemoral anatomy as well as the natural ligamentous strains has been developed. The surgical integration of computer-assisted navigation has allowed for enhanced accuracy and subsequently better results. The purpose of the current paper is to discuss the evolution of an improved ligament tensioning device, in the setting of classic mechanical guidance versus computer assistance and its postoperative impact on total knee outcomes in terms of manipulation rates and two-year radiographic alignment data. Based on a single surgeon series, mechanically guided arthroplasties resulted in a 16 per cent manipulation rate. Computer assistance with spacer blocks decreased the manipulation rate to 14 per cent, while using a novel tensioner device further decreased the manipulation rate to 7 per cent, a significant difference of p < 0.01. Radiographic data illustrate all TKAs with the tensioner to be within 4 degrees of the desired position."
pub.1143055955,Tibiofemoral dynamic stressed gap laxities correlate with compartment load measurements in robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"AIMS: It is unknown whether gap laxities measured in robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) correlate to load sensor measurements. The aim of this study was to determine whether symmetry of the maximum medial and lateral gaps in extension and flexion was predictive of knee balance in extension and flexion respectively using different maximum thresholds of intercompartmental load difference (ICLD) to define balance.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 165 patients undergoing functionally-aligned TKA was performed (176 TKAs). With trial components in situ, medial and lateral extension and flexion gaps were measured using robotic navigation while applying valgus and varus forces. The ICLD between medial and lateral compartments was measured in extension and flexion with the load sensor. The null hypothesis was that stressed gap symmetry would not correlate directly with sensor-defined soft tissue balance.
RESULTS: In TKAs with a stressed medial-lateral gap difference of ≤1 mm, 147 (89%) had an ICLD of ≤15 lb in extension, and 112 (84%) had an ICLD of ≤ 15 lb in flexion; 157 (95%) had an ICLD ≤ 30 lb in extension, and 126 (94%) had an ICLD ≤ 30 lb in flexion; and 165 (100%) had an ICLD ≤ 60 lb in extension, and 133 (99%) had an ICLD ≤ 60 lb in flexion. With a 0 mm difference between the medial and lateral stressed gaps, 103 (91%) of TKA had an ICLD ≤ 15 lb in extension, decreasing to 155 (88%) when the difference between the medial and lateral stressed extension gaps increased to ± 3 mm. In flexion, 47 (77%) had an ICLD ≤ 15 lb with a medial-lateral gap difference of 0 mm, increasing to 147 (84%) at ± 3 mm.
CONCLUSION: This study found a strong relationship between intercompartmental loads and gap symmetry in extension and flexion measured with prostheses in situ. The results suggest that ICLD and medial-lateral gap difference provide similar assessment of soft-tissue balance in robotic arm-assisted TKA.

pub.1044380062,"Patellofemoral arthroplasty, where are we today?","PURPOSE: Patellofemoral arthroplasty remains controversial, primarily due to the high failure rates reported with early implants. Numerous case series have been published over the years detailing results of various first- and second-generation implants. The purpose of this work is to summarize results published to date and identify common themes regarding implants, surgical techniques, and indications in order to maximize results of future procedures.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of the MEDLINE database was carried out to identify all clinical studies related to patellofemoral arthroplasty.
RESULTS: First-generation resurfacing implants were associated with relatively high failure rates in the medium term. Second-generation implants, with femoral cuts based on TKA designs have yielded more promising medium-term results. Surgical indications are specific and must be carefully followed to minimize poor results. Short-term complications are generally related to patellar maltracking, while long-term complications are generally related to progression of osteoarthritis in the tibiofemoral joint. Implant loosening and polyethylene wear are rarely reported. Short-term results are favourable for new technology including custom implants and computer navigated surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, recent improvements in implant design and surgical techniques have resulted in improvements in short- and medium-term results. More work is required to assess the long-term outcomes of modern implant designs.

pub.1123098811,Robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty can reduce radiologic outliers compared to conventional techniques,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to those of conventional UKA in Asian patients.
METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent robot-assisted UKA and 57 patients underwent conventional UKA were assessed in this study. Preoperative and postoperative range of motion (ROM), American Knee Society (AKS) score, Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index scale score (WOMAC), and patellofemoral (PF) score values were compared between the two groups. The mechanical femorotibial angle (mFTA) and Kennedy zone were also measured. Coronal alignments of the femoral and tibial components and posterior slopes of the tibial component were compared. Additionally, polyethylene (PE) liner thicknesses were compared.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding postoperative ROM, AKS, WOMAC and PF score. Robot group showed fewer radiologic outliers in terms of mFTA and coronal alignment of tibial and femoral components (p = 0.022, 0.037, 0.003). The two groups showed significantly different PE liner thicknesses (8.4 ± 0.8 versus 8.8 ± 0.9, p = 0.035). Robot group was the only influencing factor for reducing radiologic outlier (postoperative mFTA) in multivariate model (odds ratio: 2.833, p = 0.037).
CONCLUSION: In this study, robot-assisted UKA had many advantages over conventional UKA, such as its ability to achieve precise implant insertion and reduce radiologic outliers. Although the clinical outcomes of robot-assisted UKA over a short-term follow-up period were not significantly different compared to those of conventional UKA, longer follow-up period is needed to determine whether the improved radiologic accuracy of the components in robotic-assisted UKA will lead to better clinical outcomes and improved long-term survival."
pub.1105906799,Robotik – maschinelle Brücke zwischen Bildgebung und Patient,"BackgroundThere are still a high number of dissatisfied knee arthroplasty patients. This situation has not changed much for decades, despite many innovations focusing on implant longevity and higher procedural precision. In this context, there is a growing discussion on possible systematic errors made in knee arthroplasty, especially regarding the alignment philosophy of the implants.ObjectiveIt was reported that a more anatomical alignment might result in improved patient outcome. However, current technologies have severe limitations to achieving optimized and individual alignment. In this context, the aim of this manuscript was to assess whether image-based robot-guided knee arthroplasty might represent an opportunity for achieving individualized alignment.MethodsThe literature on this subject was evaluated and analyzed. Furthermore, research projects and expert recommendations were discussed.ResultsThe precision of preoperative planning is higher with robotic techniques than with other computer-assisted or manual technologies. In addition, the individual soft tissue situation of the patient is taken into account and the prosthesis position is optimized. This ensures optimum soft tissue balancing and stability of the prosthesis.ConclusionModern robot-assisted systems are the mechanical bridge between imaging and patient. This technique provides objective control over the results produced with alternative alignments. This applies to both the prosthesis position itself and the resulting soft tissue balancing."
pub.1079340030,Improved Functional Outcomes with Robotic Compared with Manual Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"INTRODUCTION: Functional outcome following total hip arthroplasty (THA) is affected by accurate component positioning and restoration of hip biomechanics. Robotic-assisted THA (rTHA) has been shown to improve accuracy of component positioning, but its impact on functional outcomes has not been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to compare: 1) operative time; 2) estimated blood loss; 3) postoperative complications; and 4) patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between patients who either underwent rTHA or manual THA (mTHA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a single-center database was used to identify all patients who underwent primary THA since introduction of rTHA at a large academic medical center. Surgical factors including operative time and estimated blood loss as well as postoperative complications were recorded. Validated PROMs following rTHA (n = 100) were compared with consecutive mTHA cases (n = 100) performed by the same fellowship-trained surgeon at a minimum one-year follow-up (24 ± 6 months). PROMs included the Short-Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12), UCLA activity score (UCLA), Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index, and modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS). A categorical analysis was performed to determine differences in proportions of patients with mHHS scores of 90 to 100, 80 to 89, 70 to 79, and < 70 points between the two groups. Chi-square and two-tailed t-tests were used to compare categorical and continuous data between cohorts.
RESULTS: Mean operative time was nine minutes longer for the rTHA group compared with the mTHA group (131 ± 23 min vs. 122 ± 29 min, respectively, p = 0.012). Estimated intraoperative blood loss was significantly reduced for the rTHA group when compared to the mTHA group (374 ± 133 mL vs. 423 ± 186 mL, p = 0.035), and there was no difference in overall complication rates between the two groups (p = 0.101). Robotic-assisted THA demonstrated significantly higher mean postoperative mHHS (92.1 ± 10.5 vs. 86.1 ± 16.2, p = 0.002) and mean UCLA scores (6.3 ± 1.8 vs. 5.8 ± 1.7, p = 0.033) compared with mTHA. The difference between pre- and postoperative mHHS scores was statistically significant when comparing rTHA with mTHA (43.0 ± 18.8 vs. 37.4 ± 18.3, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in SF-12 or WOMAC scores. There was a significantly higher proportion of patients with mHHS scores between 90 to 100 points (75% vs. 61%, p = 0.034) and a lower percentage with scores < 70 points (6% vs. 19%, p = 0.005) in the rTHA cohort compared with the mTHA cohort.
DISCUSSION: The rTHA cohort demonstrated significantly higher mean postoperative UCLA scores, higher mean postoperative mHHS scores, and a greater percentage of patients with mHHS of 90 to 100 points compared with mTHA at a minimum one-year follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that robotic-assisted THA leads to improved patient-reported outcomes. The observed improv"
pub.1141148809,The Use of Navigation or Robotic-Assisted Technology in Total Knee Arthroplasty Does Not Reduce Postoperative Pain,"The use of intraoperative technology (IT), such as computer-assisted navigation (CAN) and robot-assisted surgery (RA), in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasingly popular due to its ability to enhance surgical precision and reduce radiographic outliers. There is disputing evidence as to whether IT leads to better clinical outcomes and reduced postoperative pain. The purpose of this study was to determine if use of CAN or RA in TKA improves pain outcomes. This is a retrospective review of a multicenter randomized control trial of 327 primary TKAs. Demographics, surgical time, IT use (CAN/RA), length of stay (LOS), and opioid consumption (in morphine milligram equivalents) were collected. Analysis was done by comparing IT (<i>n</i> = 110) to a conventional TKA cohort (<i>n</i> = 217). When accounting for demographic differences and the use of a tourniquet, the IT cohort had shorter surgical time (88.77 ± 18.57 vs. 98.12 ± 22.53 minutes; <i>p</i> = 0.005). While postoperative day 1 pain scores were similar (<i>p</i> = 0.316), the IT cohort has less opioid consumption at 2 weeks (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and 1 month (<i>p</i> = 0.005) postoperatively, but not at 3 months (<i>p</i> = 0.058). When comparing different types of IT, CAN, and RA, we found that they had similar surgical times (<i>p</i> = 0.610) and pain scores (<i>p</i> = 0.813). Both cohorts had similar opioid consumption at 2 weeks (<i>p</i> = 0.092), 1 month (<i>p</i> = 0.058), and 3 months (<i>p</i> = 0.064) postoperatively. The use of IT in TKA does not yield a clinically significant reduction in pain outcomes. There was also no difference in pain or perioperative outcomes between CAN and RA technology used in TKA."
pub.1105953218,Preoperative CT-Based Three-Dimensional Templating in Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty More Accurately Predicts Implant Sizes than Two-Dimensional Templating,"Patient dissatisfaction after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a concern. Surgical error is a common, avoidable cause of failed TKA. Correct femoral and tibial component sizing improves implant longevity, clinical outcomes, knee balance, and pain scores. We hypothesized that preoperative three-dimensional (3D) templating for robot-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) is more accurate than two-dimensional (2D) digital templating. Prospectively collected data from 31 RA-TKAs were assessed to determine accuracy pertaining to implant sizing and positioning. All cases undergoing RA-TKA undergo preoperative CT-scans as per protocol. Three blinded observers retrospectively templated these knees for TKA using standard radiographs. We compared whether 2D templating was as accurate as CT-guided templating. Postoperative radiographs were then evaluated for sizing and positioning. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the effect of learning curve were assessed. Preoperative femoral component 3D templating and retrospective blinded 2D templating accuracies were 96.6% and 52.9%, respectively (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>: 17.965; odds ratio [OR]: 24.957, 3.250-191.661; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Tibial component 3D and 2D templating accuracies were 93.1% and 28.7%, respectively (<i>χ</i> <sup>2:</sup> 36.436; OR: 33.480, 7.400-151.481; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). ICC for the three radiograph observers was 0.920 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.652-0.890; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) for the femur and 0.833 (0.717-0.911; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) for the tibia, showing excellent agreement. We conclude that preoperative CT-based templating for RA-TKA more accurately predicts the size of implants compared with traditional 2D digital templating. This may improve operating room efficiency and cost containment."
pub.1127262607,Surgeon proficiency in robot-assisted spine surgery.,"Continuous technical improvement in spinal surgical procedures, with the aim of enhancing patient outcomes, can be assisted by the deployment of advanced technologies including navigation, intraoperative CT imaging, and surgical robots. The latest generation of robotic surgical systems allows the simultaneous application of a range of digital features that provide the surgeon with an improved view of the surgical field, often through a narrow portal. There is emerging evidence that procedure-related complications and intraoperative blood loss can be reduced if the new technologies are used by appropriately trained surgeons. Acceptance of the role of surgical robots has increased in recent years among a number of surgical specialities including general surgery, neurosurgery, and orthopaedic surgeons performing major joint arthroplasty. However, ethical challenges have emerged with the rollout of these innovations, such as ensuring surgeon competence in the use of surgical robotics and avoiding financial conflicts of interest. Therefore, it is essential that trainees aspiring to become spinal surgeons as well as established spinal specialists should develop the necessary skills to use robotic technology safely and effectively and understand the ethical framework within which the technology is introduced. Traditional and more recently developed platforms exist to aid skill acquisition and surgical training which are described. The aim of this narrative review is to describe the role of surgical robotics in spinal surgery, describe measures of proficiency, and present the range of training platforms that institutions can use to ensure they employ confident spine surgeons adequately prepared for the era of robotic spinal surgery.

pub.1138480321,Can a robot help a surgeon to predict a good total knee arthroplasty?,"AIMS: Neither a surgeon's intraoperative impression nor the parameters of computer navigation have been shown to be predictive of the outcomes following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study was to determine whether a surgeon, with robotic assistance, can predict the outcome as assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for pain (KPS), one year postoperatively, and establish what factors correlate with poor KOOS scores in a well-aligned and balanced TKA.
METHODS: A total of 134 consecutive patients who underwent TKA using a dynamic ligament tensioning robotic system with a tibia first resection technique and a cruciate sacrificing ultracongruent TKA system were enrolled into a prospective study. Each TKA was graded based on the final mediolateral ligament balance at 10° and 90° of flexion: 1) < 1 mm difference in the thickness of the tibial insert and that which was planned (n = 75); 2) < 1 mm difference (n = 26); 3) between 1 mm to 2 mm difference (n = 26); and 4) > 2 mm difference (n = 7). The mean one-year KPS score for each grade of TKA was compared and the likelihood of achieving an KPS score of > 90 was calculated. Finally, the factors associated with lower KPS despite achieving a high-grade TKA (grade A and B) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Patients with a grade of A or B TKA had significantly higher mean one-year KPS scores compared with those with C or D grades (p = 0.031). There was no difference in KPS scores in grade A or B TKAs, but 33% of these patients did not have a KPS score of > 90. While there was no correlation with age, sex, preoperative deformity, and preoperative KOOS and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical scores, patients with a KPS score of < 90, despite a grade A or B TKA, had lower PROMIS mental health scores compared with those with KPS scores of > 90 (54.1 vs 50.8; p = 0.043). Patients with grade A and B TKAs with KPS > 90 were significantly more likely to respond with ""my expectations were too low"", and with ""the knee is performing better than expected"" compared with patients with these grades of TKA who had a KPS score of < 90 (40% vs 22%; p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: A TKA balanced with robotic assistance to within 1 mm of difference between the medial and lateral sides in both flexion and extension had a higher KPS score one year postoperatively. Despite accurate ligament balance information, a robotic system could not guarantee excellent pain relief. Patient expectations and mental status also significantly affected the perceived success of TKA. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2021;103-B(6 Supple A):67-73."
pub.1174500189,Alignment Techniques in Total Knee Arthroplasty: Where do We Stand Today?,"Achieving optimal alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a critical factor in ensuring optimal outcomes and long-term implant survival. Traditionally, mechanical alignment has been favored to achieve neutral post-operative joint alignment. However, contemporary approaches, such as kinematic alignments and hybrid techniques including adjusted mechanical, restricted kinematic, inverse kinematic, and functional alignments, are gaining attention for their ability to restore native joint kinematics and anatomical alignment, potentially leading to enhanced functional outcomes and greater patient satisfaction. The ongoing debate on optimal alignment strategies considers the following factors: long-term implant durability, functional improvement, and resolution of individual anatomical variations. Furthermore, advancements of computer-navigated and robotic-assisted surgery have augmented the precision in implant positioning and objective measurements of soft tissue balance. Despite ongoing debates on balancing implant longevity and functional outcomes, there is an increasing advocacy for personalized alignment strategies that are tailored to individual anatomical variations. This review evaluates the spectrum of various alignment techniques in TKA, including mechanical alignment, patient-specific kinematic approaches, and emerging hybrid methods. Each technique is scrutinized based on its fundamental principles, procedural techniques, inherent advantages, and potential limitations, while identifying significant clinical gaps that underscore the need for further investigation."
pub.1008979262,Tailor‐made surgical guide based on rapid prototyping technique for cup insertion in total hip arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: A surgical guide made by the rapid prototyping (RP) technique for cup insertion in total hip arthroplasty might be useful to avoid malalignment of the cup, which indicates postoperative complications.
METHODS: To address this research question, we applied a RP-based guide to 24 patients with their CT images. We designed it to fit onto the acetabular edge and to insert a Kirschner wire (K-wire) which indicated a planned cup direction. We intraoperatively placed it on the acetabular edge, inserted the K-wire through the guide on the superior acetabulum and implanted the cup while observing the alignment of the K-wire. We also recorded the additional time needed to use the guide.
RESULTS: The mean cup accuracy between planned and postoperative alignments was 2.8 degrees (SD = 2.1 degrees ) for abduction and 3.7 degrees (SD = 2.7 degrees ) for anteversion. The mean additional time was 3.5 (range 2-6) min.
CONCLUSION: We can use this guide with acceptable accuracy and without consuming an excessive amount of time."
pub.1140583659,Bone Cuts Accuracy of a System for Total Knee Arthroplasty including an Active Robotic Arm,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess the bone cuts accuracy of a system for total knee arthroplasty including an active robotic arm. A second objective was to compare the accuracy among orthopaedic surgeons of different levels of experience.
METHODS: Three orthopaedic surgeons cut 10 sawbone knees each. Planned and actual bone cuts were compared using computed tomography. Difference with respect to the planning was expressed as three position and three orientation errors following the anatomical planes. Statistical tests were performed to detect bias and compare surgeons.
RESULTS: None of the 30 knees presented an outlier error, meaning an error ≥3 mm or ≥3°. The root-mean-square values of the 12 error types were below 0.8 mm or 0.8°, except for the femoral proximal-distal errors (1.7 mm) and the tibial anterior-posterior errors (1.4 mm). Biases were observed, particularly in femoral proximal-distal and tibial anterior-posterior positions. Median differences between surgeons were all lower than 0.8 mm and 0.5°, with statistically significant differences among surgeons in the femoral proximal-distal errors and the tibial anterior-posterior errors.
CONCLUSIONS: The system tested in this study achieved accurate bone cuts independently of the surgeon's level of experience. Biases were observed, suggesting that there might be options to improve the accuracy, particularly in proximal-distal position for the femur and in anterior-posterior position for the tibia."
pub.1051188228,Measuring leg length and offset with an imageless navigation system during total hip arthroplasty: is it really accurate?,"BACKGROUND: A novel imageless measurement algorithm to assess leg length (LL) and offset (OS) changes during total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been established, the purpose of this study was to describe the process and establish whether or not it is accurate.
METHODS: THA was performed on 17 cadaver hip specimens. LL and OS changes were determined intra-operatively, using an imageless navigation system. Pre- and postoperatively, all specimens had a computed tomography scan (CT) and the LL and OS changes were analysed by two blinded investigators.
RESULTS: With mean differences of less than 1 mm (LL, 0.74; SD, 2.4 mm; OS, 0.89; SD, 1.8 mm) supported by substantial significant correlations [r = 0.83 (LL) and r = 0.92 (OS)] imageless navigation values demonstrated a high accuracy when compared to CT measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-operative LL and OS measures are reliable and accurate when using an imageless calculation algorithm which stores the position of the femoral reference frame in relation to the pelvic coordinate system before and after reconstruction."
pub.1143792073,Clinical and surgical outcomes of robot-assisted versus conventional total hip arthroplasty: a systematic overview of meta-analyses,"Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA), in comparison to conventional THA, improves radiographic outcomes, but it remains unclear whether it alters complication rates, clinical and functional outcomes, and implant survival. The purpose of this systematic overview was to summarize the findings of the most recent meta-analyses that compare clinical and surgical outcomes of robot-assisted versus conventional THA. Two readers independently conducted an electronic literature search, screening and data extraction from five electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were: meta-analyses evaluating robot-assisted versus conventional THA in terms of radiographic outcomes, clinical and functional scores, and complications and revision rates. The literature search returned 67 records, of which 14 were duplicates and 49 were excluded, leaving three meta-analyses published within the past two years for data extraction and analysis. The present overview of meta-analyses suggests that, compared to conventional THA (n = 3011), robot-assisted THA (n = 1813) improves component placement and reduces intraoperative complications. The overview also affirms that robot-assisted THA could extend surgery by 20 minutes, and increases risks of postoperative heterotopic ossification, dislocation, and revision. None of the meta-analyses found significant differences in clinical or functional scores between robot-assisted and conventional THA. Future studies and reviews should make a clear distinction between active and semi-active robotic assistance, address technology matureness, and describe the experience of surgeons with robotic assistance."
pub.1046089926,Proximal tibial osteotomy Where did you go?1 1No benefits or funds were received in support of this study.,"The prevalence of knee osteotomy seems to have diminished. Better total knee arthroplasty (TKA) results, greater survival, increased use of unicompartmental arthroplasty, and decreased surgeon confidence for osteotomy are likely causes. However, continued use of knee osteotomy is encouraged by this author. TKAs are not perfect. Furthermore, there is limited long-term durability data for younger, active patients. At 40 to 60 years of age at the time of surgery, some patients will need prosthetic replacements that must last up to 40 to 60 years. A case is made for performing an osteotomy earlier rather than later. Regarding TKA after proximal tibial osteotomy, the difficulty and inappropriateness of the standard comparisons are clear. Comparison of a virgin primary knee at one point in time, with a patient whose situation led to osteotomy surgery 5 to >10 years earlier is not a matched comparison. It is proposed that future biologic resurfacing, together with computer-and even robotic-methods, as well as other advances in biology and technology, will combine to resurrect the performance of knee osteotomies."
pub.1006469686,Three-dimensional measurement technique to assess implant position and orientation after total knee arthroplasty,"The performance of implant placement technologies are often evaluated based on their achieved post-operative implant alignment. Therefore accurate assessment techniques are necessary to compare pre-operatively planned implant positions with the corresponding post-operatively placed implant positions in total knee arthroplasty. This paper describes a CT based 3D measurement method for evaluation of implant positioning accuracy comparing post-operative implant position to the corresponding pre-operative planned implant position using 3D virtual models. TKAs were carried out on three phantoms and processed three times to investigate the accuracy of the method. The measurements were then assessed against measurements taken through an optical scan. The results indicate that an average measurement error less than 1 ° and 0.5mm can be obtained except in the proximal-distal direction where the error was up to 1.34mm. The accuracy of this 3D measurement technique is sufficiently reliable to enable reporting on implant position and orientation in the same coordinate system as pre-operatively defined independently of the planning system or the surgical implant placement technology (patient-specific guides, robotics, and navigation)."
pub.1163271275,Multi-Planar Expansion of the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee Classification? A Computed Tomographic Study Indicates No Significant Correlation With Alignment Parameters in Other Planes,"BACKGROUND: The Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) classification categorizes knee phenotypes based on constitutional limb alignment (arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle or aHKA) and joint line obliquity (JLO). This study aimed to determine if sagittal and rotational knee alignments vary among CPAK types in order to establish whether this classification should be expanded beyond coronal plane assessment.
METHODS: Coronal, sagittal, and rotational alignment measurements were made and CPAK types were calculated from computed tomographic data of 437 patients (509 knees) who underwent robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Differences in femoral, tibial, and tibio-femoral angular measurements were compared across CPAK types, and correlations were made to aHKA and JLO. Nonparametric and linear regression tests were used to analyze between-type differences.
RESULTS: There were no differences in tibial slope or femoral rotational measures across CPAK phenotypes. However, CPAK Type III knees had a greater tibio-femoral rotation mean difference than CPAK Type I, II, IV, and V knees (P < .05). We also found increased femoral flexion in Type I knees when compared to Type VI knees (P = .01). The aHKA had a weak correlation with femoral flexion angle, and JLO had a weak correlation with femoral posterior condylar axis to tibial antero-posterior axis angle.
CONCLUSION: Few clinically important differences in sagittal and rotational alignments were found between CPAK types, indicating that CPAK phenotype has little correlation to 3-dimensional alignment characteristics. Need for an expansion of the CPAK classification beyond coronal plane alignment is not supported from these results."
pub.1152199267,"Does a Uni “Feel Better” than a Total Knee? Not Necessarily, When Using Modern Implant Designs","<i>Background</i>: When comparing functional outcomes of patients with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) versus total knee arthroplasty (TKA), studies often report the UKA as the preferred procedure; however, recent improvements in the design of modern TKA implants have aimed at narrowing this gap. <i>Purpose</i>: We sought to compare the ""feel"" of modern TKA implants to that of UKA, using the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), a validated patient-reported outcome measure. <i>Methods</i>: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent TKA and UKA at 2 institutions between 2014 and 2017. All UKA procedures were robotic arm-assisted with a single implant, ""traditional TKAs"" were performed using traditional posterior-stabilized implants, and ""modern TKAs"" were performed using posterior-stabilized implants with a modern design. Differences in FJS were assessed using 1-way analysis of variance and independent 2-sample <i>t</i> tests. <i>Results</i>: A total of 600 patients were included in our study, with 200 patients in each surgical subcategory. Mean age was 62.8 ± 10.2 years and mean body mass index was 29.9 ± 4.9. Modern TKA and UKA had similar FJS at 1 year. While modern TKA had a significantly higher FJS than traditional TKA, UKA did not have a significantly higher FJS than traditional TKA. <i>Conclusion</i>: Our retrospective analysis found no significant differences in the FJS of patients who underwent UKA and TKA with a modern design; however, both had superior scores than traditional TKA designs. This finding suggests that modern TKA designs may have the potential to achieve the natural feeling that is typically associated with joint-conserving surgeries such as UKA, although longer follow-up is necessary."
pub.1156490413,"Precise acetabular positioning, discrepancy in leg length, and hip offset using a new seven-axis robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty system requires no learning curve: a retrospective study","ObjectiveThe purpose of the present study was to determine the learning curve for a novel seven-axis robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) system, and to explore whether it was able to provide greater accuracy in acetabular cup positioning, superior leg length discrepancy (LLD), and hip offset than conventional methods.MethodsA total of 160 patients in which unilateral THA was performed in the second affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from July 2021 to September 2022 were studied. The first 80 patients underwent robot-assisted THA, while conventional THA was performed on the subsequent 80 by the same team of experienced surgeons. The learning curve for the RA-THA system was evaluated using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. The demographic data, preoperative clinical data, duration of surgery, postoperative Harris hip score (HHS) and postoperative radiographic data from patients that had conventional THA were compared.ResultsThe 80 patients who underwent primary unilateral RA-THA comprised 42 males and 38 females and were followed up for 12 weeks. Using analysis by CUSUM, the learning curve of the RA-THA system could be divided into learning and proficiency phases, the former of which consisted of the first 17 cases. There was no significant difference between the learning and proficiency phases in terms of LLD, hip offset, or accuracy of acetabular prosthesis position in the RA-THA groups. The proportion of acetabular prostheses located in the Lewinnek safe zone was 90.5% in the proficiency group and 77.5% in the conventional group, respectively, a difference that was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The absolute error between target angle and postoperative measured angle of anteversion was statistically significant in the proficiency group and the conventional group((P < 0.05). Postoperative acetabular anteversion and LLD were 19.96 ± 5.68° and 6.00 (5.00) mm in the proficiency group, respectively, and 17.84 ± 6.81° and 8.09 (4.33) mm using conventional surgery, respectively (anteversion: P = 0.049; LLD: P < 0.001).ConclusionsThe surgical team required a learning curve of 17 cases using the RA-THA system to become proficient. There was no learning curve for other parameters, namely LLD, hip offset, or accuracy of acetabular prosthesis positioning. During the proficiency phase, the RA system was superior to conventional THA for control of leg length and accuracy of acetabular cup placement."
pub.1171112147,Robotic exoskeletons and total knee arthroplasty: The future of knee rehabilitation and replacement – A meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Exoskeletons can play a crucial role in post-TKA rehabilitation by accelerating recovery, improving mobility, and reducing further injury risk. This meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of exoskeletons in post-total knee replacement (TKR) rehabilitation.
DESIGN: Comprehensive searches were conducted on PubMed, OVID Medline, Cochrane Collaboration Library, and Embase (period: database inception to March 2023). Randomized controlled trials enrolling patients who underwent TKR and studies examining the effect of robot-assisted rehabilitation on physical function and pain outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Eight studies (302 patients) were thus included.
RESULTS: Exoskeletons significantly improved active range of motion (ROM) (SMD: 10.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.81-14.16, P < .001), passive ROM (SMD: 4.11, 95% CI: 1.02-7.20, P = .009), Hospital for Special Surgery scores (SMD: 7.78, 95% CI: 5.87-9.68, P < .00001), and hospital stay length (SMD: -3.19, 95% CI: -4 to -2.38, P < .00001) compared with conventional rehabilitation. Active and passive ROM improvements suggest that exoskeletons aid knee function restoration and mobility post-TKR, whereas Hospital for Special Surgery score improvements support exoskeleton use in TKR rehabilitation. A shorter hospital stay was an important finding which could potentially reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Despite the inclusion of a limited number of studies, our findings suggest that exoskeletons can enhance post-TKR rehabilitation outcomes and improve quality of life. Robot-assisted rehabilitation may be effective following TKR. Further research should confirm these findings."
pub.1162660676,Is There a Difference in PROMs Between Morbidly Obese Patients and Nonobese Patients Following Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty?,"Background: Patient satisfaction and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are important for patients, surgeons, and payers in the current healthcare climate. Morbidly obese patients (body mass index [BMI] >40) have demonstrated higher incidence of complications after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and can have difficulty obtaining access for their surgical care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PROMs and patient satisfaction in morbidly obese patients undergoing primary TKA.
Methods: A total of 75 patients with BMI &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> undergoing robotic-assisted TKA were retrospectively identified and matched 2:1 to a consecutive cohort of patients with BMI &lt;35. The average BMI of the study cohort was 42.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (39.5-51.3) compared to 28.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (18.5-34.9) in the control group. Clinical outcomes, PROMs, and patient satisfaction were evaluated at a minimum 2-year follow-up.
Results: The patients of the BMI &gt;40 cohort were less likely to be discharged home (<i>P</i> = .0076), had less active flexion at 2 years (<i>P</i> = .0046), and had worse knee scores at 2 years (0.0497). Despite this, the percentage of patients who were satisfied or very satisfied after surgery was similar between the groups (87.5% vs 91.2%, <i>P</i> = .1943).
Conclusions: Morbidly obese patients are less likely to be discharged directly to home and may have functional differences after primary TKA. However, morbidly obese patients have similar PROMs and are as satisfied as nonobese patients at 2 years. Morbidly obese patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis should also be able to enjoy the benefits of primary TKA following medical and surgical optimization."
pub.1157341453,No Difference in 30-day Mortality Between Patients Undergoing Bilateral Simultaneous Total Knee Arthroplasty With Technology Assistance Compared to Conventional Instrumentation,"<i>Background:</i> Bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty (BSTKA) has decreased in frequency due to concerns about higher rates of early mortality and complications than unilateral or staged surgeries. <i>Purpose</i>: We sought to evaluate whether technology assistance (encompassing robotics and computer assistance) decreases early mortality following BSTKA. <i>Methods</i>: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a national all-payer claims database. Patients who underwent BSTKA from October 2015 to December 2020 were identified. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to compare outcomes in patients who underwent BSTKA with technology assistance compared to conventional instrumentation. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes were respiratory failure and fat embolism. A post-hoc analysis was performed to evaluate length of stay, readmission, and other medical complications. <i>Results</i>: A total of 14,870 patients who underwent BSTKA were included in this study. Of these, 860 patients underwent technology-assisted BSTKA, and 14,010 patients underwent BSTKA without technology assistance. After a multivariable analysis, patients who underwent technology-assisted BSTKA had equivalent odds of 30-day mortality compared to those who underwent BSTKA without technology assistance. Technology assistance was not protective against the development of acute respiratory failure or fat embolism. <i>Conclusion</i>: This retrospective cohort study found no differences in the rates of 30-day mortality, respiratory failure, or fat embolism after technology-assisted BSTKA compared to conventional BSTKA. On the post-hoc analysis, technology use was associated with a decreased length of stay, lower readmission risk, and decreased rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and blood transfusion."
pub.1153520095,"Accuracy, Reliability, and Repeatability of a Novel Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Converting Two-Dimensional Radiographs to Three-Dimensional Bone Models for Total Knee Arthroplasty","BACKGROUND: With the emergence of advanced technology, such as robotics, three-dimensional (3D) imaging is necessary to execute preoperative surgical plans accurately. However, 3D imaging adds cost and potential risk to patients. This study determined the measurement accuracy, reliability, and repeatability of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm which converts two-dimensional (2D) radiographs to 3D bone models.
METHODS: An AI algorithm was developed to convert 2D radiographs to 3D bone model reconstructions. The accuracy of the AI algorithm was evaluated by comparing mean absolute error in measurements performed on 3D bone reconstructions, 3D computed tomography (CT) scans, and manual measurements on five cadaveric knees. Reliability and repeatability of the AI algorithm were evaluated by assessing the inter-observer and intra-observer agreement between measurements performed on 3D bone reconstructions, respectively.
RESULTS: Accuracy of the AI algorithm was considered excellent with mean absolute errors <2mm in 9 of 12 anatomical parameters compared with measurements performed on CTs and manual calipers. All inter-observer and intra-observer correlation coefficients were greater than 0.90 representing a high level of measurement reliability and repeatability by independent observers and the same observers.
CONCLUSION: This particular AI algorithm demonstrated a high degree of accuracy, reliability, and repeatability for converting 2D radiographs to 3D bone reconstructions similar to a CT-scan. Study results suggest this AI algorithm has the potential for use in preoperative surgical planning due to its efficiencies related to cost and time and reduced radiation exposure without the use of 3D imaging."
pub.1000755270,Entwicklung der Knieendoprothetik,"In this article the evolution beginning with the robotics of total knee arthroplasty to CT-based and kinematic navigation and patient-specific instruments is described. Thereby it is pointed out that in the early 1990s, CT imaging solely for the planning of a knee endoprosthesis was considered as obsolete radiation exposure and this led to the widespread development of kinematical systems.Also a patient specific planning tool based on CAD built acryl harz blocs existed at the time. There is an ongoing process of implanting total knee arthroplasties in a more exact position. Nowadays the new evolution of soft tissue balancing by using a kinematic alignment has put these efforts into perspective."
pub.1139929321,[Application and research progress of robotic-arm in total knee arthroplasty].,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize the application and research progress of robotic-arm in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: Relevant literature at home and abroad was extensively reviewed to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA).
RESULTS: Accurate reconstruction of lower extremity alignment and rotation alignment, accurate osteotomy and implant prosthesis in TKA are very important to improve the effectiveness and prolong the life of the prosthesis. Traditional TKA deviations occur in key links such as osteotomy due to operator's operation. RATKA solves the above problems to a certain extent and can assist accurate osteotomy and implant prosthesis, and protect the soft tissues around the knee joint. Patients' satisfaction after RATKA is high, and the operator's learning curve is shorter, which improves the efficiency of the operation. But it also has disadvantages such as prolonged operation time, increased complications and medical costs.
CONCLUSION: Preliminary clinical application studies have shown that RATKA has satisfactory effectiveness, but its definite advantages compared with traditional TKA need to be confirmed by a large number of randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up."
pub.1124214375,TRENDS IN UNICOMPARTMENTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in publications on unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) from the past to the present.
METHODS: As a web-based analysis, all UKA research articles, editorial letters, case reports, reviews and meeting abstracts published on the Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge were evaluated. The period from the first publication in 1980 to January 2019 was divided into four decades and publications were evaluated. Research articles were grouped into headings according to the subjects.
RESULTS: A total of 1,658 publications were evaluated in this study. The most frequent term used in the publications title was ""outcome,"" with 260 items, followed by ""biomechanics and kinematics,"" with 99 items. Most reports have been published in the last decade, and the most common type of publication was postoperative follow-up and results.

pub.1169313724,The Value of Computed Tomography Scan in Three-dimensional Planning and Intraoperative Navigation in Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a frequently performed procedure; the objective is restoration of native hip biomechanics and achieving functional range of motion (ROM) through precise positioning of the prosthetic components. Advanced three-dimensional (3D) imaging and computed tomography (CT)-based navigation are valuable tools in both the preoperative planning and intraoperative execution. The aim of this study is to provide a thorough overview on the applications of CT scans in both the preoperative and intraoperative settings of primary THA. Preoperative planning using CT-based 3D imaging enables greater accuracy in prediction of implant sizes, leading to enhancement of surgical workflow with optimization of implant inventory. Surgeons can perform a more thorough assessment of posterior and anterior acetabular wall coverage, acetabular osteophytes, anatomical landmarks, and thus achieve more functional implant positioning. Intraoperative CT-based navigation can facilitate precise execution of the preoperative plan, to attain optimal positioning of the prosthetic components to avoid impingement. Medial reaming can be minimized preserving native bone stock, which can enable restoration of femoral, acetabular, and combined offsets. In addition, it is associated with greater accuracy in leg length adjustment, a critical factor in patients' postoperative satisfaction. Despite the higher costs and radiation exposure, which currently limits its widespread adoption, it offers many benefits, and the increasing interest in robotic surgery has facilitated its integration into routine practice. Conducting additional research on ultra-low-dose CT scans and examining the potential for translation of 3D imaging into improved clinical outcomes will be necessary to warrant its expanded application."
pub.1111314901,Simplifying the Hip-Spine Relationship for Total Hip Arthroplasty: What Do I Need to Do Differently Intraoperatively?,"As our recognition of the complexity of the hip-spine relationship is based on stability, there are several intraoperative strategies that surgeons may consider. First, patient positioning on the operative table plays an important role in reducing pelvic motion and tilt. Then, consider determining the femoral version before acetabular preparation and component insertion. The concept of a combined version of both components is an excellent guide to position. However, femoral version is often dictated by native femoral torsion, and therefore, it is the acetabular version that must be adjusted accordingly. Finally, based upon preoperative planning and intraoperative verification, the use of enabling technologies such as navigation, robotics, and other smart tools appears to play a major role of ever increasing importance in accurate component placement."
pub.1129418970,Robotic arm-assisted knee surgery: an economic analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies on Medicare populations have shown improved outcomes and decreased 90-day episode-of-care costs with robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate expenditures and utilization following RATKA in the population younger than 65 years.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective longitudinal analysis of a commercial claims data set.
METHODS: TKA procedures were identified using the OptumInsight Inc database. The procedures were stratified in 2 groups: the RATKA and manual TKA (MTKA) cohorts. Propensity score matching was performed at 1:5. Utilization and associated costs were analyzed for 90 days following the index procedure. A total of 357 RATKA and 1785 MTKA procedures were included in this analysis.
RESULTS: Within 90 days post surgery, patients who had RATKA were less likely to utilize inpatient services (2.24% vs 4.37%; P = .0444) and skilled nursing facilities (1.68% vs 6.05%; P < .0001). No patients in the RATKA group went to inpatient rehabilitation, whereas 0.90% of the MTKA arm went to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Patients who utilized home health aides in the RATKA arm utilized significantly fewer home health days (5.33 vs 6.36 days; P = .0037). Costs associated with overall postsurgery expenditures were $1332 less in the RATKA arm ($6857 vs $8189; P = .0018). The 90-day global expenditures (index plus post surgery) were $4049 less in the RATKA arm ($28,204 vs $32,253; P < .0001). Length of stay after surgery was nearly a day less for the RATKA arm (1.80 vs 2.72 days; P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: RATKA was associated with shorter length of stay, reduced utilization of services, and reduced 90-day payer costs compared with MTKA."
pub.1017598153,Robotically-milled bone cavities,"We performed an experimental study to compare the effectiveness of robotic bone milling (Robodoc and CASPAR) with hand-broaching as regards primary rotational stability of 7 different cementless stems. Using 48 synthetic femora and a specially-designed apparatus, we compared the implant stability of proximal and distal rotational stem displacement (slip) in relation to the cortex. We also measured stem deformation (twist) and the location of torque transfer from stem to cortex (i.e., fixation pattern). 5-ROM, Antega, and ABG stems were more stable in hand-broached femora. Osteolock stems showed no difference between CASPAR and hand preparation, but rotational stability was better in the Robodoc group. G2, VerSys ET and Vision 2000 stems gave increased rotational stability in the robotic groups. When placed too laterally, Vision 2000 showed a pattern of more distal fixation. The findings emphasize the current difficulties in creating a perfect match of robotically-milled cavity and stem geometry to achieve enhanced primary rotational stability. The pattern of fixation seems to depend not only on stem design, but also on canal preparation and stem positioning."
pub.1091009176,Robotic device-assisted knee extension training during the early postoperative period after opening wedge high tibial osteotomy: a case report,"BackgroundMaintenance or restoration of a good range of motion of the knee is one of the most important outcomes following knee surgery. According to previous studies, opening wedge high tibial osteotomy enables better recovery of range of motion in knee flexion than that achievable after total knee arthroplasty or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. However, few reports provide a detailed description of the postoperative recovery of knee extension range of motion after opening wedge high tibial osteotomy. We describe our experience with a knee extension training program using a single-joint hybrid assistive limb device (HAL-SJ; Cyberdyne Inc., Tsukuba, Japan) during the acute recovery phase after opening wedge high tibial osteotomy. The HAL-SJ is a wearable robotic device that facilitates voluntary control of knee joint motion.Case presentationA 67-year-old Japanese woman who underwent opening wedge high tibial osteotomy for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the left medial femoral condyle received HAL-SJ-based knee extension training postoperatively. Our experience with this patient revealed that knee extension training with the HAL-SJ during the acute phase following opening wedge high tibial osteotomy is feasible. Furthermore, the patient’s knee extension range of motion improved to values similar to those seen during the preoperative stage, and her flexion range of motion was improved at 3 months after the surgery.ConclusionsHAL-SJ-based knee extension training could be used as a novel post-opening wedge high tibial osteotomy rehabilitation modality. Further exploration of individualized optimal settings of the HAL-SJ is required to improve its safety and efficacy."
pub.1150223098,Kinematic alignment fails to achieve balancing in 50% of varus knees and resects more bone compared to functional alignment,"PURPOSE: Evidence is emerging that tibio-femoral compartmental balancing is related to clinical outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to assess if kinematic alignment (KA) delivered a balanced knee in flexion and extension after TKA on varus deformity, compared to functional alignment (FA).
METHODS: This single-centre retrospective cohort study assessed 110 consecutive TKAs performed with an image-based robotic system for pre-operative varus deformity. The ligament balancing in the medial and lateral femorotibial compartments was assessed intra-operatively with a robotic system to evaluate if a KA plan would deliver a balanced knee. Balance was considered achieved if tibio-femoral compartments (medial/lateral) were equal to or less than 1.5 mm, or if the estimated final gap position more than 2 mm from the global implant thickness (17 mm). Implant positioning was modified within limits previously defined for a FA philosophy to achieve balancing. Resection thickness and implant positioning were compared with the KA plan and after the FA adjustments; and also, between the patients with a final balanced knee in extension and at 90° of flexion.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were eligible for final analysis. Mean age was 67.3 ± 8.2 years, average BMI was 29.1 ± 5.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean pre-operative coronal alignment was 174.0° ± 3.3° and sagittal alignment 3.4° ± 5.9°. Mean post-operative coronal alignment was 177.7° ± 1.0° and sagittal alignment 0.8° ± 1.9°. A KA plan delivered medial-lateral tibio-femoral compartment balancing in 67 cases (65.7%) for the extension gap and in 50 cases (49.1%) for the flexion gap. All measured bone resection depths were significantly less for FA compared to KA. To achieve balancing targets, final femoral component position was more externally rotated relative to the posterior condylar axis, (0.5° with KA compared to 1.7° with FA (p &lt; 0.0001), and the tibia in more varus (3.0° KA vs. 3.5° FA p = 0.0024). Only one soft tissue release was required.
CONCLUSION: KA failed to deliver a balanced TKA in more than 50% of cases, especially regarding the flexion gap. Consideration of soft tissue laxity led to significantly less bone resection, with more externally rotated femoral component and more varus tibial component."
pub.1090618165,Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Demonstrated Soft Tissue Protection.,"INTRODUCTION: While total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures have demonstrated clinical success, occasionally intraoperative complications can occur. Collateral or posterior cruciate ligament injury, instability, extensor mechanism disruption, and tibiofemoral or patellofemoral dislocation are among a few of the intraoperatively driven adverse events prevalently ranked by The Knee Society. Robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA) provides a surgeon the ability to three-dimensionally plan a TKA and use intraoperative visual, auditory, and tactile feedback to ensure that only the desired bone cuts are made. The potential benefits of soft tissue protection in these surgeries need to be further evaluated. The purpose of this cadaver study was to assess the a) integrity of various knee soft tissue structures (medial collateral ligament [MCL], lateral collateral ligament [LCL], posterior cruciate ligament [PCL], and the patellar ligament), as well as b) the need for tibial subluxation and patellar eversion during RATKA procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six cadaver knees were prepared using RATKA by a surgeon with no prior clinical robotic experience. These were compared to seven manually performed cases as a control. The mean Kellgren-Lawrence score was 2.8 (range, 0 to 4) in RATKA and 2.6 (range, 1 to 4) in the manual cohort. The presence of soft tissue damage was assessed by having an experienced surgeon perform a visual evaluation and palpation of the PCL, MCL, LCL, and the patellar ligament after the procedures. In addition, leg pose and retraction were documented during all bone resections. The amount of tibial subluxation and patellar eversion was recorded for each case.
RESULTS: For all RATKA-assisted cases, there was no visible evidence of disruption of any of the ligaments. All RATKA cases were left with a bone island on the tibial plateau, which protected the PCL. Tibial subluxation and patella eversion were not required for visualization in any RATKA cases. In two of the seven MTKA cases, there was slight disruption noted of the PCL, although this did not lead to any apparent change in the functional integrity of the ligament. All MTKA cases required tibial subluxation and patellar revision to achieve optimal visualization.
DISCUSSION: Several aspects of soft tissue protection were noted during the study. During bone resections, the tibia in RATKA procedures did not require subluxation, which may reduce ligament stretching or decrease complication rates. Potential patient benefits for short-term recovery and decreased morbidity to reduce operative complications should be studied in a clinical setting. Since RATKA uses a stereotactic boundary to constrain the sawblade, which is generated based on the implant size, shape, and plan, and does not have the ability to track the patient's soft tissue structures, standard retraction techniques during cutting are recommended. Therefore, the retractor placement and potential for soft tissue protection needs "

Today TJA is accessible for a wider age and function range of patients, which has led to an exponential growth in the number of procedures conducted."
pub.1172857929,Anterior-Posterior Laxity in Midflexion After Posterior-Stabilized TKA Is Sensitive to MCL Tension in Passive Flexion,"BACKGROUND: Knee instability in midflexion may contribute to patient dissatisfaction following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Midflexion instability involves abnormal motions and tissue loading in multiple planes. Therefore, we quantified and compared the tensions carried by the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL and LCL) following posterior-stabilized (PS) TKA through knee flexion, and then compared these tensions with those carried by the native knee. Finally, we examined the relationships between collateral ligament tensions and anterior tibial translation (ATT).
METHODS: Eight cadaveric knees (from 5 male and 3 female donors with a mean age of 62.6 years and standard deviation of 10.9 years) underwent PS TKA. Each specimen was mounted to a robotic manipulator and flexed to 90°. ATT was quantified by applying 30 N of anterior force to the tibia. Tensions carried by the collateral ligaments were determined via serial sectioning. Robotic testing was also conducted on a cohort of 15 healthy native cadaveric knees (from 9 male and 6 female donors with a mean age of 36 years and standard deviation of 11 years). Relationships between collateral ligament tensions during passive flexion and ATT were assessed via linear and nonlinear regressions.
RESULTS: MCL tensions were greater following PS TKA than in the native knee at 15° and 30° of passive flexion, by a median of ≥27 N (p = 0.002), while the LCL tensions did not differ. Median tensions following PS TKA were greater in the MCL than in the LCL at 15°, 30°, and 90° of flexion, by ≥4 N (p ≤ 0.02). Median tensions in the MCL of the native knee were small (≤11 N) and did not exceed those in the LCL (p ≥ 0.25). A logarithmic relationship was identified between MCL tension and ATT following TKA.
CONCLUSIONS: MCL tensions were greater following PS TKA with this typical nonconforming PS implant than in the native knee. Anterior laxity at 30° of flexion was highly sensitive to MCL tension during passive flexion following PS TKA but not in the native knee.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgeons face competing objectives when performing PS TKA: they can either impart supraphysiological MCL tension to reduce anterior-posterior laxity or maintain native MCL tensions that lead to heightened anterior-posterior laxity, as shown in this study."
pub.1138480317,Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty improves accuracy and precision compared to conventional techniques.,"AIMS: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) is theoretically more accurate for component positioning than TKA performed with mechanical instruments (M-TKA). Furthermore, the ability to incorporate soft-tissue laxity data into the plan prior to bone resection should reduce variability between the planned polyethylene thickness and the final implanted polyethylene. The purpose of this study was to compare accuracy to plan for component positioning and precision, as demonstrated by deviation from plan for polyethylene insert thickness in measured-resection RA-TKA versus M-TKA.
METHODS: A total of 220 consecutive primary TKAs between May 2016 and November 2018, performed by a single surgeon, were reviewed. Planned coronal plane component alignment and overall limb alignment were all 0° to the mechanical axis; tibial posterior slope was 2°; and polyethylene thickness was 9 mm. For RA-TKA, individual component position was adjusted to assist gap-balancing but planned coronal plane alignment for the femoral and tibial components and overall limb alignment remained 0 ± 3°; planned tibial posterior slope was 1.5°. Mean deviations from plan for each parameter were compared between groups for positioning and size and outliers were assessed.
RESULTS: In all, 103 M-TKAs and 96 RA-TKAs were included. In RA-TKA versus M-TKA, respectively: mean femoral positioning (0.9° (SD 1.2°) vs 1.7° (SD 1.1°)), mean tibial positioning (0.3° (SD 0.9°) vs 1.3° (SD 1.0°)), mean posterior tibial slope (-0.3° (SD 1.3°) vs 1.7° (SD 1.1°)), and mean mechanical axis limb alignment (1.0° (SD 1.7°) vs 2.7° (SD 1.9°)) all deviated significantly less from the plan (all p < 0.001); significantly fewer knees required a distal femoral recut (10 (10%) vs 22 (22%), p = 0.033); and deviation from planned polyethylene thickness was significantly less (1.4 mm (SD 1.6) vs 2.7 mm (SD 2.2), p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: RA-TKA is significantly more accurate and precise in planning both component positioning and final polyethylene insert thickness. Future studies should investigate whether this increased accuracy and precision has an impact on clinical outcomes. The greater accuracy and reproducibility of RA-TKA may be important as precise new goals for component positioning are developed and can be further individualized to the patient.

pub.1164692002,Better forgotten joint scores when the angle of the prosthetic trochlea is lateral to the quadriceps vector in kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The primary aim was to analyze unrestricted kinematic alignment (unKA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and determine the frequency of medial deviation of the prosthetic trochlear angle (PTA) of the femoral component relative to the quadriceps vector (QV) that terminates at the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS), and whether patients with medial deviation had a worse Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) relative to those with lateral deviation. The secondary aim was to determine the frequency of medial deviation for mechanical alignment (MA) TKA simulations.
METHODS: From a database of a single surgeon, the study extracted de-identified data on 147 patients with a CT scanogram showing the pelvis and AIIS, a limb with an unKA TKA, and a native (i.e., healthy) opposite limb. On the scanogram, an examiner, blinded to the PROMs, measured the PTA-QV angle on the unKA TKA and on the opposite limb simulated MA TKA by drawing the PTA at 6° valgus relative to the femoral mechanical axis and measuring the PTA-QV angle.
RESULTS: Medial deviation of the PTA occurred in 86% of patients with unKA TKA, and the 126 with medial deviation had a 17/1 point worse median FJS/OKS than the 21 with lateral deviation at a mean follow-up of 47 ± 8 months, respectively (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0053). In addition, 21%, 17%, and 8% of MA TKA had medial deviation after radiographic simulation using reported surgical errors for manual, patient-specific, and robotic instrumentation, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In most patients with unKA TKA and a smaller proportion with MA TKA, a PTA of 6° valgus was medial to the QV, which, by excluding the patient's Q-angle, might alter patellofemoral kinematics like an incorrectly oriented trochleoplasty. The 17-point worse FJS in the patients with an unKA TKA and medial deviation of the PTA suggests the surgical target should be to orient the PTA lateral to the QV.

pub.1121957942,Robot-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: Increasing Surgical Accuracy? A Cadaveric Study,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) represents 10% of knee arthroplasties. Advantages are better functional results, quicker recovery, shorter hospitalization time, and lower blood loss, among others. However, revision rates are larger than total knee arthroplasty. Among the most important factors that explain this are the implant position and alignment, and the correct surgical indication. Greater accuracy in the implant placement may improve clinical results and increase the rate of implant survival. The objective of this study is to evaluate the precision of the Navio robot-assisted system in the position and alignment of medial UKA compared with the conventional technique. This is an experimental pilot study. Twenty-six cadaveric models were randomized into 2 groups: Robot-Assisted surgery (R) and Conventional Surgery (C). Radiological study was performed pre- and post-surgery, evaluating the medial distal femoral angle (MDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), tibial slope, tibiofemoral angle (TFA), sagittal femoral angle (SFA), and size of the femoral and tibial components. The main result measurement was the change in postoperative angulation. The results of this study are MDFA median of 1.07° (0.19-4.5) for group R and 0.12° (0.03-10.4) with a significant difference in variances; a Welch <i>t</i>-test of <i>p</i> = 0.013; and an MPTA of 1.28° (0.05-5.87) for R and 1.3°(0.08-14.1) for C with significantly different variances (<i>p</i> = 0.0064). Size of the femoral component has a difference of <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 between groups. No differences for dispersion of TFA nor for the size of the tibial component were observed. In conclusion, using robot-assisted UKA allows for greater accuracy in the positioning of the implants and in the prediction of the size of the femoral component."

METHODS: The bone models were prepared using a polyurethane foam block. Two hemispherical cementless cups (highly porous titanium cup [Trident II Tritanium, Stryker] and hydroxyapatite-coated titanium cup [Trident HA, Stryker]) were implanted using the Mako system. The torque of the cups was measured by rotational and lever-out torque testing and compared with that of a conventional manual technique.
RESULTS: The two types of cups that were implanted using the Mako system demonstrated significantly higher mean rotational torque than that of the manual technique (p < 0.01, p = 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the advantage of the initial stability of a cementless hemispherical cup implanted by the Mako system compared with that of the conventional manual technique."
pub.1142448354,Differences in the setting of acetabular component alignment guides between the supine and lateral positions for total hip arthroplasty,"The acetabular component orientation in total hip arthroplasty is of critical importance to clinical results. Although navigation systems and surgical robots have been introduced, most surgeons still use acetabular component alignment guides. This study aimed to compare the accuracy between modern acetabular component alignment guides for the lateral position and those for the supine position. Thirteen alignment guides for the lateral position and 10 for the supine position were investigated. All the lateral position alignment guides indicated cup alignment in operative definition, and the supine position alignment guides indicated cup alignment in radiographic definition. For lateral position alignment guides, the anteversion actually indicated by the alignment guide itself was smaller than that indicated by the manufacturer by a mean of 6° (maximum, 9°), and the inclination actually indicated by alignment guides themselves was larger than that by the manufacturer (p < 0.01) by a mean of 2° (maximum, 4°). For supine position alignment guides, the inclination and anteversion indicated by the alignment guide itself were identical with those indicated by the manufacturer. The current study showed that the angles actually indicated and those stated by manufacturers were not identical for lateral position alignment guides."
pub.1042381104,How deep can straight instruments be inserted into the femoral canal: a simulation study based on cadaveric femora*,"Determining how deep instruments can be inserted into the femoral canal without touching adjacent structures is a fundamental necessity for navigating instruments in primary and revision total hip arthroplasty. The aim of the study was to determine the reachable depth of a straight instrument inserted into the femur canal during primary and revision total hip arthroplasty. Based on the three-dimensional data of twenty-six femurs, obtained from a CT scan, the insertion depth of a virtual, straight instrument was accessed by a simulation. The effect of the diameter of the virtual instrument and the extension of the osteotomy were evaluated. Without extending the osteotomy, 100% of the femoral canal was reachable to a depth of 5.1-6.3 cm for instruments with a diameter of 10 mm. The depth was measured from the lower edge of the osteotomy. A maximum lateral extension of the osteotomy by 1 cm enlarges the access to a depth of 8.8 cm. The results provide a theoretical basis for the limitations of guiding instruments used for the preparation of the femoral canal. Bone preserving methods need the development of angulated instruments to reach deep areas in the femoral canal."
pub.1133085829,Bibliometric Analysis of the Top-Cited Articles on Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been proven to be an effective surgical technique for unilateral compartment osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the top 100 cited articles in the field of UKA research.
METHODS: Publications on UKA from 1980 to 2020 in the Web of Science database were retrieved. The characteristics of the top 100 cited articles were analyzed, including information of publications and citations, level of evidence, and research interests.
RESULTS: The number of publications and citations increased over time. The majority of the highly cited articles were from the Nuffield Orthopedic Centre (Oxford, England) and the Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, USA). Long-term outcome of UKA and comparison between UKA and TKA gathered most research interests. The most frequently occurring keywords were ""survival"" and ""revision."" Since 2012, ""life quality"" and ""robotics"" have been used. There was no level I evidence, and most studies provided level IV evidence.
CONCLUSION: There was a rising trend in publications and citations in the field of UKA research, the majority of them were from a few centers, and were low-level evidence. Most studies focused on the long-term outcomes of UKA; in recent years, patient satisfaction and navigation surgery have become new research trends."
pub.1131163976,Computer and robotic – assisted total knee arthroplasty: a review of outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a successful treatment for tricompartmental knee arthritis. Computer navigation and robotic-assisted-surgery (RAS) have emerged as tools that aim to help plan and execute surgery with greater precision and consistency. We reviewed the most current literature to describe the historical background and outcomes compared to conventional TKA.
METHODS: A review and synthesis of the literature comparing the patient reported outcomes (PROM's) of RA TKA and computer-assisted (CA) TKA to conventional TKA was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
RESULTS: CAS TKA improves accuracy and consistency of implant position, and appears to provide a small improvement in PROMs and implant survival compared to conventional TKA. RTKA similarly improves implant accuracy compared to conventional techniques and early results suggest a similar small benefit in PROMs compared to conventional TKA. A strengthening trend is emerging showing CAS TKA has greatest benefit to implant survival in people under 65. RTKA survival analysis data is more limited and early results do not allow strong conclusions, however early trends are similar to CAS TKA.
CONCLUSION: Results for CAS-TKA show improvement in alignment, and early clinical outcomes have revealed promising results, with longer-term data and medium-term survival analysis recently emerging showing small benefits over conventional TKA. RTKA represents another phase of development. Early results show similar trends to that of CAS TKA with longer-term data still to come."
pub.1063888881,In vitro method for assessing the biomechanics of the patellofemoral joint following total knee arthroplasty,"The patellofemoral joint is a common site of pain and failure following total knee arthroplasty. A contributory factor may be adverse patellofemoral biomechanics. Cadaveric investigations are commonly used to assess the biomechanics of the joint, but are associated with high inter-specimen variability and often cannot be carried out at physiological levels of loading. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of a novel knee simulator for investigating patellofemoral joint biomechanics. This simulator specifically facilitated the extended assessment of patellofemoral joint biomechanics under physiological levels of loading. The simulator allowed the knee to move in 6 degrees of freedom under quadriceps actuation and included a simulation of the action of the hamstrings. Prostheses were implanted on synthetic bones and key soft tissues were modelled with a synthetic analogue. In order to evaluate the physiological relevance and repeatability of the simulator, measurements were made of the quadriceps force and the force, contact area and pressure within the patellofemoral joint using load cells, pressure-sensitive film, and a flexible pressure sensor. The results were in agreement with those previously reported in the literature, confirming that the simulator is able to provide a realistic physiological loading situation. Under physiological loading, average standard deviations of force and area measurements were substantially lower and comparable to those reported in previous cadaveric studies, respectively. The simulator replicates the physiological environment and has been demonstrated to allow the initial investigation of factors affecting patellofemoral biomechanics following total knee arthroplasty."
pub.1062155297,The Contribution of the Acetabular Labrum to Hip Joint Stability: A Quantitative Analysis Using a Dynamic Three-Dimensional Robot Model,"The acetabular labrum provides mechanical stability to the hip joint in extreme positions where the femoral head is disposed to subluxation. We aimed to quantify the isolated labrum's stabilizing value. Five human cadaveric hips were mounted to a robotic manipulator, and subluxation potential tests were run with and without labrum. Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic data were quantified using the stability index (Colbrunn et al., 2013, ""Impingement and Stability of Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus Femoral Head Resurfacing Using a Cadaveric Robotics Model,"" J. Orthop. Res., 31(7), pp. 1108-1115). Global and regional stability indices were significantly greater with labrum intact than after total labrectomy for both anterior and posterior provocative positions. In extreme positions, the labrum imparts significant overall mechanical resistance to hip subluxation. Regional stability contributions vary with joint orientation. "
pub.1090902554,What are the six degree-of-freedom errors of a robotically-machined femoral cavity in total hip arthroplasty and are they clinically important? An in-vitro study,"Errors during a robot-assisted THA may result in a femoral cavity with position and orientation different than planned. This can lead to a femoral component placement that inaccurately sets a patient's femoral anteversion (FA), femoral offset (FO), and vertical offset (VO). The objectives of this study were to determine the position and orientation errors of robotically-machined femoral cavities in six degrees of freedom and to determine how position and orientation errors translate into errors in the setting of FA, FO, and VO. After creating preoperative plans, robot-assisted THAs were performed on twelve cadaveric specimens. The position and orientation of the machined cavities were compared to those of the planned cavities to determine the errors in six degrees of freedom. Placement of femoral components into the machined cavities was simulated, and the differences in FA, FO, and VO between the simulated and planned component placement were computed. While bias (i.e. mean error) occurred for three of six degrees of freedom in femoral cavities machined by a robotic system, the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) when the placement of femoral component was simulated were limited to 1.9° for FA, 1.0mm for FO, and 2.1mm for VO and were clinically unimportant."
pub.1002500912,Computer-assisted total hip arthroplasty: coding the next generation of navigation systems for orthopedic surgery,"This article outlines the scientific basis and a state-of-the-art application of computer-assisted orthopedic surgery in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and provides a future perspective on this technology. Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery in primary THA has the potential to couple 3D simulations with real-time evaluations of surgical performance, which has brought these developments from the research laboratory all the way to clinical use. Nonimage- or imageless-based navigation systems without the need for additional pre- or intra-operative image acquisition have stood the test to significantly reduce the variability in positioning the acetabular component and have shown precise measurement of leg length and offset changes during THA. More recently, computer-assisted orthopedic surgery systems have opened a new frontier for accurate surgical practice in minimally invasive, tissue-preserving THA. The future generation of imageless navigation systems will switch from simple measurement tasks to real navigation tools. These software algorithms will consider the cup and stem as components of a coupled biomechanical system, navigating the orthopedic surgeon to find an optimized complementary component orientation rather than target values intraoperatively, and are expected to have a high impact on clinical practice and postoperative functionality in modern THA."
pub.1154546869,Achieving Target Cemented Femoral Stem Anteversion Using a 3-Dimensional Model,"Background: Total hip arthroplasty aims to provide patients with a pain-free and stable hip joint through optimization of biomechanics such as femoral anteversion. There are studies evaluating the limits of cementless stem version, however, none assessing the range of version achieved by a cemented collarless stem. A computed tomography (CT)-based study was performed, utilizing a contemporary robotic planning platform to assess the amount of rotation afforded by a cemented collarless stem, whilst maintaining native biomechanics.
Methods: The study utilized 36 cadaveric hips. All had CT scans of the pelvis and hip joints. The CT scans were then loaded into a contemporary robotic planning platform. A stem that restored the patients native femoral offset was selected and positioned in the virtual femur. The stem was rotated while checking for cortical contact at the level of the neck cut. Cortical contact was regarded as the rotation limit, assessed in both anteversion and retroversion. Target range for stem anteversion was 10°-20°. Failure to achieve target version triggered a sequence of adjustments to simulate surgical decisions.
Results: Native femoral offset and target version range was obtained in 29 of 36 (80.5%) cases. Following an adjustment sequence, 4 further stems achieved target anteversion with a compromise in offset of 2.3 mm. Overall 33 of 36 (91.7%) stems achieved the target anteversion range of 10°-20°.
Conclusions: Target femoral stem anteversion can be achieved using a cemented, collarless stem in a CT-based 3-dimensional model in 80.5% of hips. With a small compromise in offset (mean 2.3 mm), this can be increased to 91.7%."
pub.1150427344,Gibt es noch Gründe für die Navigation in der Knieendoprothetik?,"BackgroundAfter more than two decades of experience with computer-assisted knee arthroplasty, extensive experience and study data are available, allowing a profound evaluation. Undoubtedly, computer-assisted knee arthroplasty has been proven to achieve excellent results for implant positioning and long-leg axis reconstruction. Thus, computer-assisted knee arthroplasty represents the current gold standard to avoid unintended malpositioning of total knee components for neutrally aligned implants and individualized implant alignment (kinematic alignment, adjusted mechanical alignment, and others). Previous studies could not show significant differences in functional outcomes and patient satisfaction. However, recent meta-analyses showed relevant advantages of computer-assisted knee arthroplasty. These results could be based on further developments in software-assisted soft tissue balancing and more sensitive evaluation methods of follow-up examinations.Long-term outcomeFurther, international registries show advantages of computer-assisted knee arthroplasty regarding long-term outcomes. In particular, the Australian arthroplasty registry describes a significantly lower revision rate due to aseptic loosening/osteolysis in the computer-assisted knee arthroplasty group, analyzing a period of up to 17 years. These positive effects can already be proven six months following surgery.Future prospectsHowever, despite demonstrated benefits, computer-assisted knee arthroplasty has not yet become established in daily routine, and wide regional variations in its use are observed. Newer developments such as robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty, primarily based on navigation techniques, are currently being heavily promoted. However, this new technology must justify its enormous additional costs and prove its advantages compared to computer-assisted knee arthroplasty. In the backdrop of the development of computer-assisted knee arthroplasty, this might be a difficult task."
pub.1121275953,The Influence of Preoperative Radiographic Patellofemoral Degenerative Changes and Malalignment on Patellofemoral-Specific Outcome Scores Following Fixed-Bearing Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: There is controversy as to whether the presence of degenerative changes and malalignment of the patellofemoral joint is a contraindication to medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the influence of preoperative radiographic patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis and alignment on intermediate-term knee and patellofemoral joint-specific patient-reported outcomes following fixed-bearing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the records on a consecutive series of patients who had undergone robotic arm-assisted fixed-bearing onlay medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and had a minimum duration of follow-up of 2 years. All records were collected from a single surgeon's arthroplasty registry. Patients with severe bone loss or grooving of the lateral patellar facet were excluded. Radiographic assessment was performed with use of the Kellgren-Lawrence and Altman classification systems as well as with patellofemoral joint alignment measurements. The latest follow-up consisted of a patient-reported questionnaire, including the Kujala (Anterior Knee Pain Scale) score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Junior (JR), and satisfaction levels.
RESULTS: A total of 536 patients (639 knees) were included. After a mean duration of follow-up (and standard deviation) of 4.3 ± 1.6 years (range, 2.0 to 9.2 years), good-to-excellent Kujala scores were reported independent of the presence of patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis preoperatively (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0 compared with ≥1, p = 0.82; grade ≤1 compared with ≥2, p = 0.84). Similar findings were found when osteoarthritis was present in either the medial or lateral side of the patellofemoral joint as defined by an Altman score of ≥2 (medial, p = 0.81; lateral, p = 0.90). KOOS scores and satisfaction also were not affected by degenerative patellofemoral joint changes. Furthermore, neither the patellar tilt angle nor the congruence angle influenced patient-reported outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative radiographic mild to moderate patellofemoral joint degeneration (Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1 through 3) and/or malalignment did not compromise intermediate-term knee and patellofemoral joint-specific patient-reported outcomes in patients managed with fixed-bearing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. On the basis of the results of the present study, we believe that neither mild to moderate patellofemoral degeneration nor abnormal patellar tilt or congruence should be considered a contraindication to fixed-bearing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.

pub.1134201328,Robotic arm-assisted versus manual total hip arthroplasty,"AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to compare the hip-specific functional outcome of robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) with manual total hip arthroplasty (mTHA) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Secondary aims were to compare general health improvement, patient satisfaction, and radiological component position and restoration of leg length between rTHA and mTHA.
METHODS: A total of 40 patients undergoing rTHA were propensity score matched to 80 patients undergoing mTHA for OA. Patients were matched for age, sex, and preoperative function. The Oxford Hip Score (OHS), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), and EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) were collected pre- and postoperatively (mean 10 months (SD 2.2) in rTHA group and 12 months (SD 0.3) in mTHA group). In addition, patient satisfaction was collected postoperatively. Component accuracy was assessed using Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones, and restoration of leg length were assessed radiologically.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the preoperative demographics (p ≥ 0.781) or function (p ≥ 0.383) between the groups. The postoperative OHS (difference 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 4.8; p = 0.038) and FJS (difference 21.1, 95% CI 10.7 to 31.5; p < 0.001) were significantly greater in the rTHA group when compared with the mTHA group. However, only the FJS was clinically significantly greater. There was no difference in the postoperative EQ-5D (difference 0.017, 95% CI -0.042 to 0.077; p = 0.562) between the two groups. No patients were dissatisfied in the rTHA group whereas six were dissatisfied in the mTHA group, but this was not significant (p = 0.176). rTHA was associated with an overall greater rate of component positioning in a safe zone (p ≤ 0.003) and restoration of leg length (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing rTHA had a greater hip-specific functional outcome when compared to mTHA, which may be related to improved component positioning and restoration of leg length. However, there was no difference in their postoperative generic health or rate of satisfaction. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint Res</i> 2021;10(1):22-30."
pub.1126892567,A constrained‐condylar fixed‐bearing total knee arthroplasty is stabilised by the medial soft tissues,"PURPOSE: Revision constrained-condylar total knee arthroplasty (CCK-TKA) is often used to provide additional mechanical constraint after failure of a primary TKA. However, it is unknown how much this translates to a reliance on soft-tissue support. The aim of this study was therefore to compare the laxity of a native knee to the CCK-TKA implanted state and quantify how medial soft-tissues stabilise the knee following CCK-TKA.
METHODS: Ten intact cadaveric knees were tested in a robotic system at 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° flexion with ± 90  N anterior-posterior force, ± 8 Nm varus-valgus and ± 5 Nm internal-external torques. A fixed-bearing CCK-TKA was implanted and the laxity tests were repeated with the soft tissues intact and after sequential cutting. The deep and superficial medial collateral ligaments (dMCL, sMCL) and posteromedial capsule (PMC) were sequentially transected and the percentage contributions of each structure to restraining the applied loads were calculated.
RESULTS: Implanting a CCK-TKA did not alter anterior-posterior laxity from that of the original native knee, but it significantly decreased internal-external and varus-valgus rotational laxity (p < 0.05). Post CCK-TKA, the sMCL restrained 34% of the tibial displacing load in anterior drawer, 16% in internal rotation, 17% in external rotation and 53% in valgus, across the flexion angles tested. The dMCL restrained 11% of the valgus rotation moment.
CONCLUSIONS: With a fully-competent sMCL in-vitro, a fixed-bearing CCK-TKA knee provided more rotational constraint than the native knee. The robotic test data showed that both the soft-tissues and the semi-constrained implant restrained rotational knee laxity. Therefore, in clinical practice, a fixed-bearing CCK-TKA knee could be indicated for use in a knee with lax, less-competent medial soft tissues.

pub.1134713642,Functional alignment achieves soft-tissue balance in total knee arthroplasty as measured with quantitative sensor-guided technology.,"AIMS: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using functional alignment aims to implant the components with minimal compromise of the soft-tissue envelope by restoring the plane and obliquity of the non-arthritic joint. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of TKA with functional alignment on mediolateral soft-tissue balance as assessed using intraoperative sensor-guided technology.
METHODS: This prospective study included 30 consecutive patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA using the Stryker PS Triathlon implant with functional alignment. Intraoperative soft-tissue balance was assessed using sensor-guided technology after definitive component implantation; soft-tissue balance was defined as intercompartmental pressure difference (ICPD) of < 15 psi. Medial and lateral compartment pressures were recorded at 10°, 45°, and 90° of knee flexion. This study included 18 females (60%) and 12 males (40%) with a mean age of 65.2 years (SD 9.3). Mean preoperative hip-knee-ankle deformity was 6.3° varus (SD 2.7°).
RESULTS: TKA with functional alignment achieved balanced medial and lateral compartment pressures at 10° (25.0 psi (SD 6.1) vs 23.1 psi (SD 6.7), respectively; p = 0.140), 45° (21.4 psi (SD 5.9) vs 20.6 psi (SD 5.9), respectively; p = 0.510), and 90° (21.2 psi (SD 7.1) vs 21.6 psi (SD 9.0), respectively; p = 0.800) of knee flexion. Mean ICPD was 6.1 psi (SD 4.5; 0 to 14) at 10°, 5.4 psi (SD 3.9; 0 to 12) at 45°, and 4.9 psi (SD 4.45; 0 to 15) at 90° of knee flexion. Mean postoperative limb alignment was 2.2° varus (SD 1.0°).
CONCLUSION: TKA using the functional alignment achieves balanced mediolateral soft-tissue tension through the arc of knee flexion as assessed using intraoperative pressure-sensor technology. Further clinical trials are required to determine if TKA with functional alignment translates to improvements in patient satisfaction and outcomes compared to conventional alignment techniques.

pub.1064886517,The instruments of the bonesetter.,"Orthopaedic surgeons use a variety of instruments to help correct, treat, and heal bone disease. The development of these instruments mirrors the history of orthopaedic surgery. The history of bonesetting, the treatment and replacement of joints, and of those who performed these techniques, appears to originate deep in antiquity. Changing ideas within medicine and surgery over the last 200 years have shaped the discovery and evolution of orthopaedic instruments and of the bonesetters themselves. Advances have led to the use of computers as instruments in the navigational guidance of arthroplasty surgery, the use of robotics, the development of cordless drills and improvements in the design of blades to cut bone. Yet some of the old instruments remain; plaster of Paris bandages, the Thomas Splint, Liston's bonecutter, Gigli's saw, bone nibblers and Macewan's osteotomes are still in use. This paper presents a historical review of bonesetters and examines how orthopaedic instruments have evolved from antiquity to the 21st century."
pub.1001270228,Effectiveness of the ROBODOC system in preventing intraoperative pulmonary embolism,"Intraoperative pulmonary embolism occurs not only during cemented but also during cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA). We determined whether the ROBODOC femoral milling system can reduce intraoperative pulmonary embolism, by using of transesophageal echocardiography and hemodynamic monitoring. We did a prospective clinical trial with 71 patients (75 hips) who were divided into 2 groups: group 1, 46 patients (50 hips) who underwent cementless THA with preparation of the femoral canal using ROBODOC; group 2, 25 patients (25 hips) who underwent conventional cementless THA surgery in whom separate measurements were made during preparation of the femur, insertion of the stem and relocation of the hip. The incidence of severe embolic events was lower in group 1 than in group 2. Our findings suggest that the ROBODOC femoral milling system may reduce the risk of clinically significant pulmonary embolism during cementless THA."

Intraoperatively, the robot milled the femoral canal according to the preoperative planning performed with preoperative CT data and the ROBODOC workstation. Postoperative CT data was obtained 1 month postoperatively. Anteroposterior and lateral synthetic radiographs and axial images were reconstructed from CT data on the workstation. The mean difference between the preoperative planning and the postoperative CT images was less than 5% in canal fill, less than 1 mm in gap, and less than 1 degrees in the mediolateral and anteroposterior alignment. Clinical femoral canal preparation using the ROBODOC system results in a high degree of accuracy."

The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of limb alignment and component placement after R-TKA.Methods and MaterialsThis is the prospective study of 63 patients who underwent R-TKA between March and October 2019. Standing scanogram and AP/lateral radiograph were done on day of discharge, 5th day after surgery to calculate limb alignment and component placement angles in coronal and sagittal plane. Deformity correction Bone Ninja software had been used to calculate all this angles.ResultsMean difference between robotic achieved and postoperative limb alignment was 1.24°. Mean difference between planned and achieved component placement in coronal and sagittal plane for tibia was 0.33° and 0.66° and for femur was 0.62° and 0.30°, respectively. Posterior condylar offset difference was 0.03. As per planned by Navio software, R-TKA had reduced the overall outlier of coronal limb alignment from 3° to less than 1.2° and component placement malposition to less than 1° in coronal and sagittal plane.ConclusionR-TKA provides near perfect limb alignment and near accurate femoral/tibial component placement as planned in both coronal and sagittal plane. Posterior condylar offset was also perfectly maintained. R-TKA had reduced the overall outlier of coronal limb alignment from 3° to less than 1.2° and component placement malposition to less than 1° in coronal and sagittal plane."
pub.1048135360,Technique and first clinical results of robot-assisted total knee replacement,"Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common procedure for treatment of severe gonarthrosis, but the outcome may be unsatisfactory due to primary malalignment of the prosthetic components. In order to improve precision and accuracy of this surgical procedure, a commercial robotic surgical system (CASPAR) has been adapted to assist the surgeon in the preoperative planning and intraoperative execution of TKR. So far, 70 patients with idiopathic gonarthrosis were successfully treated with a robot-assisted technique in our institution. No major adverse events related to the use of the robotic system have been observed. The mean difference between preoperatively planned and postoperatively achieved tibiofemoral alignment was 0.8 degrees (0-4.1 degrees ) in the robotic group vs. 2.6 degrees (0-7 degrees ) in a manually operated historical control group of 50 patients. A clear advantage of robot-assisted TKR seems to be the ability to execute a highly precise preoperative plan based on computed tomography (CT) scans. Due to better alignment of the prosthetic components and improved bone-implant fit, implant loosening is anticipated to be diminished which may be most evident in non-cemented prostheses. Current disadvantages such as the need for placement of fiducial markers, increased operating times and higher overall costs have to be resolved in the future."
pub.1136978958,Accuracy of cup position following robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty may be associated with surgical approach and pelvic tilt,"This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of cup placement and determine the predictive risk factors for inaccurate cup positioning in robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA). We retrospectively analyzed 115 patients who underwent robot-assisted THA between August 2018 and November 2019. Acetabular cup alignment and three-dimensional (3D) position were measured using pre- or postoperative computed tomography (CT) data. Absolute differences in cup inclination, anteversion, and 3D position were assessed, and their relation to preoperative factors was evaluated. The average measurement of the absolute differences was 1.8° ± 2.0° (inclination) and 1.9° ± 2.3° (anteversion). The average absolute difference in the 3D cup position was 1.1 ± 1.2 mm (coronal plane) and 0.9 ± 1.0 mm (axial plane). Multivariate analysis revealed that a posterior pelvic tilt [odds ratio (OR, 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00–1.23] and anterior surgical approach (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.69–15.38) were predictive factors for inaccurate cup positioning with robot-assisted THA. This is the first study to demonstrate the predictive risk factors (posterior pelvic tilt and anterior surgical approach) for inaccurate cup position in robot-assisted THA."
pub.1014949250,Medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty improves congruence and restores joint space width of the lateral compartment,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritic progression of the lateral compartment remains a leading indication for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) revision. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the alterations of the lateral compartment congruence and joint space width (JSW) following medial UKA.
METHODS: Retrospectively, lateral compartment congruence and JSW were evaluated in 174 knees (74 females, 85 males, mean age 65.5years; SD±10.1) preoperatively and six weeks postoperatively, and compared to 41 healthy knees (26 men, 15 women, mean age 33.7years; SD±6.4). Congruence (CI) was calculated using validated software that evaluates the geometric relationship between surfaces and calculates a congruence index (CI). JSW was measured on three sides (inner, middle, outer) by subdividing the lateral compartment into four quarters.
RESULTS: The CI of the control group was 0.98 (SD±0.01). The preoperative CI was 0.88 (SD±0.01), which improved significantly to 0.93 (SD±0.03) postoperatively (p<0.001). In 82% of knees, CI improved after surgery, while in 18% it decreased. The preoperative significant JSW differences of the inner (p<0.001) and outer JSW (p<0.001) were absent postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that a well-conducted medial UKA not only resurfaces the medial compartment but also improves congruence and restores the JSW of the lateral compartment."

A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed focusing on radiological and clinical outcomes. The odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) in various outcomes were calculated, and the interventions were ranked by the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) value.
RESULTS: Seventy-three RCTs were included, with a total of 4209 TKAs. Navigation and Robot could significantly reduce the occurrence of malalignment and malposition compared with PSI and CON, and Navigation could obtain higher medium-and-long-term KSS knee scores than CON. Robot had the greatest advantage in achieving the desired alignment accurately, followed by Navigation; Navigation had the greatest advantage in the KSS score.
CONCLUSION: Navigation and Robot did improve the accuracy of alignment compared with PSI and conventional instrument in TKA, but the above four techniques showed no clinical significance in postoperative outcomes.

pub.1134318586,"Feasibility and efficacy of knee extension training using a single-joint hybrid assistive limb, versus conventional rehabilitation during the early postoperative period after total knee arthroplasty","<b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of treatment for the recovery of knee joint function after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a robotic suit. <b>Patients and Methods:</b> Knee joint extension exercise sessions were started with a robotic suit (single-joint hybrid assistive limb [HAL-SJ, Cyberdyne, Inc., Tsukuba, Japan]) in one group of patients after TKA. Patients who underwent standard rehabilitation were enrolled in the control group. To evaluate feasibility and safety, we assessed the adverse events, the number of training sessions, and training time. We compared the changes in knee joint pain and extension lag (°) between the groups. <b>Results:</b> The average age was 71.3 ± 6.2 years in the HAL-SJ group and 74.9 ± 8.7 years in the control group. There were no severe adverse events. In the HAL-SJ group, training was performed 2.9 times, on average, and lasted 18.8 min. In the HAL-SJ group, there was a reduction in the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain after training, which was not significant. In the control group, the VAS score worsened after the sessions. The extension lag significantly improved in the HAL-SJ group after the 2nd and 3rd sessions, and this was more due to improvements in their active extension range of motion than their passive extension range of motion. <b>Conclusions:</b> HAL-SJ-based training is safe and effective, and leads to instantaneous improvement of extension lag, without worsening knee joint pain. HAL-SJ-based knee extension training could represent a viable novel post-TKA rehabilitation modality."
pub.1033909673,Femoral and tibial insert downsizing increases the laxity envelope in TKA,"PURPOSE: This study examines the effect of component downsizing in a modern total knee arthroplasty (TKA) system on the laxity envelope of the knee throughout flexion.
METHODS: A robotic testing system was utilized to measure laxity envelopes in the implanted knee by in the anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (ML), internal-external (IE) and varus-valgus (VV) directions. Five fresh-frozen cadavers were tested with a modern cruciate retaining TKA implantation, a 1-mm thinner polyethylene insert and a femoral component 2 mm smaller in the AP dimension.
RESULTS: The downsized tibial insert was more lax throughout the flexion arc with up to 2.0 mm more laxity in the AP direction at full extension, a 43.8% increase over the original implantation. A thinner insert consistently increased laxity throughout the arc of flexion in all degrees of freedom. Downsizing the femoral component resulted in 8.5 mm increase in AP laxity at 90°, a 73.9% increase. In mid-flexion, downsizing the femur produced similar laxity values to the downsized insert in AP, ML, IE and VV directions.
CONCLUSION: Downsizing the TKA components had significant effects on laxity throughout flexion. Downsizing a femoral component 2 mm had an equivalent increase in laxity in mid-flexion as downsizing the tibial insert 1 mm. This study quantifies the importance of choosing the appropriate implant component size, having the appropriate size available and the effect of downsizing. The laxity of the implanted knee contributes to how the implant feels to the patient and ultimately the patient's satisfaction with their new knee."
pub.1064454943,Accuracy considerations in navigated cup placement for total hip arthroplasty,"Computer assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) technology has recently been introduced to overcome problems resulting from acetabular component malpositioning in total hip arthroplasty. Available navigation modules can conceptually be categorized as computer tomography (CT) based, fluoroscopy based, or image-free. The current study presents a comprehensive accuracy analysis on the computer assisted placement accuracy of acetabular cups. It combines analyses using mathematical approaches, in vitro testing environments, and an in vivo clinical trial. A hybrid navigation approach combining image-free with fluoroscopic technology was chosen as the best compromise to CT-based systems. It introduces pointer-based digitization for easily assessable points and bi-planar fluoroscopy for deep-seated landmarks. From the in vitro data maximum deviations were found to be 3.6 degrees for inclination and 3.8 degrees for anteversion relative to a pre-defined test position. The maximum difference between intraoperatively calculated cup inclination and anteversion with the postoperatively measured position was 4 degrees and 5 degrees, respectively. These data coincide with worst cases scenario predictions applying a statistical simulation model. The proper use of navigation technology can reduce variability of cup placement well within the surgical safe zone. Surgeons have to concentrate on a variety of error sources during the procedure, which may explain the reported strong learning curves for CAOS technologies."
pub.1092589793,Balanced Flexion and Extension Gaps Are Not Always of Equal Size,"BACKGROUND: It has been widely accepted in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that flexion and extension gaps in the disarticulated knee during surgery should be equalized. We hypothesized that tensioning during assessment of the flexion gap can induce temporary widening of the gap due to posterior tibial translation. We aimed to describe posterior tibial translation at flexion gap (90°) assessments and assess the correlation of tibial translation with laxity (flexion space increase) using constrained and non-constrained inserts.
METHODS: Imageless navigation was used to measure flexion angle, tibial position relative to the femoral axis, and lateral/medial laxity in 30 patients undergoing primary TKA. Trialing was conducted using posteriorly stabilized and cruciate retaining trials of the same size to elucidate the association of posterior tibial translation with changes in joint capsule laxity at 90° knee flexion.
RESULTS: All patients demonstrated posterior tibial translation during flexion gap assessment relative to their subsequent final implantation [mean ± standard deviation (range), 11.3 ± 4.4 (4-21) mm]. Positive linear correlation [r = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44-0.84, P ≤ .001] was demonstrated between translations [8.7 ± 2.4 (3-13) mm] and laxity changes [2.9° ± 2.0° (-0.7° to 7.4°)] at 90° of flexion.
CONCLUSION: Posterior tibial translation can cause artifactual widening of the flexion gap during gap balancing in posteriorly stabilized TKA, which can be of sufficient magnitude to alter femoral component size selection for some patients. Recognition and management of these intra-operative dynamics for optimal kinematics could be feasible with the advent of robotic applications."
pub.1064454947,Comparative repeatability of guide-pin axis positioning in computer-assisted and manual femoral head resurfacing arthroplasty,"The orientation of the femoral component in hip resurfacing arthroplasty affects the likelihood of loosening and fracture. Computer-assisted surgery has been shown to improve significantly the surgeon's ability to achieve a desired position and orientation; nevertheless, both bias and variability in positioning remain and can potentially be improved. The authors recently developed a computer-assisted surgical (CAS) technique to guide the placement of the pin used in femoral head resurfacing arthroplasty and showed that it produced significantly less variation than a typical manual technique in varus/valgus placement relative to a preoperatively determined surgical plan while taking a comparable amount of time. In the present study, the repeatability of both the CAS and manual techniques is evaluated in order to estimate the relative contributions to overall variability of surgical technique (CAS versus manual), surgeon experience (novice versus experienced), and other sources of variability (e.g. across specimens and across surgeons). This will enable further improvements in the accuracy of CAS techniques. Three residents/fellows new to femoral head resurfacing and three experienced hip arthroplasty surgeons performed 20-30 repetitions of each of the CAS and manual techniques on at least one of four cadaveric femur specimens. The CAS system had markedly better repeatability (1.2 degrees) in varus/valgus placement relative to the manual technique (2.8 degrees), slightly worse repeatability in version (4.4 degrees versus 3.2 degrees), markedly better repeatability in mid-neck placement (0.7 mm versus 2.5 mm), no significant dependence on surgeon skill level (in contrast to the manual technique), and took significantly less time (50 s versus 123 s). Proposed improvements to the version measurement process showed potential for reducing the standard deviation by almost two thirds. This study supports the use of CAS for femoral head resurfacing as it is quicker than the manual technique, independent of surgeon experience, and demonstrates improved repeatability."
pub.1068895745,Comparison of robotic-assisted and manual implantation of a primary total hip replacement. A prospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total hip replacement has become a common method of implantation, especially in Europe. It frequently has been postulated that robotic reaming would result in an improved clinical outcome due to the better fit of the prosthesis, but that has never been demonstrated in a prospective study, to our knowledge. The purpose of this study was to compare robotic-assisted implantation of a total hip replacement with conventional manual implantation.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four patients scheduled for total hip replacement were randomly assigned to undergo either conventional manual implantation of an S-ROM prosthesis (eighty patients) or robotic-assisted implantation of such a prosthesis (seventy-four patients). The five-axis ROBODOC was used for the robotic-assisted procedures. Preoperatively as well as at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months after surgery, the scores according to the Harris and Merle d'Aubigné systems and the Mayo clinical score were determined. Radiographs made at these intervals were analyzed for evidence of loosening, prosthetic alignment, and heterotopic ossification.
RESULTS: Thirteen (18%) of the seventy-four attempted robotic implantations had to be converted to manual implantations as a result of failure of the system. The duration of the robotic procedures was longer than that of the manual procedures (mean and standard deviation,107.1 +/- 29.1 compared with 82.4 +/- 23.4 minutes, p < 0.001). Limb-length equality (mean discrepancy, 0.18 +/- 0.30 compared with 0.96 +/- 0.93 cm, p < 0.001) and varus-valgus orientation of the stem (mean angle between the femur and the shaft of the prosthesis, 0.34 degrees +/- 0.67 degrees compared with 0.84 degrees +/- 1.23 degrees, p < 0.001) were better after the robotic procedures. At six months, slightly more heterotopic ossification was seen in the group treated with robotic implantation. The group treated with robotic implantation had a better Mayo clinical score at six and twelve months and a better Harris score at twelve months; however, by twenty-four months, no difference was found between the groups with regard to any of the three scores. Dislocation was more frequent in the group treated with robotic implantation: it occurred in eleven of the sixty-one patients in that group compared with three of eighty in the other group (p < 0.001). Recurrent dislocation and pronounced limping were indications for revision surgery in eight of the sixty-one patients treated with robotic implantation compared with none of the seventy-eight (excluding two with revision for infection) treated with manual insertion (p < 0.001). Rupture of the gluteus medius tendon was observed during all of the revision operations.
CONCLUSIONS: The robotic-assisted technology had advantages in terms of preoperative planning and the accuracy of the intraoperative procedure. Disadvantages were the high revision rate; the amount of muscle damage, which we believe was responsible for"
pub.1063888595,Application and evaluation of biomechanical models and scores for the planning of total hip arthroplasty,"Intimate knowledge of the biomechanics of a given individual hip joint provides a potential advantage during the planning of total hip arthroplasty, and would thus have a positive influence over the outcome of such an intervention. In current clinical practise, the surgical planning is based solely on the status of the individual hip and its radiographic appearance. However, additional information could be gathered from the radiography to be used as input data for biomechanical models aimed at calculating the resultant force FR within the hip joint. An investigation of the biomechanical models by Pauwels, Debrunner and Iglič was performed, where the magnitude of FR calculated by the models showed a favourable comparison to the in-vivo data from instrumented prostheses by Bergmann. The Blumentritt model returned abnormally high results. The computational results showed large variations for FR orientation, which tends to depend more on the model used than on patient-specific parameters. Furthermore, a discrepancy was found between the data gathered from instrumented prostheses and the Standing Human Model within the 'AnyBody Modeling System™' software by AnyBody Tech. Additionally, the variations in inter-rater and intra-rater errors made while localizing radiographic landmarks were analysed with respect to their influence on Babisch-Layher-Blumentritt (BLB)-scoring using the Blumentritt hip model."
pub.1137486795,Do existing real-world data sources generate suitable evidence for the HTA of medical devices in Europe? Mapping and critical appraisal,"AIM: Technological and computational advancements offer new tools for the collection and analysis of real-world data (RWD). Considering the substantial effort and resources devoted to collecting RWD, a greater return would be achieved if real-world evidence (RWE) was effectively used to support Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and decision making on medical technologies. A useful question is: To what extent are RWD suitable for generating RWE?
METHODS: We mapped existing RWD sources in Europe for three case studies: hip and knee arthroplasty, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and mitral valve repair (TMVR), and robotic surgery procedures. We provided a comprehensive assessment of their content and appropriateness for conducting the HTA of medical devices. The identification of RWD sources was performed combining a systematic search on PubMed with gray literature scoping, covering fifteen European countries.
RESULTS: We identified seventy-one RWD sources on arthroplasties; ninety-five on TAVI and TMVR; and seventy-seven on robotic procedures. The number, content, and integrity of the sources varied dramatically across countries. Most sources included at least one health outcome (97.5%), with mortality and rehospitalization/reoperation the most common; 80% of sources included resource outcomes, with length of stay the most common, and comparators were available in almost 70% of sources.
CONCLUSIONS: RWD sources bear the potential for the HTA of medical devices. The main challenges are data accessibility, a lack of standardization of health and economic outcomes, and inadequate comparators. These findings are crucial to enabling the incorporation of RWD into decision making and represent a readily available tool for getting acquainted with existing information sources."
pub.1085906556,Computer‐assisted Orthopaedic Surgery,"Nowadays, operating rooms can be inefficient and overcrowded. Patient data and images are at times not well integrated and displayed in a timely fashion. This lack of coordination may cause further reductions in efficiency, jeopardize patient safety, and increase costs. Fortunately, technology has much to offer the surgical disciplines and the ongoing and recent operating room innovations have advanced preoperative planning and surgical procedures by providing visual, navigational, and mechanical computerized assistance. The field of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) broadly refers to surgical interface between surgeons and machines. It is also part of the ongoing initiatives to move away from invasive to less invasive or even noninvasive procedures. CAS can be applied preoperatively, intraoperatively, and/or postoperatively to improve the outcome of orthopaedic surgical procedures as it has the potential for greater precision, control, and flexibility in carrying out surgical tasks, and enables much better visualization of the operating field than conventional methods have afforded. CAS is an active research discipline, which brings together orthopaedic practitioners with traditional technical disciplines such as engineering, computer science, and robotics. However, to achieve the best outcomes, teamwork, open communication, and willingness to adapt and adopt new skills and processes are critical. Because of the relatively short time period over which CAS has developed, long-term follow-up studies have not yet been possible. Consequently, this review aims to outline current CAS applications, limitations, and promising future developments that will continue to impact the operating room (OR) environment and the OR in the future, particularly within orthopedic and spine surgery."
pub.1046706259,Expertise Modeling for Automated Planning of Acetabular Cup in Total Hip Arthroplasty Using Combined Bone and Implant Statistical Atlases,"Intraoperative robotic and computer-guided assistances are now commonly used in total hip arthroplasty (THA) for accurate execution of the preoperative plan. Although the preoperative plan to be accurately executed is critical, it is still interactively prepared in a time-consuming and subjective manner. In this paper, atlas-based approach to automated surgical planning of the acetabular cup in THA is described to stabilize its quality as well as reduce its time-consuming nature. Surgeon’s expertise is embedded in two types of statistical atlases, which are constructed from training datasets of CT-based 3D plans prepared by experienced surgeons. One is a statistical shape model which encodes global spatial relationships between the patient anatomy and implant. The other is the statistical map of residual bone thickness on the implant surface, which encodes local spatial constraints of the anatomy and implant. Given the 3D pelvis shape of the patient, we formulate a procedure to determine the best size and position of the acetabular cup which satisfy the constraints derived from the two statistical atlases. We validated the proposed planning method by retrospective study using the datasets which were actually used in the THA surgery."
pub.1159996707,Does robot-assisted surgery reduce leg length discrepancy in total hip replacement? Robot-assisted posterior approach versus direct anterior approach and manual posterior approach: a propensity score-matching study,"BackgroundAdvocates of robot-assisted technique argue that robots could improve leg length restoration in total hip replacement. However, there were few studies to compare the robot-assisted posterior approach (RPA) with conventional posterior approach (PA) THA and direct anterior approach (DAA) THA in LLD. This study aimed to determine whether robot-assisted techniques could significantly reduce LLD compared to manual DAA and manual PA.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the cohort of consecutive ONFH patients who underwent THA robot-assisted posterior, manual posterior, and manual DAA from January 2018 to December 2020 in one institution. One experienced surgeon performed all procedures. We calculated the propensity score to match similar patients in different groups by multivariate logistic regression analysis for each patient. We included confounders consisting of age at the time of surgery, sex, body mass index (BMI), and preoperative LLD. Postoperative LLD and Harris hip scores (HHS) at two years after surgery of different cohorts were compared.ResultWe analyzed 267 ONFH patients treated with RPA, DAA, or PA (73 RPA patients, 99 DAA patients, and 95 PA patients). After propensity score matching, we generated cohorts of 40 patients in DAA and RPA groups. And we found no significant difference in postoperative LLD between RPA and DAA cohorts (4.10 ± 3.50 mm vs 4.60 ± 4.14 mm, p = 0.577) in this study. The HHS at 2 years postoperatively were 87.04 ± 7.06 vs 85.33 ± 8.34 p = 0.202. After propensity score matching, we generated cohorts of 58 patients in manual PA and RPA groups. And there were significant differences in postoperative LLD between the RPA and PA cohorts. (3.98 ± 3.27 mm vs 5.38 ± 3.68 mm, p = 0.031). The HHS at 2 years postoperatively were 89.38 ± 6.81 vs 85.33 ± 8.81 p = 0.019. After propensity score matching, we generated cohorts of 75 patients in manual DAA and PA groups. And there were significant differences in postoperative LLD between the DAA and PA cohorts. (4.03 ± 3.93 mm vs 5.39 ± 3.83 mm, p = 0.031) The HHS at 2 years postoperatively were 89.71 ± 6.18 vs 86.91 ± 7.20 p = 0.012.ConclusionThis study found no significant difference in postoperative LLD between RPA and DAA, but we found a significant difference between RPA and manual PA, DAA and manual PA in ONFH patients. We found a significant advantage in leg length restoration in primary total hip arthroplasty with robot-assisted surgery."
pub.1134981266,Improved Compartment Balancing Using a Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted surgery was developed to improve accuracy and outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). One important determinant of TKA success is a well-balanced knee throughout the range of motion. The purpose of this study is to determine if robot-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) results in improved intracompartmental ligament balance compared with conventional jig-based instrumentation (CM-TKA).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 2 cohorts-a CM-TKA (n = 49) vs RA-TKA (n = 37) cohort. Demographic and intraoperative data, including intraoperative compartment loads, were measured after final implant implantation in extension (10°), mid-flexion (45°), and full flexion (90°), using an intraoperative compartment pressure sensor. An a priori power analysis revealed our study exhibited >80% power in detecting a 5-pound (lb) difference in compartment loads in the 2 cohorts.
RESULTS: There was no difference between medial and lateral compartment loads in extension, mid-flexion, and full flexion for the conventional (15.1 lbs, 15.9 lbs, and 13.4 lbs, respectively) vs RA-TKA (14.2 lbs, 15.1 lbs, and 10.3 lbs, respectively). The percentage of patients with high load compartment pressure in flexion (&gt;40 lbs) by the conclusion of the surgery was significantly greater for the conventional (18%) vs the robotic TKA cohort (3%, <i>P</i> = .025). The percentage of patients with unbalanced knees (&gt;20 lbs differential between medial and lateral compartments) in flexion was significantly greater in the conventional (24%) vs robotic TKA cohort (5%, <i>P</i> = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: In this series, RA-TKA resulted in improved intraoperative compartment balancing in flexion with no observed difference in mid-flexion and extension compared with CM-TKA."
pub.1181364862,UNICOMPARTMENTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY: WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL ALIGNMENT CORRECTION TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS? THE ROLE OF KINEMATIC ALIGNMENT. STATE OFF THE ART REVIEW,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is in many ways the ultimate kinematic operation as the express aim is to resurface the diseased side of the joint and restore pre-arthritic alignment and balance while maintaining integrity of both cruciate ligaments. An increasing body of knowledge relates the outcomes of UKA to pre-arthritic anatomy rather than an arbitrarily defined neutral. The Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) classification provides a validated technique for calculating pre-arthritic limb alignment (the Arithmetic Hip-Knee-Ankle Ankle (aHKA)) and Joint Line Obliquity (JLO) and will enable a greater understanding of the interactions between pre-arthritic anatomy, choice of prosthetic position and outcomes. When pre-arthritic alignment is not taken into consideration a post-operative limb alignment of mild to moderate varus for medial UKA and moderate valgus for lateral UKA appears produces the best outcomes. When pre-arthritic anatomy is taken into account superior results have been reported with restoration of pre-arthritic limb alignment and joint line obliquity. Restriction boundaries have yet to be clearly defined for tibial component coronal and Hip-Knee-Ankle (HKA) angles when applying this new paradigm, but existing evidence would suggest a 6<sup>0</sup> varus limit for the tibial coronal angle may be a reasonable starting point. Lateral UKA has inherent differences in terms of tibial component positioning and ligament balance targets. Mobile bearing UKA demands a three-dimensional understanding of the effect of implant position on bearing stability. Modification of technique is necessary to produce anatomic tibia component angles with equipment designed for mechanical alignment. Robotic technology allows accurate understanding of pre-arthritic anatomy, precise reproduction of patient specific virtual planning, equally precise manipulation of soft tissue balance and future research using these platforms likely to further clarify in terms of ideal patient specific component and limb alignment targets."
pub.1157333313,Does robotic-assisted surgery improve outcomes of total hip arthroplasty compared to manual technique? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an emerging technology that claims to position implants with very high accuracy. However, there is currently limited data in literature on whether this improved accuracy leads to better long-term clinical outcomes. This systematic review compares the outcomes of THA done with the help of robotic assistance (RA) to those done with conventional manual techniques (MTs).
METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for eligible articles that directly compared robot-assisted THA to manual THA and had data on the radiological or clinical outcomes of both. Data on various outcome parameters were collected. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: A total of 17 articles were found eligible for inclusion, and 3600 cases were analysed. Mean operating time in the RA group was significantly longer than in the MT group. RA resulted in significantly more acetabular cups being placed inside Lewinnek's and Callanan's safe zones (p<0.001) and had significantly reduced limb length discrepancy compared with MT. There were no statistically significant differences in the two groups in terms of incidence of perioperative complications, need for revision surgery and long-term functional outcome.
CONCLUSION: RA leads to highly accurate implant placement and leads to significantly reduced limb length discrepancies. However, the authors do not recommend robot-assisted techniques for routine THAs due to lack of adequate long-term follow-up data, prolonged surgical times and no significant differences in the rate of complications and implant survivorship compared with conventional MTs."
pub.1165710911,Higher incidence of patellar incongruence after under correction of pre‐arthritic coronal alignment following medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare patellofemoral joint alignment of knees with restored pre-arthritic coronal alignment versus knees with under- or overcorrection from their pre-arthritic coronal alignment following medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and evaluate the effect of patellofemoral joint alignment on patient-reported outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 517 knees following robotic-arm assisted medial UKA was conducted. Postoperative mechanical hip-knee-ankle angle (mHKA) was compared to estimated pre-arthritic coronal alignment, using the arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA). Knees were considered restored to the pre-arthritic coronal alignment if mHKA was within 2.0° of aHKA (Group 1). Non-restored knees were subdivided into > 2.0° over correction (Group 2), or > 2.0° under correction (Group 3) from the pre-arthritic coronal alignment. Patellar congruence and patellar tilt angles were compared between groups. The Kujala score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritic Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR) were analyzed by group. Continuous data was compared using analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Chi-squared tests were used to compare discrete variables. Logistic regressions were conducted to estimate the probability of postoperative patellofemoral malalignment.
RESULTS: Group 1 included 357 knees (69.1%), Group 2 included 57 knees (11.0%), and Group 3 included 57 knees (11.0%). The prevalence of postoperative abnormal patellar congruence (i.e. ≥ 17°) was higher in Group 3 at 40.4% (p = 0.009), with a higher odds ratio of having an abnormal patellar congruence angle (2.3, p = 0.01) compared to Group 1. The prevalence of postoperative abnormal patellar tilt (i.e. ≥ 14°) was comparable between groups (n.s.). At mean follow up of 4.4 ± 1.6 years, Kujala was worse in Group 3 (76.6 ± 17.4 compared to 84.0 ± 14.9 and 85.0 ± 14.4 in Groups 1 and 2, respectively; p = 0.006). Mean KOOS, JR outcomes were comparable among groups. No significantly inferior Kujala or KOOS, JR outcomes were observed in patients across all groups with abnormal patellar congruence or tilt angles.
CONCLUSION: Knees with under correction from their pre-arthritic coronal alignment following medial UKA were associated with a two-fold higher probability of having postoperative patellofemoral incongruence, as well as inferior mid-term Kujala scores compared to knees with restored pre-arthritic coronal alignment and knees with overcorrection from their pre-arthritic coronal alignment. Patellofemoral incongruence alone did not negatively impact functional outcome scores.

pub.1182012513,Evaluation of changes in fixed flexion deformity following medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Aims: While residual fixed flexion deformity (FFD) in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been associated with worse functional outcomes, limited evidence exists regarding FFD changes. The objective of this study was to quantify FFD changes in patients with medial unicompartmental knee arthritis undergoing UKA, and investigate any correlation with clinical outcomes.
Methods: This study included 136 patients undergoing robotic arm-assisted medial UKA between January 2018 and December 2022. The study included 75 males (55.1%) and 61 (44.9%) females, with a mean age of 67.1 years (45 to 90). Patients were divided into three study groups based on the degree of preoperative FFD: ≤ 5°, 5° to ≤ 10°, and > 10°. Intraoperative optical motion capture technology was used to assess pre- and postoperative FFD. Clinical FFD was measured pre- and postoperatively at six weeks and one year following surgery. Preoperative and one-year postoperative Oxford Knee Scores (OKS) were collected.
Results: Overall, the median preoperative navigated (NAV) FFD measured 6.0° (IQR 3.1 to 8), while the median postoperative NAV FFD was 3.0° (IQR 1° to 4.4°), representing a mean correction of 49.2%. The median preoperative clinical FFD was 5° (IQR 0° to 9.75°) for the entire cohort, which decreased to 3.0° (IQR 0° to 5°) and 2° (IQR 0° to 3°) at six weeks and one year postoperatively, respectively. A statistically significant improvement in PROMs compared with baseline was evident in all groups (p &lt; 0.001). Regression analyses showed that participants who experienced a larger FFD correction, showed greater improvement in PROMs (<i>β</i> = 0.609, p = 0.049; 95% CI 0.002 to 1.216).
Conclusion: This study found that UKA was associated with an approximately 50% improvement in preoperative FFD across all three examined groups. Participants with greater correction of FFD also demonstrated larger OKS gains. These findings could prove a useful augment to clinical decision-making regarding candidacy for UKA and anticipated improvements in FFD."
pub.1151954428,Accuracy and Precision of Acetabular Component Position Does Not Differ Between the Anterior and Posterior Approaches to Total Hip Arthroplasty With Robotic Assistance: A Matched-Pair Analysis,"Background: Deviation from planned component placement with robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA) may differ based on surgical approach. The purpose of this study was to compare radiographic accuracy and precision of acetabular component position using RA-THA with the direct anterior approach (DAA) or posterior approach (PA).
Methods: Between 2016 and 2019, 134 PA RA-THA patients were matched to 134 DAA RA-THA patients based on age (±10 years), body mass index (±5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and sex (exact). Acetabular component position was assessed using (1) planned position on preoperative computed tomography, (2) intraoperative position, and (3) position on 6-week postoperative radiographs using the digital Ein Bild Röntgen Analyse system.
Results: Accuracy of acetabular component inclination in the PA cohort was lower than that in the DAA cohort (PA: 4.3° ± 2.8° vs DAA: 3.1° ± 2.4°, <i>P</i> = .001). Inclination precision was not statistically different (PA: 3° ± 2.4° vs DAA: 2.5° ± 1.8°, <i>P</i> = .071). Anteversion accuracy was not statistically different (PA: 4.1° ± 3.7° vs DAA: 3.5° ± 2.5°, <i>P</i> = .091). Acetabular component anteversion was more precise with DAA (PA: 4.1° ± 3.7° vs DAA: 2.9° ± 2.0°, <i>P</i> = .001). Radiographic outliers (anteversion or inclination was &gt;10° or &lt;-10° from the planned target) were significantly more prevalent in the PA cohort than in the DAA cohort (12 vs 3, <i>P</i> = .016).
Conclusions: The acetabular component can be positioned with excellent precision and accuracy when using RA-THA regardless of approach. Although the DAA resulted in a slight increase in precise placement of cup anteversion and more accurate placement of cup abduction with fewer outliers, these small differences may not be clinically meaningful."
pub.1172495774,Elucidation of the association between additional distal femoral resection and extension angle improvement following the actual surgical steps with the Robot-TKA system,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association between additional distal femoral resection and improved flexion contracture in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with a robot-assisted system. Flexion contracture is a common issue in patients with knee osteoarthritis, which causes postoperative complications and functional limitations. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of additional bone resection in flexion contracture correction and knee extension angle improvement after the actual surgical steps.
METHODS: The study included 11 patients who underwent posterior-stabilized (PS)-type TKA with a robot-assisted system. The surgical technique consisted of precise bone resection and range of motion evaluation using a navigation system. A precut technique was used to facilitate posterior access and remove osteophytes that cause the contracture. The amount of additional distal femoral resection was determined based on the thickness of the insert trial required for achieving full extension.
RESULTS: The flexion contracture correction angle and the amount of additional distal femoral resection demonstrated a linear relationship. An average of 2.0° with the standard error (SE) of 0.6° improvement in flexion contracture was observed per 1.0 mm of additional bone resection. The postoperative evaluation demonstrated a significant improvement in knee extension angle, thereby reducing the contracture degree.
CONCLUSION: This study was the first to perform the additional distal femoral resection on the living knee, which closely replicates the actual surgical steps. The current study revealed that an additional 1.0 mm of distal femoral resection in PS-type TKA improves knee extension angle by 2.0° (SE 0.6°) within an additional resection range of 1.0 mm to 3.3 mm."
pub.1124550815,Achieving discharge within 24 h of robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty may be possible with appropriate patient selection and a multi-disciplinary team approach,"AIMS: There has been significant interest in day-case and rapid discharge pathways for unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR). Robotic-assisted surgery has the potential to improve surgical accuracy in UKR. However, to date there are no published studies reporting results of rapid-discharge pathways in patients receiving UKR using the NAVIO <sup><b>◊</b></sup> robotic system.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis identified 19 patients who were safely discharged within 24 h following UKR using the NAVIO <sup><b>◊</b></sup> robotic system between June 2017 and October 2019. All patients went through a standardised UKR pathway protocol. Pre-operatively patients underwent education sessions and anaesthetic assessment, with selected patients undergoing occupational/physiotherapy assessment prior to surgery. All patients received a general anaesthetic with local anaesthetic infiltration prior to closure; nerve blocks were not used routinely. A multi-modal analgesic regime was utilised. Patients were discharged home once they were safe to mobilise on ward, had normal vital signs and pain was adequately controlled. Patients were discharged with outpatient physiotherapy referral and consultant follow up at 6 weeks.
RESULTS: All patients were discharged within 24 h; there were no post-operative complications and no readmissions to hospital. The mean length of stay was 19.5 h (SD = 6.8), with patients seen twice on average by physiotherapy post-operatively. Active range of motion at 6 weeks was 105.8°, with all patients mobilising independently. The median 6-month post-operative Oxford Knee Score was 44 out of 48.
CONCLUSION: This initial feasibility study suggests that patients may be safely discharged within 24 h of UKR using the NAVIO robotic system. Appropriate patient selection will ensure successful discharge. Further prospective studies are needed."
pub.1039634479,Haptic Robot-assisted Surgery Improves Accuracy of Wide Resection of Bone Tumors: A Pilot Study,"BackgroundAccurate reproduction of the preoperative plan at the time of surgery is critical for wide resection of primary bone tumors. Robotic technology can potentially help the surgeon reproduce a given preoperative plan, but yielding control of cutting instruments to a robot introduces potentially serious complications. We developed a novel passive (“haptics”) robot-assisted resection technique for primary bone sarcomas that takes advantage of robotic accuracy while still leaving control of the cutting instrument in the hands of the surgeon.Questions/PurposesWe asked whether this technique would enable a preoperative resection plan to be reproduced more accurately than a standard manual technique.MethodsA joint-sparing hemimetaphyseal resection was precisely outlined on the three-dimensionally reconstructed image of a representative Sawbones femur. The indicated resection was performed on 12 Sawbones specimens using the standard manual technique on six specimens and the haptic robotic technique on six specimens. Postresection images were quantitatively analyzed to determine the accuracy of the resections compared to the preoperative plan, which included measuring the maximum linear deviation of the cuts from the preoperative plan and the angular deviation of the resection planes from the target planes.ResultsCompared with the manual technique, the robotic technique resulted in a mean improvement of 7.8 mm of maximum linear deviation from the preoperative plan and 7.9° improvement in pitch and 4.6° improvement in roll for the angular deviation from the target planes.ConclusionsThe haptic robot-assisted technique improved the accuracy of simulated wide resections of bone tumors compared with manual techniques.Clinical RelevanceHaptic robot-assisted technology has the potential to enhance primary bone tumor resection. Further bench and clinical studies, including comparisons with recently introduced computer navigation technology, are warranted."
pub.1140805594,"Is there increased value in robotic arm-assisted total hip arthroplasty? : a nationwide outcomes, trends, and projections analysis of 4,699,894 cases.","AIMS: The current study aimed to compare robotic arm-assisted (RA-THA), computer-assisted (CA-THA), and manual (M-THA) total hip arthroplasty regarding in-hospital metrics including length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, in-hospital complications, and cost of RA-THA versus M-THA and CA-THA versus M-THA, as well as trends in use and uptake over a ten-year period, and future projections of uptake and use of RA-THA and CA-THA.
METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample was queried for primary THAs (2008 to 2017) which were categorized into RA-THA, CA-THA, and M-THA. Past and projected use, demographic characteristics distribution, income, type of insurance, location, and healthcare setting were compared among the three cohorts. In-hospital complications, LOS, discharge disposition, and in-hospital costs were compared between propensity score-matched cohorts of M-THA versus RA-THA and M-THA versus CA-THA to adjust for baseline characteristics and comorbidities.
RESULTS: RA-THA and CA-THA did not exhibit any clinically meaningful reduction in mean LOS (RA-THA 2.2 days (SD 1.4) vs 2.3 days (SD 1.8); p < 0.001, and CA-THA 2.5 days (SD 1.9) vs 2.7 days (SD 2.3); p < 0.001, respectively) compared to their respective propensity score-matched M-THA cohorts. RA-THA, but not CA-THA, had similar non-home discharge rates to M-THA (RA-THA 17.4% vs 18.5%; p = 0.205, and 18.7% vs 24.9%; p < 0.001, respectively). Implant-related mechanical complications were lower in RA-THA (RA-THA 0.5% vs M-THA 3.1%; p < 0.001, and CA-THA 1.2% vs M-THA 2.2%; p < 0.001), which was associated with a significantly lower in-hospital dislocation (RA-THA 0.1% vs M-THA 0.8%; p < 0.001). Both RA-THA and CA-THA demonstrated higher mean higher index in-hospital costs (RA-THA $18,416 (SD $8,048) vs M-THA $17,266 (SD $8,396); p < 0.001, and CA-THA $20,295 (SD $8,975) vs M-THA $18,624 (SD $9,226); p < 0.001, respectively). Projections indicate that 23.9% and 3.2% of all THAs conducted in 2025 will be robotic arm- and computer-assisted, respectively. Projections indicated that RA-THA use may overtake M-THA by 2028 (48.3%) and reach 65.8% of all THAs by 2030.
CONCLUSION: Technology-assisted THA, particularly RA-THA, may provide value by lowering in-hospital early dislocation rates and and other in-hospital metrics compared to M-THA. Higher index-procedure and hospital costs warrant further comprehensive cost analyses to determine the true added value of RA-THA in the episode of care, particularly since we project that one in four THAs in 2025 and two in three THA by 2030 will use RA-THA technology.

pub.1125818133,A Novel Vector-Based Computer Tomography Alignment Measurement Protocol for Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"INTRODUCTION: Component position and overall limb alignment following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have been shown to influence implant survivorships and clinical outcomes. While most surgeons utilize standard x-ray imaging for preoperative joint assessments, computer tomography scans (CT), coupled with automated digital analyses have been shown to provide additional surgical and clinical benefits. However, to date, a postoperative CT measurement protocol has not been reported for robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA). Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to assess the validity of a novel, vector-based CT alignment measurement protocol. Specifically, we compared: 1) final versus planned component alignment and placement; 2) inter-observer reliability; and 3) intra-observer reliability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT-based technique utilized mathematical models to calculate prosthetic alignments from anatomical landmarks. To assess the models, 30 CT scans from multiple centers were collected on RATKA patients at six weeks postoperatively and analyzed using the proposed technique. Results were compared to the surgeons' preoperative plans for accuracy. Analyses were performed on the same protocol to determine inter-observer reliability. These analyses were repeated 30 days later to assess for intra-observer variability.
RESULTS: The mean measurement errors compared between final versus planned component positions and alignments were: 0.79±1.48o varus in overall limb alignment (p=0.004); 0.34±1.20o varus (p=0.121); and 0.35±1.15o varus (p=0.17) for femoral and tibial varus/valgus alignment; 0.71±1.77o flexion (p=0.18) and 0.38±1.88o posterior (p=0.41) for femoral flexion and tibial slope. There was strong reproducibility between observers. Correlation analyses showed low variabilities, with slopes between 0.8 to 1.0 and all R>0.8.
CONCLUSION: As robotic technologies become widely available in orthopaedic surgery, it is critical to have tools, such as CT protocols, which can quantitatively verify operative decisions concerning limb alignment and component placement. This study described a novel, vector-based, CT alignment measurement protocol for RATKA which has not previously been defined. The method demonstrated excellent accuracy to plan and low intra- and inter-observer variability. This is a valuable analysis tool for RATKA studies where component accuracy is assessed using postoperative CT images."
pub.1123724057,How will digitalisation affect patient treatment in arthroplasty? Part I: Intraoperative aspects,"We cannot deny that technology has become an important part of our daily life, not only in automobiles, houses or cellphones but also in hospitals. In the OR, in particular for knee arthroplasty, image free navigation has proven to reduce the number of outliers and by that the revision rate in younger patients. Over the last years robotics has again been introduced into the operation theatres. However, in their present version they add time and costs, but only minimal benefits to the procedure. Therefore, future robots should be faster and instrumentation free. Beside those more economical aspects, the goal of this digital technology must be an improvement in clinical outcome. To achieve that, additional steps for analyzing the pre-, and intra-OP quantitative data is key. With the use of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning a data based algorithm will probably be developed, which helps the surgeon to integrate all parameters into his individual cutting and releasing plan for each patient. Digital data therefore, might become the key to enable the surgeon to treat patients more individual and by that hopefully deliver better outcome."
pub.1139745688,Custom TKA: what to expect and where do we stand today?,"IntroductionThe concept of custom total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is explored with specific attention to current limitations. Arguments in favor of custom TKA are the anatomic and functional variability we encounter in our patients. The biggest conceptual challenge is to marry the need for correction of deformity with the ambition to stay as close as possible to original anatomy.Materials and methodsA Pubmed search was performed on the following terms: ‘patient specific implant’, ‘custom made implant’, ‘custom implant’, ‘total knee arthroplasty’ and ‘total knee replacement’. These studies were evaluated for the following intra- and post-operative variables: blood loss, hospital stay, range of motion, patient-reported outcome measures, limb and implant alignment, implant fit, tibiofemoral kinematics, complications and revision rates.ResultsOut of 1117 studies found with the initial search, a total of 17 articles were included in the final analysis. In eight out of the 17 (47%) studies, either the research was commercially funded or one of the authors had a conflict of interest related to the work. 11 out of 17 studies included a control group in their study setup. Of those studies that included a control group, both superior and inferior results compared to off-the-shelf implants have been reported.ConclusionCustom knee implants are the next step in matching the geometric features of the prosthesis to the anatomy of the individual patient, after several iterations that added asymmetry and sizes in the existing implants. Several companies have proven that it is feasible to produce these implants in a safe way. An overview of current literature reveals the lack of strong methodological studies that prove the value of this new technology. Custom knee implants face conceptual and practical difficulties, some of which might be overcome with technological advances, such as robotics and artificial intelligence."
pub.1079099496,"Leg-Length Discrepancy After Total Hip Arthroplasty: Comparison of Robot-Assisted Posterior, Fluoroscopy-Guided Anterior, and Conventional Posterior Approaches.","Total hip arthroplasty (THA) effectively provides adequate pain relief and good long-term outcomes in patients with hip osteoarthritis. However, leg-length discrepancy (LLD) remains the most common cause of patient dissatisfaction and malpractice litigation in hip arthroplasty. We conducted a study to compare LLD in patients who underwent THA performed with a robot-assisted posterior approach (RTHA), a fluoroscopy-guided anterior approach (ATHA), or a conventional posterior approach (PTHA). We reviewed all RTHA, ATHA, and PTHA cases performed by Dr. Domb between September 2008 and December 2012. Patients included in the study had a primary diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis and proper postoperative anteroposterior pelvis radiographs available. Two blinded observers calibrated and measured all radiographs twice. After exclusions, 67 RTHA, 29 ATHA, and 59 PTHA cases remained in the study. There were strong interobserver and intraobserver correlations for all LLD measurements (r > 0.9; P < .001). Mean (SD) LLD was 2.7 (1.8) mm (95% CI, 2.3-3.2) in the RTHA group, 1.8 (1.6) mm (95% CI, 1.2-2.4) in the ATHA group, and 1.9 (1.6) mm (95% CI, 1.5-2.4) in the PTHA group (P = .01). When LLD of more than 3 mm was set as an outlier, percentage of outliers was 37.3% (RTHA), 17.2% (ATHA), and 22% (PTHA) (P = .06-.78). When LLD of more than 5 mm was set as an outlier, percentage of outliers was 10.4% (RTHA), 6.9% (ATHA), and 8.5% (PTHA) (P = .72 to > .99). No patient in any group had LLD of 10 mm or more. RTHA, ATHA, and PTHA did not differ in obtaining minimal LLD. All 3 techniques are effective in achieving accuracy in LLD. "
pub.1141528093,Robotic-arm assisted THA can achieve precise cup positioning in developmental dysplasia of the hip,"AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of implant placement with robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).
METHODS: The study analyzed a consecutive series of 69 patients who underwent robotic-arm assisted THA between September 2018 and December 2019. Of these, 30 patients had DDH and were classified according to the Crowe type. Acetabular component alignment and 3D positions were measured using pre- and postoperative CT data. The absolute differences of cup alignment and 3D position were compared between DDH and non-DDH patients. Moreover, these differences were analyzed in relation to the severity of DDH. The discrepancy of leg length and combined offset compared with contralateral hip were measured.
RESULTS: The mean values of absolute differences (postoperative CT-preoperative plan) were 1.7° (standard deviation (SD) 2.0) (inclination) and 2.5° (SD 2.1°) (anteversion) in DDH patients, and no significant differences were found between non-DDH and DDH patients. The mean absolute differences for 3D cup position were 1.1 mm (SD 1.0) (coronal plane) and 1.2 mm (SD 2.1) (axial plane) in DDH patients, and no significant differences were found between two groups. No significant difference was found either in cup alignment between postoperative CT and navigation record after cup screws or in the severity of DDH. Excellent restoration of leg length and combined offset were achieved in both groups.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that robotic-assisted THA may achieve precise cup positioning in DDH patients, and may be useful in those with severe DDH. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint Res</i> 2021;10(10):629-638."
pub.1130726113,Intraoperative Bestimmung der Beckenkippung und Pfannenposition in der Hüftendoprothetik – Relevanz der Navigation und Robotik,"The optimal 3D positioning of the prosthesis components is of great importance for the stability and function of a total hip endoprosthesis. Pelvic tilt has a particular influence on the position of the implant. In order to use intraoperatively the knowledge on pelvic kinematics gained through preoperative imaging procedures and movement analyses, “image-based” and “image-free” robotic and navigation procedures are available. With the “image-based” procedures, a 3D CT scan serves as the surgeon’s basis for operative planning. The “image-free” procedures are based on the principles of stereotaxy. In the future, information about static and dynamic pelvic tilt will be conntected with navigation and robotic systems for total hip arthroplasty. Along with intraoperative data a patientindividual optimized implant position can be achieved."
pub.1129784957,Higher satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty using restricted inverse kinematic alignment compared to adjusted mechanical alignment,"PURPOSE: Various alignment philosophies for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have been described, all striving to achieve excellent long-term implant survival and good functional outcomes. In recent years, in search of higher functionality and patient satisfaction, a shift towards more tailored and patient-specific alignment is seen. The purpose of this study was to describe a restricted 'inverse kinematic alignment' (iKA) technique, and to compare clinical outcomes of patients that underwent robotic-assisted TKA performed by restricted iKA vs. adjusted mechanical alignment (aMA).
METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of a consecutive series of patients that received robotic-assisted TKA with restricted iKA (n = 40) and with aMA (n = 40). Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and satisfaction on a visual analogue scale (VAS) were collected at a follow-up of 12 months. Clinical outcomes were assessed according to patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) thresholds, and uni- and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine associations of OKS and satisfaction with six variables (age, sex, body mass index (BMI), preoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, preoperative OKS, alignment technique).
RESULTS: The restricted iKA and aMA techniques yielded comparable outcome scores (p = 0.069), with OKS, respectively, 44.6 ± 3.5 and 42.2 ± 6.3. VAS Satisfaction was better (p = 0.012) with restricted iKA (9.2 ± 0.8) compared to aMA (8.5 ± 1.3). The number of patients that achieved OKS and satisfaction PASS thresholds was significantly higher (p = 0.049 and p = 0.003, respectively) using restricted iKA (98% and 80%) compared to aMA (85% and 48%). Knees with preoperative varus deformity, achieved significantly (p = 0.025) better OKS using restricted iKA (45.4 ± 2.0) compared to aMA (41.4 ± 6.8). Multivariable analyses confirmed better OKS (β = 3.1; p = 0.007) and satisfaction (β = 0.73; p = 0.005) with restricted iKA.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that restricted iKA and aMA grant comparable clinical outcomes at 12-month follow-up, though a greater proportion of knees operated by restricted iKA achieved the PASS thresholds for OKS and satisfaction. Notably. in knees with preoperative varus deformity, restricted iKA yielded significantly better OKS and satisfaction than aMA.

pub.1090368562,Prior Arthroscopy Leads to Inferior Outcomes in Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Match-Controlled Study,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common reoperations after hip arthroscopy. Although arthroscopy causes changes in the hip joint and the surrounding soft tissues that can make THA more challenging, previous reports on arthroscopy before THA have not demonstrated any significant effect on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Patients who underwent a THA following an ipsilateral hip arthroscopy were matched to a control group of THA patients with no history of ipsilateral hip surgery. Matching criteria were age within 5 years, sex, body mass index within 5, surgical approach, and robotic assistance. Harris Hip Score, Forgotten Joint Score-12, visual analog scale score, satisfaction, and postoperative complication and reoperation rates were compared at minimum 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Thirty-five THA after arthroscopy patients were successfully matched to control patients. There were no significant differences in demographics between study groups. The THA after arthroscopy group had significantly lower Harris Hip Score, Forgotten Joint Score-12, and satisfaction at latest follow-up. They had higher visual analog scale score and complication rate in differences that closely approached significance. There was no significant difference in reoperation rate.
CONCLUSION: A prior hip arthroscopy may adversely affect the clinical outcomes of THA. This potential risk should be considered when assessing the candidacy of a patient for hip arthroscopy."
pub.1068244278,Isometric performance following total hip arthroplasty and rehabilitation,"We compared differences in isometric strength between older adults who have undergone elective unilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA) and completed rehabilitation with a population of community-dwelling older adults who have not had THA. The study was a cross-sectional design, and 22 unilateral THA subjects and 38 community-dwelling older adults participated. THA subjects received on average 13 outpatient or home-based physical therapy sessions before evaluation. THA subjects were evaluated 4 to 5 months postsurgery. We assessed isometric muscle strength by measuring peak hip torque per body weight with a robotic dynamometer during abduction, flexion, and extension. No significant performance differences were observed between operated and nonoperated hips of THA subjects. THA subject operated and nonoperated hips generated significantly less peak torque per body weight during flexion (p = 0.03) compared with community-dwelling older adult hips (THA subject operated hips = 6.96 ft-lb/lb, THA subject nonoperated hips = 8.26 ft-lb/lb, community-dwelling older adult hips = 11.56 ft-lb/lb). No significant differences were observed between THA subjects and community-dwelling older adults during hip extension (p = 0.55) or abduction (p = 0.17). At 4 to 5 months postsurgery, THA subjects were not at the same level of biomechanical performance as community-dwelling older adults. Significant strength deficits were found in THA subject operated versus nonoperated hips during isometric flexion. Additional or modified physical therapy that targets the hip flexors is recommended after THA."
pub.1033913444,The dimensional accuracy for preparation of the femoral cavity in HIP arthroplasty,Introduction: The aim of the study was to determine the precision of the preparation of the femoral cavity in cementless hip arthroplasty. We compared the bone–prosthesis interface after manual- and robot-assisted implantation of the stems. Material and methods: After plastination the specimens were cut to slices of 2.5 mm and documented by microradiography. The interface between prosthesis and bone was measured digitally with a specially designed software. Results: The manually implanted prostheses showed an average full-contact area of 60% and an average area of gaps of 40% with an average height of 0.8 mm. The robot-assisted implanted stems had a significantly higher bone–prosthesis interface area of 93% and gap areas of less than 0.2 mm depth. Destructions of the spongeous bone were seen with the manually implanted stems but not after robot-assisted implantations. There was one stem fracture during the manual preparation of a stem. Microradiographic examination showed microfractures in the region of the lesser trochanter in two femora after robot-assisted implantation Conclusion: The robot-assisted technique highly increased the fitting area at the bone–prosthesis interface. The main reason for the fractures might be the absence of a robot done marker for the ideal implantation height with the applied type of prosthesis.
pub.1017781975,Can technology improve alignment during knee arthroplasty,"Component malalignment remains a concern in total knee arthroplasty (TKA); therefore, a series of technologies have been developed to improve alignment. The authors conducted a systematic review to compare computer-assisted navigation with conventional instrumentation, and assess the current evidence for patient-matched instrumentation and robot-assisted implantation. An extensive search of the PubMed database for relevant meta-analyses, systematic reviews and original articles was performed, with each study scrutinised by two reviewers. Data on study characteristics and outcomes were extracted from each study and compared. In total 30 studies were included: 10 meta-analyses comparing computer-assisted navigation and conventional instrumentation, 13 studies examining patient-matched instrumentation, and seven investigating robot-assisted implantation. Computer-assisted navigation showed significant and reproducible improvements in mechanical alignment over conventional instrumentation. Patient-matched instrumentation appeared to achieve a high degree of mechanical alignment, although the majority of studies were of poor quality. The data for robot-assisted surgery was less indicative. Computer-assisted navigation improves alignment during TKA over conventional instrumentation. For patient-matched instrumentation and robot-assisted implantation, alignment benefits have not been reliably demonstrated. For all three technologies, clinical benefits cannot currently be assumed, and further studies are required. Although current technologies to improve alignment during TKA appear to result in intra-operative benefits, their clinical impact remains unclear, and surgeons should take this into account when considering their adoption."
pub.1020175018,A new approach to implant alignment and ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty focussing on joint loads,"Preservation and recovery of the mechanical leg axis as well as good rotational alignment of the prosthesis components and well-balanced ligaments are essential for the longevity of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In the framework of the OrthoMIT project, the genALIGN system, a new navigated implantation approach based on intra-operative force-torque measurements, has been developed. With this system, optical or magnetic position tracking as well as any fixation of invasive rigid bodies are no longer necessary. For the alignment of the femoral component along the mechanical axis, a sensor-integrated instrument measures the torques resulting from the deviation between the instrument's axis and the mechanical axis under manually applied axial compression load. When both axes are coaxial, the resulting torques equal zero, and the tool axis can be fixed with respect to the bone. For ligament balancing and rotational alignment of the femoral component, the genALIGN system comprises a sensor-integrated tibial trial inlay measuring the amplitude and application points of the forces transferred between femur and tibia. Hereby, the impact of ligament tensions on knee joint loads can be determined over the whole range of motion. First studies with the genALIGN system, including a comparison with an imageless navigation system, show the feasibility of the concept."
pub.1136006979,Überlegenheit von Navigation und Robotik in der Hüftendoprothetik: Fakt oder Mythos?,"Computer-assisted surgery represents a relatively novel treatment option in total hip arthroplasty, which has been supported by the technological progress over the latest decades. Navigation and robotics enable increasing the precision of cup positioning, as well as successful biomechanical restoration of leg length and offset. However, the intended target area is still one of debate in literature. Besides the learning curve, the use of navigation and robotics requires additional time and financial expense, which has not yet been addressed in the German healthcare system. This is one reason why computer-assisted surgery has not fully attained everyday routine. The number of comparative studies is limited, but the results are promising. However, if these surrogate measures will end in reduced revision rates or better outcome is unclear. Further prospective studies and register analysis might illuminate the potential benefit of navigation and robotics."
pub.1174757583,Ortho-digital dynamics: Exploration of advancing digital health technologies in musculoskeletal disease management,"Background: Musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, affecting billions of people worldwide, pose significant challenges to the healthcare system and require effective management models. The rapid development of digital healthcare technologies (DHTs) has revolutionized the healthcare industry. DHT-based interventions have shown promising clinical benefits in managing MSK disorders, alleviating pain, and improving functional impairment. There is, however, no bibliometric analysis of the overall trends on this topic.
Methods: We extracted all relevant publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database until April 30, 2023. We performed bibliometric analysis and visualization using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R software. Annual trends of publications, countries/regions distributions, funding agencies, institutions, co-cited journals, author contributions, references, core journals, and keywords and research hotspots were analyzed.
Results: A total of 6810 papers were enrolled in this study. Publications have increased drastically from 16 in 1995 to 1198 in 2022, with 4067 articles published in the last five years. In all, 53 countries contributed with publications to this research area. The United States, the United Kingdom, and China were the most productive countries. Harvard University was the most contributing institution. Regarding keywords, research focuses include artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, telemedicine, rehabilitation, and robotics.
Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the adoption of DHTs, highlighting the need for remote care options. The analysis reveals the positive impact of DHTs on improving physician productivity, enhancing patient care and quality of life, reducing healthcare expenditures, and predicting outcomes. DHTs are a hot topic of research not only in the clinical field but also in the multidisciplinary intersection of rehabilitation, nursing, education, social and economic fields. The analysis identifies four promising hotspots in the integration of DHTs in MSK pain management, biomechanics assessment, MSK diagnosis and prediction, and robotics and tele-rehabilitation in arthroplasty care."
pub.1168412806,Navigation und Robotik – status präsens und zukünftige Implikationen,"IntroductionBoth navigation systems and robotics enable greater precision in the implantation of an artificial knee joint. However, they do not improve clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that although implantation of a total knee arthroplasty results in reconstruction of the alignment in the coronal plane, the variable rotational tibial and variable translational femoral and tibial component positioning lead to a change in the remaining alignment parameters of the lower extremity. However, these parameters could be determined using a navigation system or robot and could represent future implications for these systems.MethodsThe kinematics and the position between femur and tibia before and after implantation of a total knee arthroplasty were determined using a navigation system in nine healthy knee joints of Thiel-fixed whole-body cadavers.ResultsAfter arthroplasty, there was no change in the natural coronal alignment. In extension and the early degrees of flexion, the rotational position of the femur relative to the tibia was altered. This also led to a change in the positioning of the medial and lateral epicondyle in relation to the tibia; while both epicondyles were positioned more laterally in relation to the tibia after arthroplasty, the lateral epicondyle was significantly more lateral in relation to the tibia up to 20° of flexion.DiscussionFollowing arthroplasty of a knee joint using the established technique, a good reconstruction of the coronal alignment was achieved with simultaneous changes in the alignment in both the rotational and translational directions between the femur and tibia. Using navigation as well as robotics, we would be able to quantify all alignment parameters and could achieve an alignment of the components or a reconstruction of the overall alignment in all six degrees of freedom. We might also be able to achieve a clinical advantage or increase the service life even further."
pub.1120747532,Robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for patients with isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis is cost-effective: a markov decision analysis.,"AIMS: The primary aim of the study was to perform an analysis to identify the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (rUKA) relative to manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for patients with isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Secondary aims were to assess how case volume and length of hospital stay influenced the relative cost per QALY.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov decision analysis was performed, using known parameters for costs, outcomes, implant survival, and mortality, to assess the cost-effectiveness of rUKA relative to manual TKA and UKA for patients with isolated medial compartment OA of the knee with a mean age of 65 years. The influence of case volume and shorter hospital stay were assessed.
RESULTS: Using a model with an annual case volume of 100 patients, the cost per QALY of rUKA was £1395 and £1170 relative to TKA and UKA, respectively. The cost per QALY was influenced by case volume: a low-volume centre performing ten cases per year would achieve a cost per QALY of £7170 and £8604 relative to TKA and UKA. For a high-volume centre performing 200 rUKAs per year with a mean two-day length of stay, the cost per QALY would be £648; if performed as day-cases, the cost would be reduced to £364 relative to TKA. For a high-volume centre performing 200 rUKAs per year with a shorter length of stay of one day relative to manual UKA, the cost per QALY would be £574.
CONCLUSION: rUKA is a cost-effective alternative to manual TKA and UKA for patients with isolated medial compartment OA of the knee. The cost per QALY of rUKA decreased with reducing length of hospital stay and with increasing case volume, compared with TKA and UKA. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2019;101-B:1063-1070."
pub.1134297294,"Neue Technologien (Robotik, „custom made“) in der unikondylären Knieendoprothetik – Contra","BackgroundNumerous long-term results for both medial and lateral unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) demonstrate that UKA is a reliable and successful treatment for isolated anteromedial or lateral osteoarthritis of the knee when the correct indications are used. The relationship between operation volume and implant performance has clearly been established from recent studies and registry data. The use of novel technologies allows for an improvement in the accuracy of implant positioning with fewer outliers. However, evidence-based target zones for the positioning of available implants have not been sufficiently established.Individual endoprostheticsCurrent data does not support the routine use of patient-specific instruments or custom-made implants.RoboticsRobot-assisted procedures must be interpreted as a very promising approach for the future.

pub.1141915450,[Robot-assisted joint arthroplasty-An emerging technology of the present and the future].,"OBJECTIVE: To review and evaluate the research progress of the robot-assisted joint arthroplasty.
METHODS: The domestic and foreign related research literature on robot-assisted joint arthroplasty was extensively consulted. The advantages, disadvantages, effectiveness, and future prospects were mainly reviewed and summarized.
RESULTS: The widely recognized advantages of robot-assisted joint arthroplasty are digital and intelligent preoperative planning, accurate intraoperative prosthesis implantation, and quantitative soft tissue balance, as well as good postoperative imaging prosthesis position and alignment. However, the advantages of effectiveness are still controversial. The main disadvantages of robot-assisted joint arthroplasty are the high price of the robot system, the prolonged operation time, and the increased radioactive damage of the imaging-dependent system.
CONCLUSION: Compared to traditional arthroplasty, robot-assisted joint arthroplasty can improve the accuracy of the prosthesis position and assist in the quantitative assessment of soft tissue tension, and the repeatability rate is high. In the future, further research is needed to evaluate the clinical function and survival rate of the prosthesis, as well as to optimize the robot system."

In this study, a method to automatically track the soft tissue envelope of a minimally invasive hip approach in a cadaver study is described.
METHODS: An algorithm for the TOF camera was developed and 30 measurements on 8 surgical situs (direct anterior approach) were carried out. The results were compared to a manual measurement of the soft tissue envelope.
RESULTS: The TOF camera showed an overall recognition rate of the soft tissue envelope of 75%. On comparing the results from the algorithm with the manual measurements, a significant difference was found (P > .005).
CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, we have presented a method for automatically recognizing the soft tissue envelope of the surgical field in a real-time application. Further improvements could result in a robotic navigation device for minimally invasive hip surgery."
pub.1170114015,Three-dimensional-based native alignment phenotype classification system: Description for use in planning for deformities during total knee arthroplasty,"Introduction: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a complex surgical procedure that traditionally relies on two-dimensional radiographs for pre-operative planning. These radiographs may not capture the intricate details of individual knee anatomy, potentially limiting the precision of surgical interventions. With advancements in imaging technology, there is an opportunity to refine TKA outcomes. This study introduces the Native Alignment Phenotype classification system that is based on pre-operative 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans, aiming to provide a more detailed understanding of knee deformities and their influence on characterizing knee osteoarthritis and planning for TKA procedures.
Methods: There were 1406 pre-operative non-weight-bearing CT scans analyzed by a single surgeon experienced with robotically-assisted total knee arthroplasties. These scans were converted into three-dimensional models, focusing on the coronal and sagittal planes. Intraoperatively, the robotic system was used to capture native coronal and sagittal deformities for each patient. These values were captured with the patient's leg held in a non-stress, extension pose. A new classification system, 'The Native Alignment Phenotype', was developed to categorize the specific differences between individual knees.
Results: There were four primary knee malalignments identified: varus deformity; valgus deformity; and two deformities in the sagittal plane. These malalignments were further categorized based on the degrees of deviation, creating groups with 5° coronal and sagittal ranges. A total of 77 phenotypic alignment patterns were found based on the analyzed cohort. In the coronal plane, varus HKA deformity between 6 and 10° was the most common, with 36.9% of the cases, followed by varus HKA alignment, which was between 0 and 5°, representing 34.3% of the cases. In the sagittal plane, neutral and flexion contracture deformities between 0 and 5° were the most common, with 32.6% of the cases, followed by a fixed flexion contracture alignment, which was between 6 and 10°, representing 28.7% of the cases. When combining coronal and sagittal planes, the most common alignment was the varus between 0 and 5° with a flexion contracture between 0 and 5° (12.5% of cases), closely followed by the varus between 6 and 10° with a flexion contracture between 6 and 10° (12.4% of cases).
Conclusion: The Native Alignment Phenotype classification system offers a nuanced understanding of knee deformities based on three-dimensional (CT scan) assessments, potentially leading to improved surgical outcomes in TKA. By leveraging the detailed data from the CT scans, this system provides a more comprehensive view of the knee's anatomy, emphasizing the importance of individualized, data-driven approaches in knee surgery."
pub.1143751349,Total Knee Arthroplasty Hospital Costs by Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing: Robotic vs Conventional,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) represents a major national health expenditure. The last decade has seen a surge in robotic-assisted TKA (roTKA); however, literature on the costs of roTKA as compared to conventional TKA (cTKA) is limited. The purpose of this study was to assess the costs associated with roTKA as compared to cTKA.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort cost-analysis study of patients undergoing primary, elective roTKA or cTKA from July 2020 to March 2021. Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) was used to determine granular costs. Patient demographics, medical/surgical details, and costs were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 2058 TKAs were analyzed (1795 cTKAs and 263 roTKAs). roTKA patients were more often male (50.2% vs 42.3%; <i>P</i> = .016), and discharged home (98.5% vs 93.7%; <i>P</i> = .017), and had longer operating room (OR) time (144.6 vs 130.9 minutes; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001), and lower length of stay (LOS) (1.8 vs 2.1 days; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001). roTKA costs were 2.17× greater for supplies excluding implant (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001), 1.18× for total supplies (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001), 1.12× for OR personnel (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001), and 1.05× for total personnel (<i>P</i> = .0001). Implant costs were similar (<i>P</i> = .076), but 0.98× cheaper for post-anesthesia care unit personnel (<i>P</i> = .018) and 0.84× for inpatient personnel (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001). Overall hospital costs for roTKA were 1.10× more than cTKA (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001).
CONCLUSION: roTKA had higher total hospital costs than cTKA. Despite a lower LOS, the longer OR time with higher supply and personnel costs resulted in a costlier procedure. Understanding the costs of roTKA is essential when considering the value (ie, outcomes per dollars spent) of this modern technology."
pub.1131503659,Biomechanical evaluation of total ankle arthroplasty. Part II: Influence of loading and fixation design on tibial bone–implant interaction,"Finite element (FE) models to evaluate the burden placed on the interaction between total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) implants and the bone often rely on peak axial forces. However, the loading environment of the ankle is complex, and it is unclear whether peak axial forces represent a challenging scenario for the interaction between the implant and the bone. Our goal was to determine how the loads and the design of the fixation of the tibial component of TAA impact the interaction between the implant and the bone. To this end, we developed a framework that integrated robotic cadaveric simulations to determine the ankle kinematics, musculoskeletal models to determine the ankle joint loads, and FE models to evaluate the interaction between TAA and the bone. We compared the bone-implant micromotion and the risk of bone failure of three common fixation designs for the tibial component of TAA: spikes, a stem, and a keel. We found that the most critical conditions for the interaction between the implant and the bone were dependent on the specimen and the fixation design, but always involved submaximal forces and large moments. We also found that while the fixation design influenced the distribution and the peak value of bone-implant micromotion, the amount of bone at risk of failure was specimen dependent. To account for the most critical conditions for the interaction between the implant and the bone, our results support simulating multiple specimens under complex loading profiles that include multiaxial moments and span entire activity cycles."
pub.1053494192,The superficial medial collateral ligament is the primary medial restraint to knee laxity after cruciate‐retaining or posterior‐stabilised total knee arthroplasty: effects of implant type and partial release,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to quantify the contributions of medial soft tissues to stability following cruciate-retaining (CR) or posterior-stabilised (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: Using a robotic system, eight cadaveric knees were subjected to ±90-N anterior-posterior force, ±5-Nm internal-external and ±8-Nm varus-valgus torques at various flexion angles. The knees were tested intact and then with CR and PS implants, and successive cuts of the deep and superficial medial collateral ligaments (dMCL, sMCL) and posteromedial capsule (PMC) quantified the percentage contributions of each structure to restraining the applied loads.
RESULTS: In implanted knees, the sMCL restrained valgus rotation (62 % across flexion angles), anterior-posterior drawer (24 and 10 %, respectively) and internal-external rotation (22 and 37 %). Changing from CR TKA to PS TKA increased the load on the sMCL when resisting valgus loads. The dMCL restrained 11 % of external and 13 % of valgus rotations, and the PMC was significant at low flexion angles.
CONCLUSIONS: This work has shown that medial release in the varus knee should be minimised, as it may inadvertently result in a combined laxity pattern. There is increasing interest in preserving constitutional varus in TKA, and this work argues for preservation of the sMCL to afford the surgeon consistent restraint and maintain a balanced knee for the patient."
pub.1057440738,"Klinisches Outcome nach Roboter-assistierter versus konventionell implantierter Hüftendoprothetik: Prospektive, kontrollierte Untersuchung von 71 Patienten","AIM: Robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty remains controversial, since wider exposure of the proximal femur and placement of the leg in maximal hip adduction and external rotation using a rigid leg-holder apparatus may impair significantly the hip abductors. Consequently, it is the purpose of this study to analyse and report both clinical outcome and hip abductor function following robotic assisted versus conventional total hip arthroplasty.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 36 robotic-assisted (CASPAR, Orto-Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) and 35 conventional cementless total hip arthroplasties were followed on average for 18 months regarding incidence of complications, Harris hip score, the scoring system according to Merle d'Aubigné and Postel, hip abductor function (using a spring-balance), and incidence of Trendelenburg's sign (according to the Kuhfuss-classification). Statistical analysis was performed in case of continuous data using the t test and the Mann-Whitney test, respectively, and in case of categorical data using Fisher's exact test and the chi-squared test, respectively. The level of significance was set as p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Average duration of surgery (CASPAR: 100.6 min; conventional: 51.5 min; p < 0.0001) as well as average loss of haemoglobin (CASPAR: 4.5 mg/dL; conventional: 3.3 mg/dL; p = 0.0002) differed significantly, whereas the incidence of complications (CASPAR: two dislocations, one sciatic paresis, one deep infection; conventional: one dislocation, two fissures), revision rate (CASPAR: 5.6 %; conventional: 2.9 %), and incidence of heterotopic ossifications (CASPAR: 30.6 %; conventional: 17.1 %) was comparable following both procedures (p > 0.05). Improvement of the Harris hip score also was comparable in both groups (CASPAR: 40.9 to 86.1 points; conventional: 39.5 to 88.0 points; p = 0.21), whereas improvement of the score according to Merle d'Aubigné and Postel was significantly greater following the manual procedure (CASPAR: 10.1 to 16.0 points; conventional: 8.3 to 16.6 points; p < 0.0001). Differences between the two groups were also significant regarding hip abductor function (CASPAR: 76.1 %; conventional: 93.8 % of the contralateral hip; p < 0.0001) and incidence of Trendelenburg's sign (CASPAR: 61.1 %; conventional: 25.7 %; p = 0.0014).
CONCLUSION: The significant functional impairment following robotic assisted THA should be taken critically into consideration prior to initiating such procedure."
pub.1135841238,Machine Learning Algorithms Identify Optimal Sagittal Component Position in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Advanced technologies, like robotics, provide enhanced precision for implanting total knee arthroplasty (TKA) components; however, the optimal targets for implant position specifically in the sagittal plane do not exist. This study identified sagittal implant position which may predict improved outcomes using machine learning algorithms.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 1091 consecutive TKAs was performed. All TKAs were posterior cruciate ligament retaining or sacrificing with an anterior-lip (49.4%) or conforming bearing (50.6%) and performed with modern perioperative protocols. Preoperative and postoperative tibial slope and postoperative femoral component flexion were measured with standardized radiographic protocols. Analysis groups were categorized by satisfaction scores and the Knee Society Score question 'does this knee feel normal to you?' Machine learning algorithms were used to identify optimal sagittal alignment zones that predict superior satisfaction and knees ""always feeling normal"" scores.
RESULTS: Mean age and median body mass index were 66 years and 34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, with 67% being female. The machine learning model predicted an increased likelihood of being ""satisfied or very satisfied"" and a knee ""always feeling normal"" with a change in tibial slope closer to native (-2 to +2°) and femoral component flexion 0 to +7°. Worse outcomes were predicted with any femoral component extension, femoral component flexion beyond +10°, and adding or removing &gt;5° of native tibial slope.
CONCLUSION: Superior patient-reported outcomes were predicted with approximating native tibial slope and incorporating some femoral component flexion. Deviation from native tibial slope and excessive femoral flexion or any femoral component extension were predictive of worse outcomes.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level III."
pub.1092167264,Predicting the Feasibility of Correcting Mechanical Axis in Large Varus Deformities With Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Due to disappointing historical outcomes of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), Kozinn and Scott proposed strict selection criteria, including preoperative varus alignment of ≤15°, to improve the outcomes of UKA. No studies to date, however, have assessed the feasibility of correcting large preoperative varus deformities with UKA surgery. The study goals were therefore to (1) assess to what extent patients with large varus deformities could be corrected and (2) determine radiographic parameters to predict sufficient correction.
METHODS: In 200 consecutive robotic-arm assisted medial UKA patients with large preoperative varus deformities (≥7°), the mechanical axis angle (MAA) and joint line convergence angle (JLCA) were measured on hip-knee-ankle radiographs. It was assessed what number of patients were corrected to optimal (≤4°) and acceptable (5°-7°) alignment, and whether the feasibility of this correction could be predicted using an estimated MAA (eMAA, preoperative MAA-JLCA) using regression analyses.
RESULTS: Mean preoperative MAA was 10° of varus (range, 7°-18°), JLCA was 5° (1°-12°), postoperative MAA was 4° of varus (-3° to 8°), and correction was 6° (1°-14°). Postoperative optimal alignment was achieved in 62% and acceptable alignment in 36%. The eMAA was a significant predictor for optimal postoperative alignment, when corrected for age and gender (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with large preoperative varus deformities (7°-18°) could be considered candidates for medial UKA, as 98% was corrected to optimal or acceptable alignment, although cautious approach is needed in deformities >15°. Furthermore, it was noted that the feasibility of achieving optimal alignment could be predicted using the preoperative MAA, JLCA, and age."
pub.1169225889,Why Kinematic Alignment Makes Little Sense in Valgus Osteoarthritis of the Knee: A Narrative Review,"There is a debate about the best alignment strategies in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Mechanical alignment (MA) targets in combination with necessary soft tissue releases are the gold standard for TKA in end-stage valgus osteoarthritis. Some authors propagate kinematic alignment (KA) with the aim of restoring the patient's native alignment and minimizing the need for soft tissue releases. Our previous studies showed that MA with standardized soft tissue release produces reproducible results, and that the preoperative phenotype does not influence the results of patients with valgus osteoarthritis. These data suggest that there is no functional advantage to preserving valgus alignment in patients with valgus osteoarthritis. Many patients with valgus osteoarthritis present with a compromised medial collateral ligament and leaving the knee in valgus could increase the risk of secondary instability. The current literature supports MA TKA with soft tissue release as the gold standard. While using more sophisticated enabling technologies like robotic surgery might allow for aiming for very slight (1-2°) valgus alignment on the femoral side, any valgus alignment outside this range should be avoided. This review paper summarizes our current knowledge on the surgical techniques of TKA in patients with valgus osteoarthritis."
pub.1064454938,Application of surgical navigation to total hip arthroplasty,"Instability, impingement, and leg-length discrepancy are among the most common early problems following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Component positioning is the primary factor affecting all three of these issues and, therefore, all three can be potentially addressed using surgical navigation. While the advent of less invasive surgical techniques performed through smaller incisions has been shown to accelerate recovery, these techniques have also been associated with a further increase in the incidence of these three problems. Acetabular component malpositioning has been a particular problem with less invasive surgical techniques. Nonetheless, it is clear that maximal preservation of the soft tissues around the hip joint may accelerate recovery following surgery and confer greater hip joint stability. Accomplishing these goals without compromising component positioning is the single greatest potential advantage to the application of surgical navigation to THA. The present paper describes the general principles of surgical navigation in THA with respect to methods of tracking, methods of registration, the role of image-free and image-based navigation, and methods of measuring leg-length change during surgery. Further, a description is given of the clinical effect of combining surgical navigation with use of the superior capsulotomy technique of performing THA, which aims maximally to preserve the soft tissues surrounding the hip joint, allowing unrestricted progression of motion and weight-bearing following surgery. These methods have led to statistically significant acceleration of recovery, improvement in acetabular component positioning, and reductions in peri-operative surgical complications."
pub.1049416954,Kinematics of passive flexion following balanced and overstuffed fixed bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Progression of osteoarthritis in the unreplaced compartment following unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) may be hastened if kinematics is disturbed following UKA implantation. The purpose of this study was to analyze tibiofemoral kinematics of the balanced and overstuffed UKA in comparison with the native knee during passive flexion since this is a common clinical assessment.
METHODS: Ten cadaveric knees were mounted to robotic manipulator and underwent passive flexion from 0 to 90°. The kinematic pathway was recorded in the native knee and in the balanced, fixed bearing UKA. The medial UKA was implanted using a measured resection technique. Additionally, a one millimeter thicker tibial insert was installed to simulate the effects of overstuffing. Tibial kinematics in relation to the femur was recorded.
RESULTS: Following UKA the tibia was externally rotated, and in valgus relative to the native knee near extension. In flexion, installing the UKA caused the knee to be translated medially and anteriorly. The tibia was translated distally through the entire range of flexion after UKA. Compared to the balanced UKA, overstuffing further increased valgus at full extension and distal translation of the tibia from full extension to 45° flexion.
CONCLUSIONS: UKA implantation altered tibiofemoral kinematics in all planes. Differences were small; nevertheless, they may affect tibiofemoral loading patterns.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Alterations in tibiofemoral kinematics following UKA might have implications for prosthesis failure and progression of osteoarthritis in the remaining compartment. Overstuffing should be avoided as it further increased valgus and did not improve the remaining kinematics."
pub.1022484932,Computer navigation of the acetabular component in total hip arthroplasty: a narrative review,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common procedure for primary osteoarthritis, but increasing numbers are also being performed for other pathologies such as secondary arthritis, inflammatory arthropathies and trauma. Estimates suggest that around 8.5 million people in the UK are affected by joint pain secondary to arthritis and a rising ageing population has resulted in an increase in THA operations of around 4% per year over the last six years.Multiple studies have shown that THA provides improved quality of life scores, but there remains the burden of complications which account for 15% of £1bn NHS liability payouts. DaPalma et al analysed the financial impact of complications following THA and found the additional cost of a dislocation within six weeks of surgery is 342% of the primary cost.Following primary THA, complications may occur as a result of incorrect component positioning of the femoral stem, the acetabular cup or both. It is known that acetabular malposition may lead to increased rates of dislocation, impingement, edge-loading, polyethylene wear, pelvic osteolysis and prosthesis failure.Acetabular component positioning has been described as the single most important factor in dictating risk of dislocation following THA. Furthermore, instability and dislocation after primary THA is the most common single reason for revision surgery accounting for 22.5% of all revisions and 33% of acetabular revisions.We outline the currently available methods of acetabular navigation comparing freehand techniques with computer and robotic-assisted navigation of the acetabular component.

pub.1143638171,Comparison of the joint laxity of total knee arthroplasty evaluated by the distraction force and the varus–valgus force,"BACKGROUND: Component gap (CG) measurement help surgeons evaluate intraoperative soft-tissue balance. One technique is measuring the CG using tensioner devices with distraction force. Another is to evaluate the laxity under a varus-valgus force using navigation or robotics. The aim was to compare the JL evaluated by CG and varus-valgus force between the different types of total knee arthroplasties.
METHODS: Forty-three bi-cruciate stabilized (BCS) knees and 33 bi-cruciate retaining (BCR) knees were included. After bone resection and soft tissue balancing, the CG was measured and after the final implantation and capsule closure, JL under a maximum varus-valgus stress was recorded with navigation. JL evaluated by the CG (JLCG) was defined as CG minus selected thickness of the tibial component and JL under varus-valgus force (JLVV) was defined as difference between varus-valgus angles without stress and maximum varus-valgus angles under varus-valgus force. The evaluations were performed at flexions of 10°, 30°, 60° and 90°.
RESULTS: Although JLCGs of lateral compartment of BCS were larger than those of BCR, no difference was found between JLVVs of BCS and BCR. Although JLCGs of lateral compartment did not change at each knee flexion angle in both BCS and BCR, JLVVs of lateral compartment increased by 3° from 10° to 90° knee flexion.
CONCLUSION: JLVVs of BCS and BCR were equivalent, whereas BCS showed larger JLCGs of lateral compartment. JLVVs of lateral compartment increased by 3° in the range from 10° to 90° knee flexion whereas JLCGs remained stable."
pub.1142178886,A novel augmented reality-based surgical guidance system for total knee arthroplasty,"IntroductionMany of the functional complications that arise after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are caused by a non-optimal balance of the knee after surgery. Over the past 20 years, technology has been used in the Operating Room (OR) to help improve precision and balance. The results of Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) and robotic systems show improved accuracy regarding implant positioning but a relatively small improvement in patient-reported outcomes and implant survival compared to conventional TKA. Recently, Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a technology that could improve accuracy in orthopaedic surgery, providing a more efficient and cost-effective solution.Materials and methodsThis article describes a novel AR-based surgical guidance system that measures intra-operatively the effect of prosthesis alignment and positioning on soft tissue balance. The system is integrated in a pair of smart glasses and two small sensors and displays surgical targets directly in the field of view of the surgeon.ResultsThe system has been used in a limited number of cases. While the preliminary experience has been positive, clinical research is ongoing to confirm to confirm the performance of the system and the impact on clinical outcomes.ConclusionAugmented Reality can be a valuable tool to improve accuracy in TKA. The use of smart glasses and integrated sensors improves the efficiency of the procedure, particularly when coupled with single-use instrumentation. A novel protocol for soft tissue assessment allows for a 3-dimensional evaluation of the ligaments and a better measurement of the effect of tibial rotation."
pub.1037994067,Lateral soft‐tissue structures contribute to cruciate‐retaining total knee arthroplasty stability,"Little information is available to surgeons regarding how the lateral structures prevent instability in the replaced knee. The aim of this study was to quantify the lateral soft-tissue contributions to stability following cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty (CR TKA). Nine cadaveric knees were tested in a robotic system at full extension, 30°, 60°, and 90° flexion angles. In both native and CR implanted states, ±90 N anterior-posterior force, ±8 Nm varus-valgus, and ±5 Nm internal-external torque were applied. The anterolateral structures (ALS, including the iliotibial band), the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), the popliteus tendon complex (Pop T), and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) were transected and their relative contributions to stabilizing the applied loads were quantified. The LCL was found to be the primary restraint to varus laxity (an average 56% across all flexion angles), and was significant in internal-external rotational stability (28% and 26%, respectively) and anterior drawer (16%). The ALS restrained 25% of internal rotation, while the PCL was significant in posterior drawer only at 60° and 90° flexion. The Pop T was not found to be significant in any tests. Therefore, the LCL was confirmed as the major lateral structure in CR TKA stability throughout the arc of flexion and deficiency could present a complex rotational laxity that cannot be overcome by the other passive lateral structures or the PCL. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

pub.1072246195,The future of spine surgery: New horizons in the treatment of spinal disorders,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: As with any evolving surgical discipline, it is difficult to predict the future of the practice and science of spine surgery. In the last decade, there have been dramatic developments in both the techniques as well as the tools employed in the delivery of better outcomes to patients undergoing such surgery. In this article, we explore four specific areas in spine surgery: namely the role of minimally invasive spine surgery; motion preservation; robotic-aided surgery and neuro-navigation; and the use of biological substances to reduce the number of traditional and revision spine surgeries.
RESULTS: Minimally invasive spine surgery has flourished in the last decade with an increasing amount of surgeries being performed for a wide variety of degenerative, traumatic, and neoplastic processes. Particular progress in the development of a direct lateral approach as well as improvement of tubular retractors has been achieved. Improvements in motion preservation techniques have led to a significant number of patients achieving arthroplasty where fusion was the only option previously. Important caveats to the indications for arthroplasty are discussed. Both robotics and neuro-navigation have become further refined as tools to assist in spine surgery and have been demonstrated to increase accuracy in spinal instrumentation placement. There has much debate and refinement in the use of biologically active agents to aid and augment function in spine surgery. Biological agents targeted to the intervertebral disc space could increase function and halt degeneration in this anatomical region.
CONCLUSIONS: Great improvements have been achieved in developing better techniques and tools in spine surgery. It is envisaged that progress in the four focus areas discussed will lead to better outcomes and reduced burdens on the future of both our patients and the health care system."
pub.1113330810,Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Does Not Improve Long-Term Clinical and Radiologic Outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Whether robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) improves the accuracy of radiographic alignment leading to improved patient satisfaction and implant survivorship in the long term has thus far been inconclusive.
METHODS: We retrospectively compared the long-term clinical and radiological outcomes of 84 knees that had undergone robot-assisted TKA using ROBODOC vs 79 knees that had undergone conventional TKA. The mean duration of the follow-up period was 129.1 months (range: 108-147 months). Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Knee Society Score and 36-item Short Form Survey, as well as by assessing the range of motion, operation time, and complications. Radiologic outcomes were evaluated by assessing the hip-knee-ankle angle, coronal and sagittal alignments of the femoral and tibial components, and any radiologic abnormalities such as loosening or osteolysis.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups. The prevalence of an outlier for the hip-knee-ankle angle in the robot-assisted group was 10.7%, whereas it was 16.5% in the conventional group (P = .172). The other component alignments (α°, β°, γ°, δ°) revealed a tendency toward a lower rate of outliers in the robot-assisted group, but without statistical significance (P > .05). In addition, there was no significant difference in complications, including revision surgery, between both groups.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted TKA does not improve long-term clinical or radiologic outcomes compared with conventional TKA."
pub.1140972213,Trends of Utilization and 90-Day Complication Rates for Computer-Assisted Navigation and Robotic Assistance for Total Knee Arthroplasty in the United States From 2010 to 2018,"BACKGROUND: Computer-assisted navigation (CAN) and robotic assistance (RA) for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are gaining in popularity. The purpose of this study is to update the literature on United States technology-assisted TKA trends of national utilization, regional utilization, and 90-day complication rates requiring readmission.
METHODS: Patients who underwent primary, elective TKA between 2010 and 2018 were retrospectively identified in the PearlDiver All Payer Claims Database (PearlDiver Technologies Inc.). TKAs were classified as conventional, CAN, or RA based on International Classification of Diseases nineth or tenth revision and Current Procedural Technology codes. Annual rates and regional trends of each type of TKA were reported. Ninety-day complications requiring readmission for each group were captured. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify odds ratios (OR) for all-cause readmission based on TKA modality.
RESULTS: Of the 1,307,411 elective TKAs performed from 2010 to 2018, 92.8% were conventional, and 7.7% were technology-assisted (95.2% CAN and 4.9% RA). RA-TKA had the greatest increase in utilization (+2204%). The Western region had the highest utilization of technologies for TKA, while the Midwestern region had the lowest. Ninety-day postoperative complications requiring readmission were highest for conventional TKA and lowest for RA-TKA. RA-TKA (OR 0.68; 97.5% confidence interval 0.56-0.83, <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and CAN-TKA (OR 0.93; 97.5% confidence interval 0.88-0.97, <i>P</i> &lt; .05) had significantly lower odds of all-cause 90-day complications requiring readmission than conventional TKA.
CONCLUSION: Utilization of RA-TKA and CAN-TKA continues to rise across the United States. The use of these technologies is associated with a lower OR of readmission within 90 days postoperatively."
pub.1139594867,Relative Clinical Outcomes Comparing Manual and Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty at Minimum 1-Year Follow-up,"<i>Background</i>: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) demonstrates excellent durability using jig-based manual techniques (manual TKA [mTKA]), but significant rates of dissatisfaction remain. Modifications of mTKA techniques and TKA implant designs to improve outcomes have had minimal success. Studies comparing relative outcomes of mTKA and robotic-assisted TKA (raTKA) are limited. <i>Purpose</i>: This study sought to compare outcomes of mTKA and raTKA in patients at a single institution. <i>Methods</i>: We retrospectively reviewed all primary TKAs performed by 1 surgeon from 2015 to 2017. In all, 139 consecutive mTKAs (2015-2016) and 148 consecutive raTKAs (2016-2017) were included. No cases were excluded. Patient demographics, complications, readmission rates, and clinical and patient-reported outcomes were compared at a minimum of 1-year follow-up. A post hoc student <i>t</i> test and Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test were used for continuous and categorical data. <i>Results</i>: We found that mTKA patients compared with raTKA patients required significantly longer length of stay (LOS) (1.73 vs 1.18 days, respectively), greater morphine milligram equivalents consumption (89.6 vs 65.2, respectively), and increased physical therapy (PT) visits (13.0 vs 11.0, respectively) with increased 30-day readmission rates (4.3 vs 0.7%, respectively) that approached significance. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement and the University of California at Los Angeles activity score did not differ significantly comparing raTKA with mTKA patients at 1 year. There were no differences in complication rates. <i>Conclusion</i>: Significant early clinical benefits were noted with raTKA, including lower opioid requirements, shorter LOS, and fewer PT visits when compared with mTKA. A reduction in 30-day readmission rates was noted with raTKA that was not significant. Excellent clinical results with similar patient-reported outcomes were noted in both groups at 1-year follow-up. Further prospective investigations at longer follow-up intervals comparing these techniques are warranted."
pub.1126268485,In Vitro Kinematic Analysis of Single Axis Radius Posterior-Substituting Total Knee Arthroplasty,"This is an experimental study. As current posterior-substituting (PS) total knee arthroplasties have been reported to incompletely restore intrinsic joint biomechanics of the healthy knee, the recently designed single axis radius PS knee system was introduced to increase posterior femoral translation and promote ligament isometry. As there is a paucity of data available regarding its ability to replicate healthy knee biomechanics, this study aimed to assess joint and articular contact kinematics as well as ligament isometry of the contemporary single axis radius PS knee system. Implant kinematics were measured from 11 cadaveric knees using an in vitro robotic testing system. In addition, medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) forces were quantified under simulated functional loads during knee flexion for the contemporary PS knee system. Posterior femoral translation between the intact knee and the single axis radius PS knee system differed significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) at 60, 90, and 120 degrees of flexion. The LCL force at 60 degrees (9.06 ± 2.81 N) was significantly lower (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) than those at 30, 90, and 120 degrees of flexion, while MCL forces did not differ significantly throughout the range of tested flexion angles. The results from this study suggest that although the contemporary single axis radius PS knee system has the potential to mimic the intact knee kinematics under muscle loading during flexion extension due to its design features, single axis radius PS knee system did not fully replicate posterior femoral translation and ligament isometry of the healthy knee during knee flexion."
pub.1085122001,Variance in predicted cup size by 2-dimensional vs 3-dimensional computerized tomography–based templating in primary total hip arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative total hip arthroplasty templating can be performed with radiographs using acetate prints, digital viewing software, or with computed tomography (CT) images. Our hypothesis is that 3D templating is more precise and accurate with cup size prediction as compared to 2D templating with acetate prints and digital templating software.
METHODS: Data collected from 45 patients undergoing robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty compared cup sizes templated on acetate prints and OrthoView software to MAKOplasty software that uses CT scan. Kappa analysis determined strength of agreement between each templating modality and the final size used. <i>t</i> tests compared mean cup-size variance from the final size for each templating technique. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) determined reliability of digital and acetate planning by comparing predictions of the operating surgeon and a blinded adult reconstructive fellow.
RESULTS: The Kappa values for CT-guided, digital, and acetate templating with the final size was 0.974, 0.233, and 0.262, respectively. Both digital and acetate templating significantly overpredicted cup size, compared to CT-guided methods (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). There was no significant difference between digital and acetate templating (<i>P</i> = .117). Interclass correlation coefficient value for digital and acetate templating was 0.928 and 0.931, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided planning more accurately predicts hip implant cup size when compared to the significant overpredictions of digital and acetate templating. CT-guided templating may also lead to better outcomes due to bone stock preservation from a smaller and more accurate cup size predicted than that of digital and acetate predictions."
pub.1111024122,[Robotic surgery : the future of prosthetic surgery ?],"Indications for hip and knee replacement will continue to grow over the next few years. Robotic systems have been developed since the early 1990s in order to optimize implant positioning, to potentially improve clinical results, and to reduce perioperative morbidity. Currently, the different available systems certainly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of prosthetic components placement. However, the cost of robotic surgery remains very high. Early results in terms of implant survival, postoperative pain, mobility, and length of stay are encouraging. Long-term studies are needed to validate the clinical efficacy and to perform a medico-economic evaluation of robots in orthopedic surgery."
pub.1139760224,True Kinematic Alignment Is Applicable in 44% of Patients Applying Restrictive Indication Criteria—A Retrospective Analysis of 111 TKA Using Robotic Assistance,"INTRODUCTION: Image-based robotic assistance appears to be a promising tool for individualizing alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The patient-specific model of the knee enables a preoperative 3D planning of component position. Adjustments to the individual soft-tissue situation can be done intraoperatively. Based on this, we have established a standardized workflow to implement the idea of kinematic alignment (KA) for robotic-assisted TKA. In addition, we have defined limits for its use. If these limits are reached, we switch to a restricted KA (rKA). The aim of the study was to evaluate (1) in what percentage of patients a true KA or an rKA is applicable, (2) whether there were differences regarding knee phenotypes, and (3) what the differences of philosophies in terms of component position, joint stability, and early patient outcome were.
METHODS: The study included a retrospective analysis of 111 robotic-assisted primary TKAs. Based on preoperative long leg standing radiographs, the patients were categorized into a varus, valgus, or neutral subgroup. Initially, all patients were planned for KA TKA. When the defined safe zone had been exceeded, adjustments to an rKA were made. Intraoperatively, the alignment of the components and joint gaps were recorded by robotic software.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: With our indication for TKA and the defined boundaries, ""only"" 44% of the patients were suitable for a true KA with no adjustments or soft tissue releases. In the varus group, it was about 70%, whereas it was 0% in the valgus group and 25% in the neutral alignment group. Thus, significant differences with regard to knee morphotypes were evident. In the KA group, a more physiological knee balance reconstructing the trapezoidal flexion gap (+2 mm on average laterally) was seen as well as a closer reconstruction of the surface anatomy and joint line in all dimensions compared to rKA. This resulted in a higher improvement in the collected outcome scores in favor of KA in the very early postoperative phase."
pub.1169454320,Widening of tibial resection boundaries increases the rate of femoral component valgus and internal rotation in functionally aligned TKA,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of increasing the tibial boundaries in functional alignment on femoral component orientation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: A retrospective review of a database of robotic-assisted TKAs using a digital joint tensioning device was performed (BalanceBot®; Corin). A total of 692 TKAs with correctable deformity were included. Functional alignment with a tibia-first balancing technique was simulated by performing an anatomic tibial resection to recreate the native medial proximal tibial angle within certain boundaries (A, 87-90°; B, 86-90°; C, 84-92°), while accounting for wear. After balancing the knee, the resulting amount of femoral component outliers in the coronal and axial plane was calculated for each group and correlated to the coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) classification.
RESULTS: The proportion of knees with high femoral component varus (>96°) or valgus (<87°) alignment increased from 24.5% (n = 170) in group A to 26.5% (n = 183) in group B and 34.2% (n = 237) in group C (p < 0.05). Similarly, more knees with high femoral component external rotation (>6°) or internal rotation (>3°) were identified in group C (33.4%, n = 231) than in group B (23.7%, n = 164) and A (18.4%, n = 127) (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant (p < 0.01) overall increase in knees with both femoral component valgus <87° and internal rotation >3° from group A (4.0%, n = 28) to B (7.7%, n = 53) and C (15.8%, n = 109), with CPAK type I and II showing a 12.9- and 2.9-fold increase, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Extending the tibial boundaries when using functional alignment with a tibia-first balancing technique in TKA leads to a statistically significant higher percentage of knees with a valgus lateral distal femoral angle < 87° and >3° internal rotation of the femoral component, especially in CPAK type I and II.

pub.1146336864,"Lower Rates of Ceramic Femoral Head Use in Non-White Patients in the United States, a National Registry Study","BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to investigate the association of race and ethnicity with the use of the newest technology and postoperative outcomes in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR).
METHODS: Adult THA procedures were queried from the AJRR from 2012 to 2020. A mixed-effects multivariate regression model was used to evaluate the association of race and ethnicity with the use of the newest technology (ceramic femoral head, dual-mobility implant, and robotic assist) at 30-day, and 90-day readmission. A proportional subdistribution hazard model was used to model a risk of revision THA.
RESULTS: There were 85,188 THAs with complete data for an analysis of outcomes and 103,218 for an analysis of ceramic head usage. The median length of follow-up was 37.9 months (interquartile range [IQR] 21.6 to 56.3 months). In multivariate models, compared to White non-Hispanic patients, Black (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.92, P < .001), Hispanic (OR 0.76, CI 0.59-0.99, P = .037), Asian (OR 0.74, CI 0.55-1.00, P = .045), and Native American (OR 0.52, CI 0.30-0.87, P = .004) patients all had significantly lower rates of ceramic head use in THA. Compared to White non-Hispanic patients, Asian (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, CI 0.18-0.86, P = .008) and Hispanic (HR 0.43, CI 0.19-0.98, P = .043) patients had significantly lower rates of revision. No differences in 30-day or 90-day readmission rates were seen.
CONCLUSION: Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian patients had lower rates of ceramic head use in THA when compared to White patients. These differences did not translate into worse clinical outcomes on a short-term follow-up. In fact, Asian patients had lower revision rates compared to non-Hispanic White patients. Additional study is necessary to evaluate the long-term consequence of lower ceramic head use in non-White patients in the United States."
pub.1140805632,Study on cutting force of reaming porcine bone and substitute bone,"Accurate mechanical feedback systems are critical to the successful implementation of virtual and robotic surgical assistant systems. Experimental measurements of reaming force could further our understanding of the cancellous bone reaming process during hip arthroplasty to help develop surgical simulators with realistic force effects and improve the protection mechanism of robot-assisted surgical systems. In this study, reaming experiments with natural bone (porcine femur) and a bone substitute (polyurethane blocks) were performed on a CNC lathe. This paper proposes using the maximum reaming force of the steady reaming stage to represent the force characteristic. The reaming force is biased to one side in the overlap direction and the maximum reaming force will vary when the reamer is not coincident with the long axis of the bone. The diameter of the reamer has the greatest influence on reaming force, which clearly increases with increasing reamer diameter. During operation, a medium rotation speed and high feed speed can reduce the reaming force. After cutting, the morphology of the cut surface is not flat, but arc-shaped, which will have a significant impact on implantation of the femoral prosthesis. In in vitro cutting experiments, polyurethane blocks can be used as a substitute for cancellous bone."
pub.1129858149,Clinical outcomes of kinematic alignment versus mechanical alignment in total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review,"Although mechanical alignment (MA) has traditionally been considered the gold standard, the optimal alignment strategy for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is still debated.Kinematic alignment (KA) aims to restore native alignment by respecting the three axes of rotation of the knee and thereby producing knee motion more akin to the native knee.Designer surgeon case series and case control studies have demonstrated excellent subjective and objective clinical outcomes as well as survivorship for KA TKA with up to 10 years follow up, but these results have not been reproduced in high-quality randomized clinical trials.Gait analyses have demonstrated differences in parameters such as knee adduction, extension and external rotation moments, the relevance of which needs further evaluation.Objective improvements in soft tissue balance using KA have not been shown to result in improvements in patient-reported outcomes measures.Technologies that permit accurate reproduction of implant positioning and objective measurement of soft tissue balance, such as robotic-assisted TKA and compartmental pressure sensors, may play an important role in improving our understanding of the optimum alignment strategy and implant position.

pub.1091143997,The Training Effect of Early Intervention with a Hybrid Assistive Limb after Total Knee Arthroplasty,"After total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it is important for patients to show early improvements in knee joint function and walking to regain independence in performing the activities of daily life. We conducted for 4 weeks an intervention one week after TKA using a hybrid assistive limb (HAL: unilateral leg type) as an exoskeleton robotic device to facilitate knee joint function and walking. The intervention improved the range of knee extension movement safely and without pain compared to preoperation. In addition, we found that training with the HAL improved walking ability, speed, and rate, as well as the time taken to perform the timed up and go (TUG) test compared to preoperation. The strength of the quadriceps muscle did not improve with training; however, the patient was able to induce a knee extensor moment during the initial stance phase, as measured by kinetics and kinematics, and these actions could be performed without pain. HAL training soon after TKA improved knee joint function in a 76-year-old patient who presented with OA of the knee. The improvements in knee extension lag and knee extensor moment allowed the patient to walk without pain and regain ADL in comparison with preoperation."
pub.1120250967,Biomechanical model of swimming rehabilitation after hip and knee surgery,"As a low-to-moderate intensity rehabilitation exercise after hip and knee surgery, we propose a dynamical model of the legs motion through the water medium in freestyle and backstroke swimming. We formulate a general Kirchhoff-Lagrangian dynamics model of the legs-propulsion through the water in post-surgical rehabilitation swimming. We start by defining the two-leg-propulsion configuration manifold. This is composed of eight Euclidean groups of rigid motions in 3D space for each of the four leg segments. Next, we define Newton-Euler dynamics for each segment. This single segmental dynamics is further generalized into Lagrangian dynamics for the whole leg-propulsion system. Finally, the water effects are added in the form of Kirchhoff's vector cross-products. In agreement with orthopaedic recommendations for post-surgical rehabilitation, numerical simulation is performed on a simplified version of the full Kirchhoff-Lagrangian dynamics model, which we call the ""robotic swimming leg"" - with intentionally reduced number of (microscopic, non-sagittal) degrees-of-freedom. The purpose of this development is both qualitative, for medical and physiotherapist practitioners to study, and quantitative, for biomechanics experts to analyze and further develop."
pub.1023871242,Dimensional analysis of total hip arthroplasty polyethylenes,"OBJECTIVE: This paper performs a dimensional analysis of different total hip arthroplasty polyethylenes, cemented and non-cemented, Brazilian made and imported.
METHODS: It was considered acetabular components with 50 mm for the 28 mm femoral heads. Dimensional analysis was performed on a 3D coordinate Carl-Zeiss robotic device. Polyethylene thickness and its external measurements (maximum diameter and diameter for the femoral head) were measured.
RESULTS: The minimum thickness of the polyethylene was guaranteed on all tested components. The thickness of cemented acetabular varied from 19.185 mm to 25.358 mm, while the thickness of the non-cemented acetabular varied from 12.451 mm to 19.232 mm. The thickness was 27.96% lower in non-cemented acetabular components. With respect to the polyethylene acetabular cavity that receives the femoral head, all internal diameters exhibit at least 28 mm. In relation to the maximum outer diameter of the polyethylene, only one cemented acetabular component reached 50 mm in diameter.
CONCLUSIONS: There are large differences in measurements between brands and models analyzed. Cementless acetabular components have the smaller thickness. The diameters of non-cemented acetabular were also lower than those cemented at the expense of their need to insert into the metal-back."

pub.1174867594,Addressing sagittal plane imbalance in primary total knee arthroplasty,"Aims: Sagittal plane imbalance (SPI), or asymmetry between extension and flexion gaps, is an important issue in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to compare SPI between kinematic alignment (KA), mechanical alignment (MA), and functional alignment (FA) strategies.
Methods: In 137 robotic-assisted TKAs, extension and flexion stressed gap laxities and bone resections were measured. The primary outcome was the proportion and magnitude of medial and lateral SPI (gap differential > 2.0 mm) for KA, MA, and FA. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of knees with severe (> 4.0 mm) SPI, and resection thicknesses for each technique, with KA as reference.
Results: FA showed significantly lower rates of medial and lateral SPI (2.9% and 2.2%) compared to KA (45.3%; p < 0.001, and 25.5%; p < 0.001) and compared to MA (52.6%; p < 0.001 and 29.9%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in medial and lateral SPI between KA and MA (p = 0.228 and p = 0.417, respectively). FA showed significantly lower rates of severe medial and lateral SPI (0 and 0%) compared to KA (8.0%; p < 0.001 and 7.3%; p = 0.001) and compared to MA (10.2%; p < 0.001 and 4.4%; p = 0.013). There was no difference in severe medial and lateral SPI between KA and MA (p = 0.527 and p = 0.307, respectively). MA resulted in thinner resections than KA in medial extension (mean difference (MD) 1.4 mm, SD 1.9; p < 0.001), medial flexion (MD 1.5 mm, SD 1.8; p < 0.001), and lateral extension (MD 1.1 mm, SD 1.9; p < 0.001). FA resulted in thinner resections than KA in medial extension (MD 1.6 mm, SD 1.4; p < 0.001) and lateral extension (MD 2.0 mm, SD 1.6; p < 0.001), but in thicker medial flexion resections (MD 0.8 mm, SD 1.4; p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Mechanical and kinematic alignment (measured resection techniques) result in high rates of SPI. Pre-resection angular and translational adjustments with functional alignment, with typically smaller distal than posterior femoral resection, address this issue."
pub.1133126446,An update about latest developments in total knee arthroplasty.,An update about latest developments in total knee arthroplasty <b>Abstract.</b> For the treatment of end-stage knee osteoarthritis the replacement of the knee joint with a total knee prosthesis has proven to be an effective and efficient therapy. Knee arthroplasty has developed considerably in recent years and will continue to develop further. It is decisive to always scientifically test these developments and innovations with regard to their improvement of the results for our patients. Not every innovation necessarily leads to an improvement. The most important innovations in recent years have mainly been computer-assisted surgical techniques such as navigation or robotics as well as increasing personalization - patient-specific cutting blocks or prostheses and individualized alignment concepts are worth mentioning. This overview provides a summary of the current developments in total knee arthroplasty and illustrates the prevailing concepts.
pub.1157597161,Projected Savings Associated with Lowering the Risk of Total Hip Arthroplasty Revision Due to Dislocation in Patients with Spinopelvic Pathology,"Purpose: In the United States (US), total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the most common hospital inpatient operation among Medicare beneficiaries and is ranked fourth when considering all payers. Spinopelvic pathology (SPP) is associated with an increased risk of THA revision (rTHA) due to dislocation. Several strategies have been proposed to mitigate the risk of instability in this population, including use of dual-mobility implants, anterior-based surgical approaches, and technology-assistance (digital 2D/3D pre-surgical planning, computer navigation, and robotic assistance). For primary THA (pTHA) patients with SPP who subsequently undergo rTHA due to dislocation, we aimed to estimate (1) target population size; (2) economic burden; and (3) 10-year projected savings to the US payer of lowering the risk of rTHA due to dislocation among pTHA patients with SPP.
Methods: A budget impact analysis from the US payer perspective was undertaken using published literature; American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons American Joint Replacement Registry 2021 Annual Report; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services MEDPAR 2019; and National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2019. Expenditures were inflation-adjusted to 2021 US dollars using the Medical Care component of the Consumer Price Index. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
Results: The target population size in 2021 was estimated at 5040 (range, 4830-6309) for Medicare (fee-for-service plus Medicare Advantage) and 8003 (range, 7669-10,018) for all-payer. Annual rTHA episode-of-care (through 90 days) expenditures for Medicare and all-payer were $185 million and $314 million, respectively. Using a 4.14% compound annual growth rate from NIS, the estimated number of applicable rTHA procedures that will be performed from 2022-2031 was 63,419 Medicare and 100,697 all-payer. With each 10% reduction in relative risk of rTHA due to dislocation, Medicare and all-payer could save $233 million and $395 million, respectively, over a 10-year period.
Conclusion: Among pTHA patients with spinopelvic pathology, a modest reduction in the risk of rTHA due to dislocation could achieve substantial cumulative savings to payers while improving healthcare quality."
pub.1139095624,Verification and clinical translation of a newly designed “Skywalker” robot for total knee arthroplasty: A prospective clinical study,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate accuracy of an innovative ""Skywalker"" system, a newly designed, robot-assisted operation system for orthopaedics via a clinical trial at knee joint.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of the clinical data of 31 patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty assisted by the ""Skywalker"" robot (Microport, Suzhou, China) from June 2020 to January 2021. Five male patients and 26 female patients aged 69.68 ​± ​6.11 years (range: 57-79 years) were diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis and indicated for surgery. The ""Skywalker"" surgical robotic system was adopted to make a preoperative plan for knee arthroplasty. When the robotic arm reached the specified position during the operation, a single surgeon performed the osteotomy with a cutting saw through the cutting jig, and the difference between the actual and the expected resection thickness, and the preoperative and postoperative lower limb alignments were measured.
RESULTS: The actual error of the resection thickness was the difference between the actual and the expected resection thickness. The absolute error of the resection thickness was the absolute value of the actual error of resection thickness. The absolute errors of the resection thickness of the medial and lateral condyle of the distal femur, the medial and lateral posterior condyle of the femur, and the medial and lateral sides of the tibial plateau were 0.87 ​± ​0.63 ​mm, 1.02 ​± ​0.67 ​mm, 0.74 ​± ​0.46 ​mm, 0.98 ​± ​0.81 ​mm, 0.92 ​± ​0.66 ​mm, and 1.04 ​± ​0.84 ​mm, respectively. The absolute angle errors between the actual postoperative angles and the preoperative planned angles of the lower limb alignment angles, coronal femoral component angles, and coronal tibial component angles were 1.46° ​± ​0.95°, 1.13° ​± ​1.01°, and 1.05° ​± ​0.73°, respectively. Besides, 100% of the absolute error of the HKA angles was within 3°. In addition, compared to the preoperative lower limb alignment angle, 90.32% of the postoperative lower limb alignment angles of 31 patients were closer to 180° after the operation. All 31 patients underwent a successful surgery, and no relevant complications occurred after the operation, such as surgical site infection, deep venous thrombosis, or vascular and nerve injury.
CONCLUSION: The ""Skywalker"" system has good osteotomy accuracy, can achieve the planned angles well, and is expected to assist surgeons in performing accurate bone cuts and reconstructing planned lower limb alignments in the relevant clinical applications in future."

pub.1077286206,Total knee arthroplasty: the future.,"Few areas in orthopaedics have evolved so dramatically over the past few decades as our knowledge of knee physiology, knee kinematics, and knee replacement surgery. This article addresses major breakthroughs in knee replacement surgery, the thought process behind these concepts, and their impact on clinical practice. It focuses on compartmental arthroplasty, use of minimally invasive surgery, advances in biomaterials, and biological solutions for treating arthritis. Compartmental knee replacements are gaining popularity, especially for medial compartment arthritis. Minimally invasive surgery (i.e., quadriceps sparing arthroplasty) has become very popular in the last few years and is being used routinely for unicompartmental knee replacement and increasingly used for total knee replacement. Computer-assisted surgery has the ability to help the surgeon place the components in the desired position, thereby avoiding component malpositioning, which can cause pain, instability, limited range of movement, excessive polyethylene wear, and subsequent implant loosening. Recent advances in the metallurgy have led to the introduction of tantalum trabecular metal which offers several advantages over other current conventional materials used for implants. Expanding knowledge regarding cartilage biochemistry and the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis has focused the research on slowing the progression of osteoarthritis and promoting cartilage matrix synthesis. Perichondrial transplantation as well as periosteal transplantation have been tried by a few investigators but they have limited and temporary success. Autologous chondrocyte implantation is another technique that is gaining popularity. The chondrocytes harvested from the patient are cultured and reimplanted after 3-4 weeks of culturing. In the future, we are likely to see advances in diagnosis as well as management of osteoarthritis. The treatment modalities will probably evolve at the cellular level and it will not be long before a patient-specific medication can be given to a asymptomatic patient in order to prevent development of osteoarthritis. Patients with end-stage osteoarthritis will be offered a combination of treatments (e.g., partial replacement of one compartment or localized cartilage repair if there is localized cartilage defect in the other compartment)."
pub.1079205209,Design and Preliminary Testing of the RIC Hybrid Knee Prosthesis,"We present a novel hybrid knee prosthesis that uses a motor, transmission and control system only for active dynamics tasks, while relying on a spring/damper system for passive dynamics activities. Active dynamics tasks require higher torque, lower speed, and occur less frequently than passive dynamic activities. By designing the actuation system around active tasks alone, we achieved a lightweight design (1.7 Kg w/o battery) without sacrificing peak torque (85Nm repetitive). Preliminary tests performed by an able-bodied person using a bypass orthosis show that the hybrid knee can support reciprocal stairs ambulation with low electrical energy consumption. "
pub.1100751888,Current Role of Computer Navigation in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Computer-assisted surgical (CAS) navigation has been developed with the aim of improving the accuracy and precision of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) component positioning and therefore overall limb alignment. The historical goal of knee arthroplasty has been to restore the mechanical alignment of the lower limb by aligning the femoral and tibial components perpendicular to the mechanical axis of the femur and tibia. Despite over 4 decades of TKA component development and nearly 2 decades of interest in CAS, the fundamental question remains; does the alignment goal and/or the method of achieving that goal affect the outcome of the TKA in terms of patient-reported outcome measures and/or overall survivorship? The quest for reliable and reproducible achievement of the intraoperative alignment goal has been the primary motivator for the introduction, development, and refinement of CAS navigation. Numerous proprietary systems now exist, and rapid technological advancements in computer processing power are stimulating further development of robotic surgical systems. Three categories of CAS can be defined: image-based large-console navigation; imageless large-console navigation, and more recently, accelerometer-based handheld navigation systems have been developed.
CONCLUSION: A review of the current literature demonstrates that there are enough well-designed studies to conclude that both large-console CAS and handheld navigation systems improve the accuracy and precision of component alignment in TKA. However, missing from the evidence base, other than the subgroup analysis provided by the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry, are any conclusive demonstrations of a clinical superiority in terms of improved patient-reported outcome measures and/or decreased cumulative revision rates in the long term. Few authors would argue that accuracy of alignment is a goal to ignore; therefore, in the absence of clinical evidence, many of the arguments against the use of large-console CAS navigation center on the prohibitive cost of the systems. The utilization of low-cost, handheld CAS navigation systems may therefore bridge this important gap, and over time, further clinical evidence may emerge."
pub.1002971079,A surface‐matching technique for robot‐assisted registration,"Successful implementation of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) requires coherent integration of spatial image data with sensing and actuating devices, each having its own coordinate system. Hence, accurate estimation of the geometric relationships between relevant reference frames, known as registration, is a crucial procedure in all RAS applications. The purpose of this paper is to present a new registration scheme, along with the results of an experimental evaluation of a robot-assisted registration method for RAS applications in orthopedics. The accuracy of the proposed registration is appropriate for specified orthopedic surgical applications such as Total Knee Replacement. The registration method is based on a surface-matching algorithm that does not require marker implants, thereby reducing surgical invasiveness. Points on the bone surface are sampled by the robot, which in turn directs the surgical tool. This technique eliminates additional coordinate transformations to an external device (such as a digitizer), resulting in increased surgical accuracy. The registration technique was tested on an RSPR six-degrees-of-freedom parallel robot specifically designed for medical applications. A six-axis force sensor attached to the robot's moving platform enables fast and accurate acquisition of positions and surface normal directions at sampled points. Sampling with a robot probe was shown to be accurate, fast, and easy to perform. The whole procedure takes about 2 min, with the robot performing most of the registration procedures, leaving the surgeon's hands free. Robotic registration was shown to provide a flawless link between preoperative planning and robotic assistance during surgery."
pub.1137050323,Significant increase in quantity and quality of knee arthroplasty related research in KSSTA over the past 15 years,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate both publication and authorship characteristics in Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy journal (KSSTA) regarding knee arthroplasty over the past 15 years.
METHODS: PubMed was searched for articles published in KSSTA between January 1, 2006, and December 31st, 2020, utilising the search term 'knee arthroplasty'. 1288 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were evaluated using the following criteria: type of article, type of study, main topic and special topic, use of patient-reported outcome scores, number of references and citations, level of evidence (LOE), number of authors, gender of the first author and continent of origin. Three time intervals were compared: 2006-2010, 2011-2015 and 2016-2020.
RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2020, publications peaked at 670 articles (52%) compared with 465 (36%) published between 2011 and 2016 and 153 articles (12%) between 2006 and 2010. While percentage of reviews (2006-2010: 0% vs. 2011-2015: 5% vs. 2016-2020: 5%) and meta-analyses (1% vs. 6% vs. 5%) increased, fewer case reports were published (13% vs. 3% vs. 1%) (p < 0.001). Interest in navigation and computer-assisted surgery decreased, whereas interest in perioperative management, robotic and individualized surgery increased over time (p < 0.001). There was an increasing number of references [26 (2-73) vs. 30 (2-158) vs. 31 (1-143), p < 0.001] while number of citations decreased [30 (0-188) vs. 22 (0-264) vs. 6 (0-106), p < 0.001]. LOE showed no significant changes (p = 0.439). The number of authors increased between each time interval (p < 0.001), while the percentage of female authors was comparable between first and last interval (p = 0.252). Europe published significantly fewer articles over time (56% vs. 47% vs. 52%), whereas the number of articles from Asia increased (35% vs. 45% vs. 37%, p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Increasing interest in the field of knee arthroplasty-related surgery arose within the last 15 years in KSSTA. The investigated topics showed a significant trend towards the latest techniques at each time interval. With rising number of authors, the part of female first authors also increased-but not significantly. Furthermore, publishing characteristics showed an increasing number of publications from Asia and a slightly decreasing number in Europe.

pub.1037313561,Die Bedeutung der Fräsbahngenerierung für die roboterassistierte Implantation von Hüftendoprothesenschäften Vergleichende experimentelle Studie: Hand- vs. Roboterpräparation,"We present an experimental study to determine the effectiveness of computer assisted robotic bone preparation with regard to primary rotational stability in comparison to hand broaching. 5 different cementless stems were standardized implanted in synthetic femora and measured in a specially designed apparatus (displacement in 6 degrees of freedom). In addition the contact areas of the stems and the bone were visualized.The S-ROM- and ABG-stems were more stable in hand broached femora. The Osteolock-, G2- and Vision-2000-stems were more stable in the robot group. The mode of fixation of each implant could be characterized in relation to its position and its stiffness (primary rotational stability). The contact areas differed in some prosthesis in the way of preparation. The findings highlight the current difficulties in creating a perfect match of robotically milled cavity and stem geometry to achieve enhanced stability."
pub.1137229706,[A cadaveric experimental study on domestic robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty].,"OBJECTIVE: To simulate and validate the performance, accuracy, and safety of the Yuanhua robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty system (YUANHUA-TKA) through cadaver-based experiment, thus optimizing the robotic system for the future human clinical application.
METHODS: Six unilateral adult cadaver specimens of the lower limbs were scanned by three-dimensional CT before the experiment, and then the three-dimensional models of femur and tibia were obtained by using the preoperative software of YUANHUA-TKA system, so as to plan the type of prosthesis implant, the osteotomy volume and osteotomy angles [hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), coronal frontal femoral component (FFC) and frontal tibial component (FTC)], the ideal value of HKA was set to 180°, and of FFC and FTC were set to 90°, respectively. The operator could further confirm the osteotomy plan according to the intraoperative situation before osteotomy, and then install the prosthesis after completing the osteotomy in each plane with the assistance of YUANHUA-TKA system. At last, the X-ray films of hip joint, knee joint, and ankle joint were taken and stitched into the full length X-ray film of the lower limb, and HKA, coronal FFC and FTC were measured.
RESULTS: During the experiment, YUANHUA-TKA system ran stably. All sections of femur and tibia were smooth and no ligament injury was found. After operation, the HKA was 177.1°-179.7°, FFC was 87.9°-91.4°, and FTC was 87.3°-91.4°, which were within ±3° from the ideal values of preoperative planning.
CONCLUSION: The YUANHUA-TKA system can assist the surgeon to carry out precise osteotomy according to the preoperative planned value, which has a good auxiliary effect for total knee arthroplasty. It is expected to assist joint surgeons to improve the surgical accuracy in clinical application."
pub.1173489878,Radiographic measurements of acetabular component orientation with Widmer´s method in total hip arthroplasty. Descriptive case series.,"INTRODUCTION: total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most performed surgeries worldwide, with high satisfaction rates. The orientation of the acetabular component has a direct impact on the risk of dislocation, recently with the support of robotic surgery the margin of error in implant placement has decreased; however, the conventional technique even without fluoroscopic support continues to have satisfactory results within the safety zone.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive case series of patients treated with THA at Hospital General Xoco between 2022 and 2024. Degrees of anteversion and inclination were measured with Widmer's method on postoperative radiographs.
RESULTS: the radiographs of 113 patients were studied, 80 female and 33 male, with a mean age of 63.2 ± 13.01 years (95% CI: 60.6-65.4), a mean inclination of 42.2° ± 8.1° (95% CI: 40.7-43.2) and anteversion of 14.3° ± 8.5° (95% CI: 12.5-15.4); 76% of the population was within Lewinnek safe zone; by etiology: osteoarthrosis 74%, sequelae of dysplasia 68% and intracapsular fracture 82%; difference between the values of the affected side: left 65%, right 83%, of 3.9° and 4.7°/6.4o and 9° in relation to the overall values of the population.
CONCLUSION: in our population undergoing THA, without the use of robotic technique or support of imaging studies, anteversion and inclination figures were recorded within the Lewinnek safety parameters with a conventional method."
pub.1172353878,Assessment of average femoral component rotation for balancing functionally aligned total knee replacement in varus deformity: Robotic image guidance study,"Introduction and purpose: Ensuring proper femoral component alignment post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial for normal patellofemoral (PF) kinematics. However, the customary 3° external rotation relative to the Posterior Condylar Axis (PC Axis) may not universally apply, and the expected final femoral component rotation remains unclear in functionally aligned knees. This study examines the relation between the Transepicondylar Axis (TEA) and PC axis, known as Posterior Condylar Angle (PCA) in Indian patients along with factors influencing PCA, and the feasibility of reproducing patient-specific PCA using image-guided Cuvis joint robot.
Methods: Forty patients (52 Knees) with primary osteoarthritis and varus deformity were prospectively evaluated. Native PCA was determined using CT-based J planner. Pre-operative patellar shape, PF tilt, PF shift, final femoral component rotation (representing post-operative PCA), final patellar tracking, and post-operative functional and radiological assessment at 3 months were recorded.
Results: Study participants averaged 64.3 years of age, with a female-to-male ratio of 23 to 17. Varus deformities varied, with IA2 being most prevalent, and sagittal plane deformities included fixed flexion (34.6 %) and hyperextension (44.2 %). The average PCA was 1.9° (range: 0°-7.3°), with most knees (41 out of 52) below 3°. The majority had Wiberg type 1 patellae, with pre-operative patellar tilt averaging 5.63°, reducing post-operatively to 4.43°. Most patients (37 out of 40) achieved excellent Knee Society functional scores at the 3-month mark. Complications included one case of delayed wound healing and one femoral array pin breakage. Notably, our study revealed a significant deviation in PCA from the commonly reported 3° in Western literature, underscoring the need for region-specific considerations in TKA planning.
Conclusion: PCA of our population is statistically different from customary 3° followed with jig system. Image guided Robotics helps to identify patients specific PCA and reproducing the same was more commonly possible in patients with reducible Varus deformity."
pub.1166267833,Technology assistance in primary total knee replacement: hype or hope?,"INTRODUCTION: Total knee replacement (TKR) reduces pain, it increases quality of life and it generally lasts a long time with revision rates of less than 5% at 10 years. Some authors have suggested that outcomes may be further improved by technology assistance.
AREAS COVERED: Technology assistance in primary TKR includes technologies such as navigated TKR, patient specific instrumentation TKR and robotic TKR.
EXPERT OPINION: In general, technology assistance results in higher accuracy of component positioning and alignment, but this is likely not clinically relevant as no clinically important difference in clinical outcomes, quality of life and complications such as revisions has been demonstrated in meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. As technology assistance in primary TKR is increasingly used to capture patient and surgeon data, surgeons have an increasingly important role in protecting their patients' data and their own data. Real world evidence of implant registries has shown that TKR without technologically assistance can achieve perfectly acceptable outcomes. Although there is a genuine hope that technology-assisted TKR may further improve these outcomes, this hope is based on promises rather than solid evidence. At the same time, technology assisted TKR is heavily promoted including direct patient marketing, which are aspects of a hype."
pub.1060169196,How Correctly Does an Intramedullary Rod Represent the Longitudinal Tibial Axes?,"In a robot-assisted procedure for preparing the tibia in total knee arthroplasty, developed in the authors' laboratory, an intramedullary rod is used to register the tibia. In 18 formalin-fixed tibias, the difference in orientation was calculated between the intramedullary rod and several longitudinal tibial axes used in clinical practice. This was done using roentgenstereophotogrammetric analysis. Three tibial axes and two insertion techniques were considered. In three-dimensional space, small differences between the axes are observed. The results showed a high standard deviation, indicating the importance of anatomic differences. In the frontal plane, the difference in orientation between rod and tibial axes never exceeded +/- 2 degrees. In the sagittal plane, the observed differences were larger. Significant differences between the considered axes appeared. The results of the two insertion techniques were not significantly different. Because an intramedullary rod frequently is used for alignment of the tibia in conventional surgery, these results also are valuable for conventional surgery. In the current study, the accuracy of the intramedullary alignment is examined, without influences of the sawing procedure. Moreover, the study is not limited to the frontal plane; the total accuracy in three-dimensional space, and the accuracy in the frontal and the sagittal planes were studied."
pub.1009483183,Machining and accuracy studies for a tibial knee implant using a force‐controlled robot,"Total knee arthroplasty requires accurate preparation of the bone surfaces to maximize bone implant contact area in cementless surgery and to obtain proper joint kinematics and ligament balancing. Robots can make the cuts with the necessary high precision. The purpose of this article is threefold: to propose an alternative method for intraoperative registration using an intramedullary rod and an alternative method for force control using the hybrid force-velocity control scheme; to demonstrate that the accuracy and the surface flatness of the cuts machined by a robot are better than in a conventional operation; and to monitor the machining process and to try to derive some information about the local bone quality from it. The results of the laboratory study are promising: the surface flatness of the tibial plateau, calculated using a least squares method, is 0.1-0.2 mm, which is significantly better than in conventional surgery; and the high angular accuracy of the robot allows the bone cuts to be located precisely. Further, an exponential relation between milling forces and local bone density was established, so measurements of the milling forces can provide the surgeon with on-line information about the local bone quality."
pub.1051755510,Tailor-made Surgical Guide Reduces Incidence of Outliers of Cup Placement,"Malalignment of the cup in total hip arthroplasty (THA) increases the risks of postoperative complications such as neck cup impingement, dislocation, and wear. We asked whether a tailor-made surgical guide based on CT images would reduce the incidence of outliers beyond 10° from preoperatively planned alignment of the cup compared with those without the surgical guide. We prospectively followed 38 patients (38 hips, Group 1) having primary THA with the conventional technique and 31 patients (31 hips, Group 2) using the surgical guide. We designed the guide for Group 2 based on CT images and fixed it to the acetabular edge with a Kirschner wire to indicate the planned cup direction. Postoperative CT images showed the guide reduced the number of outliers compared with the conventional method (Group 1, 23.7%; Group 2, 0%). The surgical guide provided more reliable cup insertion compared with conventional techniques.Level of Evidence: Level II, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."
pub.1003851188,A 3D kinematic estimation of knee prosthesis using X-ray projection images: clinical assessment of the improved algorithm for fluoroscopy images,"In this paper, we propose three ideas to improve a kinematic estimation algorithm for total knee arthroplasty. The first is a two-step estimation algorithm that improves estimation accuracy by excluding certain assumptions needed for the pattern matching algorithm reported by Banks and Hodge. The second is incorporating a 3D geometric articulation model into the algorithm to improve estimation accuracy substantially for the depth translation, and to introduce contact points’ trajectories between the articular surfaces. The third is an algorithm to process estimation even when the silhouettes of two components overlap. To assess our algorithm’s potential for clinical application, we carried out two experiments. First, we used a robot to position the prosthesis. Estimation accuracy was checked by comparing input data to the robot with the estimates from X-ray photographs. Incorporating our articulation model remarkably reduced the error in the depth translation. Next, we performed a clinical assessment by applying the algorithm and articulation model to fluoroscopy images of a patient who had recently had TKA."
pub.1064454690,Active compliance in robotic surgery—the use of force control as a dynamic constraint,"Robotic surgery can be carried out automatically by using a robot to move the cutting tool under position control. However, although the surgeon can observe the procedure on a visual display and has the ability to stop the operation in an emergency, he has little direct contact with the task. An alternative approach is to involve the surgeon more directly, by his moving a robot using active force control. The robot is then used to allow motion in preprogrammed regions, by the surgeon back-driving the robot motors, while preventing motion in prohibited areas. This active constraint robot (or ACROBOT) is described in this paper applied to knee surgery, in which the knee bones are accurately machined to allow the fitting of prosthetic knee implants. The ACROBOT is, however, ideally suited to a range of surgical procedure, because it allows the surgeon to feel the forces exerted during cutting and take appropriate action. This ability to be in direct control, while being constrained to cut within a permitted region, enhances safety and makes the system more acceptable to the medical community. The system of programmable constraint also allows the ACROBOT to provide the traditional benefits of robot surgery, namely the ability to machine complex geometrical surfaces very accurately and to make repetitive motions tirelessly. The system also has a potential for minimally invasive procedures. In knee surgery, for example, the robot could operate through a small incision in the skin and excise a volume into which a small, specially designed, unicompartmental prosthesis could fit."
pub.1181631721,Evaluation of a novel robotic testing method for stability and kinematics of total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: This work developed a novel preclinical test of total knee replacements (TKRs) in order to explain TKR instability linked to patient dissatisfaction. It was hypothesized that stability tests on the isolated moving prostheses would provide novel comparative data on the stability and kinematics among TKR designs.
METHODS: Three TKR designs, DePuy Synthes Attune MS, Stryker Triathlon and Zimmer Biomet Persona MC, were assessed using a robotic arm while flexing-extending 0-140°. Tests imposed 710 N body weight combined with three tibial loads: no anterior-posterior (AP) force, 90 N anterior or 90 N posterior force. Other load effects were minimized and the kinematics was recorded. Each implant was tested six times to investigate the repeatability of the method. Data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). If significance was found (p < 0.05), post hoc t tests with Bonferroni correction were used to contrast groups.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found throughout flexion-extension. Femoral rollback, AP stability, coupled internal-external rotation and AP position (roll-back) were all influenced by implant design. AP stability of the TKRs reduced with flexion reaching Attune 15 mm, Persona 13 mm and Triathlon 21 mm at 140° flexion. Tractive rolling significantly affected kinematics in the less congruent Triathlon design, with 6 mm different paths between flexion and extension motion (p < 0.05 across 5-100°). Paradoxical anterior femoral sliding in early flexion (0-40°) occurred in Persona and Triathlon designs.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel testing technique provides, for the first time, comparative data on the inherent stability and kinematics of the TKR implants themselves across the arc of flexion-extension, independent of variables including soft tissue behaviour and surgical technique. The data show how much each prosthesis can contribute to the stability and motion of the implanted knee. Similar data from a wider range of designs will enable more informed decisions regarding implant design choice, aiming to reduce the prevalence of TKR instability in patients.

pub.1006577921,Evolution of customization design for total knee arthroplasty,"Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly successful surgical procedure with more than 600,000 TKA’s performed annually in the US. Interest in improving surgical outcomes has led to improvements in surgical technique, instrumentation, and implant design. Computer navigation and robotic systems were introduced to further refine the mechanical alignment of joint replacement procedures. The cost to implement some of these technologies and the additional time required in the operating room to utilize these developments has limited the acceptance of them broadly. The introduction of custom instrumentation and cutting blocks based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has allowed for better restoration of mechanical alignment. Unfortunately, little has changed in patient satisfaction in the past ten years. The recent introduction of patient specific instrumentation and patient specific implants is another step forward to restore the pre-deformity anatomy and joint geometry. This new technology can benefit the hospital by improving operating room time efficiencies through having shorter set-up times, and the elimination of cleaning, sterilization and inventory costs. The patient can potentially benefit by a shorter operative time, improved postoperative alignment and better fitting implants."
pub.1171429602,A pilot study on preferences from surgeons to deal with an innovative customized and connected knee prosthesis – A discret choice experiment,"Background: To address the increasing global demand for Total Knee Arthroplasty and reduce the need for revisions, several technologies combining 3D planning and artificial intelligence have emerged. These innovations aim to enhance customization, improve component positioning accuracy and precision. The integration of these advancements paves the way for the development of personalized and connected knee implant.
Questions/purposes: These groundbreaking advancements may necessitate changes in surgical practices. Hence, it is important to comprehend surgeons' intentions in integrating these technologies into their routine procedures. Our study aims to assess how surgeons' preferences will affect the acceptability of using this new implant and associated technologies within the entire care chain.
Methods: We employed a Discrete Choice Experiment, a predictive technique mirroring real-world healthcare decisions, to assess surgeons' trade-off evaluations and preferences.
Results: A total of 90 experienced surgeons, performing a significant number of procedures annually (mostly over 51) answered. Analysis indicates an affinity for technology but limited interest in integrating digital advancements like preoperative software and robotics. However, they are receptive to practice improvements and considering the adoption of future sensors.
Conclusions: In conclusion, surgeons prefer customized prostheses via augmented reality, accepting extra cost. Embedded sensor technology is deemed premature by them."
pub.1134980455,"Report on a novel bone registration method: A rapid, accurate, and radiation-free technique for computer- and robotic-assisted orthopedic surgeries","INTRODUCTION: Computer- and robotic-assisted technologies have recently been introduced into orthopedic surgery to improve accuracy. Each requires intraoperative ""bone registration,"" but existing methods are time consuming, often inaccurate, and/or require bulky and costly equipment that produces substantial radiation.
METHODS: We developed a novel method of bone registration using a compact 3D structured light surface scanner that can scan thousands of points simultaneously without any ionizing radiation.Visible light is projected in a specific pattern onto a 3 × 3 cm<sup>2</sup> area of exposed bone, which deforms the pattern in a way determined by the local bone geometry. A quantitative analysis reconstructs this local geometry and compares it to the preoperative imaging, thereby effecting rapid bone registration.A registration accuracy study using our novel method was conducted on 24 CT-scanned femur Sawbones®. We simulated exposures typically seen during knee/hip arthroplasty and common bone tumor resections. The registration accuracy of our technique was quantified by measuring the discrepancy of known points (i.e., pre-drilled holes) on the bone.
RESULTS: Our technique demonstrated a registration accuracy of 0.44 ± 0.22 mm. This compared favorably with literature-reported values of 0.68 ± 0.14 mm (<i>p</i>-value = 0.001) for the paired-point technique<sup>13</sup> and 0.86 ± 0.38 mm for the intraoperative CT based techniques <sup>14</sup> (not enough reported data to calculate <i>p</i>-value).
CONCLUSION: We have developed a novel method of bone registration for computer and robotic-assisted surgery using 3D surface scanning technology that is rapid, compact, and radiation-free. We have demonstrated increased accuracy compared to existing methods (using historical controls)."

pub.1140286814,A prospective randomised control trial comparing functional with mechanical axis alignment in total knee arthroplasty: study protocol for an investigator initiated trial,"BackgroundA drive to improve functional outcomes for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has led to alternative alignment being used. Functional alignment (FA) uses intraoperative soft tissue tension to determine the optimal position of the prosthesis within the patient’s soft tissue envelope. Angular limits for bone resections are followed to prevent long-term prosthesis failure. This study will use the aid of robotic assistance to plan and implement the final prosthesis position. This method has yet to be compared to the traditional mechanically aligned (MA) knee in a randomised trial.MethodsA blinded randomised control trial with 100 patients will be undertaken via Perth Hip and Knee Clinic. Fifty patients will undergo a MA TKA and fifty will undergo a FA TKA. Both alignment techniques will be balanced via computer-assisted navigation to assess prosthetic gaps, being achieved via the initial bony resection and further soft tissue releases as required to achieve satisfactory balance. The primary outcome will be the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) 2 years after surgery, with secondary outcomes being other patient-reported outcome measures, clinical functional assessment, radiographic position and complications. Other data that will be collected will be patient demography (sex, age, level of activity) and medical information (grade of knee injury, any other relevant medical information). The linear statistical model will be fitted to the response (FJS), including all the other variables as covariates.DiscussionMany surgeons are utilising alternative alignment techniques with a goal of achieving better functional outcomes for their patients. Currently, MA TKA remains the gold standard with good outcomes and excellent longevity. There is no published RCTs comparing FA to MA yet and only two registered studies are planned or currently in progress. This study utilises a FA technique which differs from the two studies. This study will help determine if FA TKA has superior functional results for patients.Trial registrationThis trial has been registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) http://www.anzctr.org.au: U1111-1257-2291, registered 25th Jan 2021.

pub.1031858110,An in vitro analysis of medial structures and a medial soft tissue reconstruction in a constrained condylar total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to quantify the medial soft tissue contributions to stability following constrained condylar (CC) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and determine whether a medial reconstruction could restore stability to a soft tissue-deficient, CC-TKA knee.
METHODS: Eight cadaveric knees were mounted in a robotic system and tested at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion with ±50 N anterior-posterior force, ±8 Nm varus-valgus, and ±5 Nm internal-external torque. The deep and superficial medial collateral ligaments (dMCL, sMCL) and posteromedial capsule (PMC) were transected and their relative contributions to stabilising the applied loads were quantified. After complete medial soft tissue transection, a reconstruction using a semitendinosus tendon graft was performed, and the effect on kinematic behaviour under equivocal conditions was measured.
RESULTS: In the CC-TKA knee, the sMCL was the major medial restraint in anterior drawer, internal-external, and valgus rotation. No significant differences were found between the rotational laxities of the reconstructed knee to the pre-deficient state for the arc of motion examined. The relative contribution of the reconstruction was higher in valgus rotation at 60° than the sMCL; otherwise, the contribution of the reconstruction was similar to that of the sMCL.
CONCLUSION: There is contention whether a CC-TKA can function with medial deficiency or more constraint is required. This work has shown that a CC-TKA may not provide enough stability with an absent sMCL. However, in such cases, combining the CC-TKA with a medial soft tissue reconstruction may be considered as an alternative to a hinged implant."
pub.1135278538,The prevalence of posterolateral tibial baseplate overhang: An anatomical CT study,"INTRODUCTION: Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is used in patients with osteoarthritis who have failed conservative management to reduce pain, improve functional outcomes and ultimately quality of life. However, less than optimal patient satisfaction has led to continued improvements in design and technology of TKA. One factor that can limit patient satisfaction is postero-lateral overhang of the tibial baseplate. The purpose of our study is to utilize pre-operative CT scans to assess the prevalence of posterolateral tibial overhang with the use of a symmetric tibial baseplate component in a popular knee system with robotic assistance.
METHODS: Ninety-eight (98) consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were included in this study. Using both the most medial aspect of the tibial tubercle and the medial ⅓ of the tibial tubercle as reference points, we quantified the extent of posterolateral overhang when determining the rotation of the tibial component.
RESULTS: Using the most medial aspect of the tibial tubercle as a reference point for rotation of the tibial baseplate, 63% of the instances of reviewed CT scans (369/588) had posterolateral overhang. Furthermore, 81% (406/588) had posterolateral overhang when using the medial ⅓ aspect of the tibial tubercle as the reference for rotation of the tibial baseplate. The average posterolateral tibial baseplate overhang was 1.5 mm (range 0-8 mm) when using the most medial aspect of the tibial tubercle and 2.4 mm (range 0-8 mm) when using the medial ⅓ tibial tubercle as the centering point for the tibial baseplate.
DISCUSSION: Tibial baseplate overhang could lead to potential pain from irritation of soft tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first study that was able to valencquantify the amount of tibial baseplate overhang using pre-operative CT scans. Rotational alignment of the tibial baseplate needs to be balanced to ensure minimal lateral overhang while achieving sufficient external rotation of the tibial component. An asymmetric tibial component may provide a compromise in certain situations.

pub.1134922921,Effect of Tourniquet Use on Patient Outcomes After Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Tourniquet use is common in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but debate exists regarding its use and effect on patient outcomes. The study purpose was to compare the effect of short tourniquet (ST) time vs long tourniquet (LT) time on pain, opioid consumption, and patient outcomes.
METHODS: Patients were prospectively randomized to an ST time of 10 min vs LT time. A total of 100 consecutive patients undergoing primary cementless robotic-assisted TKA underwent randomization, with 5 patients unable to complete follow-up, leaving 49 in the ST group and 46 in the LT cohort. Visual analog scale pain scores, morphine equivalent, serum creatine kinase, distance walked, range of motion, length of stay (LOS), surgical time, hemoglobin (Hgb), and Knee Society Scores (KSS) were prospectively collected.
RESULTS: Visual analog scale pain was statistically equivalent at 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. Morphine equivalent consumption was 36 vs 44 (P = .03), 48 vs 50 (P = .72), 31 vs 28 (P = .57), and 4.7 vs 5.5 (P = .75) in the LT vs ST cohorts at 24 hours, 48 hours, 2weeks, and 6weeks postoperatively. Change in Hgb postoperative day 1 was 2.7 in both groups (P = .975). Postoperative day 1 creatine kinase-MB was 3.7 and 3.0 (P = .30) in LT and ST cohorts. Six-week postoperative KSS Knee and Function scores were 82.4 and 70.5 in LT group vs 80.8 and 72.3 in ST group (P = .61 and P = .63). Postoperative range of motion, LOS, and surgical time were equivalent.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates no significant advantage of ST use in primary TKA with respect to opioid consumption, patient-reported pain, KSS scores, LOS, or postoperative Hgb level."
pub.1024136520,Preliminary application of computer‐assisted patient‐specific acetabular navigational template for total hip arthroplasty in adult single development dysplasia of the hip,"BACKGROUND: The considerable variation in anatomical abnormalities of hip joints associated with different types of developmental dysplasia of hip (DDH) makes reconstruction in total hip arthroplasty (THA) difficult. It is desirable to create patient-specific designs for THA procedures. In the cases of adult single DDH, an accuracy-improved method has been developed for acetabular cup prosthesis implantation of hip arthroplasty.
METHODS: From October 2007 to November 2008, 22 patients with single DDH (according to the Crowe standard, all dysplasia hips were classified as type I) were scanned with spiral CT pre-operatively. These patients scheduled for THA were randomly assigned to undergo either conventional THA (control group, n = 11) or navigation template implantation (NT group, n = 11). In the NT group, three-dimensional (3D) CT pelvis image data were transferred to a computer workstation and 3D models of the hip were reconstructed using the Mimics software. The 3D models were then processed by the Imageware software. In brief, a template that best fitted the location and shape of the acetabular cup was 'reversely' built from the 3D model, the rotation centre of the pathological hip determined by mirroring that of the healthy site, and a guiding hole in the template was then designed. The navigational templates were manufactured using a rapid prototyping machine. These navigation templates guide acetabular component placement.
RESULTS: Based on the predetermined abduction angle 45° and anteversion angle 18°, after 1 year follow-up, the NT group showed significantly smaller differences (1.6° ± 0.4°, 1.9° ± 1.1°) from the predetermined angles than those in the control group (5.8° ± 2.9°, 3.9° ± 2.5°) (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The template designs facilitated accurate placement of acetabular components in dysplasia of acetabulum. The hip's center of rotation in DDH could be established using computer-aided design, which provides a useful method for the accurate location of prosthesis with a low cost-performance ratio without excessive technical workload on the surgical team."
pub.1144048727,The initial learning curve for the ROSA® Knee System can be achieved in 6‐11 cases for operative time and has similar 90‐day complication rates with improved implant alignment compared to manual instrumentation in total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the learning curve for total operative time using a novel cutting guide positioning robotic assistant for total knee arthroplasty (raTKA). Additionally, we compared complications and final limb alignment between raTKA and manual TKA (mTKA), as well as accuracy to plan for raTKA cases.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study on a series of patients (n = 180) that underwent raTKA (n = 90) using the ROSA Total Knee System or mTKA (n = 90) by one of three high-volume (> 200 cases per year) orthopaedic surgeons between December 2019 and September 2020, with minimum three-month follow-up. To evaluate the learning curve surgical times and postoperative complications were reviewed.
RESULTS: The cumulative summation analysis for total operative time revealed a change point of 10, 6, and 11 cases for each of three surgeons, suggesting a rapid learning curve. There was a significant difference in total operative times between the learning raTKA and both the mastered raTKA and mTKA groups (p = 0.001) for all three surgeons combined. Postoperative complications were minimal in all groups. The proportion of outliers for the final hip-knee-ankle angle compared to planned was 5.2% (3/58) for the mastered raTKA compared to 24.1% (19/79) for mTKA (p = 0.003). The absolute mean difference between the validated and planned resections for all angles evaluated was < 1 degree for the mastered raTKA cases.
CONCLUSION: As the digital age of medicine continues to develop, advanced technologies may disrupt the industry, but should not disrupt the care provided. This cutting guide positioning robotic system can be integrated relatively quickly with a rapid initial learning curve (6-11 cases) for operative times, similar 90-day complication rates, and improved component positioning compared to mTKA. Proficiency of the system requires additional analysis, but it can be expected to improve over time.

pub.1086086198,Regional Femoral and Tibial Radiolucency in Cemented Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty and the Relationship to Functional Outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Femoral and tibial radiolucent lines (RLL) after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) can be categorized in physiological and pathological radiolucencies. Although physiological tibial radiolucency is assessed extensively in literature, studies reporting femoral radiolucency are lacking. Therefore, a retrospective study was performed to assess physiological femoral RLL and its relationship to short-term functional outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 352 patients were included who underwent robotic-assisted medial UKA surgery and received a fixed-bearing metal-backed cemented medial UKA. Radiographic follow-up consisted of standard anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. Functional outcomes, using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index questionnaire, of patients with RLL were compared with a matched cohort, based on gender, age, and body mass index.
RESULTS: In this cohort, 101 patients (28.8%) had physiological regional radiolucency around the femoral (10.3%) and/or tibial (25.3%) components, of which 6.8% concerned both components. Tibial RLL were more frequently seen compared with femoral RLL (P < .001). Our data suggest that the time of onset of femoral radiolucency develops later (1.36 years) than tibial radiolucency (1.00 years, P = .02). No difference in short-term functional outcomes was found between the RLL group and the matched cohort group without radiolucency.
CONCLUSION: This study acknowledges that tibial and femoral physiological radiolucencies may develop after cemented medial UKA. Furthermore, this was the first study showing that physiological femoral RLL occur later than tibial RLL. Prospective studies with longer follow-up and larger numbers are necessary to compare radiolucency in different UKA designs and the relationship to outcomes."
pub.1125503293,Trends and patient factors associated with technology-assisted total hip arthroplasty in the United States from 2005 to 2014,"BACKGROUND: Technology-assisted total hip arthroplasty (TA-THA) using either computer-assisted navigation or robotic assistance has become increasingly more popular. The purpose of this study was to examine the trends and patient factors associated with TA-THA.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review utilizing the National Inpatient Sample, a large national database incorporating inpatient hospitalization information. International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes were used to identify patients with hip osteoarthritis who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients were then separated into those who underwent TA-THA or conventional THA. Outcomes of interest included annual TA-THA utilization; patient and hospital characteristics associated with TA-THA; and trends for length of stay (LOS), cost, and discharge to home.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2014, a total of 2,588,304 patients with hip osteoarthritis who underwent THA were identified in the National Inpatient Sample database. Of those, 39,700 (1.5%) underwent TA-THA. The number of TA-THA procedures increased from 178 (0.1% of all THA) in 2005 to 10,045 (3.0% of all THA) in 2014, which represented a 30-fold increase in incidence (<i>P</i>-trend &lt;.0001). TA-THA was associated with Hispanic race, higher patient income, and the Western region of the United States. During the study period, there was a trend toward decreased LOS and increased discharge to home for both TA-THA and conventional THA. TA-THA was associated with higher inpatient cost.
CONCLUSION: TA-THA is being increasingly used in the United States and is associated with specific patient factors. However, the value of TA-THA compared to conventional THA remains unclear and should be assessed with future research.

pub.1117509926,Influence of Tibial Component Position on Altered Kinematics Following Total Ankle Arthroplasty During Simulated Gait,"BACKGROUND: Ankle and hindfoot kinematics following total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) are poorly understood and it is unclear whether patients can replicate physiologic motion after TAA. Furthermore, the effect of implant position on TAA kinematics is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare ankle and hindfoot kinematics pre- and post-TAA during simulated gait and determine to what degree tibial component position correlated with variations in ankle kinematics.
METHODS: Eight midtibia cadaveric specimens were utilized in this institutional review board-approved study. The stance phase of gait was simulated both pre- and post-TAA in each specimen using a 6 degrees of freedom robotic platform. Ankle and hindfoot kinematics were measured from reflective markers attached to bones via surgical pins. The effect of tibial component position on absolute differences in ankle kinematics was assessed using linear regression.
RESULTS: No differences were observed in ankle sagittal and coronal plane motion between the intact and TAA conditions. Differences in ankle joint kinematics were identified in the transverse plane, where internal talar rotation was significantly increased following TAA compared with the native condition. The medial-lateral position of the tibial component was found to correlate with the altered transverse plane motion observed after TAA (β = 1.861 degrees/mm, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.72, <i>P</i> = .008). No significant differences in subtalar and talonavicular joint kinematics in any plane were observed comparing the pre- and post-TAA condition.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an increased internal rotation of the ankle in the transverse plane following TAA. This increase was correlated with the medial-lateral position of the tibial implant.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This finding could have clinical implications for how tibial components are positioned during the operative procedure, and how implant design and position may affect ankle kinematics following TAA."
pub.1116016079,The ‘critical trochanter angle’: a predictor for stem alignment in total hip arthroplasty,"IntroductionStem malalignment can affect offset reconstruction and may result in gluteal muscle insufficiency. In this retrospective study, a novel geometric angle named ‘critical trochanter angle’ (CTA) is described and investigated towards the risk of malposition of a collarless straight tapered hydroxyapatite-coated stem in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).Material and methodsA total of 100 cementless THA were implanted in patients with unilateral coxarthrosis via the direct anterior (n = 50) or direct lateral Hardinge approach (n = 50) in a two surgeon setting using the Corail® or Trendhip® stem (DePuy Synthes or Aesculap). Stem alignment was analysed in postoperative AP pelvic radiographs and correlated to the CTA: the angle crest was defined by the intersection of the femoral shaft and neck axis and the angle was measured between the shaft axis and a leg intersecting the vertex between the lateral and superoposterior facet of the trochanter.ResultsForty-seven stems were implanted in varus (≥ + 1°), 42 in neutral (< + 1°/> − 1°) and 11 in valgus position (≤ − 1°). The mean critical trochanter angle was 25.0° (SD ± 7.5°), and there was a negative and statistically significant correlation to stem alignment (r = − 0.52; p ≤ 0.001) independent from the surgical approach. For stem malposition of 2° and above (n = 23), mean CTA was 17.2° for varus (n = 20) and 31.6° for valgus (n = 3). A CTA lesser or equal to 22.75° had a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 80% for varus stem position of 2° or greater. Specificity raised to 100% with a cutoff CTA of 12.5° or lesser.ConclusionVarus stem alignment in THA is associated with coxa vara deformity and a radiological low CTA. In preoperative planning, the critical trochanter angle can help to evaluate the risk for intraoperative stem malpositioning. If navigation or robotic assistance is not available when using this stem design, we recommend an intraoperative x-ray to verify correct implant positioning in patients with a CTA under 20° or above 30°."
pub.1111154988,Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients With Extra-Articular Deformity: Restoration of Mechanical Alignment Using Accelerometer-Based Navigation System,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with post-traumatic extra-articular deformity (EAD) is difficult to manage using conventional instrumentation techniques. In this study, we evaluate whether accelerometer navigation system can be a valuable option to make accurate bone resections and restore the neutral mechanical axis in complex TKA patients with EAD.
METHODS: From May 2015 to June 2017, 18 consecutive TKA were performed in 18 patients with knee osteoarthritis with associated EAD. An accelerometer-based navigation system was used to guide tibial and femoral resection in the coronal and sagittal plane. Postoperative lower limb alignment in coronal plane and component position in coronal and sagittal plane was measured through full-leg weight-bearing X-ray. Clinical score were recorded using the Knee Society Score at the final follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean hip-knee-ankle angle was 0.9° ± 1.4° varus alignment. The coronal alignment of the femoral component was 89.2° ± 1.9°, and the coronal alignment of the tibial component was 89.4° ± 2.1°. The sagittal alignment of the femoral component was 93.2°± 1.9°, and the sagittal alignment of the tibial component was 84.4° ± 3.1°. At the final follow-up, the Knee Society Score was 89 points (range, 82-100), and the functional score was 86.7 points (range, 60-100). No intraoperative and postoperative surgical complications were reported using this technology.
CONCLUSION: Accelerometer-based navigation is accurate in achieving neutral mechanical alignment and optimal implant position after TKA in patients with EAD. This system should be considered a valuable option to the more complex technique of computer navigation or robotic surgery."

pub.1012736542,Comparison of Robotic-assisted and Conventional Acetabular Cup Placement in THA: A Matched-pair Controlled Study,"BackgroundImproper acetabular component orientation in THA has been associated with increased dislocation rates, component impingement, bearing surface wear, and a greater likelihood of revision. Therefore, any reasonable steps to improve acetabular component orientation should be considered and explored.Questions/purposesWe therefore sought to compare THA with a robotic-assisted posterior approach with manual alignment techniques through a posterior approach, using a matched-pair controlled study design, to assess whether the use of the robot made it more likely for the acetabular cup to be positioned in the safe zones described by Lewinnek et al. and Callanan et al.MethodsBetween September 2008 and September 2012, 160 THAs were performed by the senior surgeon. Sixty-two patients (38.8%) underwent THA using a conventional posterior approach, 69 (43.1%) underwent robotic-assisted THA using the posterior approach, and 29 (18.1%) underwent radiographic-guided anterior-approach THAs. From September 2008 to June 2011, all patients were offered anterior or posterior approaches regardless of BMI and anatomy. Since introduction of the robot in June 2011, all THAs were performed using the robotic technique through the posterior approach, unless a patient specifically requested otherwise. The radiographic cup positioning of the robotic-assisted THAs was compared with a matched-pair control group of conventional THAs performed by the same surgeon through the same posterior approach. The safe zone (inclination, 30°–50°; anteversion, 5°–25°) described by Lewinnek et al. and the modified safe zone (inclination, 30°–45°; anteversion, 5°–25°) of Callanan et al. were used for cup placement assessment. Matching criteria were gender, age ± 5 years, and (BMI) ± 7 units. After exclusions, a total of 50 THAs were included in each group. Strong interobserver and intraobserver correlations were found for all radiographic measurements (r > 0.82; p < 0.001).ResultsOne hundred percent (50/50) of the robotic-assisted THAs were within the safe zone described by Lewinnek et al. compared with 80% (40/50) of the conventional THAs (p = 0.001). Ninety-two percent (46/50) of robotic-assisted THAs were within the modified safe zone described by Callanan et al. compared with 62% (31/50) of conventional THAs p (p = 0.001). The odds ratios for an implanted cup out of the safe zones of Lewinnek et al. and Callanan et al. were zero and 0.142, respectively (95% CI, 0.044, 0.457).ConclusionsUse of the robot allowed for improvement in placement of the cup in both safe zones, an important parameter that plays a significant role in long-term success of THA. However, whether the radiographic improvements we observed will translate into clinical benefits for patients—such as reductions in component impingement, acetabular wear, and prosthetic dislocations, or in terms of improved longevity—remains unproven.Level of EvidenceLevel III, therapeutic study.

pub.1144499791,Learning curve and short-term clinical outcomes of Mako robotic-assisted direct anterior approach total hip arthroplasty,"Objective  To explore the learning curve and short-term clinical outcomes of Mako robotic-assisted direct anterior approach total hip arthroplasty (THA).   Methods  The preoperative basic data, surgical information and postoperative rehabilitation of 50 patients who underwent Mako robotic-assisted THA for hip diseases in Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the 6th People′s Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University from December 2018 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively, included operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, postoperative imaging parameters (abduction angle, anteversion angle, lower limb length difference, eccentricity difference) and postoperative hip joint Harris score (hip Harris score, HHS). There were 16 males and 34 females, with a mean age of 50-79(67±10) years. The postoperative clinical results of Mako robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty was analyzed. A cumulative sum analysis (CUSUM) was performed on the operation time (OT). The CUSUM learning curve was modeled by curve fitting and R² was used to testify the goodness. The different phase of the learning curve was compared with several observation indicators.   Results  All patients were followed up for more than 6 months. Two patients had poor wound healing and 5 patients had symptoms of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury, which disappeared within 1-2 months. No serious complications such as dislocation, aseptic loosening, periprosthetic infection or revision occurred in all the patients. The average operation time was (81±16) min, and the intraoperative blood loss was (456±84) ml. The average Harris hip score at the last follow-up was 88.6±2.5. The radiological evaluation showed that the positions of the acetabular cups were all in the Lewinnnek safety zone; the limb length discrepancy was (0.15±0.50) cm, the offset was (-0.11±0.72) cm. The OT decreased with the accumulation of the cases. The CUSUM learning curve was best modeled as cubic curve,the fitting curve reached the top at the 19th case. As a cut-off point, the 19th point divided the learing curve into two phases. There were statistical differences in OT, pelvic array installation time, acetabular registration time, acetabular reaming time (all P <0.05), but there was no significant differences in Harris hip score, acetabular prosthesis anteversion angle and abduction angle between the two groups (all P >0.05).   Conclusions  The learning curve of Mako robot-assisted DAA-THA is about 19 cases. Mako robot-assisted DAA-THA can ensure the accuracy of prosthetic placement and the safety of the operation during the learning curve, and the short-term clinical results after surgery is excellent."
pub.1159753533,Restoration of the native tibial joint line obliquity in total knee arthroplasty with inverse kinematic alignment does not increase knee adduction moments,"PURPOSE: Patient-specific alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has shown promising patient-reported outcome measures; however, the clinical and biomechanical effects of restoring the native knee anatomy remain debated. The purpose of this study was to compare the gait pattern between a mechanically aligned TKA cohort (adjusted mechanical alignment-aMA) and a patient-specific alignment TKA cohort (inverse kinematic alignment-iKA).
METHODS: At two years postoperatively, the aMA and iKA groups, each with 15 patients, were analyzed in a retrospective case-control study. All patients underwent TKA with robotic assistance (Mako, Stryker) through an identical perioperative protocol. The patients' demographics were identical. The control group comprised 15 healthy participants matched for age and gender. Gait analysis was performed with a 3D motion capture system (VICON). Data collection was conducted by a blinded investigator. The primary outcomes were knee flexion during walking, knee adduction moment during walking and spatiotemporal parameters (STPs). The secondary outcomes were the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS).
RESULTS: During walking, the maximum knee flexion did not differ between the iKA group (53.0°) and the control group (55.1°), whereas the aMA group showed lower amplitudes of sagittal motion (47.4°). In addition, the native limb alignment in the iKA group was better restored, and although more in varus, the knee adduction moments in the iKA group were not increased (225 N mm/kg) compared to aMA group (276 N mm/kg). No significant differences in STPs were observed between patients receiving iKA and healthy controls. Six of 7 STPs differed significantly between patients receiving aMA and healthy controls. The OKS was significantly better in patients receiving iKA than aMA: 45.4 vs. 40.9; p = 0.05. The FJS was significantly better in patients receiving iKA than aMA: 84.8 vs. 55.5; p = 0.002.
CONCLUSION: At two years postoperatively, the gait pattern showed greater resemblance to that in healthy controls in patients receiving iKA rather than aMA. The restoration of the native coronal limb alignment does not lead to increased knee adduction moments due to the restoration of the native tibial joint line obliquity.

The control system was implemented on a powered prosthesis and evaluated by a unilateral, transfemoral amputee subject. The ability of the powered prosthesis to provide stair ascent and descent capability was assessed by comparing the gait kinematics, as recorded by a motion capture system, with the kinematics provided by a passive prosthesis, in addition to those recorded from a set of healthy subjects. The results indicate that the powered prosthesis provides gait kinematics that are considerably more representative of healthy gait, relative to the passive prosthesis, for both stair ascent and descent."
pub.1172125298,"Short-Term Outcomes of Total Knee Arthroplasty Using a Conventional, Computer-Assisted, and Robotic Technique: A Pilot Clinical Trial","<b>Background:</b> Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a prevalent surgical procedure for treating severe knee arthritis, aiming to alleviate pain and restore function. Recent advancements have introduced computer-assisted (CAS) and robot-assisted (RA-TKA) surgical techniques as alternatives to conventional methods, promising improved accuracy and patient outcomes. However, comprehensive comparative studies evaluating the short-term outcomes and prostheses survivorship among these techniques are limited. We hypothesized that the outcome of RA-TKA and/or CAS- TKA is advantageous in function and prosthesis survivorship compared to manually implanted prostheses. <b>Methods:</b> This prospective controlled study compared the short-term outcomes and prostheses survivorship following TKA using conventional, CAS, and RA-TKA techniques. One hundred seventy-eight patients requiring TKA were randomly assigned to one of the three surgical groups. The primary outcomes were knee function (KSS knee score) and functional recovery (KSS function score), which were assessed before surgery three years postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included prosthesis alignment, knee range of movements, and complication rates. Survivorship analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves, with revision surgery as the endpoint. <b>Results:</b> While all three groups showed significant improvements in knee function postoperatively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), the CAS and RA-TKA groups demonstrated superior prosthetic alignment and higher survivorship rates than the conventional group (100%, 97%, and 96%, respectively). However, although the RA-TKA group had a maximal 100% survivorship rate, its knee score was significantly lower than following CAS and conventional techniques (mean 91 ± 3SD vs. mean 93 ± 3SD, <i>p</i> = 0.011). <b>Conclusion:</b> The RA-TKA technique offers advantages over conventional and CAS methods regarding alignment accuracy and short-term survivorship of TKA prostheses. Since short-term prosthesis survivorship indicates the foreseen rates of mid- and long-term survivorship, the current data have a promising indication of the improved TKA prosthesis's long-term survivorship by implementing RA-TKA. According to the presented data, although the survival rates were 100%, 97%, and 96% in the three study groups, no clinical difference in the functional outcome was found despite the better mechanical alignment and higher survivorship in the group of patients treated by the RA-TKA."
pub.1146835716,Negligible effect of surgeon experience on the accuracy and time to perform unrestricted caliper verified kinematically aligned TKA with manual instruments,"PURPOSE: Surgeons performing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are interested in the accuracy and time it takes to make the four femoral resections that determine the setting of the femoral component. A method for quantifying the error of each resection is the thickness, measured by a caliper, minus the femoral target. The present study tested the hypothesis that the mean deviation of the resection from the femoral target, the percentage of resections with a deviation of ± 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm, and the time to complete the femoral cuts were not different between experienced (E) and less-experienced (LE) surgeons performing unrestricted caliper verified kinematically aligned (KA) TKA with manual instruments.
METHODS: This study analyzed intraoperative verification worksheets from 203 patients treated by ten E surgeons and 58 patients treated by four LE surgeons. The worksheet recorded (1) the thickness of the femoral target for the distal medial (DM), distal lateral (DL), posterior medial (PM), and posterior lateral (PL) resections and the caliper thickness of the resections with a resolution of 0.5 mm, and (2) the time to complete them. The most accurate resection has a mean difference ± standard deviation of 0 ± 0.0 mm.
RESULTS: The accuracy of the 1044 initial resections (261 patients) was significantly closer to the femoral target for E vs. the LE surgeons: 0.0 ± 0.4 vs. - 0.3 ± 0.5 for the DM, 0.0 ± 0.5 vs. - 0.4 ± 0.6 for the DL, - 0.1 ± 0.5 vs. - 0.2 ± 0.5 PM, and - 0.1 ± 0.5 vs. - 0.4 ± 0.6 for the PL resections (p ≤ 0.0248). E surgeons completed the femoral resections in 12 min; 5 min faster than LE surgeons (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Because the mean difference in femoral resections with manual instruments for E vs. LE surgeons was < 0.5 mm which is within the caliper's resolution, differences in accuracy were not clinically relevant. Surgeons exploring other alignment options and robotic, navigation, and patient-specific instrumentation might find these values helpful when deciding to change.

pub.1175623913,Better restoration of joint line obliquity in tibia first restricted kinematic alignment versus mechanical alignment TKA,"IntroductionIn total knee arthroplasty (TKA), suboptimal restoration of joint line obliquity (JLO) and joint line height (JLH) may lead to diminished implant longevity, increased risk of complications, and reduced patient reported outcomes. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) leads to improved restoration of JLO and JLH compared to mechanical alignment (MA) in TKA.Materials and MethodsThis retrospective study assessed patients who underwent single implant design TKA for primary osteoarthritis, either MA with manual instrumentation or rKA assisted with imageless navigation robotic arm TKA. Pre- and post-operative long standing AP X-ray imaging were used to measure JLO formed between the proximal tibial joint line and the floor. JLH was measured as the distance from the femoral articular surface to the adductor tubercle.ResultsOverall, 200 patients (100 patients in each group) were included. Demographics between the two groups including age, sex, ASA, laterality, and BMI did not significantly differ. Distribution of KL osteoarthritis classification was similar between the groups. For the MA group, pre- to post-operative JLO significantly changed (2.94° vs. 2.31°, p = 0.004). No significant changes were found between pre- and post-operative JLH (40.6 mm vs. 40.6 mm, p = 0.89). For the rKA group, no significant changes were found between pre- and post-operative JLO (2.43° vs. 2.30°, p = 0.57). Additionally, no significant changes were found between pre- and post-operative JLH (41.2 mm vs. 42.4 mm, p = 0.17). Pre- to post-operative JLO alteration was five times higher in the MA group compared to the rKA group, although this comparison between groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09).ConclusionrKA-TKA results in high restoration accuracy of JLO and JLH, and demonstrates less pre- and post-operative JLO alteration compared to MA-TKA. With risen interest in joint line restoration accuracy with kinematic alignment, these findings suggest potential advantages compared to MA. Future investigation is needed to correlate between joint line restoration accuracy achieved by rKA and enhanced implant longevity, reduced risk of post-operative complications, and heightened patient satisfaction."
pub.1075284568,Accuracy evaluation of a shape-based registration method for a computer navigation system for total knee arthroplasty.,"This study evaluated the effect of computed tomography (CT) slice thickness, reconstruction pitch, intraoperative data sampling area, and data sampling volume on the accuracy of registration and determined a clinically acceptable trade-off between accuracy and surgical invasiveness. One cadaveric femur and one cadaveric tibia were used. Computed tomography of the femur and tibia were obtained using a helical scanner. Three sets of slice thickness and slice pitch were chosen for data acquisition, and two additional sets of reconstructed data were made. Bone contours were extracted by removing surrounding substrate. Surface models of bones were made from the resulting data. Registration of surface models to real objects was performed by measuring the position of various surface points on various areas of each object using an OPTOTRAK pen-probe (Northern Digital Inc, Ontario, Canada). The following trade-off is proposed as clinically optimal: perform CT with 3-mm slice thickness and 1-mm reconstruction pitch, and sample a periarticular area of 30 sampling points. The accuracy of registration in terms of position and angle was 0.8 mm and 0.6 degrees of bias with 0.2 mm and 0.3 degrees of root-mean-square in the femur, and 0.5 mm and 0.4 degrees of bias with 0.2 mm and 0.3 degrees of root-mean-square in the tibia."
pub.1071720122,"Computer-assisted TKA: greater precision, doubtful clinical efficacy: opposes.","Despite improved precision of component placement and consistent and accurate restoration of neutral limb alignment, controversy persists regarding the clinical benefits of computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Computer-assisted TKA provides excellent information regarding gap equality and symmetry throughout the knee range of motion and allows precise, quantitative soft tissue release for deformities, especially in knees with severe flexion contractures and severe rigid valgus deformities. Hence accurate restoration of gap balance, joint line, and posterior femoral offset consequently improves functional results. Knee arthritis with complex extra-articular deformities and in situ hardware can be tackled appropriately using computer navigation where conventional techniques may be inadequate. It also allows intra-articular correction for extra-articular deformities due to malunions and facilitates extra-articular correction in cases with severe extra-articular tibial deformities. In obese patients, where the alignment of the limb is difficult to assess, computer navigation improves accuracy and reduces the number of outliers. The ability to quantify the precise amount of bone cuts and soft tissue releases needed to equalize gaps and restore alignment, reduced blood loss, and incidence of systemic emboli improves the safety of the procedure and hastens functional recovery of the patient. Hence, computer-assisted TKA not only provides greater precision, but also greater clinical benefit."
pub.1026245333,Can in vitro systems capture the characteristic differences between the flexion–extension kinematics of the healthy and TKA knee?,"In vitro systems provide a powerful means to evaluate the efficacy of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in restoring normal knee kinematics. The Oxford knee rig (OKR) and the robotic knee testing system (RKTS) represent two systems that have been extensively used to study TKA biomechanics. Nonetheless, a frequently asked question is whether in vitro simulations can capture the in vivo behavior of the knee. Here, we compared the flexion-extension kinematics of intact knees and knees after TKA tested on the OKR and RKTS, to results of representative in vivo studies. The goal was to determine if the in vitro systems could capture the key kinematic features of knees in healthy subjects and TKA patients. Results showed that the RKTS and the OKR can replicate the femoral rollback and 'screw home' tibial rotation between 0 degrees and 30 degrees flexion seen in healthy subjects, and the reduced femoral rollback and absence of 'screw home' motion in TKA patients. The RKTS also replicated the overall internally rotated position of the tibia beyond 30 degrees flexion. However, ability of the OKR to replicate the internally rotated position of the knee beyond 30 degrees flexion was inconsistent. These data could aid in validation of new in vitro systems and physiologic interpretations of in vitro results."
pub.1040671614,Computer- and Robot-Assisted Total Knee Replacement: Analysis of a New Surgical Procedure,"This paper describes a nonstandard procedure for total knee replacement (TKR), based on the use of modern tools such as computers, electronic sensors, and robots, to achieve accurate and optimal implant results. The intervention is planned on a standard PC connected to the CT scanner. Dedicated software shows the surgeon limb alignment and knee status and assists in the choice of the best prosthesis. The intervention is then performed with a new device and surgical procedure. At first the femur and the tibia are fixed to the operating table with a special clamp and the knee bones are exposed with the standard technique; then the surgeon digitizes the shape of the joint and the computer transfers the planned surgical strategy to a dedicated surgical robot. Resections are performed by the surgeon on a constrained guide held by the robot. In this paper we summarize the main results on the system performances, and discuss the clinical implications of this new technology in the operating room. Preliminary experiments on cadavers and volunteers show that this methodology can improve the accuracy of the implant to 2.5 mm and 2°, reduce operating time and surgical errors, and may represent a challenging alternative methodology for TKR. © 2000 Biomedical Engineering Society.PAC00: 0707Tw, 8780-y"
pub.1158147757,Weight-shifting-based robot control system improves the weight-bearing rate and balance ability of the static standing position in hip osteoarthritis patients: a randomized controlled trial focusing on outcomes after total hip arthroplasty,"Background: After a total hip arthroplasty (THA), standing and walking balance are greatly affected in the early stages of recovery, so it is important to increase the weight-bearing amount (WBA) on the operated side. Sometimes, traditional treatments may not be enough to improve WBA and weight-bearing ratio (WBR) on the operated side in a satisfactory way. To solve this problem, we came up with a new weight-shifting-based robot control system called LOCOBOT. This system can control a spherical robot on a floor by changing the center of pressure (COP) on a force-sensing board in rehabilitation after THA. The goal of this study was to find out how rehabilitation with the LOCOBOT affects the WBR and balance in a static standing position in patients with unilateral hip osteoarthritis (OA) who had a primary uncemented THA.
Methods: This randomized controlled trial included 20 patients diagnosed with Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade 3 or 4 hip OA on the operative side and K-L grade 0 normal hip on the nonoperative side. We used the minimization method for allocation and randomly assigned patients to either the LOCOBOT group or the control group. As a result, 10 patient seach were randomly assigned to the LOCOBOT and control groups. Both groups received 40 min of rehabilitation treatment. Out of the 40 min, the LOCOBOT group underwent treatment for 10 min with LOCOBOT. The control group performed COP-controlled exercises on a flat floor instead of using LOCOBOT for 10 of the 40 min. All theoutcome measures were performed pre-THA and 11.9 ± 1.6 days after THA (12 days after THA). The primary outcome measure included WBR in the static standing position.
Results: After12 days of THA, the LOCOBOT group exhibited significantly higher mean WBR and WBA (operated side) values than the control group. Furthermore, the LOCOBOT group exhibited significantly lower mean WBA (non-operated side) and outer diameter area (ODA) values than the control group. From pre-THA to 12 days after THA, the LOCOBOT group exhibited a significant improvement in mean WBR and WBA (operated side). Moreover, the mean WBA (non-operated side) and ODA significantly decreased. From pre-THA to 12 days after THA, the control group showed a significant increase in total trajectory length and ODA.
Conclusions: The most important finding of this study was that patients were able to perform the LOCOBOT exercise as early as the second day after THA, and that WBR and ODA significantly improved by the 12th day after THA. This result demonstrated that the LOCOBOT effectively improves WBR in a short period of time after THA and is a valuable system for enhancing balance ability. This expedites the acquisition of independence in activities of daily living after THA and may contribute to optimizing the effectiveness of medical care."
pub.1120168020,"Does Robotic-assisted TKA Result in Better Outcome Scores or Long-Term Survivorship Than Conventional TKA? A Randomized, Controlled Trial.","BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted TKA was introduced to enhance the precision of bone preparation and component alignment with the goal of improving the clinical results and survivorship of TKA. Although numerous reports suggest that bone preparation and knee component alignment may be improved using robotic assistance, no long-term randomized trials of robotic-assisted TKA have shown whether this results in improved clinical function or survivorship of the TKA.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this randomized trial, we compared robotic-assisted TKA to manual-alignment techniques at long-term follow-up in terms of (1) functional results based on Knee Society, WOMAC, and UCLA Activity scores; (2) numerous radiographic parameters, including component and limb alignment; (3) Kaplan-Meier survivorship; and (4) complications specific to robotic-assistance, including pin-tract infection, peroneal nerve palsy, pin-site fracture, or patellar complications.
METHODS: This study was a registered prospective, randomized, controlled trial. From January 2002 to February 2008, one surgeon performed 975 robotic-assisted TKAs in 850 patients and 990 conventional TKAs in 849 patients. Among these patients 1406 patients were eligible for participation in this study based on prespecified inclusion criteria. Of those, 100% (1406) patients agreed to participate and were randomized, with 700 patients (750 knees) receiving robotic-assisted TKA and 706 patients (766 knees) receiving conventional TKA. Of those, 96% (674 patients) in the robotic-assisted TKA group and 95% (674 patients) in the conventional TKA group were available for follow-up at a mean of 13 (± 5) years. In both groups, no patient older than 65 years was randomized because we anticipated long-term follow-up. We evaluated 674 patients (724 knees) in each group for clinical and radiographic outcomes, and we examined Kaplan-Meier survivorship for the endpoint of aseptic loosening or revision. Clinical evaluation was performed using the original Knee Society knee score, the WOMAC score, and the UCLA activity score preoperatively and at latest follow-up visit. We also assessed loosening (defined as change in the position of the components) using plain radiographs, osteolysis using CT scans at the latest follow-up visit, and component, and limb alignment on mechanical axis radiographs. To minimize the chance of type-2 error and increase the power of our study, we assumed the difference in the Knee Society score to be 25 points to match the MCID of the Knee Society score with a SD of 5; to be able to detect a difference of this size, we calculated that a total of 628 patients would be needed in each group in order to achieve 80% power at the α = 0.05 level.
RESULTS: Clinical parameters at the latest follow-up including the Knee Society knee scores (93 ± 5 points in the robotic-assisted TKA group versus 92 ± 6 points in the conventional TKA group [95% confidence interval 90 to 98]; p = 0.321) and Knee Society knee function sco"
pub.1172798420,Maintaining the Physiological Lateral Flexion Gap in the Kinematically Aligned TKA Does Not Compromise Clinical Outcomes at One-Year Follow-Up,"<b>Background:</b> Instability is a common cause of (total knee arthroplasty) TKA failure, which can be prevented by achieving proper gap balance during surgery. There is no consensus on the ideal gap balance in TKA, and different alignment philosophies result in varying soft-tissue tightness. Traditional TKA aims for symmetric compartment balance, while kinematic alignment (KA) restores anatomy and accepts asymmetric flexion gaps. This study evaluated the impact of these philosophies on the flexion gap balance and clinical outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective review of 167 patients who received true or restricted KA robotic-assisted TKA with at least one year of follow-up was conducted. The groups were based on intraoperative flexion gap differences: symmetric (0-1 mm) (n = 94) and asymmetric (2-5 mm) (n = 73). <b>Results:</b> Preoperative demographics and postoperative clinical and functional scores were compared. Both groups were similar in demographics and preoperative scores. True KA alignment was more likely to result in an asymmetric flexion gap, while restricted KA produced symmetric gaps. <b>Conclusions:</b> The study found no adverse effects from the physiological asymmetric flexion gap, with clinical and functional outcomes comparable to symmetric gaps. A 5 mm difference between the medial and lateral gap width did not negatively impact the outcomes. True KA more frequently results in a physiological asymmetric flexion gap."
pub.1084467685,Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty Results in Smaller Acetabular Cup Size in Relation to the Femoral Head Size: A Matched-Pair Controlled Study,"PURPOSE: To compare the acetabular component size relative to the patient's native femoral head size between conventional THA (CTHA) approach and robotic-arm assisted THA (RTHA) to infer which of these techniques preserved more acetabular bone.
METHODS: Patients were included if they had primary osteoarthritis (OA) and underwent total hip replacement between June 2008 and March 2014. Patients were excluded if they had missing or rotated postoperative anteroposterior radiographs. RTHA patients were matched to a control group of CTHA patients, in terms of preoperative native femoral head size, age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and approach. Acetabular cup size relative to femoral head size was used as a surrogate for amount of bone resected. We compared the groups according to 2 measures describing acetabular cup diameter (c) in relation to femoral head diameter (f): (i) c-f, the difference between cup diameter and femoral head diameter and (ii) (c-f)/f, the same difference as a fraction of femoral head diameter.
RESULTS: 57 matched pairs were included in each group. There were no significant differences between groups for demographic measures, femoral head diameter, or acetabular cup diameter (p>0.05). However, measures (i) and (ii) did differ significantly between the groups, with lower values in the RTHA group (p<0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Using acetabular cup size relative to femoral head size as an approximate surrogate measure of acetabular bone resection may suggest greater preservation of bone stock using RTHA compared to CTHA. Further studies are needed to validate the relationship between acetabular cup size and bone loss in THA."
pub.1031076951,Precision freehand sculpting for unicondylar knee replacement: design and experimental validation,"Precision freehand sculpting (PFS), is a hand-held semi-active robotic technology for bone shaping that works within the surgical navigation framework. PFS can alternate between two control modes - one based on control of exposure of the cutting bur and another based on the control of the speed of the cutting bur. In this study we evaluate the performance of PFS in preparing the femoral bone surface for unicondylar knee replacement (UKR). The experiment is designed to prepare a synthetic bone for UKR. The implant was a modified commercial design that allows accurate measurement of the implant position after it is placed on the prepared bone surface. The distal and anterior-distal facets were cut with a 5 mm cylindrical bur using exposure control. The posterior facet and the post holes were cut using a 6-mm spherical bur using speed control. Three users cut five specimens each. The performance was evaluated in terms of the implant fit and the performance time. The average cut times for the first two cuts combined were 4:35 min, and for the posterior cut 3:26 min. The average distance from the planned implant position was 0.54 mm (SD 0.23 mm) and the average angular difference was 1.08° (SD 0.53°)."
pub.1138982499,Current concepts in total knee arthroplasty,"Limb alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) influences periarticular soft-tissue tension, biomechanics through knee flexion, and implant survival. Despite this, there is no uniform consensus on the optimal alignment technique for TKA. Neutral mechanical alignment facilitates knee flexion and symmetrical component wear but forces the limb into an unnatural position that alters native knee kinematics through the arc of knee flexion. Kinematic alignment aims to restore native limb alignment, but the safe ranges with this technique remain uncertain and the effects of this alignment technique on component survivorship remain unknown. Anatomical alignment aims to restore predisease limb alignment and knee geometry, but existing studies using this technique are based on cadaveric specimens or clinical trials with limited follow-up times. Functional alignment aims to restore the native plane and obliquity of the joint by manipulating implant positioning while limiting soft tissue releases, but the results of high-quality studies with long-term outcomes are still awaited. The drawbacks of existing studies on alignment include the use of surgical techniques with limited accuracy and reproducibility of achieving the planned alignment, poor correlation of intraoperative data to long-term functional outcomes and implant survivorship, and a paucity of studies on the safe ranges of limb alignment. Further studies on alignment in TKA should use surgical adjuncts (e.g. robotic technology) to help execute the planned alignment with improved accuracy, include intraoperative assessments of knee biomechanics and periarticular soft-tissue tension, and correlate alignment to long-term functional outcomes and survivorship."
pub.1042634249,Reliability of leg alignment using the OrthoPilot system depends on knee position: a cadaveric study,"Despite the increase in clinical use of navigation systems in total knee arthroplasty, few studies have focused on the reproducibility of these systems. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of knee position and observer experience on intra- and inter-observer agreement in limb alignment assessment with the OrthoPilot system. Limb alignment in the coronal plane and extension range of the knee were assessed in four embalmed cadaveric specimens by five independent observers and measurements were repeated four times to determine intra- and inter-observer agreement, expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Additionally, navigation results were compared against figures from conventional measurement of leg alignment (ground truth). Intra- and inter-observer agreements were excellent for assessing the extension range (ICC, 0.97 and 0.95) and the coronal femuro-tibial axis in knee extension (ICC, 0.92 and 0.88) but were generally worse in knee flexion (ICC, 0.62 and 0.55). There was an increased tendency of intraobserver errors in observers with less clinical experience. Mean correlation with conventional measurements was fair (Spearman's rho 0.61). The OrthoPilot system showed excellent reproducibility for assessment of extension range and coronal limb alignment. However, assessments of coronal limb alignment in flexion were prone to error and caution should be taken when relying on these measurements."
pub.1125064670,Implant placement accuracy in total knee arthroplasty: validation of a CT-based measurement technique,"BACKGROUND: The primary goal of many computer-assisted surgical systems like robotics for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is to accurately execute a preoperative plan. To assess whether the preoperative plan was executed accurately in 3D, one option is to compare the planned and postoperative implant placement using a preoperative and postoperative CT scan of the patient's limb. This comparison requires a 3D-to-3D surface registration between the preoperative and postoperative 3D bone models and between the planned and postoperative 3D implants. Hence, the present study aimed at validating this measurement technique by determining (I) the anatomical regions that result in the lowest 6-degree of freedom (DoF) errors for 3D-to-3D surface registration of bone models, (II) the 6-DoF errors for 3D-to-3D surface registration of the implant models, and (III) the 6-DoF of the complete measurement technique.
METHODS: Four different regions of the femur were tested to determine which one would result in the most accurate 3D-to-3D registration of the bone models using 12 cadaveric lower limb specimens. Next, total knee arthroplasties were performed on six specimens, and the accuracy of the 3D-to-3D implant registration was evaluated against a gold standard registration performed using fiducial markers.
RESULTS: The most accurate 3D-to-3D bone registration was obtained when using the largest anatomical regions available after TKA, being the full 3D femur model or the femur model without the distal femur which resulted in root mean square errors within 0.2 mm for translations and 0.2° for rotation. The accuracy of the 3D-to-3D femoral and tibial implant registration was within 0.7 mm for translations and 0.4°-0.6° for rotations, respectively. The accuracy for the overall procedure was within 0.9 mm and 0.6° for both femur and tibia when using femoral regions resulting in accurate 3D-to-3D bone registration.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this measurement technique can be used in applications where measurement errors up to 0.9 mm in translations and up to 0.6° in rotations in component placement are acceptable."
pub.1046062452,Anterior tibial post impingement in a posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty,"Despite the numerous long-term success reports of posterior stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA), recent retrieval studies of various PS TKA designs revealed wear and deformation on the anterior side of the tibial post. This study investigated the mechanisms of anterior impingement of the post with the femoral component. Seven cadaveric knees were tested to study kinematics and tibial post biomechanics during simulated heel strike using an in vitro robotic testing system. Intact knee kinematics and in situ anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) forces were determined at hyperextension (0 degree to -9 degrees) and low flexion angles (0 degrees to 30 degrees) under the applied loads. The same knee was reconstructed using a PS TKA. The kinematics and the tibial post contact forces of the TKA were measured under the same loading condition. The ACL in the intact knee carried load and contributed to knee stability at low flexion angles and hyperextension. After TKA, substantial in situ contact forces (252.4 +/- 173 N at 9 degrees of hyperextension) occurred in the tibial post, indicating anterior impingement with the femoral component. Consequently, the TKA showed less posterior femoral translation compared to the intact knee after the impingement. At 9 degrees of hyperextension, the medial condyle of the intact knee translated 0.1 +/- 1.1 mm whereas the medial condyle of the TKA knee translated 5.6 +/- 6.9 mm anteriorly. The lateral condyle of the intact knee translated 1.5 +/- 1.0 mm anteriorly whereas the lateral condyle of the TKA knee translated 2.1 +/- 5.8 mm anteriorly. The data demonstrated that anterior tibial post impingement functions as a substitute for the ACL during hyperextension, contributing to anterior stability. However, anterior post impingement may result in additional polyethylene wear and tibial post failure. Transmitted impingement forces might cause backside wear and component loosening. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the tibial post function at low flexion angles may help to further improve component design and surgical techniques and thus enhance knee stability and component longevity after TKA."
pub.1130545194,A cadaver-based biomechanical model of acetabulum reaming for surgical virtual reality training simulators,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a highly successful surgical procedure, but complications remain, including aseptic loosening, early dislocation and misalignment. These may partly be related to lacking training opportunities for novices or those performing THA less frequently. A standardized training setting with realistic haptic feedback for THA does not exist to date. Virtual Reality (VR) may help establish THA training scenarios under standardized settings, morphology and material properties. This work summarizes the development and acquisition of mechanical properties on hip reaming, resulting in a tissue-based material model of the acetabulum for force feedback VR hip reaming simulators. With the given forces and torques occurring during the reaming, Cubic Hermite Spline interpolation seemed the most suitable approach to represent the nonlinear force–displacement behavior of the acetabular tissues over Cubic Splines. Further, Cubic Hermite Splines allowed for a rapid force feedback computation below the 1 ms hallmark. The Cubic Hermite Spline material model was implemented using a three-dimensional-sphere packing model. The resulting forces were delivered via a human–machine-interaction certified KUKA iiwa robotic arm used as a force feedback device. Consequently, this novel approach presents a concept to obtain mechanical data from high-force surgical interventions as baseline data for material models and biomechanical considerations; this will allow THA surgeons to train with a variety of machining hardness levels of acetabula for haptic VR acetabulum reaming."
pub.1078503772,Recognition-based segmentation and registration method for image guided shoulder surgery,"For any image guided surgery, independently of the technique which is used (navigation, templates, robotics), it is necessary to get a 3D bone surface model from CT or MR images. Such model is used for planning, registration and visualization. We report that graphical representation of patient bony structure and the surgical tools, interconnectively with the tracking device and patient-to-image registration are crucial components in such a system. For Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA), there are many challenges, The most of cases that we are working with are pathological cases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis disease. The CT images of these cases often show a fusion area between the glenoid cavity and the humeral head. They also show severe deformations of the humeral head surface that result in a loss of contours. This fusion area and image quality problems are also amplified by well-known CT-scan artifacts like beam-hardening or partial volume effects. The state of the art shows that several segmentation techniques, applied to CT-Scans of the shoulder, have already been disclosed. Unfortunately, their performances, when used on pathological data, are quite poor [1, 2]. The aim of this paper is to present a new image guided surgery system based on CT scan of the patient and using bony structure recognition, morphological analysis for the operated region and robust image-to-patient registration."
pub.1133720068,"Neue Technologien (Robotik, „custom made“) in der unikondylären Endoprothetik – Pro","BackgroundUnicondylar knee arthroplasty offers the advantage that partial degenerative changes can be addressed with partial prosthetic solutions, thus preserving as much of the native joint as possible, including the cruciate ligaments. On the other hand, the number of revisions is still higher than for total knee endoprosthetics. In the literature, the causes mentioned are insufficient fit of the components as well as surgical errors. The use of new technologies to achieve a better fit and higher surgical precision and reproducibility, therefore, represents a promising approach.Individual endoprostheticsIndividual endoprosthetics offers the advantage that the prosthesis is adapted to the individual anatomy of each patient and not the patient’s anatomy to the prosthesis, as is the case with standard prostheses. This allows for an optimal fit of the prosthesis while avoiding excessive bone resections and soft tissue releases.RoboticsThe use of robotics in endoprosthetics makes it easier to correctly perform bone resections and align components. This ensures high and reproducible precision even for surgeons with lower case numbers. Studies on individual unicondylar endoprosthetics and robotics are reporting promising results. However, long-term results of high-quality randomized studies must be awaited in order to make a scientifically sound statement."
pub.1140214098,How Large a Study Is Needed to Detect TKA Revision Rate Reductions Attributable to Robotic or Navigated Technologies? A Simulation-based Power Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Robotic and navigated TKA procedures have been introduced to improve component placement precision in the hope of improving implant survivorship and other clinical outcomes. Although numerous comparative studies have shown enhanced precision and accuracy in placing components, most comparative studies have not shown that such interventions result in improved implant survival. Given what we know about effect sizes from large arthroplasty registries, large cohort studies, and large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we wondered how large randomized trials would need to be to detect such small differences, and if the number is very high, what that would tell us about the value of these treatments for preventing revision surgery.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this simulation study, we asked: Given that survivorship differences between technology-assisted TKA (TA-TKA, which we defined as either navigated or robot-assisted TKA) and conventional TKA are either small or absent based on large arthroplasty registries, large cohort studies, and large RCTs, how large would randomized trials need to be to detect small differences between TA-TKA and conventional TKA if they exist, and how long would the follow-up period need to be to have a reasonable chance to detect those differences?
METHODS: We used estimated effect sizes drawn from previous clinical and registry studies, combined with estimates of the accuracy and precision of various navigation and robotic systems, to model and simulate the likely outcomes of potential comparative clinical study designs. To characterize the ranges of patients enrolled and general follow-up times associated with traditional RCT studies, we conducted a structured search of previously published studies evaluating the effect of robotics and navigation on revision rates compared with that of conventional TKA. The structured search of the University of British Columbia's library database (which automatically searches medical publication databases such as PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science) and subsequent searching through included studies' reference lists yielded 103 search results. Only clinical studies assessing implant survival differences between patient cohorts of TA-TKA and conventional TKA were included. Studies analyzing registry data, using cadaver specimens, assessing revision TKA, conference proceedings, and preprint services were excluded. Twenty studies met all our inclusion criteria, but only one study reported a statistically significant difference between the conventional and robotic or navigated groups. Next, we generated a large set of patients with simulated TKA (1.5 million), randomly assigning each simulated patient a set of patient-specific factors (age at the index surgery, gender, and BMI) drawn from data from registries and published information. We divided this set of simulated procedures into four groups, each associated with a coronal alignment precision reported for different types "
pub.1023788309,Surgeon opinion on new technologies in orthopaedic surgery,"Technological advances such as computer navigation systems and robotics, including support systems for minimally invasive surgery, have the potential to revolutionise how orthopaedic surgery is carried out. However uptake has so far been limited. Increased awareness of user requirements in adoption decision-making will be useful. In this regard, the opinion of the individual surgeon regarding his or her willingness to engage in a novel technology has rarely been garnished. This paper analyses the opinions of orthopaedic consultants from the UK and USA about technological advances in hip and knee arthroplasty, factors contributing to successful short-term and long-term surgical outcome, and patient preferences. The survey, using a web-based questionnaire, was carried out in 2006-2007 and followed up in 2010. The results of this research give a greater insight into why surgical technologies that have the potential to improve patient outcome are not more speedily adopted in the health service."
pub.1079026526,Designing and Testing a Hybrid Lightweight Shoulder Prosthesis,"Lightweight prostheses are preferred in terms of usability in daily living. However, this is not a property easy to realize, especially for shoulder prostheses. High portability, multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) with an appropriate ROM (range of motion), sufficient end-effector power, and suitable viscoelasticity for the safe use in daily living, usually result in a heavy weight. In this paper, a hybrid shoulder prosthesis that combined servo motors and pneumatic elastic actuators, with a weight distribution scheme, was designed to meet the requirements. The prosthetic system was preliminarily tested by comparing its ADL (activities of daily living) motion data with that of an intact arm. The experiment results showed that the shoulder prosthesis could reproduce the motion of an intact arm, thus demonstrate its usability in daily living. "

We advocate for better interpretable algorithms which can help both the patients and surgeons alike."
pub.1106523771,Does Robotic Milling For Stem Implantation in Cementless THA Result in Improved Outcomes Scores or Survivorship Compared with Hand Rasping? Results of a Randomized Trial at 10 Years,"BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted THA has been promoted as potentially advantageous due to the precision it may afford when machining the proximal femur. However, few reports have compared the long-term clinical results of robotic techniques for femoral component insertion during THA regarding clinical outcomes scores or loosening.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to compare results from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) at a minimum followup of 10 years between robot-assisted and hand-rasped stem implantation techniques with regard to (1) Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) clinical outcomes scores, and (2) aseptic loosening, revision surgery, and heterotopic ossification.
METHODS: This is a concise followup of a previously reported RCT. In that trial, robot-assisted primary THA was performed on 75 hips (69 patients), and a hand-rasping technique was used on 71 hips (61 patients). Five experienced surgeons at two institutions participated in this trial; all THAs were performed through the posterolateral approach and the patients were treated similarly apart from the method used to prepare the femur. In all, 115 of 130 (88%) of patients initially randomized were available for followup at a minimum of 10 years (mean, 135 months; range, 120-152 months). There was no differential loss to followup between the study groups, and the final study groups here included 64 hips in 59 patients in the robotic group, and 64 hips in 56 patients in the hand-milling group. There were no differences between the study groups in terms of age, sex, diagnosis, body-mass index, or baseline JOA scores. The primary study endpoint was the JOA score, which is scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better function and less pain. Secondary outcomes were revision surgery, and radiographic signs of aseptic loosening and heterotopic ossification as assessed using the four-grade Brooker scale by individuals other than the operating surgeon.
RESULTS: At a minimum of 10 years postoperatively, there were no differences between patients treated with robot-assisted surgery or hand rasping in JOA scores (97 ± 5 versus 96 ± 7, mean difference 1.4; p = 0.159). No stems in either group developed aseptic loosening, and there were no revisions in either group. There was no difference between the groups in heterotopic ossification (19 of 64 [30%] in the robot-assisted group versus 12 of 64 [19%] in the hand-rasping group; p = 0.186), severe heterotopic ossification was uncommon in both groups, and no hips developed Grade 4 heterotopic ossification in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically and radiographically, THAs performed with robotic milling for stem implantation did not result in better 10-year clinical outcomes scores, or a lower risk of loosening or revision, compared with hand-rasping. We recommend against widespread adoption of robotic milling for stem implantation in primary cementless THAs.

pub.1152784552,[Effectiveness analysis of MAKO robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty via direct anterior approach for bony fused hips].,"Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of MAKO robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) via direct anterior approach (DAA) for bony fused hips in ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
Methods: Between June 2021 and January 2022, MAKO robotic-arm assisted THA via DAA was applied to treat 10 cases (12 hips) of AS with bony fused hips. There were 7 males and 3 females; the age ranged from 30 to 71 years, with an average age of 42.4 years. The duration of AS was 12-35 years, with an average of 21.4 years. The preoperative hip was ankylosed in flexion in 3 cases, with a flexion angle of 20°, 30°, 35°, respectively; 9 cases were ankylosed in extension. The operation time and complications were recorded; the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Harris score, and Oxford hip scale (OHS) score before and after operation, and postoperative range of motion (flexion, extension, internal rotation, external rotation, adduction, and abduction) were used to evaluate the recovery of joint function; according to the postoperative anteroposterior X-ray film and CT scan of both hip joints, the abduction angle, anteversion angle, the difference between bilateral combined off-set and the lower limb length discrepancy were measured.
Results: The operation time ranged from 80 to 190 minutes (mean, 134.6 minutes). All 10 patients were followed up 5-11 months (mean, 7.4 months). There was no serious adverse events such as incision infection, deep vein thrombosis of lower extremities, hip redislocation, aseptic loosening of the prosthesis, or death. At 5 months after operation, the acetabular prosthesis angle of abduction was 37°-45° (mean, 40.3°), anteversion angle was 9°-20° (mean, 15.8°). The difference between bilateral combined off-set was 0-10 mm (mean, 4.3 mm); the lower limb length discrepancy was 0-12 mm (mean, 3.5 mm). At last follow-up, the average range of motion of the hip joint was 89.2° in flexion (range, 80°-100°), 1.7° in extension (range, -5°-10°), 7.1° in internal rotation (range, 0°-15°), 20.4° in external rotation (range, 10°-30°), 7.9° in adduction (range, 0°-20°), and 16.5° in abduction (range, 10°-25°). At last follow-up, the VAS score, Harris score, and OHS score significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05).
Conclusion: The MAKO robotic-arm assisted THA via DAA can achieve satisfactory results in the treatment of AS with bony fused hip, which has the advantages of accurate prosthesis installation, soft tissue release, and less trauma during operation."
pub.1127343635,Robot-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty for Arthrodesed Hips,"BACKGROUND: Conversion of arthrodesed hips to total hip arthroplasty (THA) remains technically demanding. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of robot-assisted THA in arthrodesed hips.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 45 ankylosing spondylitis patients with hip arthrodesis in the Chinese PLA General Hospital between August 2018 and August 2019. All surgeries were carried out by one single surgeon. The patients were followed at 3 months after surgery. Gender, body mass index, angle of hip arthrodesis, operating time, intraoperative fluoroscopic times, postoperative length of hospitalization, cup positioning, postoperative leg length discrepancy, offset discrepancy, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and postoperative Harris Hip Score were collected for all patients.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (35 hips) who underwent robot-assisted THA and 23 patients (37 hips) who underwent manual THA were enrolled in this study. There were no significant differences in demographics and arthrodesed angles between the two groups. The fluoroscopic times during manual THA were significantly higher than those during robot-assisted THA (2.16±1.61 vs 0.47±0.61, respectively, <i>p</i>=0.000). In the robotic group, the percentage of acetabular cups within the safe zone was significantly greater than in the manual group (94.29% vs 67.56%, respectively, <i>p</i>=0.042). For manual THA, the anteversions were significantly different between the left and right sides (21.14±7.86 vs 16.00±6.32, respectively, <i>p</i>=0.042); however, no such significant difference was found in robot-assisted THA.
CONCLUSION: Compared with manual THA for arthrodesed hips, robot-assisted THA had significant advantages in improving the frequency of achieving cup positioning within the target zone with diminished radiation dose and no increase in operating time."
pub.1101671969,Minimally invasive total knee replacement: techniques and results,"In this review, we outlined the definition of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in total knee replacement (TKR) and described the different surgical approaches reported in the literature.
 Afterwards, we went through the most recent studies assessing MIS TKR. Next, we searched for potential limitations of MIS knee replacement and tried to answer the following questions: Are there selective criteria and specific patient selection for MIS knee surgery? If there are, then what are they? After all, a discussion and conclusion completed this article. There is certainly room for MIS or at least less invasive surgery for appropriate selected patients. Nonetheless, there are differences between approaches. Mini-medial parapatellar is easy to master, quick to perform and potentially extendable, whereas mini-subvastus and mini-midvastus are trickier and require more caution related to risk of haematoma and vastus medialis oblique (VMO) nerve damage. Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of mini-incision surgery for TKR does not appear fully adequate for the procedure to be used without special arrangements for consent and for audit or continuing research. There is an argument that a sudden jump from standard TKR to MIS TKR, especially without computer assistance such as navigation, patient-specific instrumentation or robotic, may breach a surgeon’s duty of care towards patients because it exposes patients to unnecessary risks. As a final point, more evidence is required on the long-term safety and efficacy of this procedure which will give objective shed light on real benefits of MIS TKR."
pub.1105282167,Subchondral Pathology: Proceedings of the International Consensus Meeting on Cartilage Repair of the Ankle,"BACKGROUND: The evidence supporting best practice guidelines in the field of cartilage repair of the ankle are based on both low quality and low levels of evidence. Therefore, an international consensus group of experts was convened to collaboratively advance toward consensus opinions based on the best available evidence on key topics within cartilage repair of the ankle. The purpose of this article is to report the consensus statements on ""Subchondral Pathology"" developed at the 2017 International Consensus Meeting on Cartilage Repair of the Ankle.
METHODS: Seventy-five international experts in cartilage repair of the ankle representing 25 countries and 1 territory were convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Questions and statements were drafted within 11 working groups focusing on specific topics within cartilage repair of the ankle, after which a comprehensive literature review was performed and the available evidence for each statement was graded. Discussion and debate occurred in cases where statements were not agreed upon in unanimous fashion within the working groups. A final vote was then held, and the strength of consensus was characterized as follows: consensus, 51% to 74%; strong consensus, 75% to 99%; unanimous, 100%.
RESULTS: A total of 9 statements on subchondral pathology reached consensus during the 2017 International Consensus Meeting on Cartilage Repair of the Ankle. No statements achieved unanimous support, but all statements reached strong consensus (greater than 75% agreement). All statements reached at least 81% agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: This international consensus statements regarding subchondral pathology of the talus derived from leaders in the field will assist clinicians in the assessment and management of this difficult pathology."
pub.1084468963,The Evolution of Computer-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty and Relevant Applications,"In total hip arthroplasty (THA), the accurate positioning of implants is the key to achieve a good clinical outcome. Computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) has been developed for more accurate positioning of implants during the THA. There are passive, semi-active, and active systems in CAOS for THA. Navigation is a passive system that only provides information and guidance to the surgeon. There are 3 types of navigation: imageless navigation, computed tomography (CT)-based navigation, and fluoroscopy-based navigation. In imageless navigation system, a new method of registration without the need to register the anterior pelvic plane was introduced. CT-based navigation can be efficiently used for pelvic plane reference, the functional pelvic plane in supine which adjusts anterior pelvic plane sagittal tilt for targeting the cup orientation. Robot-assisted system can be either active or semi-active. The active robotic system performs the preparation for implant positioning as programmed preoperatively. It has been used for only femoral implant cavity preparation. Recently, program for cup positioning was additionally developed. Alternatively, for ease of surgeon acceptance, semi-active robot systems are developed. It was initially applied only for cup positioning. However, with the development of enhanced femoral workflows, this system can now be used to position both cup and stem. Though there have been substantial advancements in computer-assisted THA, its use can still be controversial at present due to the steep learning curve, intraoperative technical issues, high cost and etc. However, in the future, CAOS will certainly enable the surgeon to operate more accurately and lead to improved outcomes in THA as the technology continues to evolve rapidly."
pub.1068901196,Perspectives on Computer-Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery,"The fundamental goal of computer-assisted surgery is to make orthopaedic surgery patient-specific, minimally invasive, and quantitative. The components of computer-assisted surgery include preoperative imaging and planning, intraoperative execution, and postoperative evaluation. Ideally, these components are integrated such that sophisticated diagnostic technologies are used to create a patient-specific surgical plan. This plan is then programmed into a computer-assisted intraoperative system so that it can be precisely executed. Finally, the patient outcome is tracked longitudinally in a quantitative fashion. Computer-assisted surgery relies on the use of quantitative data rather than surgeon feel and intuition to facilitate clinical decision-making. As surgeons rely more on quantitative feedback, they must establish appropriate specifications for various operations. These specifications should be clinically relevant and must have known targets and tolerances. This overview provides examples of quantitative surgery as applied in navigated total knee replacement and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and in the more recent indication of robotic unicondylar knee replacement. Computer-assisted surgery represents a set of tools that facilitate quantitative surgery. To effectively use these tools, however, one must identify technical specifications that are clinically relevant for the various procedures; these specifications must be associated with known target values and tolerances and must have the capability of being reliably measured by computer-assisted surgery tools. Clinical and basic-science research is necessary to better define technical specifications for navigated procedures."
pub.1135746713,3D‐surface scan based validated new measurement technique of femoral joint line reconstruction in total knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to validate a new joint line measurement technique in total knee arthroplasty for separated assessment of the medial and lateral femoral joint line alteration with 3D-surface scan technology. Separate assessment of the medial and lateral joint line alteration may improve TKA alignment assessment regarding to joint line restoration in kinematic alignment and use of robotic-assisted TKA surgery.
METHODS: The medial and lateral joint line difference after TKA implantation on an artificial bone model was analyzed and compared with a 3D-scan and full femoral radiographs pre- and postoperatively. Radiographic analysis included the perpendicular distance between the most distal point of the medial and lateral condyle and the reproduced preoperative lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA). For evaluation of validity and reliability, radiographs were captured initially with true anteroposterior view and subsequently with combined flexion and rotation malpositioning. Reliability of the introduced measurement technique in between three observers was tested with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
RESULTS: Radiographic measurement showed a mean difference of 0.9 mm on the medial side and 0.6 mm on the lateral side when compared to the 3D-surface scan measurement. The reliability of measurement accuracy was ≤ 1 mm in x-rays with < 10° flexion error regardless to malrotation in these images. The ICC test showed very good reliability for the medial joint line evaluation and good reliability for lateral joint line evaluation (ICC 0.92, ICC 0.86 respectively).
CONCLUSION: The new introduced joint line measurement method showed a sufficient reliability, accuracy and precision. It provides separated information about medial and lateral joint line alteration in TKA surgery in absolute values.

pub.1136774413,Personalized alignment in total knee arthroplasty: current concepts,"Traditionally in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a post-operative neutral alignment was the gold standard. This principle has been contested as functional outcomes were found to be inconsistent. Analysis of limb alignment in the non-osteoarthritic population reveals variations from neutral alignment and consideration of a personalized or patient-specific alignment in TKA is challenging previous concepts. The aim of this review was to clarify the variations of current personalized alignments and to report their results. Current personalized approaches of alignment reported are: kinematic, inverse kinematic, restricted kinematic, and functional. The principle of ""kinematic alignment"" is knee resurfacing with restitution of pre-arthritic anatomy. The aim is to resurface the femur maintaining the native femoral joint line obliquity. The flexion and extension gaps are balanced with the tibial resection. The principle of the ""inverse kinematic alignment"" is to resurface the tibia with similar medial and lateral bone resections in order to keep the native tibial joint line obliquity. Gap balancing is performed by adjusting the femoral resections. To avoid reproducing extreme anatomical alignments there is ""restricted kinematic alignment"" which is a compromise between mechanical alignment and true kinematic alignment with a defined safe zone of alignment. Finally, there is the concept of ""functional alignment"" which is an evolution of kinematic alignment as enabling technology has progressed. This is obtained by manipulating alignment, bone resections, soft tissue releases, and/or implant positioning with a robotic-assisted system to optimize TKA function for a patient's specific alignment, bone morphology, and soft tissue envelope. The aim of personalizing alignment is to restore native knee kinematics and improve functional outcomes after TKA. A long-term follow-up remains crucial to assess both outcomes and implant survivorship of these current concepts."
pub.1131902528,Gait Training Using a Hip-Wearable Robotic Exoskeleton After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Case Report,"The Honda Walking Assist® (HWA) is a light and easy wearable robot device for gait training, which assists patients' hip flexion and extension movements to guide hip joint movements during gait. However, the safety and feasibility of gait training with HWA after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this gait training intervention using HWA for a patient who underwent TKA. The patient was a 76-year-old female who underwent a left TKA. Gait training using HWA was conducted for 18 sessions in total, from 1 to 5 weeks after TKA. To verify the recovery process after TKA surgery, knee function parameters and walking ability were measured at pre-TKA and 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after TKA. The gait patterns at self-selected walking speed (SWS) without HWA at pre- and 5 weeks after TKA were measured by using 3-dimensional (3D) gait analysis. The patient completed a total of 18 gait training interventions with HWA without any adverse complications such as knee pain and skin injury. The postoperative knee extension range of motion (ROM), knee extension torque, SWS, and maximum walking speed were remarkably improved. Regarding gait kinematic parameters, though this patient had a characteristic gait pattern with decreased knee ROM (called stiff knee gait) preoperatively, the knee flexion angle at 5 weeks after TKA showed knee flexion movement at loading response phase (LR; called double knee action), increased knee ROM during gait, and increased knee flexion angle at swing phase. In this case, the gait training using HWA was safe and feasible, and could be effective for the early improvement of gait ability, hip function, and gait pattern after TKA."
pub.1064454673,A semi-active milling procedure in view of preparing implantation beds in robot-assisted orthopaedic surgery,"Bone cutting in total joint reconstructions requires a high accuracy to obtain a well-functioning and long-lasting prosthesis. Hence robot assistance can be useful to increase the precision of the surgical actions. A drawback of current robot systems is that they autonomously machine the bone, in that way ignoring the surgeon's experience and introducing a safety risk. This paper presents a semi-active milling procedure to overcome that drawback. In this procedure the surgeon controls robot motion by exerting forces on a force-controlled lever that is attached to the robot end effector. Meanwhile the robot constrains tool motion to the planned motion and generates a tool feed determined by the feed force that the surgeon executes. As a case study the presented milling procedure has been implemented on a laboratory set-up for robot-assisted preparation of the acetabulum in total hip arthroplasty. Two machining methods have been considered. In the first method the surgeon determines both milling trajectory and feed by the forces that he/she executes on the force-controlled lever. In the second method the cavity is machined contour by contour, and the surgeon only provides the feed. Machining experiments have shown that the first method results in large surface irregularities and is not useful. The second method, however, results in accurate cavity preparation and has therefore potential to be implemented in future robot systems."
pub.1032899058,Posterior stabilized TKA reduce patellofemoral contact pressure compared with cruciate retaining TKA in vitro,"Increased patellofemoral contact pressure was described after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Aim of this in vitro study was to compare the influence of a posterior stabilized (PS) design in comparison to a cruciate retaining (CR) design on patellofemoral contact pressure. Patellofemoral area contact pressure, peak contact pressure and the centre of pressure motion were determined in eight fresh frozen human cadaveric specimens using a Tekscan sensor (K-Scan 4000). A robotic knee simulator was used simulating an isokinetic knee extension cycle from 120 degrees of flexion to full extension. All knees were tested in a first test cycle after implantation of a CR design and in a second test cycle after replacement by a PS design, both using a 11 mm PE inlay (Genesis II, Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA). The patella remained unresurfaced. A paired sampled t test to compare mean values (significance, P < or = 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. After implantation of the PS design, average patellofemoral area contact pressure was significantly lower (P < or = 0.006) compared with the CR design (PS: 3.58 +/- 1.25 MPa; CR: 4.31 +/- 1.40 MPa). Accordingly, average patellofemoral peak contact pressure decreased significantly (P < or = 0.02) with the PS design (6.12 +/- 2.37 MPa) in comparison with the CR design (7.17 +/- 2.41 MPa). On average, the centre of pressure motion was more physiological with the PS design compared to the CR design over the complete extension cycle. However, this was not significant. In conclusion, the data suggest less patellofemoral contact pressure of a posterior stabilized TKA design in comparison to a cruciate retaining design."

Methods  Clinical data of 246 patients undergoing primary unilateral THA from September 2019 to June 2021 in Peking University Third Hospital were retrospectively reviewed, including patients treated with rTHA ( n =113) and conventional THA (cTHA) ( n =133). Thirty-seven male patients along with 76 females were enrolled into the rTHA group with a mean age of (62±9) years. In comparison, the average age of cTHA group was (60±12) years with 59 males and 74 females. The postoperative inclination and anteversion of the acetabular cup and the rate of acetabular cup within the Lewinnek and Callanan ""safe zone"" were documented and analyzed. For the patient with normal or surgically restored contralateral hip, the leg length discrepancy was also measured and compared between the two groups.   Results  The overall mean postoperative inclination and anteversion was 39.0°±5.5° and 14.1°±5.1°, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the rTHA and cTHA group regarding postoperative inclination (39.3°±2.9° vs 38.7°±7.0°, P =0.383) and anteversion (13.4°±4.3° vs 14.7°±5.6°, P =0.054). In rTHA group, 97.3%(110/113) of the cups were implanted within the Lewinnek""safe zone""(75.9%(101/133) in cTHA group) and 94.7%(107/113) were within the Callanan""safe zone""(66.2%(88/133) in cTHA group), and those were both higher in rTHA group (both P <0.01). There was no significant difference in postoperative leg length discrepancy between the two groups ( P =0.445). Meanwhile, 29(23.0%) cases of cTHA group had leg length discrepancy more than 5 mm, and it was 9.7%(9/93) in rTHA group.   Conclusion  It indicated the benefit of rTHA in acetabular cup positioning as well as the leg length restoration."
pub.1147364652,Cadaveric Gait Simulation of the Effect of Subtalar Arthrodesis on Total Ankle Replacement Kinematics,"BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing total ankle replacement (TAR) often have symptomatic adjacent joint arthritis and deformity. Subtalar arthrodesis can effectively address a degenerative and/or malaligned hindfoot, but there is concern that it places abnormal stresses on the TAR and adjacent joints of the foot, potentially leading to early TAR failure. This study hypothesized that ankle and talonavicular joint kinematics would be altered after subtalar arthrodesis in the setting of TAR.
METHODS: Thirteen mid-tibia cadaveric specimens with neutral alignment were tested in a robotic gait simulator. To simulate gait, each specimen was secured to a static mounting fixture about a 6-degree of freedom robotic platform, and a force plate moves relative to the stationary specimen based on standardized gait parameters. Specimens were tested sequentially in TAR and TAR with subtalar arthrodesis (TAR-ST<sub>fuse</sub>). Kinematics and range of motion of the ankle and talonavicular joint were compared between TAR and TAR-ST<sub>fuse</sub>.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in kinematics and range of motion between TAR and TAR-ST<sub>fuse</sub> groups. At the ankle joint, TAR-ST<sub>fuse</sub> had less internal rotation in early-mid stance (<i>P</i> &lt; .05), with decreased range of motion in the sagittal (-2.7 degrees, <i>P</i> = .008) and axial (-1.8 degrees, <i>P</i> = .002) planes in early stance, and increased range of motion in the coronal plane in middle (+1.2 degrees, <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and late (+2.5 degrees, <i>P</i> = .012) stance. At the talonavicular joint, there were significant differences in axial and coronal kinematics in early and late stance (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). Subtalar arthrodesis resulted in significantly decreased talonavicular range of motion in all planes in early and late stance (<i>P</i> &lt; .003).
CONCLUSION: In ankles implanted with the TAR design used in this study, kinematics of the ankle and talonavicular joint were found to be altered after subtalar arthrodesis. Aberrant motion may reflect altered contact mechanics at the prosthesis and increased stress at the bone-implant interface, and affect the progression of adjacent joint arthritis in the talonavicular joint.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings may provide a correlate to clinical studies that have cited hindfoot arthrodesis as a risk factor for TAR failure."

METHODS: The clinical data of 70 patients treated with THA via posterolateral approach between March 2017 and March 2019 who met the selection criteria were retrospectively analyzed. According to different treatment methods, the patients were divided into two groups, 35 were treated with MAKO robotic arm assisted THA (MAKO group) and 35 with traditional THA (THA group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass index, disease duration, etiology, perioperative time, preoperative activity of daily living (ADL) scale index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, walking ability, comorbidities, hemoglobin, and other general data between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, postoperative acetabular abduction and anteversion angles, postoperative length difference of bilateral lower limbs, and proportions of intraoperative blood transfusion, immediate postoperative loading, wound drainage time more than 2 days, and complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. According to the X-ray films at 6 months after operation, the reduction quality was judged. The forgotten joint score, Harris score, and proportions of independent walking and ADL index increased were used to evaluate the function recovery of patients.
RESULTS: Patients in both groups were followed up 6-18 months, with an average of 8 months. There was no significant difference ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05) between the two groups in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, acetabular abduction and anteversion angles, and length difference of both lower limbs at 6 months after operation.

pub.1106677391,ACL Function in Bicruciate-Retaining Total Knee Arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Bicruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty (BCR-TKA) is attracting attention because of the functional and satisfaction outcomes associated with keeping the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) intact. However, knowledge of the functional importance of the ACL after BCR-TKA is limited. We performed a biomechanical investigation of ACL function following BCR-TKA compared with that in the intact knee.
METHODS: We investigated 8 fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees using a 6-degrees-of-freedom robotic system that allowed natural joint motion. Three knee states-intact knee, BCR-TKA, and BCR-TKA with ACL transection (BCR-TKA + ACLT)-were evaluated. For each knee state, the kinematics during passive flexion-extension motion (from 0° to 120°) and anteroposterior laxity at 0°, 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion in response to a 100-N load were investigated. The recorded knee motions of the intact and BCR-TKA knees during each test were repeated after ACLT to calculate the ACL in situ force.
RESULTS: The femur in the BCR-TKA group translated posteriorly and rotated externally during passive knee flexion and was in an anterior position compared with the femur in the intact-knee state. After ACLT, the femur translated posteriorly, compared with the BCR-TKA group, at 0° and 10° (p < 0.05). The anteroposterior laxities of the BCR-TKA and intact knees were comparable at all flexion angles and increased 2-fold or more after ACLT (p < 0.01). The ACL in situ force in the BCR-TKA knees was 2-fold to 6-fold higher than that in the intact knees at 0°, 15°, 90°, and 120° during a passive path (p < 0.05) and equivalent to that in the intact knees under anterior loading.
CONCLUSIONS: The preserved ACL in the BCR-TKA knees was functional, like the ACL in the intact knees, under anterior tibial loading and contributed to good anteroposterior stability. However, the kinematics and ACL in situ force differed between the intact and BCR-TKA knees during passive flexion-extension movements.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgeons may not be able to prevent overtensioning of the ACL during a standardized BCR-TKA procedure, which could potentially limit range of motion."
pub.1126024641,The effect of anterior cruciate ligament resection on knee biomechanics.,"AIMS: The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) resection on flexion-extension gaps, mediolateral soft tissue laxity, maximum knee extension, and limb alignment during primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: This prospective study included 140 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary robotic-arm assisted TKA. All operative procedures were performed by a single surgeon using a standard medial parapatellar approach. Optical motion capture technology with fixed femoral and tibial registration pins was used to assess study outcomes pre- and post-ACL resection with knee extension and 90° knee flexion. This study included 76 males (54.3%) and 64 females (45.7%) with a mean age of 64.1 years (SD 6.8) at time of surgery. Mean preoperative hip-knee-ankle deformity was 6.1° varus (SD 4.6° varus).
RESULTS: ACL resection increased the mean extension gap significantly more than the flexion gap in the medial (mean 1.2 mm (SD 1.0) versus mean 0.2 mm (SD 0.7) respectively; p < 0.001) and lateral (mean 1.1 mm (SD 0.9) versus mean 0.2 mm (SD 0.6) respectively; p < 0.001) compartments. The mean gap differences following ACL resection did not create any significant mediolateral soft tissue laxity in extension (gap difference: mean 0.1 mm (SD 2.4); p = 0.89) or flexion (gap difference: mean 0.2 mm (SD 3.1); p = 0.40). ACL resection did not significantly affect maximum knee extension (change in maximum knee extension = mean 0.2° (SD 0.7°); p = 0.23) or fixed flexion deformity (mean 4.2° (SD 3.2°) pre-ACL release versus mean 3.9° (SD 3.7°) post-ACL release; p = 0.61). ACL resection did not significantly affect overall limb alignment (change in alignment = mean 0.2° valgus (SD 1.0° valgus; p = 0.11).
CONCLUSION: ACL resection creates flexion-extension mismatch by increasing the extension gap more than the flexion gap. However, gap differences following ACL resection do not create any mediolateral soft tissue laxity in extension or flexion. ACL resection does not affect maximum knee extension or overall limb alignment. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2020;102-B(4):442-448."
pub.1139929304,[Effect of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty on femoral rotation alignment and its short-term effectiveness].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the improvement of femoral rotation alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by robotic-arm assisted positioning and osteotomy and its short-term effectiveness.
METHODS: Between June 2020 and November 2020, 60 patients (60 knees) with advanced osteoarthritis of the knee, who met the selection criteria, were selected as the study subjects. Patients were randomly divided into two groups according to the random number table method, with 30 patients in each group. Patients were treated with robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA) in trial group, and with conventional TKA in control group. There was no significant difference in gender, age, side and course of osteoarthritis, body mass index, and the preoperative hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), posterior condylar angle (PCA), knee society score-knee (KSS-K) and KSS-function (KSS-F) scores between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). The clinical (KSS-K, KSS-F scores) and imaging (HKA, LDFA, MPTA, PCA) evaluation indexes of the knee joints were compared between the two groups at 3 months after operation.
RESULTS: All patients were successfully operated. The incisions in the two groups healed by first intention, with no complications related to the operation. Patients in the two groups were followed up 3-6 months, with an average of 3.9 months. KSS-K and KSS-F scores of the two groups at 3 months after operation were significantly higher than those before operation ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). X-ray re-examination showed that the prosthesis was in good position, and no prosthesis loosening or sinking occurred. HKA, MPTA, and PCA significantly improved in both groups at 3 months after operation ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05) except LDFA. There was no significant difference in HKA, LDFA, and MPTA between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). PCA in trial group was significantly smaller than that in control group ( <i>t</i>=2.635, <i>P</i>=0.010).
CONCLUSION: RATKA can not only correct knee deformity, relieve pain, improve the quality of life, but also achieve the goal of restoring accurate femoral rotation alignment. There was no adverse event after short-term follow-up and the effectiveness was satisfactory."
pub.1128103889,What is the impact of patellofemoral joint degeneration and malalignment on patient-reported outcomes after lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty?,"AIMS: It remains controversial whether patellofemoral joint pathology is a contraindication to lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of preoperative radiological degenerative changes and alignment on patient-reported outcome scores (PROMs) after lateral UKA. Secondarily, the influence of lateral UKA on the alignment of the patellofemoral joint was studied.
METHODS: A consecutive series of patients who underwent robotic arm-assisted fixed-bearing lateral UKA with at least two-year follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Radiological evaluation was conducted to obtain a Kellgren Lawrence (KL) grade, an Altman score, and alignment measurements for each knee. Postoperative PROMs were assessed using the Kujala (Anterior Knee Pain Scale) score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Joint Replacement (KOOS JR), and satisfaction levels.
RESULTS: A total of 140 knees (130 patients) were identified for analysis. At mean 4.1 years (2.0 to 8.5) follow-up, good to excellent Kujala scores were reported. The presence of mild to moderate preoperative patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis had no impact on these scores (KL grade 0 vs 1 to 3, p = 0.203; grade 0 to 1 vs 2 to 3, p = 0.674). Comparable scores were reported by patients with osteoarthritis (Altman score of ≥ 2) evident on either the medial or lateral patellofemoral joint facet (medial, p = 0.600 and lateral, p = 0.950). Patients with abnormal patellar congruence and tilt angles (≥ 17° and ≥ 14°, respectively) reported good to excellent Kujala scores. Furthermore, lateral UKA resulted in improvements to patellofemoral alignment.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study demonstrating that mild to moderate preoperative radiological degenerative changes and malalignment of the patellofemoral joint are not associated with poor patient-reported outcomes at mid-term follow-up after lateral fixed-bearing UKA. Our data suggest that this may be explained by realignment of the patella and thereby redistribution of loads across the patellofemoral joint.

pub.1133568759,"Five-day rehabilitation of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty using an end-effector gait robot as a neuromodulation blending tool for deafferentation, weight offloading and stereotyped movement: Interim analysis","Deafferentation and weight offloading can increase brain and spinal motor neuron excitability, respectively. End-effector gait robots (EEGRs) can blend these effects with stereotyped movement-induced neuroplasticity. The authors aimed to evaluate the usefulness of EEGRs as a postoperative neuro-muscular rehabilitation tool. This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients who had undergone unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: one using a 200-step rehabilitation program in an EEGR or the other using a walker on a floor (WF) three times a day for five weekdays. The two groups were compared by electrophysiological and biomechanical methods. Since there were no more enrollments due to funding issues, interim analysis was performed. Twelve patients were assigned to the EEGR group and eight patients were assigned to the WF group. Although the muscle volume of the quadriceps and hamstring did not differ between the two groups, the normalized peak torque of the operated knee flexors (11.28 ± 16.04 Nm/kg) was improved in the EEGR group compared to that of the operated knee flexors in the WF group (4.25 ± 14.26 Nm/kg) (p = 0.04). The normalized compound motor action potentials of the vastus medialis (VM) and biceps femoris (BF) were improved in the EEGR group (p < 0.05). However, the normalized real-time peak amplitude and total, mean area under the curve of VM were decreased during rehabilitation in the EEGR group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between operated and non-operated knees in the EEGR group. Five-day EEGR-assisted rehabilitation induced strengthening in the knee flexors and the muscular reactivation of the BF and VM after TKA, while reducing the real-time use of the VM. This observation may suggest the feasibility of this technique: EEGR modulated the neuronal system of the patients rather than training their muscles. However, because the study was underpowered, all of the findings should be interpreted with the utmost caution."
pub.1167210921,Quantification of the passive behavior of the glenohumeral joint: A biomechanical study,"Shoulder stabilization and arthroplasty procedures aim to restore the complex motion innate to the glenohumeral joint relying on proper tensioning of the surrounding soft-tissues at the time of surgery. Joint instability remains a leading cause for revisions of these procedures necessitating a deeper understanding of the passive constraint of the intact glenohumeral joint. The current literature lacks comprehensive analysis of the passive glenohumeral joint in all degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The objective of the present study is to better understand this complex joint by quantifying the passive laxity of the glenohumeral joint in multiple DOFs over a range of motion. Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested in the intact state using a robotic simulator capable of six-DOF motion. The limits of range of motion was quantified in separate laxity tests applying a ± 2 Nm internal-external (IE) torque, ±20 N anterior-posterior (AP) force, ±20 N superior-inferior (SI) force and a 44 N distraction force at six levels of glenohumeral abduction. Overall, glenohumeral joint laxity was greatest between 15° and 45° of abduction except for SI translation which increased with abduction. IE rotation and AP translation were dominated by external rotation and anterior translation, respectively. Although early abduction and late abduction produced similar laxities, the increase in laxity in the mid abduction range indicates it is important to assess the shoulder joint throughout the range of motion and not just at these two end points. The presented laxity data establishes a baseline for intact shoulder laxity over a range of motion in multiple DOFs under known loading conditions."
pub.1000297386,The John Insall Award: No Functional Benefit After Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Performed With Patient-specific Instrumentation: A Randomized Trial,"BackgroundComponent alignment can influence implant longevity as well as perhaps pain and function after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), but correct alignment is not consistently achieved. To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.Questions/purposesWe hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.MethodsWe randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 ± 4 years (range, 54–72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 ± 3 kg/m2. Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.ResultsOne year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%–54%) versus 30% (23%–56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86–1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71–1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178° ± 3°, conventional group 178° ± 4°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 ± 8 points at 3 months, 87 ± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 ± 8 points at 3 months 83 ± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 ± 12 points at 3 months and 74 ± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 ± 11 points at 3 months and 75 ± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).ConclusionsOur observations suggest that PSI may confer small, if any, advantage in alignment, pain, or function after UKA. This argument can therefore not be used to justify the extra cost and uncertainty related to this technique.Level of EvidenceLevel I, therapeutic study."
pub.1151721208,Robot-assisted rehabilitation for total knee or hip replacement surgery patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to update the current evidence and evaluate the effects of robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) in comparison with conventional rehabilitation (CR) in patients following total knee (TKR) or hip replacements (THR).
METHODS: PubMed Central, OVID Medline, Cochrane Collaboration Library, and EMBASE for a comprehensive search for all relevant studies, from database inception to July 2022. The following inclusion criteria were used to determine eligibility for studies: randomized and matched controlled trials recruiting men and women who underwent TKR and THR; and studies examining the effect of RAR on outcome measures of physical function and pain.
RESULTS: A total of 9 studies (230 patients) were included in this review and 4 were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of 2 studies showed that Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) training for 5 days, significantly improved pain measured on a visual analogue scale, compared to CR in patients following TKR (SMD = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.39-1.71). Heterogeneity for I2 value was lower than moderate (tau^2 = 0.0121; I2 = 5%; P = .30). There were 2 studies that assessed self-selected walking speed. The meta-analysis of these studies showed that HAL training was significantly superior to CR in patients following TKR (SMD = 48.70, 95% Cl -50.53 to 147.94) at 2 months. A high heterogeneity was detected (P < .01; I2 = 97%).
CONCLUSION: The result of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that RAR may be an effective treatment in TKR and THR patients. However, high-quality studies are needed to verify the long-term effect on their recovery."
pub.1158625654,Posterior-stabilized versus mid-level constraint polyethylene components in total knee arthroplasty,"Aims: Mid-level constraint designs for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are intended to reduce coronal plane laxity. Our aims were to compare kinematics and ligament forces of the Zimmer Biomet Persona posterior-stabilized (PS) and mid-level designs in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes under loads simulating clinical exams of the knee in a cadaver model.
Methods: We performed TKA on eight cadaveric knees and loaded them using a robotic manipulator. We tested both PS and mid-level designs under loads simulating clinical exams via applied varus and valgus moments, internal-external (IE) rotation moments, and anteroposterior forces at 0°, 30°, and 90° of flexion. We measured the resulting tibiofemoral angulations and translations. We also quantified the forces carried by the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL/LCL) via serial sectioning of these structures and use of the principle of superposition.
Results: Mid-level inserts reduced varus angulations compared to PS inserts by a median of 0.4°, 0.9°, and 1.5° at 0°, 30°, and 90° of flexion, respectively, and reduced valgus angulations by a median of 0.3°, 1.0°, and 1.2° (p ≤ 0.027 for all comparisons). Mid-level inserts reduced net IE rotations by a median of 5.6°, 14.7°, and 17.5° at 0°, 30°, and 90°, respectively (p = 0.012). Mid-level inserts reduced anterior tibial translation only at 90° of flexion by a median of 3.0 millimetres (p = 0.036). With an applied varus moment, the mid-level insert decreased LCL force compared to the PS insert at all three flexion angles that were tested (p ≤ 0.036). In contrast, with a valgus moment the mid-level insert did not reduce MCL force. With an applied internal rotation moment, the mid-level insert decreased LCL force at 30° and 90° by a median of 25.7 N and 31.7 N, respectively (p = 0.017 and p = 0.012). With an external rotation moment, the mid-level insert decreased MCL force at 30° and 90° by a median of 45.7 N and 20.0 N, respectively (p ≤ 0.017 for all comparisons). With an applied anterior load, MCL and LCL forces showed no differences between the two inserts at 30° and 90° of flexion.
Conclusion: The mid-level insert used in this study decreased coronal and axial plane laxities compared to the PS insert, but its stabilizing benefit in the sagittal plane was limited. Both mid-level and PS inserts depended on the MCL to resist anterior loads during a simulated clinical exam of anterior laxity."
pub.1151081815,"Robot-assisted surgery in total knee arthroplasty: trauma maker or trauma savior? A prospective, randomized cohort study","Background: Robotic assistance has been increasingly employed to improve the operative precision in modern knee surgery. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the trauma effect of one of the first domestically developed orthopedic surgical robots in China in a clinical trial of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA).
Methods: A total of 33 patients who underwent unilateral TKA for end-stage osteoarthritis were randomized to receive RA-TKA (17 cases) or conventional manual TKA (CM-TKA) in our institution in 2020. The trauma effects of the 4 main indicators with 48 sub-indicators in terms of subsectional operative time, inflammation and coagulation markers, physical and radiographical analyses of osteotomy deviation, and postoperative comfort were analyzed.
Results: Subsectional operative time analysis showed that the times for bone cutting and gap balancing with RA-TKA were 5.3 and 2.2 min shorter than those with CM-TKA (<i>p</i> = 0.010, <i>p</i> = 0.02), respectively. Arterial blood gas indicators (partial pressure of carbon dioxide, partial pressure of oxygen and SO<sub>2</sub>) 24 h after RA-TKA, as well as the white blood cell count and neutrophil ratio, were significantly lower than those after CM-TKA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Inflammatory markers at 72 h after surgery showed the increments of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and D-dimer of RA-TKA declined by 180.7, 22.0 and 1050.0% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), respectively, referenced to the preoperative baseline values, as compared to CM-TKA. Mechanical deviation distribution exhibited percentages of region I errors for RA-TKA and CM-TKA of 76.5% and 27.1% (<i>p</i> = 0.000), respectively, and the success rates of one-time osteotomy were 94.1% and 62.5% (<i>p</i> = 0.039), respectively. Radiographical verification showed RA-TKA was more conducive to achieving mechanical alignment and ideal tibial component azimuths. Postoperative efficacy showed that patients were more comfortable after RA-TKA in terms of reduced administration of tranexamic acid, hydrocortisone and the utilization rate of temporary intensive opioid analgesics. No statistical difference in patient-reported outcome measures and complications were recorded between the two groups during continuous observation.
Conclusions: Compared with CM-TKA, RA-TKA decreases rather than increases trauma. It might shorten the time required for bone cutting and gap balancing, reduce mechanical errors related to the osteotomy and prosthesis position, and improve the accuracy of the mechanical alignment reconstruction. RA-TKA is also favorable in promoting postoperative comfort and minimizing inflammatory response and drug consumption.

pub.1031926346,Three‐dimensional A‐mode ultrasound calibration and registration for robotic orthopaedic knee surgery,"BACKGROUND: Registration is a key step for computer-navigated robot-assisted surgery. Registration links the live patient anatomical location to the prescanned CT or MRI images, so that predesigned procedures can be performed accurately. Fiducial markers or mechanical probes are usually used to identify anatomical features or collect data points for registration. This conventional invasive approach is common; however, using ultrasound probes may provide a non-invasive alternative.
METHODS: This report presents investigations of selecting an A-mode ultrasound transducer, calibrating it, analysing the ultrasound signal and using it to register phantom-sawbones of tibia and femur as well as cadaveric specimens. To ensure accurate registration, the A-mode ultrasound probe is calibrated by a designed calibration system. Detailed mathematical derivation and procedures for the calibration are provided in the Appendix. The calibration and registration experiments were performed in conjunction with MAKO Surgical Corporation's Tactile Guidance System (TGS) at their headquarters and at the South Florida Spine Clinic for cadaveric experiments.
RESULTS: Calibration results show that an A-mode ultrasound probe can reach the same accuracy level as a mechanical probe. By using the A-mode ultrasound probe, averaged root mean square errors (RMSE) are <0.5 mm for calibration, <1.0 mm for phantom-sawbones and <2.0 mm for cadaveric specimens.
CONCLUSION: The registration results from phantom and cadaveric experiments are suitable for clinical applications. A-mode ultrasound registration is a viable option for registration of the bones in orthopaedic knee surgery but with reduced incision size."
pub.1164946663,Intra‐operative laxity and balance impact 2‐year pain outcomes in TKA: a prospective cohort study,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine if intra-operatively measured joint gaps are associated with 2-year pain outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and whether balance and laxity windows could be defined throughout flexion to optimize 2-year pain outcomes. Our hypothesis is that intra-operative joint gaps are associated with 2 year post-operative pain outcome.
METHODS: A prospective study investigating 310 robotically assisted TKAs was performed. Final intra-operative joint gap data were recorded using a digital tensioner and component alignment data were recorded by the robotics system. Patient demographics and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were recorded pre-operatively and KOOS and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) satisfaction were recorded at 2 years post-op. A random search Simulated Annealing (SANN) optimisation algorithm was used to determine global optimum laxity and balance windows at different flexion angles which maximized the 2-year KOOS pain scores. The windows were combined to determine the impact of achieving optimal laxity and balance throughout flexion. To improve clinical utility, boundaries identified by the SANN algorithm were rounded to the nearest 0.5 mm before statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Laxity and balance windows were defined in extension (Med lax: -2.0 to 2.5 mm, Lat lax: -0.5 to 2.5 mm, Balance: -3.0 to 0.0 mm), mid-flexion (Med lax: -1.0 to 2.5 mm, Lat lax: -0.5 to 3.0 mm, Balance: -2.0 to 2.0 mm), and flexion (Med lax: -2.0 to 3.5 mm, Lat lax: -2.0 to 1.5 mm, Balance: -3.0 to 3.0 mm). When all windows were satisfied, the greatest difference in KOOS pain score was observed (100.0 vs 94.4, p < 0.0001). The highest percentage of knees satisfying the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) for KOOS pain was also observed in knees which satisfied all windows compared to knees which did not (93% vs 71%, p = 0.0009). The proportion of knees which satisfy the PASS threshold decreased in knees which only satisfied 1-3 (29%) or 4-6 (69%) windows (p ≤ 0.0018). No optimal windows were found between component alignment and KOOS pain outcome (p ≥ 0.1180). High satisfaction was found across all groups (≥ 95%).
CONCLUSION: Intra-operatively measured joint gaps are associated with all KOOS sub-score outcomes at 2 years after TKA. Optimal windows for a clinically relevant improvement in post-operative KOOS pain were defined for laxity and balance but not for alignment indicating balance may have a greater impact on outcome than alignment.

pub.1171052015,Asymmetric gap balancing improves knee kinematic following primary total knee arthroplasty,"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to demonstrate closer-to-normal knee kinematics following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed establishing asymmetric gap balancing intraoperatively.Material and methodTwo age-, sex-, BMI-matched groups of patients underwent medially stabilized TKA because of isolated knee disease. Group A (12 patients) underwent “unrestricted” kinematic alignment (uKA) according to Howell while group B (15 patients) received robot-assisted “simplified” KA (sKA) with an alignment goal (Hip-Knee-Ankle axis-HKA) ± 5° respect to the mechanical axis. Intraoperatively, in group B, the flexion gap at 90° was first set at an average of 1.5 mm (0–5 mm; SD 4.4 mm) tighter in the medial compartment with respect to the lateral; in the same way, the extension gap was then set at an average of 2.0 mm (0–4.5 mm; SD 3.1 mm) tighter in the medial compartment with respect to the lateral. All patients, including a non-arthritic cohort (group C: 5 controls) underwent gait analysis using an instrumented treadmill (WalkerView–WV) equipped with an instrumented belt armed with a 3D video camera. The WV software evaluated multiple spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters, including: (1) contact time (s); (2) knee ROM during gait cycle; (3) step length percentage with respect to total gait (%) and pure step length (cm). Statistical analyses included t-Test and ANOVA and were conducted by using SPSS.ResultsAt the final FU, significant differences were noted during gait between the two TKA groups (uKA-sKA) and the controls. Both TKA groups showed superior mean contact time on the surgical knee (uKA 1 s; sKA 0.97 s) as compared to the controls (0.72 s) (P = 0.002) while no differences were found between them (P = 0.11). TKA groups showed a lower, maximum ROM in the surgical knee (mean uKA 36º; mean sKA 49º) relative to the controls (mean 57º) (P < 0.05) but a statistical difference was found between them (P = 0.003). Both TKA groups showed a higher step length percentage with respect to the total gait and a shorter step length on the surgical side (uKA: mean 8.28% and mean step length 35.5 cm; sKA: mean 8.38% and mean step length 34.6 cm) in comparison to the controls (mean 3.38%; mean step length 71.4 cm) (P < 0.05) while no statistical differences were found between them.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this was the first study to exhibit the kinematic advantages of a slightly asymmetric gap balancing during KA TKA. Combining a medially-stabilized implant design and a surgical technique aiming to obtain a tighter medial compartment represents a promising approach to improve outcomes after TKA.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1121275946,Altered Range of Motion and Plantar Pressure in Anterior and Posterior Malaligned Total Ankle Arthroplasty: A Cadaveric Gait Study.,"BACKGROUND: Malaligned ankle arthroplasty components have been associated with increased postoperative pain and reduced ankle range of motion. With this study, we aimed to quantify how anterior and posterior malalignment of the talar component affects foot bone kinematics and plantar pressures in a dynamic, cadaveric gait simulation.
METHODS: Ten cadaveric foot specimens received a modified ankle prosthesis. Proper alignment was defined as the prosthesis being neutral to a plantigrade foot, where varus/valgus and internal/external rotation were determined using the tibial alignment guide from the prosthesis manufacturer. Axially loaded lateral radiographs were made to measure the tibiotalar ratio (TTR) preoperatively and postoperatively. Specimens were prepared for gait simulation and mounted into the robotic gait simulator. Foot bone kinematics and plantar pressures were measured for each alignment condition.
RESULTS: Posterior malalignment of the talar component decreased mean sagittal-plane range of motion (p ≤ 0.0005) in the tibiotalar joint (by up to 3.9°) and in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (by up to 7.7°) and increased sagittal-plane range of motion (p ≤ 0.0005) in the calcaneocuboid joint (by up to 2.0°). Posterior malalignment increased mean transverse-plane range of motion (p ≤ 0.0005 and p = 0.012) in the tibiotalar joint (by up to 2.3°) and in the calcaneocuboid joint (by 2.3°). Posterior malalignment decreased mean peak plantar pressures (p = 0.001 and p = 0.013) under the hallux and the first metatarsal (by up to 82.1 and 110.1 kPa, respectively) and increased (p = 0.012 and p = 0.0006) peak plantar pressures under the third metatarsal and the hindfoot (by 23.0 and 47.8 kPa, respectively). Anterior malalignment decreased (p = 0.0006) mean hindfoot peak plantar pressure (by 127.7 kPa). Anterior and posterior malalignments shifted center of pressure laterally during early and late stance. The TTR weakly to moderately correlated with range-of-motion changes in the tibiotalar, calcaneocuboid, and first metatarsophalangeal joints (r ≤ 0.39) and weakly correlated with plantar pressure changes under the hindfoot, the first metatarsal, and the hallux (r ≤ 0.15).
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior and posterior malalignments of the talar component altered foot bone kinematics and plantar pressures. Mild malalignments produced fewer significant differences than moderate and extreme malalignments. A greater number of significant differences were found for posterior malalignments than for anterior. The TTR weakly to moderately correlated with changes in range of motion and plantar pressures.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The observed changes in range of motion and plantar pressures may explain why malaligned ankle arthroplasties are associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and poor prosthesis longevity. Posterior malalignments may produce worse clinical outcomes than anterior malalignments."
pub.1053190375,A Navigated Mechatronic System with Haptic Features to Assist in Surgical Interventions,"OBJECTIVE: In orthopaedic surgery, the development of new computer-based technologies such as navigation systems and robotics will facilitate more precise, reproducible results in surgical interventions. There are already commercial systems available for clinical use, though these still have some limitations and drawbacks. This paper presents an alternative approach to a universal modular surgical assistant system for supporting less or minimally invasive surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The position of a mechatronic arm, which is part of the system, is controlled by a navigation system so that small patient movements are automatically detected and compensated for in real time. Thus, the optimal tool position can be constantly maintained without the need for rigid bone or patient fixation. Furthermore, a force control mode of the mechatronic assistant system, based on a force-torque sensor, not only increases safety during surgical interventions but also facilitates hand-driven direct positioning of the arm.
RESULTS: A prototype has been successfully tested in clinical applications at the Orthopadische Universitätsklinik Frankfurt. For the first time worldwide, implantation of the cup prosthesis in total hip replacement surgery has been carried out with the assistance of a mechatronic arm. According to measurements by the digitizing system, operating tool angle deviation remained below 0.5 degrees, relative to the preoperative planning.
CONCLUSION: The presented approach to a new kind of surgical mechatronic assistance system supports the surgeon as needed by optimal positioning of the surgical instruments. Due to its modular design, it is applicable to a wide range of tasks in surgical interventions, e.g., endoscope guidance, bone preparation, etc."
pub.1124663038,[Research progress in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty].,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical application and research progress in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA).
METHODS: The literature related to UKA in recent years was reviewed and the emerging indications, implant options, comparisons between other surgical techniques, and recent advances were summarized.
RESULTS: Clinical studies show that UKA has many advantages, such as less trauma, faster recovery, and fewer postoperative complications. At present, the operative indication has been expanded. The body mass index more than 25 kg/m <sup>2</sup>, less than 60 years old, patellofemoral arthritis, and anterior cruciate ligament dysfunction are no longer considered as contraindications. The prosthesis type in UKA should be selected according to the patient's condition. In recent years, the robot-assisted UKA can effectively improve the effectiveness, improve patient satisfaction, and reduce postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION: With the development of surgical techniques, designs of prosthesis, and the robotic technology, UKA would be further applicated. As more long-term data on UKA become available, it will further guide clinicians in counseling patients on whether UKA should be performed."
pub.1141915451,[Optimal lower limb alignment and soft tissue balancing strategy for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty].,"Lower limb alignment and soft tissue balance are important factors affecting patient satisfaction, clinical functional outcome, and prosthetic long-term survival rate after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Robot-assisted TKA (rTKA) has the advantages of achieving precise osteotomy and soft tissue balance. However, rTKA under the guidance of classic mechanical alignment principles does not significantly improve the functional outcome after operation. The new TKA alignment principles, such as kinematic alignment (KA) and functional alignment (FA), can better consider the patient's own knee joint morphology and kinematic characteristics, which may help improve the clinical results of TKA. With the help of more objective and accurate soft tissue balance assessment tool such as pressure sensors, KA and FA have been proven to better achieve soft tissue balance. rTKA can achieve non-neutral alignment goals such as KA or FA more accurately and reproducibly. The use of these lower limb alignment and soft tissue balancing strategies will be expected to further increase the patients' satisfaction rate after rTKA."
pub.1054512249,Planning and performance of orthopedic surgery with the help of individual templates.,"Operational interventions can be planned and simulated accurately with the help of a three-dimensional reconstruction of the anatomical bone structures, created from the tomographic data of a patient. Computer-assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can assist the intraoperative realization of the planned intervention and may support the spatial orientation within the operational field. As an inexpensive alternative without the high excessive technical workload on the physicians or the surgical personnel, individual templates were developed in the Helmholtz Institute Aachen. In this approach the negative three-dimensional bone surface, known exactly from the 3D-reconstruction of the patient's bone by the planning system DISOS, is milled into a small cubic block of polycarbonate. During the intervention, the template serves as a reference for the spatial orientation and as a tool-guide for cutting or milling of the bone according to the previous planning. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that operation times as well as intraoperative X-ray times can be shortened by the use of individual templates, while preserving the task sequence of the conventional operation procedures."
pub.1121837654,[Clinical effects of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty compared with traditional surgery: a Meta-analysis].,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference between robotic-assisted TKA and traditional TKA by Meta-annlysis in order to determine whether robotic-assisted TKA can provide better lower limb force line and clinical prognosis.
METHODS: Computerized searches of Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science and CNKI, Wanfang and VIP databases were conducted until November 2018 to find out the difference between robotic assisted TKA and traditional TKA. After screening, quality evaluation and data extraction according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, Revman 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis of literature data.
RESULTS: Six clinical controlled studies were included, 253 in robot-assisted TKA group and 231 in traditional TKA group. Meta-analysis showed that the incidence of coronal force line angle[WMD=-1.00, 95%CI(-1.66, -0.35), <i>P</i>=0.003], coronal force line inversion or valgus&gt;3°[RR=0.04, 95% CI(0.01, 0.13), <i>P</i>=0.000 01] in robot-assisted TKA group was significantly better than that in traditional TKA group, but there were no statistical differences between two groups in range of knee joint motion[WMD=0.06, 95%CI(-5.43, 5.55)], <i>P</i>=0.98], anterior position tibial angle[WMD=-0.19, 95% CI(-0.81, 0.43), 95%, <i>P</i>=0.55] and lateral tibial angle[WMD=-1.37, 95%CI(-3.73, 0.99), <i>P</i>=0.25], anterior position femoral angle[WMD=0.30, 95%CI(-1.37, 1.96), <i>P</i>=0.72] and lateral femoral angle[WMD=-0.93, 95%CI(-1.98, 0.013), <i>P</i>=0.08], the incidence of complications[RR=0.84, 95%CI(0.45, 1.58), <i>P</i>=0.60]. The operation time of robot-cassisted TKA group was longer than that of traditional TKA group[WMD=14.28, 95%CI(0.79, 27.77), <i>P</i>=0.04].
CONCLUSIONS: The application of robotic assistant system in TKA surgery can significantly improve the accuracy of prosthesis fixation, better reconstruct the lower limb line of force, and has the potential advantages of reducing postoperative pain and promoting the recovery of knee joint function. Due to the limitation of the quantity and quality of the included literature, a high-quality randomized controlled study with long-term follow-up is still needed in the future to support the conclusions of this paper."
pub.1155816399,[Translated article] Current situation of robotics in knee prosthetic surgery: A technology that has come to stay?,"Robotic surgery is a surgical technique that is on the rise. The goal of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) is to provide the surgeon with a tool to accurately execute bone cuts according to previous surgical planning to restore knee kinematics and balance of soft tissue, being able to precisely apply the type of alignment that we choose. In addition, RA-TKA is a very useful tool for training. Within the limitations, there is the learning curve, the need for specific equipment, the high cost of the devices, the increase in radiation in some systems and that each robot is linked to a specific type of implant. Current studies show, with RA-TKA, variations in the alignment of the mechanical axis are reduced, postoperative pain is improved and earlier discharge is facilitated. On the other hand, there are no differences in terms of range of motion, alignment, gap balance, complications, surgical time or functional results."
pub.1057432933,Die Primärstabilität von manuell und roboterassistiert implantierten Hüftendoprothesenstielen: eine biomechanische Untersuchung an Kunstfemora,"AIM: We investigated the initial stability of cementless stems implanted with robotic milling and conventional manual broaching.
METHODS: Proximally porous structured stems (G2, ESKA-Implants, Luebeck, Germany) were implanted into synthetic femora. In one group, the femoral cavity was prepared by a CT-based robot (CASPAR, URS-Ortho, Germany) with a high-speed milling head. In the other group, femora were rasped manually with broaches. The broaches had 1 mm proximal press-fit, the robotic cavities 1.5 mm. The implants were exposed to 15 000 loading cycles with 1 000 +/- 500 N. The direction of forces on the implant head were chosen to simulate stair climbing. Internal rotation and translation (caudal, dorsal and lateral) of the implants were measured by linear transducers.
RESULTS: The robotic group showed significantly less reversible motion regarding translation in caudal, dorsal and lateral directions. The standard deviations of implant motions were smaller in the robotic group.
CONCLUSION: Using robotic preparation of the femur, initial stability was higher and more consistent than with manual broaching, but differences in undersizing of the cavities created in the femur in relation to the implant may have contributed to these differences for the most part. In-vitro-loading experiments focusing on femoral cavities with varying press-fits are recommended before the introduction of new implants or operating procedures."
pub.1120972993,Predictors of extended length of stay after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"PURPOSE: To identify factors that independently predict extended length of stay after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) surgery (defined as length of stay longer than 3 days), and to identify factors predicting early post-operative complications.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing UKA from January 2016-January 2019 at our institution was performed. Clinical notes were reviewed to determine the following information: Patient age (years), gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, weight (kg), height (meters), body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, indication for surgery, surgeon, surgical volume, surgical technique (navigated or patient-specific instrumentation), implant manufacturer, estimated blood loss (ml), application of tourniquet during the surgery, application of drain, hospital length of stay (days) and surgical complications.
RESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis showed that ASA 3-4 vs. ASA 1-2 [OR 4.4 (CI; 1.8-10.8, p = 0.001)] and a history of cardiovascular disease [OR 2.8 (CI; 1.4-5.5), p = 0.004)] were significant independent predictors of prolonged length of stay. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit of the model showed a p-value of 0.214. Nagelkerke R-Square was 0.2. For complications, multivariate regression analysis showed that ASA 3-4 vs. ASA 1-2 [OR 5.8 (CI; 1.7-20.7)] and high BMI (BMI >30) [OR 4.3 (CI; 1.1-17.1)] were significant independent predictors of complications. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit was 0.89 and Nagelkerke R-Square was 0.2. Patients treated with robotics (Navio) techniques had shorter length of stay median 51 h (IQR; 29-96) when compared to other techniques 72 h (IQR; 52-96), p = 0.008.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of our study, high ASA grade (≥3) appears to be the most important factor excluding eligibility for fast-track UKA. Any number of co-morbidities may increase ASA, but in and of themselves, apart from a history of cardiovascular disease, they should not be seen as contraindications. Appropriate patient selection, technical tools and details during the surgery could facilitate fast track surgery."
pub.1132687582,[An animal experimental study on domestic robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance, safety, and precision of the Yuanhua robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty system (YUANHUA-TKA) through animal experiments, which will provide reference data for human clinical trials.
METHODS: Six 18-month-old goats, weighing 30-35 kg, were used in this study. The experimental study was divided into two parts: the preoperative planning and intraoperative bone resection. CT scans of the goats' lower extremities were firstly performed before the experiments. Then the CT scans were segmented to generate the femoral and tibial three-dimensional (3D) models in the YUANHUA-TKA system. The volumes and angles of each resection plane on the femur and tibia were planned. The bone resection was finally implemented under the assistance of the YUANHUA-TKA system. After completing all bone resections, the lower extremities of each goat were taken to have CT scans. By comparing the femoral and tibial 3D models before and after the experiments, the actual bone resection volumes and angles were calculated and compared with the preoperative values.
RESULTS: During the experiments, no abnormal bleeding was found; the YUANHUA-TKA system ran smoothly and stably and was able to stop moving and keep the osteotomy in the safe zone all the time. After the experiment, the resection planes were observed immediately and found to be quite flat. There was no significant difference between the planned and actual osteotomy thickness and osteotomy angle ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05); the error of the osteotomy thickness was less than 1 mm, and the error of the osteotomy angle was less than 2°.
CONCLUSION: The YUANHUA-TKA system can assist the surgeons to perform osteotomy following the planned thickness and angle values. It is expected to assist surgeons to implement more accurate and efficient osteotomy in the future clinical applications."
pub.1003629522,The Role of Posterior Longitudinal Ligament in Cervical Disc Replacement: An Ovine Cadaveric Biomechanical Analysis,"BACKGROUND Cervical disc replacement (CDR) has been widely used to restore and maintain mobility and function of the treated and adjacent motion segments. Posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) resection has been shown to be efficient in anterior cervical decompression and fusion. However, less is known about the biomechanical effect of PLL removal versus preservation in cervical disc arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three motion segments of 24 ovine cervical spines (C2-C5) were evaluated in a robotic spine system with axial compressive loads of 50 N. These cervical spines were divided in three groups according to the following conditions: (1) intact spine, (2) C3/C4 CDR with the Prestige LP prosthesis and PLL preservation, and (3) C3/C4 CDR with the Prestige LP prosthesis and PLL removal. The ranges of motion (ROMs) were recorded and analyzed in each group. RESULTS The C3/C4 ROM in group 3 (CDR with PLL removed) increased significantly in flexion-extension and axial rotation compared with group 1 (intact spine). Moreover, in flexion-extension, the mean total ROM was significantly larger in group 3 than in group 1. All the ROM observed in group 2 (CDR with PLL preserved) did not significantly differ from the ROM observed in group 1. CONCLUSIONS Compared with intact spines, CDR with PLL removal partly increased ROM. Moreover, the ROM in CDR with PLL preservation did not significantly differ from the ROM observed in intact spines. The PLL appears to contribute to the balance and stability of the cervical spine and should thus be preserved in cervical disc replacement provided that the posterior longitudinal ligament is not degenerative and the compression can be removed without PLL takedown.

Especially the distal cement removal can be a challenging problem. To avoid exhaustive x-ray imaging a navigation system should be used, nevertheless, the three-dimensional shape of the bone cement remains unclear. Our approach in the MINARO-project is to reconstruct the real shape of the bone cement by using just a few x-ray projections. First results show, that the reconstruction has an RMS-Error smaller than 0.5 mm using 6 x-ray projections."
pub.1060167433,Computer Assisted Knee Replacement,"Accurate alignment of knee implants is essential for the success of total knee replacement. Although mechanical alignment guides have been designed to improve alignment accuracy, there are several fundamental limitations of this technology that will inhibit additional improvements. Various computer assisted techniques have been developed to examine the potential to install knee implants more accurately and consistently than can be done with mechanical guides. For example, computer integrated instrumentation incorporates highly accurate measurement devices to locate joint centers, track surgical tools, and align prosthetic components. Image guided knee replacement provides a three-dimensional preoperative plan that guides the placement of the cutting blocks and prosthetic components. Robot assisted knee replacement allows one to machine bones accurately without the use of standard cutting blocks. The rationale for the development of computer assisted knee replacement systems is presented, the operation of several different systems is described, the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches are discussed, and areas for future research are suggested."
pub.1077839683,Development of a knee joint motion simulator to evaluate deep knee flexion of artificial knee joints,"A purpose of this study is to examine the effect that quadriceps femoris force gives to rotation angle and joint reaction force of total knee prosthesis during deep knee flexion such as a unique sitting style called 'seiza' in Japanese. For the evaluation, we developed the knee motion simulator which could bend to 180 degrees continually simulating the passive flexion performed by clinicians. A total knee prosthesis, which is a specially-devised posterior stabilized type and capable of flexion up to 180 degrees, was inserted into bone model. And this prosthesis pulled by three kinds of quadriceps femoris forces to perform parameter study. The results obtained in this study were showed the same tendency with those in the past cadaveric experiment. It is suggested that the rotation angle and joint reaction force of total knee prosthesis are affected by shape of prosthesis, a vector of quadriceps femoris force, and bony aliments during deep knee flexion."
pub.1139533793,Computer-Assisted Surgical Navigation for Primary and Metastatic Bone Malignancy of the Pelvis: Current Evidence and Future Directions,"Computer-assisted navigation and robotic surgery have gained popularity in the treatment of pelvic bone malignancies, given the complexity of the bony pelvis, the proximity of numerous vital structures, and the historical challenges of pelvic bone tumor surgery. Initial interest was on enhancing the accuracy in sarcoma resection by improving the quality of surgical margins and decreasing the incidence of local recurrences. Several studies have shown an association between intraoperative navigation and increased incidence of negative margin bone resection, but long-term outcomes of navigation in pelvic bone tumor resection have yet to be established. Historically, mechanical stabilization of pelvic bone metastases has been limited to Harrington-type total hip arthroplasty for disabling periacetabular disease, but more recently, computer-assisted surgery has been employed for minimally invasive percutaneous fixation and stabilization; although still in its incipient stages, this procedure is potentially appealing for treating patients with bone metastases to the pelvis. The authors review the literature on navigation for the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors of the pelvic bone and discuss the best practices and limitations of these techniques."
pub.1064454829,Preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance for accurate computer-assisted minimally invasive hip resurfacing surgery,"Hip resurfacing is an alternative to total hip replacement (THR) and is particularly suitable for the younger, more active patient. However, it is a more demanding procedure. This paper describes a system that enables the surgeon to plan the surgery preoperatively with optimally sized and placed components, and then transfer this plan to an intraoperative system that registers computer models to the real patient and tracks surgical tools, allowing the surgeon to ensure that the bone is resected correctly and that the components are fitted in accordance with the plan. The paper describes a series of instruments used with the system which are locked to the bone. These instruments serve the dual purpose of soft tissue retraction and bone immobilization. The system will shortly be the subject of laboratory and clinical evaluation. Registration, a cornerstone of the tracked instrument system, has been tested, and accuracy measures are provided. Experimental results for the remainder of the system will be provided after clinical trials."
pub.1019903809,New visualization tools: computer vision and ultrasound for MIS navigation,"BACKGROUND: A versatile image acquisition method called echo surgetics has been developed for minimally invasive computer-assisted orthopaedic procedures. The principle of echo surgetics is to use freehand three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound to acquire relevant 3D bone surface and point data transcutaneously, eliminating access problems associated with conventional digitizers. The concept has been implemented in three technologies: Echo Point, Echo Matching and Echo Morphing.
METHODS: Cadaver experiments were carried out to evaluate the accuracy of (a) Echo Point for digitization of the anterior pelvic plane (APP) in total hip arthroplasty, and (b) Echo Morphing for reconstructing the distal femur in minimally invasive knee surgery.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Echo Point provided significantly improved results (p < 0.001) over conventional digitization where mean tilt errors exceeded 20 degrees . The Echo Morphing experiments demonstrated that with a reasonable number of points (ca. 1000) and initial attitude (IA) error (ca. 5-10 mm and 5-10 degrees ) we can obtain an average accuracy of approximately 1 mm that is sufficient for most of clinical applications."
pub.1064454946,Computer-assisted hip resurfacing surgery using the Acrobot® Navigation System,"The authors have previously reported on the laboratory development of the Acrobot Navigation System for accurate computer-assisted hip resurfacing surgery. This paper describes the findings of using the system in the clinical setting and including the improvements that have been made to expedite the procedure. The aim of the present system is to allow accurate planning of the procedure and precise placement of the prosthesis in accordance with the plan, with a zero intraoperative time penalty in comparison to the standard non-navigated technique. At present the navigation system is undergoing final clinical evaluation prior to a clinical study designed to demonstrate the accuracy of outcome compared with the conventional technique.

The introduction of navigation systems into knee surgery has now made precise measurement of the leg axis and gap size possible.MethodsTen knee joints received a computer-assisted total knee replacement (Ci® navigation system DePuy® I-Orthopaedics®, Munich). The change of the leg axis and the size of the mediolateral gaps were measured and documented when performing a standardized medial ligament release sequence.ResultsWe found a significant effect after each release step regarding the change of the leg axis as well as the gap width (p<0.001).

pub.1118153058,The efficiency and expediency of different rehabilitation approaches after knee replacement.,"The paper reviews the literature on the efficiency of different rehabilitation methods after knee arthroplasty, such as continuous passive motion (CPM) therapy, exercises for balance and strengthening of hip muscles on the postoperative leg, and aquatic rehabilitation. It analyzes the optimal periods of rehabilitation initiation and continuance, studies of the Pilates system for patients after knee arthroplasty, kinesiotaping, fast-track rehabilitation, and Locomat robotic system. Various functional tests and questionnaire surveys are considered as performance measures. CPM therapy and the Pilates method are shown to require an additional investigation for inclusion in the standard rehabilitation program. Balance exercises have a positive impact on functional status and mobility in patients after surgery. Exercises for strengthening the hip muscles on the postoperative leg and aquatic training are recommended for use in routine practice. Kinesiotaping is successfully used to more effectively perform exercises, by reducing pain, edema and to improve a patient's psychological status. The Locomat can be used for walking technology training, which will be able to enhance the structure of a step and amortization function. The time taken in the rehabilitation center can be reduced using the fast-track rehabilitation program."

pub.1175344950,Evaluation of Two Clinical Stem Fit Philosophies within the Femoral Canal Using a Preoperative Planning Tool: Could a Hybrid Approach Be Best?,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has transformed patient lives, yet evolving expectations and the number of postoperative foot angle changes have underscored the need for precise component positioning. The objective of this study was to use 3-dimensional (3D) preoperative planning to evaluate stem alignment and orientation for three THA systems using two different stem-fit algorithms. It was hypothesized that the different stem alignments would yield similar changes in stem orientation and placement within the canal for all 3 systems.
METHODS: This study introduced a novel 3D preoperative planning tool, comparing two different surgical stem-fit philosophies within the canal: ""canal fit"" (CF) and ""anatomical fit"" (AF). We virtually implanted 10 subjects with three different THA implant systems using both philosophies, evaluating 60 total fits within the canals. The CF philosophy aimed to minimize cortical bone removal. In contrast, the AF philosophy prioritized aligning the implanted head with the anatomical head center.
RESULTS: Detailed analyses revealed that AF led to fixation occurring mainly on the medial aspect of the stem, while CF exhibited a more even distribution between medial and lateral sides. The AF philosophy achieved significantly closer placement of the implanted head to the anatomical center (2.0 to 2.1 mm) compared to the CF philosophy (3.0 to 6.0 mm) (P < 0.01). The AF resulted in neutral stem orientation (0°) across all stems, whereas the CF exhibited greater malrotation (2.0 to 7.0°) (P < 0.02). The AF required more bone removal (0.13 to 0.46 cm³) than the CF (0.02 to 0.06 cm³) (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the importance of 3D planning, emphasizing its potential to improve stem version alignment in THA. The results from this study may advocate 3D preoperative planning with robotic surgery to plan stem placement within the canal while maintaining anatomical femoral head restoration."
pub.1155636535,The Definition of the Tibial Sagittal Plane and the Paradox of Imageless Navigation and Robotics: A Cadaveric Study,"BACKGROUND: The accuracy, precision, and repeatability by which the tibial sagittal plane can be found with imageless technology is currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify any differences between imageless and image-based technology to define the sagittal plane of the tibia.
METHODS: A computed tomography (CT) was obtained of 18 cadavers with the knee fully extended. The surgical trans-epicondylar axis and several tibial rotation references were acquired on the CT scan. After a medial parapatellar approach, the same anatomical landmarks were acquired in vivo. In the horizontal plane, the angle between the surgical trans-epicondylar axis and the tibial rotational axes was assessed.
RESULTS: Highest accuracy was found for posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)-anterior cruciate ligament (ACL, -1.48°, standard deviation [SD] 13.64; imageless), tibial medial condyle (TMC)-tibial lateral condyle (TLC, 1.72°, SD 4.24; image-based), the ACL-medial border of tibial tuberosity (MTT, -2.89°, SD 18.86; image-based). Highest precision was acquired with image-based technology: TMC-TLC (SD 4.24), PCL-ACL (SD 5.86), and PCL-medial third of tibial tuberosity (M3TT, SD 7.10). Excellent intraobserver and interobserver correlation coefficients were observed with image-based technology: PCL-MTT, anterior medial condyle (AMC)-anterior lateral condyle (ALC), and TMC-TLC (Intraobserver and interobserver correlation coefficients 0.90-0.98).
CONCLUSION: The tibial sagittal plane could be defined with highest accuracy, precision, and repeatability on a preoperative CT. Imageless methodology lacked the precision and repeatability of image-based technology. With the current pursuit of high accuracy and precision in total knee arthroplasty, the reference frame used to quantify implant position should be highly accurate and precise as well.

pub.1138942964,Augmented reality in robotic assisted orthopaedic surgery: A pilot study,"BACKGROUND: The research and development of augmented-reality (AR) technologies in surgical applications has seen an evolution of the traditional user-interfaces (UI) utilised by clinicians when conducting robot-assisted orthopaedic surgeries. The typical UI for such systems relies on surgeons managing 3D medical imaging data in the 2D space of a touchscreen monitor, located away from the operating site. Conversely, AR can provide a composite view overlaying the real surgical scene with co-located virtual holographic representations of medical data, leading to a more immersive and intuitive operator experience.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work explores the integration of AR within an orthopaedic setting by capturing and replicating the UI of an existing surgical robot within an AR head-mounted display worn by the clinician. The resulting mixed-reality workflow enabled users to simultaneously view the operating-site and real-time holographic operating informatics when carrying out a robot-assisted patellofemoral-arthroplasty (PFA). Ten surgeons were recruited to test the impact of the AR system on procedure completion time and operating surface roughness.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The integration of AR did not appear to require subjects to significantly alter their surgical techniques, which was demonstrated by non-significant changes to the study's clinical metrics, with a statistically insignificant mean increase in operating time (+0.778 s, p = 0.488) and a statistically insignificant change in mean surface roughness (p = 0.274). Additionally, a post-operative survey indicated a positive consensus on the usability of the AR system without incurring noticeable physical distress such as eyestrain or fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these study results demonstrated a successful integration of AR technologies within the framework of an existing robot-assisted surgical platform with no significant negative effects in two quantitative metrics of surgical performance, and a positive outcome relating to user-centric and ergonomic evaluation criteria."

We hypothesized that the parameters investigated would not differ in relation to the two implants compared.
METHODS: We included two different ankle prostheses (Hintegra, Newdeal, Vienne, France; German Ankle System, R-Innovation, Coburg, Germany). The prostheses were implanted in seven paired cadaver specimens. The specimens were mounted on an industrial robot that enables complex motion under predefined conditions (RX 90, Stäubli, Bayreuth, Germany). The robot detected the load-bearing (30 kg) motion of the 100(th) cycle of the specimens without prostheses as the baseline for the later testing, and mimicked that exact motion during 100 cycles after the prostheses were implanted. The resulting forces, torques, and bone motions were recorded and the differences between the prostheses compared.
RESULTS: The Hintegra and German Ankle System, significantly increased the forces and torques in relation to the specimen without a prosthesis with one exception (one-sample-t-test, each p < or = 0.01; exception, parameter lateral force measured with the German Ankle System, p = 0.34). The force, torque, and motion differences between the specimens before and after implantation of the prostheses were lower with the German Ankle System than with the Hintegra (unpaired t-test, each p < or = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The German Ankle System prosthesis had less of an effect on resulting forces and torques during partial weightbearing passive ankle motion than the Hintegra prosthesis. This might improve function and minimize loosening during the clinical use."
pub.1152834407,Kinematic alignment results in clinically similar outcomes to mechanical alignment: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"PURPOSE: It is unclear whether a difference in functional outcome exists between kinematically aligned (KA) and mechanically aligned (MA) knee replacements. The aim of this study is to perform a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the available level I-IV evidence.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies comparing patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), range of motion (ROM), gait analysis and complications in TKA with KA and MA was performed. Quality assessment was performed for each study using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools.
RESULTS: Twelve randomised controlled trials and fourteen observational studies published between 2014 and 2022 were included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis revealed KA to have significantly better Oxford Knee Score (OKS) (p = 0.02), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) (p = 0.006), Knee Society Score (KSS) Objective Knee (p = 0.03) and KSS Functional Activity (p = 0.008) scores. However, these improvements did not exceed the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) values reported in the literature. Subgroup analysis showed robotic assisted KA-TKA to have a clinically superior FJS (p = 0.0002) and trend towards KSS Objective Knee score (p = 0.10), compared to PSI. Gait and plantar pressure distribution of KA cohorts more closely represented healthy cohorts, and KA showed a weak association of a decreased knee adduction moment (KAM) compared to MA. Differences in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), range of motion and complications were not significant between groups.
CONCLUSION: Although KA results in several improved functional outcomes, these do not reach clinical significance. Further standardised large-scale randomised studies are required to improve the quality of evidence. As it stands, it is difficult to recommend one philosophy over the other."
pub.1164173746,Three-Dimensional CT-Based Limb Length Evaluation Is Highly Dependent on Anatomical Landmark Selection and Pelvic Asymmetry,"Background: Pelvic skeletal asymmetry can result in rotational differences and morphologic bony prominence variance between the left and right hemipelvis. When selecting bony reference points for modern computed tomography-based robotic total hip arthroplasty planning, it is unclear which bony landmarks are the most reliable and accurate, especially in the presence of significant pelvic asymmetry.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted utilizing a database of computed tomography scans. Multiple bony landmarks in the pelvis and femur were selected for comparison, with the aim of measuring pelvic asymmetry. Specifically, the study measured the average difference in lateral offset between the left and right hemipelvis caused by pelvic asymmetry. Landmarks were also compared to determine the impact of pelvic asymmetry on hip length, femur length, and limb length discrepancies. Furthermore, a scenario was simulated in the software whereby a total hip replacement was inserted, potentially changing the hip length. The impact of pelvic reference point selection on the measurement of this simulated change in hip length was examined.
Results: This study population showed widespread pelvic asymmetry. The anatomical landmarks of the opposite side cannot be relied upon for predicting the anatomy of the affected side. The center of rotation axis is more reliable than the inferior obturator foramen axis for hip length discrepancy due to pelvic asymmetry (<i>P</i> &lt; .05).
Conclusions: Current computer-assisted surgery THR software reports measurements of global offset and hip length that do not consider pelvic asymmetry. Surgeons are not given confidence ranges to represent the potential impact of asymmetry on the global offset and hip length values. Surgeons following these numbers to guide implant position may incur implant placement error should significant pelvic asymmetry be present in a given patient."
pub.1167756881,Trends in der Navigation – Handheld-Systeme,"Navigation-assisted surgical procedures in orthopedics and trauma surgery have become increasingly widespread over the last 20 years. In addition to applications in spinal surgery, they are primarily available for knee and hip endoprosthetics. On the one hand, computer-assisted procedures have been increasingly expanded with robotic assistance systems in recent years, and on the other hand, so-called handheld navigation systems have been developed, which enable specialized use directly in the operating field at lower acquisition costs. The aim of this overview is to describe current handheld systems and to present the respective technical principles and the available scientific results. Three handheld systems for TKA use, two for THA use and one system to support pedicle screw placement on the spine are presented."
pub.1057405368,"Frühergebnisse einer prospektiven Studie bei Patienten mit computergestützter Femurschaftpräparation bei Hüft-TEP-Implantationen (System Robodoc) - Indikation, Ergebnisse, Komplikationen","AIM: Indications, results, advantages and disadvantages of the computer-guided femoral preparation in total hip arthroplasty (Robodoc) in our patients are recorded and represented.
METHOD: 41 patients who underwent a computer-guided femoral preparation in total hip arthroplasty (Robodoc) were examined after 1 year on average in a prospective study. The evaluation was made using the Harris Hip Score. The advantages and disadvantages of the Robodoc-assisted surgery are described.
RESULTS: More than 80% of the patients had a good or very good result (> 80 points of Harris Hip Score) 3 month after surgery; after 6 months in 20 of 21 patients a score of more than 85 pts. was calculated. The following complications were noticed: thrombotic embolism (2) with one lethal embolism included, fracture of the greater trochanter using the straight stem (3), aseptic drainage due to hematoma (2). 12 patients noticed a postoperative pain at the distal marking pin location (condylus femoris medialis) for an average of 3 months.
CONCLUSION: Generally, Robodoc-assisted surgery may be performed in all uncemented total hip arthroplasties. The individual indication should be checked because of the increased effort of surgery, the advantages and disadvantages, and the non-proven better long-term results in comparison to the regular technique. It seems that the Robodoc system provides advantages in post-traumatic arthritis and deformities of the proximal femur (varus and valgus neck) on account of the computer-aided preoperative planning and correct operative realization."
pub.1121389627,"Posterior cruciate ligament resection in total knee arthroplasty: the effect on flexion-extension gaps, mediolateral laxity, and fixed flexion deformity.","AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) resection on flexion-extension gaps, mediolateral soft-tissue laxity, fixed flexion deformity (FFD), and limb alignment during posterior-stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 110 patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee undergoing primary robot-assisted PS TKA. All operations were performed by a single surgeon using a standard medial parapatellar approach. Optical motion capture technology with fixed femoral and tibial registration pins was used to assess gaps before and after PCL resection in extension and 90° knee flexion. Measurements were made after excision of the anterior cruciate ligament and prior to bone resection. There were 54 men (49.1%) and 56 women (50.9%) with a mean age of 68 years (sd 6.2) at the time of surgery. The mean preoperative hip-knee-ankle deformity was 4.1° varus (sd 3.4).
RESULTS: PCL resection increased the mean flexion gap significantly more than the extension gap in the medial (2.4 mm (sd 1.5) <i>vs</i> 1.3 mm (sd 1.0); p &lt; 0.001) and lateral (3.3 mm (sd 1.6) <i>vs</i> 1.2 mm (sd 0.9); p &lt; 0.01) compartments. The mean gap differences after PCL resection created significant mediolateral laxity in flexion (gap difference: 1.1 mm (sd 2.5); p &lt; 0.001) but not in extension (gap difference: 0.1 mm (sd 2.1); p = 0.51). PCL resection significantly improved the mean FFD (6.3° (sd 4.4) preoperatively <i>vs</i> 3.1° (sd 1.5) postoperatively; p &lt; 0.001). There was a strong positive correlation between the preoperative FFD and change in FFD following PCL resection (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.81; p &lt; 0.001). PCL resection did not significantly affect limb alignment (mean change in alignment: 0.2° valgus (sd 1.2); p = 0.60).
CONCLUSION: PCL resection creates flexion-extension mismatch by increasing the flexion gap more than the extension gap. The increase in the lateral flexion gap is greater than the increase in the medial flexion gap, which creates mediolateral laxity in flexion. Improvements in FFD following PCL resection are dependent on the degree of deformity before PCL resection. Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2019;101-B:1230-1237."

At present, CAS procedures are established in dorsal spine instrumentation, prosthetics and long bone surgery. Present status and future of CAS was a topic of an expert meeting at the Reisensburg castle. Imaging will speed up in the future using multi-detector techniques. C-arm navigation will gain more information using the 3D technology intraoperatively. CT based navigation procedures are standard in spine and will be established in pelvic surgery. CAS in robotics at the moment means the use of robot-assistance. A new concept is the modality-based navigated surgery, which can be used at various skeletal locations. Visualization of patient data will improve using 3D semi-transparencies with real time update. In the future it will be mandatory to find algorithms to fuse the different possibilities and techniques. A new concept of surgical training is necessary to teach CAS procedures. Therefore discussion must go on to improve these systems."
pub.1121175895,"Computer assisted orthopaedic surgery: Past, present and future","Computer technology is ubiquitous and relied upon in virtually all professional activities including neurosurgery, which is why it is surprising that it is not the case for orthopaedic surgery with fewer than 5% of surgeons using available computer technology in their procedures. In this review, we explore the evolution and background of Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS), delving into the basic principles behind the technology and the changes in the discussion on the subject throughout the years and the impact these discussions had on the field. We found evidence that industry had an important role in driving the discussion at least in knee arthroplasty-a leading field of CAOS-with the ratio between patents and publications increased from approximately 1:10 in 2004 to almost 1:3 in 2014. The adoption of CAOS is largely restrained by economics and ergonomics with sceptics challenging the accuracy and precision of navigation during the early years of CAOS moving to patient functional improvements and long term survivorship. Nevertheless, the future of CAOS remains positive with the prospect of new technologies such as improvements in image-guided surgery, enhanced navigation systems, robotics and artificial intelligence."
pub.1107539903,Computer-Aided Orthopedic Surgery: Incremental Shift or Paradigm Change?,"Computer-aided orthopedic surgery (CAOS) is now about 25 years old. Unlike neurosurgery, computer-aided surgery has not become the standard of care in orthopedic surgery. In this paper, we provide the technical and clinical context raised by this observation in an attempt to elucidate the reasons for this state of affairs. We start with a brief outline of the history of CAOS, review the main CAOS technologies, and describe how they are evaluated. We then identify some of the current publications in the field and present the opposing views on their clinical impact and their acceptance by the orthopedic community worldwide. We focus on total knee replacement surgery as a case study and present current clinical results and contrasting opinions on CAOS technologies. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities for research in medical image analysis in CAOS and in musculoskeletal radiology. We conclude with a suggestion that while CAOS acceptance may be more moderate than that of other fields in surgery, it still has a place in the arsenal of useful tools available to orthopedic surgeons."
pub.1020920809,"Validation of the femoral component placement during hip resurfacing: a comparison between the conventional jig, patient‐specific template, and CT‐based navigation","BACKGROUND: Appropriate insertion of a femoral guidewire is essential for hip resurfacing. A simulation study was planned using synthetic femoral bone models and the accuracy and precision of femoral guidewire alignment and insertion point were compared between conventional jigs, patient-specific templates, and computed tomography (CT) based navigation techniques.
METHODS: Anteversion, stem-shaft angle, and the three-dimensional insertion point were measured postoperative with CT. Errors between planned and postoperative measurement and precision were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in error for anteversion or insertion point, although the mechanical jig showed greater error in the stem-shaft angle than the others. Patient-specific template and CT-based navigation showed good precision with high intraclass correlation (ICC) (template, 0.908 to 1.000; navigation, 0.929 to 0.995) and small root mean square error (RMSE) (0.954 to 2.969; 1.468 to 3.213). The mechanical jig group performance was inferior to the others.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific templates and CT-based navigation had good accuracy and precision. The mechanical jig technique was inferior to the others."
pub.1074812723,Using robots in hip prosthesis implantation. Precision with the wrong concept?.,"Robot-assisted milling permits more precise preparation of the proximal femur, without necessarily optimizing stem placement. Currently propagated implantation concepts involving maximized implant-cortical bone contact may result in major biomechanical disadvantages, such as unphysiological load transfer in the proximal femur and increased stiffening in this region and subsequent stress shielding. While equipment procurement and running costs are higher, evidence of longer prosthetic life over the long-term has not been forthcoming. Against this background, present efforts to propagate this system for general use in hip replacement surgery cannot be justified."
pub.1074832505,"Computer-assisted, robot-assisted hip prosthesis--standard procedure or specialty indication?.","Approximately 150,000 total hip replacements annually are performed in Germany, with an increasing incidence of implants carried out on young subjects. Due to aseptic loosening, this group will undergo some revision arthroplasty after 15 years. Therefore, a permanent fixation appears mandatory. In case of posttraumatic or postoperative anatomical changes, exact preoperative planning by x-rays is extremely difficult. This might result in a higher rate of complications (e.g., displacement of the implanted prosthesis, fractures of the proximal femur), as documented by the available literature. The preoperative planning with CT images obtained at the 3D workstation shows the exact cortical situation, while the robot-assisted surgery allows the precise execution of the preoperative plan during surgery. By this point of time, long-term results of computer-guided, robot-assisted implantation of endoprosthesic devices are still lacking. However, the preliminary data indicate good results by means of anatomical position of the endoprosthesis and perioperative complications."
pub.1053030066,Effects of a contoured articular prosthetic device on tibiofemoral peak contact pressure: a biomechanical study,"Many middle-aged patients are affected by localized cartilage defects that are neither appropriate for primary, nor repeat biological repair methods, nor for conventional arthroplasty. This in vitro study aims to determine the peak contact pressure in the tibiofemoral joint with a partial femoral resurfacing device (HemiCAP, Arthrosurface Inc., Franklin, MA, USA). Peak contact pressure was determined in eight fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens using a Tekscan sensor placed in the medial compartment above the menisci. A closed loop robotic knee simulator was used to test each knee in static stance positions (5 degrees /15 degrees /30 degrees /45 degrees ) with body weight ground reaction force (GRF), 30 degrees flexion with twice the body weight (2tBW) GRF and dynamic knee-bending cycles with body weight GRF. The ground reaction force was adjusted to the living body weight of the cadaver donor and maintained throughout all cycles. Each specimen was tested under four different conditions: Untreated, flush HemiCAP implantation, 1-mm proud implantation and 20-mm defect. A paired sampled t test to compare means (significance, P < or = 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. On average, no statistically significant differences were found in any testing condition comparing the normal knee with flush device implantation. With the 1-mm proud implant, statistically significant increase of peak contact pressures of 217% (5 degrees stance), 99% (dynamic knee bending) and 90% (30 degrees stance with 2tBW) compared to the untreated condition was seen. No significant increase of peak contact pressure was evaluated with the 20-mm defect. The data suggests that resurfacing with the HemiCAP does not lead to increased peak contact pressure with flush implantation. However, elevated implantation results in increased peak contact pressure and might be biomechanically disadvantageous in an in vivo application."
pub.1169762478,Favorable early outcomes of medial unicompartimental knee arthroplasty in active patients presenting a degenerative medial meniscus root tear with meniscal extrusion and mild radiographic osteoarthritis,"IntroductionThere is only limited literature available evaluating the preferable treatment for active mid-age or elderly patients presenting with a degenerative medial meniscus root tear (d-MMRT) with medial meniscal extrusion (MME) and early-phase radiographic osteoarthritis (OA), failing to provide solid evidence.The aim of this study was to evaluate early outcomes of medial unicompartimental arthroplasty (mUKA) in active patients presenting a d-MMRT with meniscal extrusion and mild radiographic OA of the knee. To prove this claim we hypothesized that (1) patients with a d-MMRT with initial grade 1–3 KL OA of the medial compartment of the knee present the same pre-operative symptoms as patients with an end-stage grade 4 K-L OA, and that (2) those patients with d-MMRT and low-grade OA achieve the same early clinical and functional outcomes when treated with mUKA compared to patients with end-stage medial OA.MethodsWe reviewed the prospectively collected data of 185 patients undergoing robotic-assisted image-based mUKA from January 2021 to July 2022 at a single Institution. We identified two different cohorts of non-consecutive patients: a group of 24 patients undergoing mUKA surgery following d-MMRT combined with K-L grades 1–3 OA (group 1), and a group of 161 patients who underwent mUKA but presenting with an end-stage bone-on-bone K-L grade 4 OA (group 2). Preoperative and postoperative clinical assessments at one-year follow-up included the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L score), and a standard weight-bearing X-ray protocol. The paired t-test was used to compare clinical outcomes and radiologic values of the two cohorts and in-between the two cohorts. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.ResultsThe mean follow-up for group 1 was 16.4 ± 2.5 months, and the mean age at the time of operation was 63 ± 8.6 years with a mean time from diagnosis to intervention of 53 ± 47.5 days. Preoperative impairment was greater in group 1 compared to group 2, but with no significant difference. Postoperatively, both groups showed excellent mean outcomes at 1-year follow-up, with no significant difference. The mean preoperative HKA, mPTA, and LDFA were 176.3 ± 3.1, 88.1 ± 2.3, and 86.6 ± 1.7 respectively. The mean postoperative HKA, coronal femoral component angle, and coronal tibial component angle were 179.1 ± 2.6, 87.2 ± 2.3, and 87.2 ± 3.3. No difference was found between preoperative age, BMI, between the two cohorts.ConclusionsFavorable early clinical outcomes were obtained after mUKA in active mid-age and elderly patients presenting with degenerative medial meniscus root tear and mild isolated medial OA. Patients with mild no bone-on-bone OA but with degenerative medial meniscus root tear and medial meniscal extrusion presented the same or worse pre-operative symptoms as patients with end-stage medial OA and benefit the same from mUKA."
pub.1166189614,[Translated article] Clinical results of total hip arthroplasty assisted by robotic arm in Spain: Preliminary study,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical, radiological and functional results of the first Spanish series of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty assisted by Mako® (Stryker) robotic arm at the Hospital Clínico San Carlos (HCSC) in Madrid.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective and descriptive study analyzing the first 25 patients who underwent robotic-assisted THA at the HCSC, with a minimum follow-up of 4 months. Demographics, imaging studies (Mako® processing, Rx and CT), clinical parameters, functionality (modified Harris) and associated complications were evaluated.
RESULTS: Average age was 67.2 years (min 47, max 88), being 56% male population sample. 88% involves primary coxarthrosis, 4% post-traumatic coxarthrosis, 4% secondary avascular necrosis and 4% secondary femoroacetabular impingement. Average surgery time was 116.9min (min 92, max 150). The average time of the first five surgeries was 122.6min, and, regarding the last five interventions, it was 108.2min. Found medical intraoperative complications were four intraoperative markers loss. Average admission time was 4.4days (min 3, max 7), with an average postoperative haemoglobin decrease of 3.08±1.08g/dl, requiring a transfusion in 12% of the cases. Three medical complications have been registered in the meantime of the admission, with a relevant case of a confusional syndrome and a fall, which resulted in a non-displaced AG1 periprosthetic fracture. The analysis of the positioning of registered implants with Mako® system shows 40.55±1.53 acetabular inclination degrees and 12.2±3.6 acetabular anteversion degrees. The postoperative image study carried out on patients, are consistent with Mako® results, as it shows an acetabular inclination of 41.2±1.7 in Rx, as well as acetabular anteversion of 16±4.6 in CT. Hip length variance ranges depending on preoperative values of 3.91mm (SD: 3.9; min -12, max 3) to 1.29mm (SD: 1.96) after surgery registered with Mako®, with an increase of an average hip length of 5.64mm (SD: 3.35). Rx simple study results show a postoperative difference between both hips of 0.5±3.08mm, which is consistent with Mako® results. Native femoral offset was stable after surgery with a showing difference both pre and post operative of the intervened hip of 0.1mm (SD: 3.7), registered with Mako®. Preoperatory modified Harris punctuation was 41.6±13.3, improving to postoperative values of 74.6±9.7 after four months since the surgery. No complications were registered in immediate postoperative (4 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Total hip arthroplasty robot-assisted achieves an adequate precision and repeatability of the implant positioning and the postoperative hip dysmetry without showing an increase of associated complications to the technique applied. Surgery time, complications and functional results in a short-time period are similar to conventional techniques applied to great series previously published."
pub.1151998550,"Situación actual de la robótica en cirugía protésica de rodilla, ¿una tecnología que ha venido para quedarse?","Robotic surgery is a surgical technique that is on the rise. The goal of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) is to provide the surgeon with a tool to accurately execute bone cuts according to previous surgical planning to restore knee kinematics and balance of soft tissue, being able to precisely apply the type of alignment that we choose. In addition, RA-TKA is a very useful tool for training. Within the limitations, there is the learning curve, the need for specific equipment, the high cost of the devices, the increase in radiation in some systems and that each robot is linked to a specific type of implant. Current studies show, with RA-TKA, variations in the alignment of the mechanical axis are reduced, postoperative pain is improved and earlier discharge is facilitated. On the other hand, there are no differences in terms of range of motion, alignment, gap balance, complications, surgical time or functional results."

Methods  This is a retrospective cohort study. The clinical data of 1 867 patients who underwent primary knee arthroplasty at Department of Joint Surgery, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from April 2022 to June 2023 were retrospectively analysed, including total knee arthroplasty (TKA), robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) and unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA). There were 687 males and 1 180 females, aged (68.0±11.2)years(range:45 to 87 years). Patients were divided into the vancomycin group and the control group according to whether or not intra-articular injection of 1 g of vancomycin powder dissolved in 30 ml of saline was performed after intraoperative joint capsule closure. In the vancomycin group, 925 patients were included, including 782 TKA, 27 RA-TKA and 116 UKA.In the control group, 942 patients were included, including 767 TKA, 99 RA-TKA and 76 UKA. Early PJI, wound complications, and vancomycin-related toxicity including acute renal collapse, ototoxicity, and allergic reactions were assessed within 3 months postoperatively. The data were compared using the independent sample t test, χ ² test, and Fisher's exact probability method, as appropriate. Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium (METRC).   Results  No PJI was found in all patients in the vancomycin group.Five cases (0.7%,5/767) of early PJI were found in TKA patients in the control group, with a statistically significant difference ( P =0.030); 1 case of early PJI was found in each RA-TKA and UKA patients, with non-significant difference compared with vancomycin group (all P >0.05). Two cases (0.3%,2/782) of incisional complications were found in TKA patients in the vancomycin group, and 4 cases (0.5%, 4/767) of incisional complications were found in TKA patients in the control group, with non-significant difference( P =0.449); no incisional complication was found in RA-TKA patients in the vancomycin group, and 1 case (1.0%,1/99) of incisional complications were found in RA-TKA patients in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant ( P >0.05); no incisional complication was found in both groups of UKA patients.No vancomycin-related acute kidney injury, ototoxicity, or allergic reactions was observed in all patients.   Conclusion  Intra-articular injection of 1 g of vancomycin suspension after arthrotomy closure during TKA maybe lower the risk of early PJI without increasing the risk of wound complication and vancomycin-associated systemic toxicity."
pub.1106946161,[Progress of total ankle arthroplasty for end-stage ankle osteoarthritis].,"Objective: To review the progress of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) in treatment of end-stage ankle osteoarthritis (AOA).
Methods: The domestic and foreign literatures about TAA in recent years were reviewed. The current status and progress of TAA were summarized from the results of traditional and computer-assisted TAA clinical outcomes.
Results: End-stage AOA often leads to severe pain and dysfunction, and arthrodesis is still the main selective treatment option. In recent years, with the advancement of surgical techniques and prosthesis design, TAA which can remain joint mobility has increased gradually, and the surgical results also have significant progress. Accurate prosthesis implant and mechanical alignment restoration are critical factors for TAA, and surgery-related malalignment is correlative to the prosthesis failure. Computer assisted patient-specific guide can simplify the TAA procedures and obtain the accuracy of tibia and talus osteotomy.
Conclusion: The clinical efficiency of preoperative CT based patient-specific guide technology for TAA needs further clinical follow-up. Meanwhile, it is necessary to further develop intraoperative navigation and robotic surgery system suitable for TAA."

METHOD: Within a prospective study 70 total hip replacements were performed by one surgeon (KB) between March and November, 1999 using a CAS system for preoperative planning and intraoperative cup placement.
RESULTS: The average operating time was 70 min. This means an average increase in total time of operation about 15-20 min. The average blood loss was 630 ml. No additional specific complications due to the use of the system were seen. There was no additional trauma created by percutaneous pointing at the spina or flxing a dynamic reference base (DRB) at the pelvis.
CONCLUSION: The active application of this CAS system in clinical routine use showed very good results in feasibility and can be considered as reliable. The navigated cup placement shows the potential of improving the results in cup placement, thus improving the outcome of hip arthroplasty."

DESIGN: Quasi-experimental study using a nonequivalent posttest-only control group design, comprising 20 unilateral THR patients and a convenience sample of 22 healthy older adults. THR patients participated between 4 and 5 mos after surgery. THR subjects received an average of 13 outpatient or home-based physical therapy sessions. Isokinetic muscle strength and fatigue was assessed through measurement of hip peak torque per body weight, total work, and average power using a robotic dynamometer.
RESULTS: Comparisons of THR subjects' operated vs. nonoperated hips showed no significant differences in isokinetic performance for any of the examined variables. THR subjects' operated hips generated significantly less peak torque per body weight, total work, and average power across all exercises as compared with a population of healthy subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: THR subjects' operated and nonoperated hips showed similar biomechanical performance. THR patients are not being restored to the same level of strength and muscular endurance as compared with a population of healthy adults. These findings may be useful in providing a preliminary rationale for revising current approaches in THR rehabilitation protocols."
pub.1090701622,Multi-level spine endoscopy,"In the last ten years, there has been an exponential increase in endoscopic spinal surgery practice.With improvements in equipment quality and the availability of high definition camera systems, cervical endoscopic disc resection is now a viable alternative to anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) or disc arthroplasty for the treatment of disc prolapse and low grade stenosis.Based on the current literature, there is now strong evidence to support the use of transforaminal endoscopic approaches for the treatment of thoracic disc prolapse.There is now level I evidence to show that outcomes following transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (TED) are at least equivalent to those after open microdiscectomy, with an expected shorter operating time, lesser requirement for analgesia, reduced duration of post-operative disability, more rapid rehabilitation and lower costs of care. However, it should be recognised that there is a significant learning curve for TED.New endoscopic techniques with interlaminar approaches allow the decompression of central and lateral recess stenosis. Future developments will facilitate vision and access to the spine with 3D imaging and robotics at the forefront.We present a case report of whole spine endoscopic decompression to illustrate the potential of endoscopic surgery at all spinal levels.

Hence, the Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) developed for this type of training employs task-specific, user-centered navigation and autonomous, real-time gait feature classification techniques to enrich the self-training through companionship and timely corrective feedback. The evaluation of the system took place during user tests in a hospital from the point of view of technical benchmarking, considering the therapists' and patients' point of view with regard to training motivation and from the point of view of initial findings on medical efficacy as a prerequisite from an economic perspective. In this paper, the following research questions were primarily considered: Does the level of technology achieved enable autonomous use in everyday clinical practice? Has the gait pattern of patients who used additional robot-assisted gait self-training for several days been changed or improved compared to patients without this training? How does the use of a SAR-based self-training robot affect the motivation of the patients?"
pub.1024101225,The internal calcar septum and its contact with the virtual stem in THRA computer tomographic evaluation,"The internal calcar septum is a ridge of cortical bone protruding from the inner cortical wall of the proximal femur into the medullary canal. It extends from the lesser trochanter into the femoral neck and narrows the femoral cavity in its dorsal third. This region is essential for THR stability, but the degree of contact between the septum and standard THR implants has never been studied. We obtained CT scans of 50 arthrotic hip joints from patients requiring THR. Virtual stems (50 straight/wedge-shaped and 50 anatomic stems) were placed in CT images of the femora using a PC-based preoperative planning unit. The dimensions of the septum, degree and location of contact between the septum and implants were recorded. A septum of cortical density was seen in 49/50 CT scans. It was 11 (2.9) mm long (medial-lateral), 3.5 (0.7) mm wide and 32 (10) mm high (caudal-cranial, mean (SD)). 94/100 implanted virtual stems showed direct contact with the septum. 31 straight stems and 5 anatomical stems were supported by the septum along their dorsal side. The internal calcar septum can be consistently seen on CT scans of patients needing THR and it probably contributes to THR stability."
pub.1078189566,Heat Generation during Cement Removal in Revision Total Hip Replacement - a Comparison of Three Methods,"High speed cutting and ultrasound devices for cement extraction from the femoral cavity in hip revision procedures are frequently used. Such devices generate heat at the cutting interface which may damage osteocytes. One ultrasound device, a manual high-speed cutter and a robot-based high-speed cutter were tested in human cadaveric bone at body temperature. Temperature probes were placed at the cement-bone interface, and data collected from 12 sensors with a digital data-logger during cement removal from the femoral cavity. Peak temperatures from each sensor were recorded and compared by Kruskal-Wallis-H-Test for global effect and Mann-Whitney-U-Test for multiple comparisons. All devices generated mean temperature peaks of over 50 degrees C which is above levels considered safe. A peak temperature of 164 degrees C was reached by the ultrasound system. Significant differences between the three devices exist, with the ultrasound generating the highest median peak temperatures of 107 degrees C. The lowest median peak temperature of 65 degrees C was generated by the high-speed cutting system.Major improvements of the irrigation and cooling systems of the devices seem to be necessary."
pub.1173872772,Economic analysis of digital motor rehabilitation technologies: a systematic review,"Rehabilitation technologies offer promising opportunities for interventions for patients with motor disabilities. However, their use in routine care remains limited due to their high cost and persistent doubts about their cost-effectiveness. Providing solid evidence of the economic efficiency of rehabilitation technologies would help dispel these doubts in order to better take advantage of these technologies. In this context, this systematic review aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions based on the use of digital technologies. In total, 660 articles published between 2011 and 2021 were identified, of which eleven studies met all the inclusion criteria. Of these eleven studies, seven proved to be cost-effective, while four were not. Four studies used cost-utility analyses (CUAs) and seven used cost-minimization analyses (CMAs). The majority (ten studies) focused on the rehabilitation of the upper and/or lower limbs after a stroke, while only one study examined the rehabilitation of the lower limbs after knee arthroplasty. Regarding the evaluated devices, seven studies analyzed the cost-effectiveness of robotic rehabilitation and four analyzed rehabilitation with virtual reality.The assessment of the quality of the included studies using the CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) suggested that the quality was related to the economic analysis method: all studies that adopted a cost-utility analysis obtained a high quality score (above 80%), while the quality scores of the cost-minimization analyses were average, with the highest score obtained by a CMA being 72%. The average quality score of all the articles was 75%, ranging between 52 and 100. Of the four studies with a considering score, two concluded that there was equivalence between the intervention and conventional care in terms of cost-effectiveness, one concluded that the intervention dominated, while the last one concluded that usual care dominated. This suggests that even considering the quality of the included studies, rehabilitation interventions based on digital technologies remain cost-effective, they improved health outcomes and quality of life for patients with motor disorders while also allowing cost savings."
pub.1165884338,Unrestricted kinematic alignment corrects fixed flexion contracture in robotically aligned total knees without raising the joint line in extension,"PURPOSE: Mechanically Aligned Total Knee Arthroplasty (MA TKA) typically addresses fixed flexion contractures (FFC) by raising the joint line during extension. However, in unrestricted Kinematically Aligned TKA (KA TKA) utilizing a caliper-based resection technique, the joint line is not raised. This study aims to determine the efficacy of KA TKA in restoring full extension in patients with FFC without increasing distal femoral resection, considering tibial bone resection and sagittal component positioning.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted by a single surgeon, involving patients who underwent primary robotically assisted cruciate retaining unrestricted KA TKA between June 1, 2021, and December 1, 2022. Complete intraoperative resection and alignment data were recorded, including the thickness of distal femoral and proximal tibial bone cuts. Patients with a preoperative FFC ≥ 5° (study group) were compared to those with FFC < 5° (control group). The impact of variations in tibial resection and sagittal component positioning was assessed by comparing the heights of medial and lateral resections, sagittal femoral component flexion, and tibial slope. Group comparisons were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, with a significance level set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 48 KA TKA procedures met the inclusion criteria, with 24 performed on women. The mean preoperative FFC in the study group was 11.2° (range: 5-25°), while the control group exhibited 1° (range: 0-4°) (p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences observed between the study and control groups in terms of distal femoral resections, both medially (p = 0.14) and laterally (p = 0.23), as well as tibial resection heights, both medially (p = 0.66) and laterally (p = 0.74). The alignment of the femoral component flexion and tibial slope was comparable between the two groups (p = 0.31 and p = 0.54, respectively). All patients achieved within 5 degrees of full extension at closure.
CONCLUSION: Robotic arm-assisted unrestricted KA TKA effectively restores full extension without raising the joint line during extension for patients with a preoperative fixed flexion contracture.

pub.1154925080,"Digital TKA Alignment Training with a New Digital Simulation Tool (Knee-CAT) Improves Process Quality, Efficiency, and Confidence","Individual alignment techniques have been introduced to restore patients' unique anatomical variations during total knee arthroplasty. The transition from conventional mechanical alignment to individualised approaches, with the assistance of computer and/or robotic technologies, is challenging. The objective of this study was to develop a digital training platform with real patient data to educate and simulate various modern alignment philosophies. The aim was to evaluate the training effect of the tool by measuring the process quality and efficiency, as well as the post-training surgeon's confidence with new alignment philosophies. Based on 1000 data sets, a web-based interactive TKA computer navigation simulator (Knee-CAT) was developed. Quantitative decisions on bone cuts were linked to the extension and flexion gap values. Eleven different alignment workflows were introduced. A fully automatic evaluation system for each workflow, with a comparison function for all workflows, was implemented to increase the learning effect. The results of 40 surgeons with different experience levels using the platform were assessed. Initial data were analysed regarding process quality and efficiency and compared after two training courses. Process quality measured by the percentage of correct decisions was increased by the two training courses from 45% to 87.5%. The main reasons for failure were wrong decisions on the joint line, tibia slope, femoral rotation, and gap balancing. Efficiency was obtained with a reduction in time spent per exercise from 4 min 28 s to 2 min 35 s (42%) after the training courses. All volunteers rated the training tool as helpful or extremely helpful for learning new alignment philosophies. Separating the learning experience from OR performance was mentioned as one of the main advantages. A novel digital simulation tool for the case-based learning of various alignment philosophies in TKA surgery was developed and introduced. The simulation tool, together with the training courses, improved surgeon confidence and their ability to learn new alignment techniques in a stress-free out-of-theatre environment and to become more time efficient in making correct alignment decisions."

Methods This was a cross-sectional observational study conducted at the KIMS-Sunshine Hospitals, Hyderabad, a high-volume tertiary care institute in India, in which patients with end-stage osteoarthritis requiring primary total knee arthroplasty were evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire, which assessed both patient-related and surgeon-related factors in choosing their joint replacement surgeon. Results A total of 210 participants were surveyed among whom the majority were females with an average age of 60.2 years with the majority belonging to the upper-middle-class socioeconomic status (48.6%, N=102). Fifty-nine percent preferred surgeons with over 20 years of experience, and 63.8% were willing to travel out-of-state for recognized expertise. Family recommendations (33.8%) and surgeon reputation (24.3%) were primary factors in surgeon selection. A vast majority (73.3%) preferred surgeons who were skilled in robotic surgery and had foreign training (32.9%). However, the majority (67.6%) did not express any gender preference. The survey highlighted a broad range of informational sources affecting decisions, including financial consideration (63.8%), personal referrals, and online platforms (17.1%). Preferences were also shaped by hospital reputation and insurance options (10.5%), illustrating a nuanced interplay of quality, cost, and personal connections in the selection process. Conclusion The findings of this survey illuminate the intricate and diverse preferences exhibited by patients when selecting a surgeon for joint replacement surgery. A significant rise in patient expectations is evident, underscoring a demand for more personalized, contemporary, and high-quality healthcare services. Importantly, geographical proximity appears to be a diminishing concern in their decision-making process. This trend presents an opportunity for centers of excellence to extend their influence and attract patients on both a regional and national level."
pub.1141915453,[Application of Mako robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty in developmental dysplasia of the hip].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the early effectiveness and summarize the initial application experiences of Mako robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in adults.
METHODS: Between August 2018 and January 2020, 55 cases of DDH (75 hips) were treated with Mako robot-assisted THA. There were 10 males and 45 females with an average age of 51 years (range, 30-73 years). There were 35 cases of unilateral hip and 20 cases of bilateral hips. The DDH was classified as Crowe type Ⅰin 29 hips, type Ⅱ in 20 hips, type Ⅲ in 6 hips, and type Ⅳ in 20 hips. The modified Harris score was 54.8±16.0, the hip joint range of motion was 90° (80°, 100°), and the leg length discrepancy (LLD) was 22.0 (10.5, 47.0) mm. The preoperative surgical plan was made in the robot system based on the CT data. The reaming and installation of the acetabular cup were completed with the assistance of the robot system. The distance between the rotation center of the hip joint and the teardrop (horizontal distance, vertical distance), inclination angle, and anteversion angle were measured on the pelvic X-ray film to evaluate the position of the acetabular prosthesis. The above indicators were compared with preoperative planning to evaluate the accuracy of robotic-assisted surgery. The modified Harris score, the range of motion, and the LLD were used to evaluate the early effectiveness.
RESULTS: The 75 hips of THAs were completed with the assistance of Mako robots. There was no significant difference in the acetabular inclination angle, the horizontal distance and the vertical distance of the rotation center between the preoperative planning and the postoperative measurement values ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05); the acetabular anteversion angle was significantly smaller than the postoperative measurement value ( <i>t</i>=-2.482, <i>P</i>=0.015). Four hips located beyond the Lewinnek safety zone, and 71 hips located within the Lewinnek safety zone. All patients followed up 6-24 months (mean, 13 months). All incisions healed by first intention. At last follow-up, the modified Harris score was 85.5±11.2, the hip joint range of motion was 120° (110°, 120°), and the LLD was 3.8 (2.0, 8.1) mm; all improved significantly compared with preoperative ones ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Except for one nerve injury case, there was no other complication.
CONCLUSION: Mako robot-assisted THA is a safe and effective method for adult DDH, which can optimize the acetabular cup positioning, hip function, and leg length, but the long-term effectiveness needs to be confirmed by further studies."
pub.1162720952,Long leg radiographs underestimate the degree of constitutional varus limb alignment and joint line obliquity in comparison with computed tomography: a radiographic study,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to understand if differences exist between computed tomography (CT) and long leg radiographs (LLR) when defining coronal plane alignment of the lower limb in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It aimed to identify any such differences between the two imaging modalities by quantifying constitutional limb alignment (arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA), joint line obliquity (JLO) and Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) type within the same population.
METHODS: A retrospective radiographic study compared pre-operative LLR and CT measurements in patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA. The aHKA, JLO and CPAK types were calculated after measuring the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA). The primary outcomes were the mean differences in aHKA (MPTA-LDFA), JLO (MPTA + LDFA) and proportions of CPAK types between LLR and CT groups. The secondary outcomes were the differences in CT-derived MPTA values based on four different tibial sagittal landmarks.
RESULTS: After exclusions, 465 imaging sets were analysed in 394 patients. There was a statistically significant mean difference between LLR and CT, respectively, for both MPTA (87.5° vs. 86.2°; p < 0.01) and LDFA (88.7° vs. 87.3°; p < 0.01). There were also statistically significant differences for aHKA (- 0.2° vs. - 1.1°) and JLO (175.1° vs. 173.4°) for LLR and CT, respectively (both p < 0.01). CT increased the proportion of patients with CPAK Type I (constitutional varus aHKA, apex distal JLO) and CPAK Type II (neutral aHKA, apex distal JLO), and decreased numbers of CPAK Types III-VI. There were significant mean differences in the MPTA using varying sagittal landmarks.
CONCLUSION: Alignment determined by LLRs underestimates the magnitude of both constitutional varus alignment and joint line obliquity compared to CT, differences that notably increase the proportions of patients included in CPAK Types I and II. These distinctions are primarily due to underestimation of proximal tibial varus when measured on LLRs compared to CT, which more specifically defines articular weight-bearing points.

pub.1144868232,Effect of Total Ankle Arthroplasty Implantation and Adaptive Gait on Ankle and Adjacent Joint Kinematics During Simulated Gait," Category: Ankle; Ankle Arthritis; Basic Sciences/Biologics   Introduction/Purpose: Clinical and functional improvement after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) in end-stage ankle arthritis has been well documented. However, despite the implantation of TAA devices designed to restore normal walking kinematics, patients with end-stage arthritis develop compensatory walking patterns which do not return to normal, postoperatively. This discrepancy between the normative and adaptive gait patterns could influence implant loading and intended function; however, the independent influence of implant constraints and adaptive gait on joint function is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to isolate the individual and combined effects of TAA implantation and gait adaption from ankle arthritis on foot and ankle kinematics during simulated level walking. We hypothesized that foot and ankle kinematics would primarily be altered through adaptations in gait resulting from ankle arthritis.   Methods: Twelve mid-tibia cadaveric specimens were utilized. A validated six-degree of freedom robotic gait simulator was used to simulate the stance phase [3]. The specimen was first placed on the simulator in the intact condition, simulated with both healthy and adaptive gait inputs collected from healthy and post-surgical TAA subjects (average follow-up: 46 months), respectively. The TAA (Salto Talaris; Integra LifeSciences) was then implanted, and adaptive and healthy gait trials were conducted in the implanted condition. Four conditions were collected on each specimen: intact with a healthy walking trajectory (intact- healthy), intact with an adaptive walking trajectory (intact-adaptive), implanted with TAA with a healthy walking trajectory (TAA- healthy), and implanted with TAA with an adaptive gait trajectory (TAA-adaptive). Ankle, subtalar, and talonavicular joint kinematics in each condition were compared to intact-healthy to isolate the effects of implantation and adaptive gait on kinematics. Bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the difference between conditions.   Results: Significant differences were observed in the ankle, subtalar, and talonavicular joints across all comparisons. In the comparison between the intact-healthy and intact-adaptive conditions, to isolate the effect of adaptive gait (Figure 1A), ankle dorsiflexion and subtalar eversion increased late in stance, while talonavicular abduction increased in early and late stance. In the comparison between intact-healthy and TAA-healthy conditions, to isolate the effect of implant constraints (Figure 1B), ankle plantarflexion, subtalar eversion, and talonavicular abduction significantly increased in mid-stance after implantation. In the comparison between the intact healthy and the TAA-adaptive conditions, to evaluate the combined effect of adaptive gait and implantation (Figure 1C), ankle plantarflexion was increased during early stance and decreased in late stance, subtalar eversion inc"

Our objectives were to compare the impact of (1) a predictive digital joint tensioning tool on intra-operative joint balance; and (2) joint balance and flexion joint laxity on patient-reported outcomes.Materials and methodsTwo-hundred Eighty patients received posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing TKA with ultra-congruent tibial inserts using a robotic-assisted navigation platform. Patients were divided into those in which a Predictive Plan with a digital joint-tensioning device was used (PP) and those in which it was not (NPP), in all cases final post-operative joint gaps were collected immediately before final implantation. Demographics and KOOS were collected pre-operatively. KOOS, complications and satisfaction were collected at 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively. Optimal balance difference between PP and NPP was defined and compared using area-under-the-curve analysis (AUC). Outcomes were then compared according to the results from the AUC.ResultsAUC analysis yielded a balance threshold of 1.5 mm, in which the PP group achieved a higher rate of balance throughout flexion compared to the NPP group: extension: 83 vs 52%; Midflexion: 82 vs 55%; Flexion 89 vs 68%; Flexion to Extension 80 vs 49%; p ≤ 0.003. Higher KOOS scores were observed in knees balanced within 1.5 mm across all sub-scores at various time points, however, differences did not exceed the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Patients with > 1.5 mm flexion laxity medially or laterally had an increased likelihood of 2.2 (1.1–4.4) and 2.5 (1.3–4.8), respectively, for failing to achieve the Patient Acceptable Symptom State for KOOS Pain at 12 months. Patient satisfaction was high in both the PP and NPP groups (97.4 and 94.7%, respectively).ConclusionsUse of a predictive joint tensioning tool improved the final balance in TKA. Improved outcomes were found in balanced knees; however, this improvement did not achieve the MCID, suggesting further studies may be required to define optimal balance targets. Limiting medial and lateral flexion laxity resulted in an increased likelihood of achieving the Patient Acceptable Symptom State for KOOS Pain."
pub.1127866695,Threshold for Computer- and Robot-Assisted Knee and Hip Replacements in the English National Health Service,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate threshold prices for computer- and robot-assisted knee and hip replacement.
METHODS: A lifetime cohort Markov model provided the framework for analysis. Linked primary care and inpatient hospital records informed estimates of outcomes under current practice. Outcomes were estimated under a range of hypothetical relative improvements in quality of life if unrevised and in revision risk after computer or robot-assisted surgery. Threshold prices, a price at which the net health benefit from funding the intervention would be zero, for these improvements were estimated for a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: For average patient profiles under current knee and hip replacement practice, lifetime QALYs were 10.3 (9.9 to 10.7) and 11.0 (10.6 to 11.4), with costs of £6060 (£5947 to £6203) and £6506 (£6335 to £6710) for knee and hip replacement, respectively. A combined 50% relative reduction in risk of revision and 5% improvement in postoperative quality of life if unrevised would, for example, result in QALYs increasing to 10.9 (10.4 to 11.3) and 11.6 (11.2 to 12.0), and costs falling to £5880 (£5816 to £5956) and £6258 (£6149 to £6376) after knee and hip replacement, respectively. These particular improvements would have an associated threshold price of £11 182 (£10 691 to £11 721) for knee replacement and £12 134 (£11 616 to £12 701) for hip replacement. The 50% reduction in revision rate alone would have associated threshold prices of £1094 (£788 to £1488) and £1347 (£961 to £1842), and the 5% improvement in quality of life alone would have associated threshold prices of £9911 (£9476 to £10 296) and £10 578 (£10 171 to £10 982).
CONCLUSIONS: At current prices, computer- and robot-assisted knee and hip replacement will likely need to lead to improvements in patient-reported outcomes in addition to any reduction in the risk revision."
pub.1150854983,"Can Technology Assistance be Cost Effective in TKA? A Simulation-Based Analysis of a Risk-prioritized, Practice-specific Framework","BACKGROUND: Robotic, navigated, and patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) TKA procedures have been introduced to improve component placement precision and improve implant survivorship and other clinical outcomes. However, the best available evidence has shown that these technologies are ineffective in reducing revision rates in the general TKA patient population. Nonetheless, it seems plausible that these technologies could be an effective and cost-effective means of reducing revision risk in clinical populations that are at an elevated risk of revision because of patient-specific demographics (such as older age at index surgery, elevated BMI, and being a man). Since clinical trials on this topic would need to be very large, a simulation approach could provide insight on which clinical populations would be the most promising for analysis.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We conducted a simulation-based analysis and asked: (1) Given key demographic parameters characterizing a patient population, together with estimates of the precision achievable with selected forms of technology assistance in TKA, can we estimate the expected distributions of anticipated reductions in lifetime revision risk for that population and the associated improvements in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that would be expected to result? (2) Are there realistic practice characteristics (such as combinations of local patient demographics and capital and per-procedure costs) for which applying a per-patient risk-prioritized policy for using technology-assisted TKA could be considered cost-effective based on projected cost savings from reductions in revision rates?
METHODS: We designed simulations of hypothetical practice-specific clinical scenarios, each characterized by patient volume, patient demographics, and technology-assisted surgical technique, using demographic information drawn from other studies to characterize two contrasting simulated clinical scenarios in which the distributions of factors describing patients undergoing TKA place one population at a comparatively elevated risk of revision (elevated-risk population) and the second at a comparatively reduced risk of revision (lower-risk population). We used results from previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses to estimate the implant precision in coronal plane alignment for patient-specific instrumentation, navigated, and robotic technology. We generated simulated TKA patient populations based on risk estimates from large clinical studies, structured reviews, and meta-analyses and calculated the patient-specific reduction in the revision risk and the change in QALYs attributable to the technology-assisted intervention in each of the two simulated clinical scenarios. We also incorporated a sensitivity analysis, incorporating variations in the effect size of deviations from overall coronal alignment on revision risk and difference in health state utilities acquired through a structured review process. We then simulated t"

Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software.
Results: A total of 10 high-quality cohort studies were included.

pub.1141232958,Importance of Hip-Spine Syndrome in Hip Arthroplasty: Influence on the Outcome and Therapeutic Consequences,"Correct interaction between the spine, pelvis, and hip is an essential condition for successful progress after total hip replacement. Spinal pathologies, such as degeneration, fractures, and spinopelvic imbalance with and without lumbar fusions, are closely associated with an increased risk of impingement or even dislocation of the prosthesis. To significantly reduce this risk, various parameters are required to quantify the risk groups. Knowledge on the presence of stiffness of the spine (change in pelvic tilt between standing and sitting at < 10°) and sagittal spinal deformity (pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch > 10° or 20°) is essential in identifying patients with corresponding risk. The individual risk profile can be assessed through a specific history and examination. Before total hip arthroplasty, a routine preoperative workup is recommended for high-risk patients: using information from standardised preoperative radiographs while sitting and standing (pelvis, anteroposterior view, lying and standing; spine and pelvis, lateral view, standing and sitting). Important changes can be made during the surgery. If the spine is stiff, attention should be paid to the position of the cup, with increased anteversion, sufficient offset, and larger head that is secure to dislocation - to reduce the risk of dislocation. In the case of a sagittal spinal deformity, the functional coronary pelvic level must be carefully controlled so that it is better to use double mobility cups. Digital systems, such as navigation and robotics, can optimise component positioning although, so far, there is little evidence that the complication rate decreased. Therefore, further studies are warranted."

High concentrations of Cr, Co, Ni, Ti and Al affect multiple organs such as thyroid, heart, lung and cranial nerves and may lead to metallosis, intoxications, poly-neuropathy, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy and the formation of localized pseudo tumors. The determination of the concentration of metals in body fluids and tissues can be used for predicting failure of hip or knee replacements to prevent subsequent severe intoxications. A semi-automated robot-assisted measurement system is presented for the determination of heavy metals in human tissue samples using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The manual and automated measurement processes were similarly validated using certified reference material and the results are compared and discussed. The automation system was successfully applied in the determination of heavy metals in human tissue; the first results are presented."
pub.1064454939,A quantitative method of effective soft tissue management for varus knees in total knee replacement surgery using navigational techniques,Total knee replacement (TKR) has become the standard procedure in management of degenerative joint disease with its success depending mainly on two factors: three-dimensional alignment and soft-tissue balancing. The aim of this work was to develop and validate an algorithm to indicate appropriate medial soft tissue release during TKR for varus knees using initial kinematics quantified via navigation techniques. Kinematic data were collected intraoperatively for 46 patients with primary end-stage osteoarthritis undergoing TKR surgery using a computer-tomography-free navigation system. All patients had preoperative varus knees and medial release was made using the surgeon's experience. Based on these data an algorithm was developed. This algorithm was validated on a further set of 35 patients where it was used to define the medial release based on the kinematic data. The post-operative valgus stress angles for the two groups were compared. These results showed that the algorithm was a suitable tool to indicate the type of medial release required in varus knees based on intra-operatively measured pre-implant valgus stress and extension deficit angles. It reduced the percentage of releases made and the results were more appropriate than the decisions made by an experienced surgeon.
pub.1005630063,Development and Evaluation of an Instrumented Linkage System for Total Knee Surgery,"The principles and application of total knee surgery using optical tracking have been well demonstrated, but electromagnetic tracking may offer further advantages. We asked whether an instrumented linkage that attaches directly to the bone can maintain the accuracy of the optical and electromagnetic systems but be quicker, more convenient, and less expensive to use. Initial testing using a table-mounted digitizer to navigate a drill guide for placing pins to mount a cutting guide demonstrated the feasibility in terms of access and availability. A first version (called the Mark 1) instrumented linkage designed to fix directly to the bone was constructed and software was written to carry out a complete total knee replacement procedure. The results showed the system largely fulfilled these goals, but some surgeons found that using a visual display for pin placement was difficult and time consuming. As a result, a second version of a linkage system (called the K-Link) was designed to further develop the concept. User-friendly flexible software was developed for facilitating each step quickly and accurately while the placement of cutting guides was facilitated. We concluded that an instrumented linkage system could be a useful and potentially lower-cost option to the current systems for total knee replacement and could possibly have application to other surgical procedures."
pub.1041244852,Primary stability of a robodoc® implanted anatomical stem versus manual implantation,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the initial stability of anatomical stems implanted in manually broached femoral cavities compared with that assessed in cavities milled with the robodoc system.
DESIGN: The bone-prosthesis interface motion was measured in matched pairs of cadaveric femora to assess the initial stability of anatomical stems implanted with two different implantation techniques.
BACKGROUND: The high costs of surgical robots and the increased perioperative efforts associated with their use can only be justified if measurable benefits for patients can be achieved. Increased initial stability of the stem as an early indicator for better bone ongrowth would be such a benefit.
METHODS: Seven pairs of fresh frozen human cadaveric femora were used. One femur of each pair was randomly assigned to receive the robotic milling method; the other femur underwent manual broaching by an experienced surgeon. Initial micromotions of the anatomical stems were measured during simulated gait cycles with loads of < or =1500 N, and both groups underwent matched-pair analysis. Results. High motion of the prostheses was found for both implantation techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: The robodoc system did not enhance the primary stability of the anatomical prosthesis compared with the manual broaching method."
pub.1029207406,A pilot study of post-total knee replacement gait rehabilitation using lower limbs robot-assisted training system,"The aim of this study was to explore the application value of the lower limbs robot-assisted training system for post-total knee replacement (TKR) gait rehabilitation. A total of 60 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were equally randomized into the traditional and robot-assisted rehabilitation training groups within 1 week after TKR. All patients received 2-week training. Scores of hospital for special surgery (HSS), knee kinesthesia grades, knee proprioception grades, functional ambulation (FAC) scores, Berg balance scores, 10-m sitting–standing time, and 6-min walking distances were compared between the groups. The HSS score, Berg score, 10-m sitting–standing time, and 6-min walking distance of the robot-assisted training group were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.05). Its knee kinesthesia grade, knee proprioception grade, and FAC score were better than the control group but not significantly (P > 0.05). Lower limbs robot-assisted rehabilitation training improves post-TKR patients’ knee proprioception and stability more effectively compared with the traditional method. It improves patients’ gait and symptoms, increases their walking speed, and prolongs their walking distances, which benefit their return to family and society."
pub.1076944979,Atlas-based segmentation of pathological knee joints.,"Efficiency, comparability and simplicity are key aspects for user acceptance of surgical planning systems in the long term. Automatic segmentation and identification of geometric reference systems of the anatomical structures are essential to fulfill these requirements. A statistical motivated shape atlas of the knee joint, based on 235 normal and abnormal MR and CT volume sets, is constructed for automatic segmentation of CT image data. In the first step of the atlas construction, the bony structures of the knee were segmented semi-automatically and processed into a dense and a sparse triangulated surface mesh to obtain training data sets. To establish an inter-individual correspondence, a skeleton-based registration method is used. The registered sparse surface meshes are retriangulated to estimate a pointwise inter-individual correspondence. The shape atlas is build upon these correspondences and integrated into a segmentation algorithm. An iterative segmentation scheme is proposed, which consists of a combination of the iterative-closest-point algorithm for spatial registration and of a downhill-simplex optimization procedure for deformation of the statistical motivated shape atlas to the image data. We expect the statistical shape model to be a robust and image modality independent method for the segmentation of pathological knee joints in CT image data."
pub.1061526332,Fluoroscopy-based 3-D reconstruction of femoral bone cement: a new approach for revision total hip replacement,"In revision total hip replacement the removal of the distal femoral bone cement can be a time consuming and risky operation due to the difficulty in determining the three-dimensional (3-D) boundary of the cement. We present a new approach to reconstruct the bone cement volume by using just a small number of calibrated multiplanar X-ray images. The modular system design allows the surgeon to react intraoperatively to problems arising during the individual situation. When encountering problems during conventional cement removal, the system can be used on demand to acquire a few calibrated X-ray images. After a semi-automatic segmentation and 3-D reconstruction of the cement with a deformable model, the system guides the surgeon through a free-hand navigated or robot-assisted cement removal. The experimental evaluation using plastic test implants cemented into anatomic specimen of human femoral bone has shown the potential of this method with a maximal error of 1.2 mm (0.5 mm RMS) for the distal cement based on just 4-5 multiplanar X-ray images. A first test of the complete system, comparing the 3-D-reconstruction with a computed tompgraphy data set, confirmed these results with a mean error about 1 mm."
pub.1042089612,"Alignment of resection planes in total knee replacement obtained with the conventional technique, as assessed by a modern computer‐based navigation system","BACKGROUND: To improve the anatomy-based alignment of prosthetic components in total knee replacement, surgical navigation systems have recently been developed, based on anatomical reference frame definitions through landmark digitations and functional calibration. In this study, femoral and tibial resection plane alignments, obtained by conventional tecnique, were measured intraoperatively during total knee replacements by a navigation system to quantify potential errors in conventional bone preparation techniques.
METHODS: Femoral and tibial resection plane alignments, obtained by conventional femoral intramedullary and tibial extramedullary cutting guides, were measured intraoperatively in 25 primary total knee replacements by a navigation system. This system enabled the surgeon to calculate, before definitive bone sawing, the final position and orientation of all resection planes.
RESULTS: The measurements revealed unsatisfactory alignments in nearly all anatomical planes. Except for tibial varus/valgus, final plane orientations were considerably different from those targeted by the surgeon via the navigation system, respectively 7 degrees, 8 degrees and 10 degrees apart in varus-valgus and flexion-extension at the femur, and in flexion-extension at the tibia.
CONCLUSION: Modern computer-aided surgery in total knee replacement, once relevant precision has been established in all femur and tibia anatomical planes, can in the future limit the current critical component misalignments."
pub.1004395977,Geometric Accuracy in Robot-Assisted Total Hip Replacement Surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Robot-Assisted Surgery in Total Hip Replacement (RAS-THR) has become a fairly widespread procedure for hip replacement surgery in Europe. However, data on the geometric accuracy of the overall process have so far been unavailable. The equipment manufacturers have only published data on the accuracy of certain elements of the procedure (e.g., the accuracy of the robot system). This study aimed to investigate the overall geometric accuracy of the complete process of RAS-THR, as well as the influence of some of the individual component steps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anthropomorphic phantom has been developed representing the hip and upper leg region of a human body. The entire RAS-THR procedure can be carried out using this phantom. Studies were conducted to investigate the overall accuracy of the process, as well as the influence of some individual steps in the procedure, using both the ROBODOC and CASPAR systems.
RESULTS: Overall geometric accuracy of the RAS-THR process was found to be within a standard deviation of 0.5 mm and 0.3 degrees in the critical directions. Most individual steps in the process make similar contributions to the overall variation. The two robot systems examined offer comparable accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Initial results seem to indicate that the RAS-THR process is acceptably accurate. However, acceptance criteria for the necessary geometric accuracy have not yet been defined."
pub.1045609682,A C‐arm fluoroscopy‐guided progressive cut refinement strategy using a surgical robot,"We describe a new method to cut a precise, high-quality femoral cavity in Revision Total Hip Replacement surgery (RTHR) using a surgical robot and an intra-operative C-arm fluoroscope. With respect to previous approaches, our method contains several new features. (1) We describe a novel checkerboard plate designed to correct the geometric distortion within fluoroscopic images. Unlike previous distortion correction devices, the plate does not completely obscure any part of the image, and the distortion correction algorithm works well even when there are some overlaid objects in the field of view. (2) Also included are a novel corkscrew fiducial object designed to be integrated with the robot end-effector, and a 6D pose estimation algorithm based on the two-dimensional (2D) projection of the corkscrew, used in robot-imager registration and imager co-registration. (3) In addition, we develop a cavity location algorithm, which utilizes image subtraction and 2D anatomy contour registration techniques. (4) Finally, we propose a progressive cut refinement strategy, which progressively improves the robot registration during the procedure. We have conducted several experiments, in both simulated and in vitro environments. The results indicate that our strategy is a promising method for precise orthopedic procedures like total hip replacement."
pub.1141915454,[Early effectiveness of robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty via direct superior approach].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the early effectiveness of the robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) via direct superior approach (DSA).
METHODS: Between March 2021 and April 2021, 11 patients (11 hips) were treated with a robot-assisted THA via DSA. There were 7 males and 4 females, with an average age of 55 years (range, 26-73 years). There were 5 patients of osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia and 6 patients of osteonecrosis of femoral head. Preoperative hip Harris score was 55.8±6.3. The operation time, volume of blood loss, length of incision, postoperative blood transfusion and hospital stay, and the incidence of surgical complications were recorded. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score and Harris score were used to evaluate hip joint pain and function. The leg length discrepancy (LLD) was measured on the X-ray films. The inclination angle and anteversion angle of the acetabular component were also measured, and the difference between the planned and actual values were compared.
RESULTS: One THA was performed via conventional posterolateral approach finally because of poor exposure. The rest of 10 THAs were performed with assistance of robotic arm via DSA. The average operation time was 89 minutes (range, 65-120 minutes); the average length of incision was 10.5 cm (range, 9-13 cm); and the average blood loss was 400 mL (range, 110-740 mL). One patient was given a blood transfusion for 2 unit. All incisions healed by first intention and no neurovascular injury, deep vein thrombosis, or fracture occurred. The length of hospital stay after operation was 2-6 days (mean, 4.4 days). The duration of follow-up was 1-3 months (mean, 2.1 months). The VAS score was 0 in 9 patients and 2 in 1 patient at the day of discharge. At last follow-up, the hip Harris score was 84.9±6.7, showing significant difference when compared with that before operation ( <i>t</i>=-8.717, <i>P</i>=0.000). The inclination and anteversion angles were (37.4±2.0)° and (17.1±4.5)°, respectively, and there was no significant difference when compared with the planned values [(38.2±1.6)°, (16.6±3.7)°] ( <i>t</i>=1.809, <i>P</i>=0.104; <i>t</i>=-1.103, <i>P</i>=0.299). The LLD ranged from -2 to 4 mm. No complication such as dislocation, aseptic loosening, or periprosthetic joint infection occurred.
CONCLUSION: The robot-assisted THA via DSA has encouraged early effectiveness."
pub.1009521210,Stellenwert der Navigation und Roboterchirurgie bei Knie-Totalendoprothesen,"Up to now robotics play a minor role in orthopedic surgery because the financing and daily costs of these devices overburden the budgets of normal hospitals. The technical demands are time consuming and pose an additional cost factor. The trauma to the patients in the opinion of some authors is considerable. Nevertheless, robotics play an important role in the further development of orthopedic surgery because improvements in technology will lead to a better operative outcome for the patients.Navigation devices have been developed in the last few years in different centers. From the medical point of view, it is important that navigation systems support surgeons in the analysis of all questions concerning alignment. This pertains not only to rotation analyses of the femur and tibia components but also to analyses of the cinematic gap in flexion and extension. The handling of soft tissues has an important influence on the postoperative function of the knee. It is also a medical issue that the navigation systems should be open, i.e., that different designs of implants could be implanted with one navigation device. There are some systems which offer this quality. Improvements in technology are necessary especially in rotation analyses of the lower limb."

Methods: A clinical data of 54 patients (54 knees) with TKA who met the selection criteria between January 2022 and March 2022 was retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 27 cases underwent traditional TKA (traditional operation group) and 27 cases underwent ""SkyWalker"" robot-assisted TKA (robot-assisted operation group). There was no significant difference between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05) in terms of gender, age, body mass index, osteoarthritis side, disease duration, and preoperative Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), visual analogue scale (VAS) score, hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and posterior proximal tibial angle (PPTA). The operative time, intraoperative bleeding volume, surgery-related complications, the KSS, WOMAC, and VAS scores before operation and at 6 months after operation, and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) at 6 months after operation were recorded. X-ray films were taken to review the prosthesis position and measure HKA, LDFA, MPTA, and PPTA. The differences of the clinical and imaging indicators between before and after operation were calculated and statistically analyzed.
Results: The operations were completed successfully in both groups. There was no significant difference in the operative time and intraoperative bleeding volume between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). After operation, 1 case of incision nonunion and 1 case of heart failure occurred in the traditional operation group, while no surgery-related complications occurred in the robotic-assisted operation group. The incidences of surgical complications were 7.4% (2/27) in the traditional operation group and 0 (0/27) in the robotic-assisted operation group, with no significant difference ( <i>P</i>=0.491). Patients in both groups were followed up 6 months. KSS score, WOMAC score, VAS score, and ROM significantly improved in both groups at 6 months after operation when compared with preoperative ones ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05) in the differences between the pre- and post-operative values of the clinical indicators and FJS scores at 6 months after operation. X-ray films showed that the lower extremity force lines of the patients improved and the knee prostheses were in good position. Except for LDFA in the robot-assisted operation group, HKA, LDFA, MPTA, and PPTA significantly improved in both groups at 6 months after operation when compared with the preoperative ones ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the differences between the pre- and post-operative values of the radiological indicators ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05).

pub.1060167437,Primary and Revision Total Hip Replacement Using the Robodoc® System,"The ROBODOC system was designed to address potential human errors in performing cementless total hip replacement. The system consists of a preoperative planning computer workstation (called ORTHODOC) and a five-axis robotic arm with a high speed milling device as an end effector. The combined experience of the United States Food and Drug Administration multicenter trial and the German postmarket use of the system are reported. The United States study is controlled and randomized with 136 hip replacements performed at three centers (65 ROBODOC and 62 control). Followup was 1 year on 127 hip replacements and 2 years on 93 hip replacements. No differences were found in the Harris hip scores or the Short Form Health Survey outcomes questionnaire. Length of stay also was not different, but the surgical time and blood loss were greater in the ROBODOC group. This was attributed to a learning curve at each center. Radiographs were evaluated by an independent bone radiologist and showed statistically better fit and positioning of the femoral component in the ROBODOC group. Complications were not different, except for three cases of intraoperative femoral fracture in the control group and none in the ROBODOC group. The German study reports on 858 patients, 42 with bilateral hip replacements and this includes 30 revision cases for a total of 900 hip replacements. The Harris hip score rose from 43.7 to 91.5. In these cases the surgical time declined quickly from 240 minutes for the first case to 90 minutes. No intraoperative femoral fractures occurred in 900 cases. Other complications were comparable with total hip replacements performed using conventional techniques. The ROBODOC system is thought to be safe and effective in producing radiographically superior implant fit and positioning while eliminating femoral fractures."
pub.1128458332,"Are There Differences in Accuracy or Outcomes Scores Among Navigated, Robotic, Patient-specific Instruments or Standard Cutting Guides in TKA? A Network Meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Several kinds of cutting guides, including patient-specific instrumentation, navigation, standard cutting guides, accelerometer-based navigation, and robotic guidance, are available to restore a planned alignment during TKA. No previous study has simultaneously compared all of these devices; a network meta-analysis is an especially appealing method because it allows comparisons across approaches that were not compared head-to-head in individual randomized controlled trials.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We performed a network meta-analysis to determine whether novel approaches to achieving implant alignment, such as patient-specific instrumentation, navigation, accelerometer-based navigation, and robotic guidance, provide any advantage over standard cutting guides in terms of: (1) hip-knee-ankle (HKA) alignment outliers greater than ± 3°, (2) outcome scores (1989 - Knee Society Score and WOMAC score) measured 6 months after surgery, or (3) femoral and tibial implant malalignment (greater than ± 3°), taken separately, in the frontal and sagittal plane, as well as other secondary outcomes including validated outcome scores 1 and 2 years after surgery.
METHODS: In our network meta-analysis, we included randomized controlled trials comparing the different cutting guides by using at least one of the previously specified criteria, without limitation on language or date of publication. We searched electronic databases, major orthopaedic journals, proceedings of major orthopaedic meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until October 1, 2018. This led to the inclusion of 90 randomized controlled trials involving 9389 patients (mean age 68.8 years) with 10,336 TKAs. Two reviewers independently selected trials and extracted data. The primary outcomes were the proportion patients with malalignment of the HKA angle (defined as HKA > 3° from neutral) and the Knee Society Score and WOMAC scores at 6 months postoperatively. We combined direct and indirect comparisons using a Bayesian network meta-analysis framework to assess and compare the effect of different cutting guides on outcomes. Bayesian estimates are based on the posterior distribution of an endpoint and are called credible intervals. Usually the 95% credible interval, corresponding to a posterior probability of 0.95 that the endpoint lies in the interval, is computed. Unlike the frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach does not allow the calculation of the p value.
RESULTS: The proportion of HKA outliers was lower with navigation than with patient-specific instrumentation (risk ratio 0.46 [95% credible interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.63]) and standard cutting guides (risk ratio 0.45 [95% CI 0.37 to 0.53]); however, this corresponded to an actual difference of only 12% of patients for navigation versus 21% of patients for patient-specific instrumentation, and 12% of patients for navigation versus 25% for standard cutting guides.

pub.1057422518,Nervenläsionen bei der Hüft-TEP-Implantation - Strategien zur Lähmungsprophylaxe,"AIM: Nerve lesions are a serious complication of total hip arthroplasty. The incidence of lesions of large nerves exceeds those of luxation and septic loosening. An analysis of damage causes should lead to prophylactic strategies and improvement of operative technique. Patients are more aware of this complication and malpractice cases are increasing. Between 1977 and 2001 the medical association of North Rhine dealt with 126 cases of nerve lesions.
METHOD: All potential intraoperative causes for nerve damage are investigated.
RESULTS: Incorrectly placed Hohmann retractors offer the largest damage potential. Electro surgery and self-cutting screws have a hazardous potential. Sharp injuries, retractor damage and leg lengthening are infrequent causes for nerve lesions. Positioning devices such as leg holders used for robotic hip surgery might damage the peroneal nerve.
CONCLUSION: Risk management is necessary for medico-legal quality control and gives protection for patient and surgeon. Risk management may prevent damage in advance. The head of the department is in charge of internal quality control. Systematic evaluations of operative techniques and damage possibilities are necessary to avoid future malpractice. Guidelines give a good support, but cannot replace teaching on the patient. Operation reports offer the surgeon the chance to document cautious and nerve protecting techniques."
pub.1176043035,"Association of Technology Usage and Decreased Revision TKA Rates for Low-Volume Surgeons Using an Optimal Prosthesis Combination: An Analysis of 53,264 Primary TKAs.","BACKGROUND: Technology (navigation and robotics) usage during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is often supported by literature involving high-volume surgeons and hospitals, but the value of technology for lower-volume surgeons is uncertain. This study aimed to determine if there was a relationship among surgeon volume, technology usage, and revision rate when using an optimal prosthesis combination (OPC).
METHODS: Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) data were obtained from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2022, for all primary TKA procedures performed for osteoarthritis using an OPC by a known surgeon ≥5 years after their first recorded procedure. The interaction between surgeon volume and conventional-instrumentation (CV) versus technology-assisted (TA) TKA was assessed. The cumulative percent revision (CPR) was determined by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cox proportional-hazards methods were used to compare rates of revision by surgeon volume and by the interaction of volume and technology. Subanalyses were undertaken to examine major and minor revisions separately, and to assess the influence of technology on revision rates relative to those of a surgeon undertaking 100 TKA/year.
RESULTS: Of the 53,264 procedures that met the inclusion criteria, 31,536 were TA-TKA and 21,728 were CV-TKA. Use of technology reduced the all-cause revision rate for surgeons with a volume of <50 TKA/year and the rate of minor revisions for surgeons with a volume of <40 TKA/year. No interaction between surgeon volume and the rate of major revision surgery was found. With CV-TKA by a surgeon with a 100-TKA/year volume as the comparator, all-cause and major revision rates were significantly elevated for surgeons undertaking <50 and <100 TKA/year, respectively. In contrast, analysis of TA-TKA showed no difference in rates of all-cause or major revisions for surgeons undertaking <100 TKA/year compared with 100 TKA/year.
CONCLUSIONS: TA-TKA was associated with a decrease in the revision rate for lower-volume surgeons but no significant alterations in revision rate for higher-volume surgeons. Preferential use of TA-TKA by lower-volume surgeons should be considered.

pub.1163154277,"NAVIO RATKA shows similar rates of hemoglobin‐drop, adverse events, readmission and early revision vs conventional TKA: a single centre retrospective cohort study","PURPOSE: Despite widespread adoption of NAVIO robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (NAVIO RATKA) in clinical practice, clinical outcome in terms of adverse events and complications remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare adverse events, length of stay, surgical time, hemoglobin drop, early readmission rate and revision rate between conventional TKA (CTKA) and NAVIO RATKA.
METHODS: This single-centre retrospective cohort analysis compared 230 NAVIO RATKA patients to 489 CTKA patients with a minimal follow-up of 12 months. Baseline demographic and comorbidity parameters were collected, as well as length of stay, revision rate and reason for revision, early readmission rate (< 6w) and reason for readmission, post-operative hemoglobin levels, adverse events, surgical time and operating room time. Data were compared using Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data without normal distribution and ordinal data, categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square or Fisher exact test.
RESULTS: There were no clinically relevant baseline demographic or comorbidity differences between groups. CTKA had shorter length of stay than NAVIO RATKA (5.0 days vs 5.4 days, p = 0.010) but trended towards a higher reoperation rate (4.1% vs 1.7%, p = .144, n.s). No differences were found in hemoglobin drop, readmission rate or overall incidence of adverse events, but CTKA showed more hematoma formation (1.6% vs 0%, p = .044) and higher incidence of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) (1% vs 0%, p = n.s.), whilst NAVIO RATKA showed more periprosthetic fractures and persistent wound drainage (0.4% vs 2.2%, p = .038 and 0.6% vs 4.3%, p = .001, respectively). Surgical time remained significantly longer in NAVIO RATKA during all 230 cases (87 min vs 67.6 min) and showed a continuous downward trend.
CONCLUSIONS: This study further validates the usage of NAVIO RATKA as a safe method to perform TKA, with comparable short term outcomes to CTKA in terms of early revisions and adverse events. Surgeons should be mindful of the differing adverse event profile in NAVIO RATKA and adjust their patient selection accordingly to ensure optimal outcomes. In addition, surgeons using NAVIO RATKA should expect a linear learning curve and a surgical time exceeding that of CTKA.

pub.1139830996,Equal bony resection of distal and posterior femur will lead to flexion/extension gap inequality in robot‐assisted cruciate‐retaining TKA,"PURPOSE: Joint imbalance has become one of the main reasons for early revision after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and it is directly related to the surgical technique. Therefore, a better understanding of how much bone has to be removed to obtain a balanced flexion/extension gap could improve current practice. The primary objective of this study was to analyse the amount of bone that needed to be removed from the distal and posterior femoral joint surfaces to obtain an equal flexion/extension gap in robot-assisted TKA. The second objective of this study was to evaluate whether the size of the knee joint influenced the amount of bony resection needed to achieve an equal flexion/extension gap in robot-assisted TKA.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients receiving a robot-assisted TKA (Cruciate Retaining (n = 268)) by six surgeons from April 2018 to September 2019. The robot was used consecutively when available in all patients receiving Cruciate Retaining TKA. Gap assessment, bony resections, femoral implant size and hip-knee-ankle angle were evaluated with the robot. Femoral implant size was categorized into small (size 1-2), medium (size 3-5) and large (size 6-8).
RESULTS: The difference between the posterior and distal resection needed to obtain equal flexion and extension gap was on average 2.0 mm (SD 1.6) and 1.5 mm (SD 2.2) for the medial and lateral compartment, respectively. The discrepancy was smaller in the large implant group compared to the small implant group (p < .05 medial and lateral) and medium implant group (p < .05 medial). Varus knees required a larger differential resection compared to neutral and valgus knees (only laterally) (medial compartment: p < .05 (varus-neutral), p = .051 (varus-valgus); lateral compartment: p < .05 (varus-neutral and varus-valgus).
CONCLUSION: Removing an equal amount of bone from the distal and posterior femur will lead to flexion/extension gap imbalance in TKA. It was required to remove 1.5-2 mm more bone from the posterior femur compared to the distal femur to equalize flexion and extension gap. This effect was size dependent: in larger knees, the discrepancy between the distal and posterior resections was smaller.

pub.1105566755,Influence of the moving fluoroscope on gait patterns,"Video-fluoroscopic analysis can provide important insights for the evaluation of outcome and functionality after total knee arthroplasty, allowing the in vivo assessment of tibiofemoral kinematics without soft tissue artefacts. To enable measurement of the knee throughout activities of daily living such as gait, robotic systems like the moving fluoroscope have been developed that follow the knee movement and maintain the joint in front of the image intensifier. Since it is unclear whether walking while being accompanied by moving fluoroscope affects normal gait, the objective of this study was to investigate its influence on gait characteristics in healthy subjects. In addition, the impact of the motors' noise was analysed. By means of skin markers analysis (VICON MX system, Oxford Metrics Group, UK) and simultaneous measurement of ground reaction forces (Kistler force plates, Kistler, Switzerland), gait characteristics when walking with and without the moving fluoroscope as well as with and without ear protectors in combination with the moving fluoroscope, were obtained in young (n = 10, 24.5y ± 3.0y) and elderly (n = 9, 61.6y ± 5.3y) subjects during level gait and stair descent. Walking with the moving fluoroscope significantly decreased gait velocity in level gait and stair descent over the respective movement without the fluoroscope. Statistical analysis, including gait velocity as a covariate, resulted in no differences on the ground reaction force parameters. However, some kinematic parameters (ankle, knee and hip ranges of motion, minimal knee angle in late stance phase, maximal knee angles in stance and swing phase) seemed to be modified by the presence of the moving fluoroscope, but statistical comparison was limited due to velocity differences between the conditions. Wearing ear protectors to avoid the influence of motor sound during walking with the moving fluoroscope caused no significant difference. Walking with the moving fluoroscope has been shown to decrease gait velocity and small alterations in kinematic parameters were observed. Therefore, gait and movement alterations due to the moving fluoroscope cannot completely be excluded. However, based on the absence of differences in ground reaction force parameters (when adjusted for velocity within ANCOVA), as well as based on the comparable shape of the angular curves to the slow control condition, it can be concluded that changes in gait when walking with the moving fluoroscope are small, especially in comparison to natural slow walking. In order to allow assessment of joint replacement with the moving fluoroscope, including an understanding of the effects of joint pain, clinical analyses can only be compared to gait activities showing similarly reduced velocities. Importantly, the reduced gait speeds observed in this study are similar to those observed after total knee arthroplasty, suggesting that analyses in such subjects are appropriate. However, the moving fluoroscope would li"
pub.1121623575,Effect of surgical parameters on the biomechanical behaviour of bicondylar total knee endoprostheses – A robot-assisted test method based on a musculoskeletal model,"The complicated interplay of total knee replacement (TKR) positioning and patient-specific soft tissue conditions still causes a considerable number of unsatisfactory outcomes. Therefore, we deployed a robot-assisted test method, in which a six-axis robot moved and loaded a bicondylar cruciate-retaining (CR)-TKR in a virtual lower extremity emulated by a musculoskeletal multibody model. This enabled us to systematically analyse the impact of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), tibial slope, and tibial component rotation on TKR function while considering the physical implant components and physiological-like conditions during dynamic motions. The PCL resection yielded a decrease of femoral rollback by 4.5 mm and a reduction of tibiofemoral contact force by 50 N. A reduced tibial slope led to an increase of tibiofemoral contact force by about 170 N and a decrease of femoral rollback up to 1.7 mm. Although a higher tibial slope reduced the contact force, excessive tibial slopes should be avoided to prevent joint instability. Contrary to an external rotation of the tibial component, an internal rotation clearly increased the contact force and lateral femoral rollback. Our data contribute to improved understanding the biomechanics of TKRs and show the capabilities of the robot-assisted test method based on a musculoskeletal multibody model as a preoperative planning tool."
pub.1060167461,Image Guided Navigation System to Measure Intraoperatively Acetabular Implant Alignment,"There has been little clinical research to examine the effects of patient positioning and pelvic motion on the alignment of the acetabular implant during total hip replacement surgery. Until now, no tools were capable of accurately measuring these variables during the actual procedure. As part of a broader program in medical robotics and computer assisted surgery, a clinical system has been developed that includes several enabling technologies. The hip navigation system (HipNav) continuously and precisely measures pelvic location and tracks relative implant alignment intraoperatively. HipNav technology is used to gauge current clinical practice and provide intraoperative feedback to surgeons with the goal of improving the precision and accuracy of acetabular alignment during total hip replacement. This system provides surgeons with a new class of image guided measurement tools and assist devices. These tools successfully were introduced into the clinical practice of surgery with results showing the following: (1) There exist unpredictable and large variations in the initial position of patients' pelves on the operating room table and significant pelvic movement during surgery and during intraoperative range of motion testing; (2) current mechanical acetabular alignment guides do not account for these variations, and result in variable and in the majority of cases unacceptable acetabular alignment; and (3) press fitting oversized acetabular components influences the final cup orientation."
pub.1127132248,Assessing the biofidelity of in vitro biomechanical testing of the human cervical spine,"In vitro biomechanical studies of the osteoligamentous spine are widely used to characterize normal biomechanics, identify injury mechanisms, and assess the effects of degeneration and surgical instrumentation on spine mechanics. The objective of this study was to determine how well four standards in vitro loading paradigms replicate in vivo kinematics with regards to the instantaneous center of rotation and arthrokinematics in relation to disc deformation. In vivo data were previously collected from 20 asymptomatic participants (45.5 ± 5.8 years) who performed full range of motion neck flexion-extension (FE) within a biplane x-ray system. Intervertebral kinematics were determined with sub-millimeter precision using a validated model-based tracking process. Ten cadaveric spines (51.8 ± 7.3 years) were tested in FE within a robotic testing system. Each specimen was tested under four loading conditions: pure moment, axial loading, follower loading, and combined loading. The in vivo and in vitro bone motion data were directly compared. The average in vitro instant center of rotation was significantly more anterior in all four loading paradigms for all levels. In general, the anterior and posterior disc heights were larger in the in vitro models than in vivo. However, after adjusting for gender, the observed differences in disc height were not statistically significant. This data suggests that in vitro biomechanical testing alone may fail to replicate in vivo conditions, with significant implications for novel motion preservation devices such as cervical disc arthroplasty implants."
pub.1057401124,ROBODOC - Ein Weg in die Zukunft der Hüftendoprothetik oder eine Fehlinvestition?,"GOAL: The Orthopaedic Department of Martin-Luther-University has been using computer-guided, robot-assisted surgery in cementless total hip arthroplasty since June 1997. The goal of the present paper is to critically evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the ROBODOC system when using two different femoral components and the employment of the system in orthopaedics in general.
METHOD: Between June 1997 and August 1999 87 procedures have been performed using the ROBODOC system. 48 ABG stems and 39 OSTEOLOC stems manufactured by HOWMEDICA were used. The results are based on a prospective study.
RESULTS: The main advantage of the system is the excellent three-dimensional preoperative planning and the precise execution of the preoperative plan during surgery. Problematic situations of the proximal femur can be evaluated and the optimal position of the femoral component can be guaranteed. Investigations on cadaver femurs showed significant differences in the bone-implant contact. The first results let us expect some advantage in congenital and acquired femoral deformities.
CONCLUSION: The ROBODOC system has to be critically considered as an alternative to hand implantation. In our opinion, it should be used only under certain circumstances considering the current technical progress. Only in these cases the potential of the system can be used beneficially."
pub.1125610053,"Comparison of 1-year outcomes between MAKO versus NAVIO robot-assisted medial UKA: nonrandomized, prospective, comparative study","BackgroundWe have conducted a prospective cohort study with the aim of comparing operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and radiologic and clinical outcomes between imageless (NAVIO) and image-based (MAKO) robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.MethodsA total of 33 patients with medial compartment OA of the knee were prospectively allocated on alternate operative days of their surgery to MAKO (16 patients) or NAVIO (17 patients) robot-assisted UKA. The primary outcome (Knee Society Score [KSS] and Knee Functional Score [KFS]) and the secondary outcomes (intraoperative time of seven steps [registration of hip and ankle, femur and tibia, ligament tension, implant planning, preparation femur, tibia and trial implant], component alignment [coronal and sagittal of femur, tibia implant], blood loss, complications, and revision at 1 year after surgery) were compared between two groups. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.ResultsMean KSS measured at baseline and 1 year were, respectively, 70.3 (5.6) and 96.9 (5.7) in the NAVIO group and 72.3 (4.5) and 94.7 (10.01) in the MAKO group. Mean KFS measured at baseline and 1 year were, respectively, 95.5 (7.9) and 99.9 (0.25) in the NAVIO group and 67.3 (7.8) and 99.5 (1.2) in the MAKO group. There were no significant differences for KFS and KSS outcomes (P = 0.203 and P = 0.457, respectively) between the NAVIO and MAKO groups. Mean operative time and blood loss in the NAVIO versus MAKO robot-assisted UKA groups were 98 min versus 82.5 min and 136.3 ml versus 80 ml, respectively, and these differences were statistically significant. In the MAKO group, the intraoperative time was statistically significantly shorter in registration of hip and ankle center, femur and tibia, femur preparation, and trial implantation compared with the NAVIO group. There were no significant differences of component alignment and radiologic alignment at 1 year between the two groups. No perioperative or delayed complications (infection, periprosthetic fracture, thromboembolism, and compromised wound healing) and revisions were reported in either group.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that two robotic systems showed no difference in clinical outcomes at 1 year and radiologic alignment of implants, whereas operative time and intraoperative blood loss were found to be less in MAKO robot-assisted UKA.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03954912.

pub.1004234522,Use of the spider limb positioner in oncologic lower extremity surgery,"Orthopedic extremity surgery presents a unique set of restraints and difficulties relative to other surgical specialties. Among these is the positioning of heavy limbs in sometimes awkward positions for long periods of time. Ideal positioning of an extremity allows accurate and precise surgery to occur at otherwise difficult to access joints and proximal bones and soft tissues. Numerous solutions to this problem have been proposed, one such solution is the Smith and Nephew Spider Limb Positioning System. The table-mounted pneumatic arm features three fully articulating joints and a simple repositioning mechanism. Classic uses of the Spider Limb Positioner System include shoulder and elbow surgery, total knee replacement and ankle procedures. In our institution, the Spider Limb Positioner is used primarily for shoulder arthroscopy and total shoulder arthroplasty. In addition, we have had success using the system for orthopedic oncology cases. This manuscript addresses the conventional as well as unconventional uses implemented at our institution. Limb positioning in orthopedics provides a unique challenge for prepping, draping and surgery. The use of positioning aids can improve exposure, decrease contamination and reduce the risk of surgeon strain. Our institution has developed a solution to positioning of heavy lower limbs for hip disarticulation via the Smith and Nephew 'Spider'. This pneumatic, full articulating device used primarily for shoulder surgery can be modified to allow lower extremity use in the setting of hip disarticulation. This paper describes the standard and novel use of this device. "
pub.1039516278,An implant-free double-bundle reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: Operative technique and influence on tibiofemoral kinematics,"BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is a standard surgical procedure in sports traumatology. The widespread replacement method using hamstring tendons has an important shortcoming namely delayed or missing bony healing in contrast to patellar tendon grafts where implant-free fixation is established by using the adjacent bone blocks. The purpose of this study was to describe a new implant-free surgical procedure using hamstring tendon grafts and to analyse the influence on tibiofemoral kinematics in vitro.
METHODS: Nine human knee specimens with arthroscopically transected anterior cruciate ligaments were mounted on a dynamic knee simulator and weight-bearing muscle-loaded knee flexions were simulated while a robotic universal force sensor system was used to provide external tibial loads. Three different loading conditions were simulated including partial body weight only, an additional 50 N anterior tibial force or an additional Five Nm of internal rotational torque. After reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using a tibial bone block hybrid technique these three trials were repeated. The kinematics was measured with an ultrasonic measuring system and different loading and ligament conditions were examined. Graft tunnel placement was verified by computed tomography.
FINDINGS: Our fixation method achieved stability to anterior tibial drawer force whereas internal tibial rotation did not change before and after the reconstruction. Computed tomography confirmed anatomical graft and tunnel placement.
INTERPRETATION: The presented operative procedure is technically feasible and leads to reproducible results concerning knee joint kinematics and graft placement."
pub.1078680803,Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement?,"PURPOSE: There are a number of factors responsible for the longevity of unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR). These include the magnitude of postoperative alignment and the type of material used. The effect of component design and material on postoperative alignment, however, has not been explored.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent UKR with robotic guidance. Patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups.
RESULTS: Mean postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the Onlay group (mean=2.8°; 95% CI=2.4°, 3.2°) compared to the Inlay group (mean=3.9°; 95% CI=3.4°, 4.4°) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01).
CONCLUSION: Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial UKR."
pub.1061696588,Mobile Biplane X-Ray Imaging System for Measuring 3D Dynamic Joint Motion During Overground Gait,"Most X-ray fluoroscopy systems are stationary and impose restrictions on the measurement of dynamic joint motion; for example, knee-joint kinematics during gait is usually measured with the subject ambulating on a treadmill. We developed a computer-controlled, mobile, biplane, X-ray fluoroscopy system to track human body movement for high-speed imaging of 3D joint motion during overground gait. A robotic gantry mechanism translates the two X-ray units alongside the subject, tracking and imaging the joint of interest as the subject moves. The main aim of the present study was to determine the accuracy with which the mobile imaging system measures 3D knee-joint kinematics during walking. In vitro experiments were performed to measure the relative positions of the tibia and femur in an intact human cadaver knee and of the tibial and femoral components of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implant during simulated overground gait. Accuracy was determined by calculating mean, standard deviation and root-mean-squared errors from differences between kinematic measurements obtained using volumetric models of the bones and TKA components and reference measurements obtained from metal beads embedded in the bones. Measurement accuracy was enhanced by the ability to track and image the joint concurrently. Maximum root-mean-squared errors were 0.33 mm and 0.65° for translations and rotations of the TKA knee and 0.78 mm and 0.77° for translations and rotations of the intact knee, which are comparable to results reported for treadmill walking using stationary biplane systems. System capability for in vivo joint motion measurement was also demonstrated for overground gait."
pub.1032612738,Computer-integrated revision total hip replacement surgery: concept and preliminary results,"This paper describes an ongoing project to develop a computer-integrated system to assist surgeons in revision total hip replacement (RTHR) surgery. In RTHR surgery, a failing orthopedic hip implant, typically cemented, is replaced with a new one by removing the old implant, removing the cement and fitting a new implant into an enlarged canal broached in the femur. RTHR surgery is a difficult procedure fraught with technical challenges and a high incidence of complications. The goals of the computer-based system are the significant reduction of cement removal labor and time, the elimination of cortical wall penetration and femur fracture, the improved positioning and fit of the new implant resulting from precise, high-quality canal milling and the reduction of bone sacrificed to fit the new implant. Our starting points are the ROBODOC system for primary hip replacement surgery and the manual RTHR surgical protocol. We first discuss the main difficulties of computer-integrated RTHR surgery and identify key issues and possible solutions. We then describe possible system architectures and protocols for preoperative planning and intraoperative execution. We present a summary of methods and preliminary results in CT image metal artifact removal, interactive cement cut-volume definition and cement machining, anatomy-based registration using fluoroscopic X-ray images and clinical trials using an extended RTHR version of ROBODOC. We conclude with a summary of lessons learned and a discussion of current and future work."
pub.1001646486,Providing visual information to validate 2-D to 3-D registration,"This paper addresses a key issue of providing clinicians with visual information to validate the accuracy of 2-D/3-D registration for robot-assisted total hip replacement (THR) surgery. Although numerous registration approaches have been presented, the topic of registration validation has scarcely been addressed in the literature. In practice, clinicians rely on post-operative X-rays to assess the accuracy of implant placement. Motivated by this, we simulate a set of post-operative X-ray images by superimposing the implant positioned pre-operatively onto the intra-operatively collected and calibrated images of the femur, through a transformation computed by the 2-D/3-D registration. With these images, a judgment on the registration accuracy can be made. In addition, this paper introduces methods for superimposing pre-operative data on intra-operative X-ray images that were not corrected for distortion, by applying the same image distortion to the data. This paper also introduces a new framework for incorporating surface normals in the objective function for registration. A comparison between marker-based and image-based registration is conducted. The advantage of our approach is that the simulated post-operative X-ray images are very familiar to clinicians and, therefore, easy for them to interpret. As an added benefit, this technique provides new means for comparing the marker-based and image-based registration for robot-assisted THR surgery. This approach can be extended to other interventions where intra-operative images are used for registration."
pub.1083862733,Dynamical analysis of dislocation‐associated factors in total hip replacements by hardware‐in‐the‐loop simulation,"Since dislocation of total hip replacements (THR) remains a clinical problem, its mechanisms are still in the focus of research. Previous studies ignored the impact of soft tissue structures and dynamic processes or relied on simplified joint contact mechanics, thus, hindered a thorough understanding. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to use hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation to analyze systematically the impact of varying implant positions and designs as well as gluteal and posterior muscle function on THR instability under physiological-like loading conditions during dynamic movements. A musculoskeletal multibody model emulated the in situ environment of the lower extremity during deep sit-to-stand with femoral adduction maneuver while a six-axis robot moved and loaded a THR accordingly to feed physical measurements back to the multibody model. Commercial THRs with hard-soft bearings were used in the simulation with three different head diameters (28, 36, 44 mm) and two offsets (M, XL). Cup inclination of 45°, cup anteversion of 20°, and stem anteversion of 10° revealed to be outstandingly robust against any instability-related parameter variation. For the flexion motion, higher combined anteversion angles of cup and stem seemed generally favorable. Total hip instability was either deferred or even avoided even in the presence of higher cup inclination. Larger head diameters (>36 mm) and femoral head offsets (8 mm) deferred occurrence of prosthetic and bone impingement associated with increasing resisting torques. In summary, implant positioning had a much higher impact on total hip stability than gluteal insufficiency and impaired muscle function. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

pub.1164189934,Polyethylene Luxation in an Oxinium Fixed-bearing Unicompartmental Knee Replacement Leading to Metallosis: A Case Reports for an Early and a Late Presentation,"Introduction: Polyethylene (PE) subluxation is a rare complication after fixed-bearing unicompartmental knee replacement. We present two cases of PE luxation with a rapid onset of metallosis in a unicompartmental knee replacement made of Oxinium, one early presentation 3 months after surgery and the other case 6 years after.
Case Report: Case 1: A 84-year-old male underwent a fixed-bearing medial unicompartmental knee replacement in his left knee. Standard surgery was carried out with robotic assistance. Three months after surgery, he felt acute pain in the anterior portion of his knee. Radiographs showed that the PE was luxated anteriorly and a radiopaque ""cloud"" that blurs the vision of the implants suggesting metallosis. In the revision surgery, abundant blackish liquid and metallic-like debris were deposited in the synovial tissue and capsule around the knee. The tibial and femoral components presented extensive wear areas, suggesting extensive metal-to-metal contact. Both components were removed, and a posterior stabilized total knee prosthesis was placed. Case 2: A 50-year-old male patient underwent a fixed-bearing medial unicompartmental knee replacement. After 6 years, he complained of insidious pain in the posteromedial side of his knee. During the physical examination, significant joint effusion, a loss of extension, and a limited flexion were observed, with flexion reaching only up to 80°. The patient did not report systemic symptoms associated with metallosis, and no signs of systemic involvement were found. Radiographs show similar findings than in case 1, but the radiopaque ""cloud"" was limited to the knee. In the revision surgery, both components were removed. The tibial and femur components had extensive wear, especially in the posterior-central portion. A posterior stabilized total knee prosthesis was used.
Conclusion: Emphasis on careful engagement between the PE and the tibial component is a must, checking that no tissue or cement gets in the way of the anchoring system. Furthermore, prosthesis designs must look for models with a more friendly, engaging system to prevent early presentation. The radiographs assessing the height of the PE - especially in the posterior area - must be carried out. In the case of metallosis and PE luxation, we suggest performing a revision surgery with total knee arthroplasty; however, there is little evidence for a strong recommendation."
pub.1166193617,High Prevalence of Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders and Limited Evidence-based Ergonomics in Orthopaedic Surgery: A Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control defines work-related musculoskeletal disorders as disorders of the nerves, muscles, tendons, joints, spinal discs, and cartilage that are caused or exacerbated by the environment or nature of work. Previous meta-analyses have characterized work-related musculoskeletal disorders among interventionists, general surgeons, and other surgical subspecialties, but prevalence estimates, prognosis, and ergonomic considerations vary by study and surgical specialty.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the career prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in orthopaedic surgeons? (2) What is the treatment prevalence associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders in orthopaedic surgeons? (3) What is the disability burden of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in orthopaedic surgeons? (4) What is the scope of orthopaedic surgical ergonomic assessments and interventions?
METHODS: A systematic review of English-language studies from PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus was performed in December 2022 and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies that presented prevalence estimates of work-related musculoskeletal disorders or assessed surgical ergonomics in orthopaedic surgery were included. Reviews, case reports, gray literature (conference abstracts and preprints), and studies with mixed-surgeon (nonorthopaedic) populations were excluded. The search yielded 5603 abstracts; 24 survey-based studies with 4876 orthopaedic surgeons (mean age 48 years; 79% of surgeons were men) were included for an analysis of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, and 18 articles were included for a descriptive synthesis of ergonomic assessment. Quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute Tool revealed that studies had a low to moderate risk of bias, largely because of self-reporting survey-based methodology. Because of considerable heterogeneity and risk of bias, prevalence outcomes were not pooled and instead are presented as ranges (mean I 2 = 91.3%).
RESULTS: The career prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in orthopaedic surgeons ranged from 37% to 97%. By anatomic location, the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in the head and neck ranged from 4% to 74%; back ranged from 9% to 77%; forearm, wrist, and hand ranged from 12% to 54%; elbow ranged from 3% to 28%; shoulder ranged from 3% to 34%; hip and thigh ranged from 1% to 10%; knee and lower leg ranged from 1% to 31%; and foot and ankle ranged from 4% to 25%. Of orthopaedic surgeons reporting work-related musculoskeletal disorders, 9% to 33% had a leave of absence, practice restriction or modification, or early retirement, and 27% to 83% received some form of treatment. Orthopaedic surgeons experienced biomechanical, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and metabolic stress during procedures. Interventions to improve orthopaedic surgical ergonomics have bee"

pub.1155711768,[Early clinical application of Mako robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty in knee osteoarthritis].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the early efficacy of Mako robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and summarize the initial application experience.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 73 patients with KOA treated with Mako robot-assisted TKA from June 2021 to December 2021. There were 16 males and 57 females, aged from 54 to 81 years old with an average of (67.8±6.6) years old. The hip knee and ankle angle (HKA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), lateral femoral component angle (LFCA) and lateral tibial component angle (LTCA) were recorded and analyzed. WOMAC score and KSS were used to compare the functional recovery of patients preoperatively, 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: All the 73 patients were successfully treated without serious complications such as vascular and nerve injury, and all the incisions healed well at stageⅠwithout infection. The patients were followed up from 4 to 11 months with an average of (7.0±2.7) months, and the satisfaction rate of the last follow-up was 90.41% (66/73). WOMAC scores were (23.1±5.4) at 3 months and (14.8±4.1) at 6 months postoperatively. KSS clinical scores were ( 76.1±4.0) at 3 months and (82.1±3.7) at 6 months postoperatively;KSS functional scores were (74.3±3.1) at 3 months and (78.6±2.1) at 6 months after operation. Postoperative imaging showed good position of the prosthesis, HKA angle was (178.5±2.1)°, LDFA was (91.2±1.8)°, MPTA was(89.9±1.5) °, LFCA was (7.6±3.1)°, LTCA was (88.2±1.1)°. The mechanical axis within ±3° in sixty cases(82.2%), and the mechanical axis within ±6° in all the patients.
CONCLUSION: Mako robot-assisted TKA is a safe and effective surgery in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, which exhibited good efficacy in the correction of lower limb alignment, soft tissue balance and improvement of knee function. The long-term efficacy needs further follow-up observation."
pub.1043431367,Computerassistenzsysteme in der Knieendoprothetik,"BackgroundThe primary goal of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) in total knee arthroplasty is to increase the accuracy in terms of prosthesis positioning. In theory, this would lead to longer implant survival and a reduction of malpositioning. Thus, a better clinical outcome and lower revision rates would be expected. However, the necessary technical equipment represents significant additional effort and cost factors which are not included in the current diagnosis-related groups (DRG) system.ObjectiveThe objective of this article is a critical review of the current literature to examine whether these costs are reasonable by taking the additional benefits of the technology into account.MethodsThis review is based on a selective PubMed search on CAS and navigation in primary total knee arthroplasty.ResultsThe current evidence base on CAS suggests that at least the primary outcome parameter, the improvement of the radiological alignment, is achieved by the technique. However, the claimed secondary effects are not yet proven. In particular, an improvement of clinical outcome and patient satisfaction has not been demonstrated so far. Furthermore, there is some evidence of increased complication rates by the use of CAS.ConclusionAgainst this background and with respect to further cost-benefit analyses, the technology has to be reviewed critically. In particular, low-volume units do not seem to benefit from the use of CAS. However, the assessment of long-term effects is still pending."

The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between position of the humeral head and function of the shoulder prosthesis (muscle efficiency). Shoulder elevation-motion and rotator cuff defects were simulated in vitro in a robot-assisted shoulder simulator. The EPOCA Custom Offset shoulder prosthesis (Argomedical AG, Cham, CH) was implanted in seven normal shoulders (77 +/- 20 kg, 55 +/- 14 years). Active elevation was simulated by hydraulic cylinders, and scapulothoratic motion by a specially programmed industrial robot. Muscle efficiency (elevation-angle/muscle-force of the deltoid muscle) was measured in anatomic (ANA), medialised (MED) and lateralised (LAT) positions of the humeral head, with or without rotator cuff muscle deficiency. Medialisation increased efficiency by 0.03 +/- 0.04 deg/N (p = 0.022), lateralisation decreased it by 0.04 +/- 0.06 deg/N (p = 0.009). Supraspinatus muscle deficiency increased the deltoid force required to elevate the arm, and thus decreased efficiency (ANA p = 0.091, MED p = 0.018, LAT p = 0.028). The data confirm that the position of the humeral head affects the mechanics of total shoulder arthroplasty. Medialisation increases efficiency of the deltoid muscle and may prove useful in compensating isolated supraspinatus muscle deficiency. Lateralisation, in contrast, leads to an unfavorable situation."
pub.1074501302,Computer-assisted surgery for hip endoprosthesis.,"The use of computer-controlled robots for implanting cement-free prostheses requires exact preoperative planning on a three-dimensional graphics computer (ORTHODOC). For the first time ever, it has been possible to implement the three-dimensional plan using a computer-controlled robot working on patients. We assume that the considerably improved bone contact provided by the high-precision reaming process--an thus high primary stability--will lead to better incorporation in the bone. In experiments on dogs, in which cement-free hips had been implanted using computer-assisted robots, the animals showed much earlier and more uniform weight-bearing on the affected extremity than animals in a control group that had received conventional implants. In histological therms, the precise fit obtained by the ROBOCOC was accompanied by primary angiogenic healing patterns that all demonstrated labels during the first four weeks. The manually reamed comparators showed more pronounced fissure and defect healing, the healing patterns was irregular, and turnover activity was demonstrate."

METHODS: Electronic bibliographic databases, the reference lists of relevant articles and various health services research-related resources were analysed and selected studies were assessed using defined quality criteria.
RESULTS: 57 publications and three HTA-reports were assessed. Only two prospective randomised controlled studies could be identified. There was no proof of clinical benefit but rather an increased incidence of complications.
CONCLUSION: Patients must be informed on the risks, complications, benefits and especially alternatives to a robot-assisted operation. The importance of HTA reports to evaluate new or established procedures will even increase in Germany especially in the recent medico-legal context."
pub.1127669625,Does Coronal Plane Malalignment of the Tibial Insert in Total Ankle Arthroplasty Alter Distal Foot Bone Mechanics? A Cadaveric Gait Study.,"BACKGROUND: Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is becoming a more prevalent treatment for end-stage ankle arthritis. However, the effects of malalignment on TAA remain poorly understood.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to quantify the mechanical effects of coronal plane malalignment of the tibial insert in TAA using cadaveric gait simulation. Specifically, we asked, is there a change in (1) ankle joint congruency, (2) kinematic joint position, (3) kinematic ROM, (4) peak plantar pressure, and (5) center of pressure with varus and valgus malalignment?
METHODS: A modified TAA was implanted into seven cadaveric foot specimens. Wedges were used to simulate coronal plane malalignment of the tibial insert. The degree of malalignment (tibial insert angle [TIA] and talar component angle [TCA]) was quantified radiographically for neutral and 5°, 10°, and 15° varus and valgus wedges. Dynamic walking at 1/6 of physiological speed was simulated using a robotic gait simulator. A motion capture system was used to measure foot kinematics, and a pressure mat was used to measure plantar pressure. Joint congruency was quantified as the difference between TIA and TCA. Continuous joint position, joint ROM, peak plantar pressure, and center of pressure for varus and valgus malalignment compared with neutral alignment were estimated using linear mixed effects regression. Pairwise comparisons between malalignment conditions and neutral were considered significant if both the omnibus test for the overall association between outcome and malalignment and the individual pairwise comparison (adjusted for multiple comparisons within a given outcome) had p ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS: Descriptively, the TIA and TCA were both less pronounced than the wedge angle and component incongruence was seen (R = 0.65; p < 0.001). Varus malalignment of the tibial insert shifted the tibiotalar joint into varus and internally rotated the joint. The tibiotalar joint's ROM slightly increased as the TIA shifted into varus (1.3 ± 0.7° [mean ± SD] [95% confidence interval -0.7 to 3.4]; p = 0.03), and the first metatarsophalangeal joint's ROM decreased as the TIA shifted into varus (-1.9 ± 0.9° [95% CI -5.6 to 1.7]; p = 0.007). In the sagittal plane, the naviculocuneiform joint's ROM slightly decreased as the TIA shifted into varus (-0.9 ± 0.4° [95% CI -2.1 to 0.3]; p = 0.017). Hallux pressure increased as the TIA became more valgus (59 ± 50 kPa [95% CI -88 to 207]; p = 0.006). The peak plantar pressure slightly decreased in the third and fourth metatarsals as the TIA shifted into valgus (-15 ± 17° [95% CI -65 to 37]; p = 0.03 and -8 ± 4° [95% CI -17 to 1]; p = 0.048, respectively). The fifth metatarsal's pressure slightly decreased as the TIA shifted into valgus (-18 ± 12 kPa [95% CI -51 to 15]) or varus (-7 ± 18 kPa [95% CI -58 to 45]; p = 0.002). All comparisons were made to the neutral condition.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cadaver study, coronal plane malalignment in TAA altered foot kinematics "
pub.1145209303,Combined quadriceps tendon reconstruction and total knee replacement with computer navigation: a case report,"BackgroundChronic quadriceps tendon rupture is technically challenging for surgeons due to scarring and tendon retraction. The presence of concurrent ipsilateral knee osteoarthritis compounds the issue even further. Although a combined presentation is rare, treatment options to manage each coexisting pathology simultaneously are scarcely reported. We describe the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian male who had such a presentation, and was subsequently treated with a one-stage extensor mechanism autograft reconstruction and total knee replacement with computer navigation.CaseThe patient was a 67-year-old male Caucasian, who had previously sustained an acute rupture of his right quadriceps tendon that was adequately repaired 6 months prior. Despite an initial satisfactory result, he reported deterioration in his mobility in the few months thereafter, with worsening knee pain. His comorbidities consisted of hypertension, asthma, and a body mass index of 40.4 kg/m2. Otherwise, there were no risk factors for tendon rerupture. Clinical examination later revealed a large palpable gap in the right suprapatellar region and weakness of active knee extension. No traumatic cause for this new presentation was identified. Suspicion of a chronic quadriceps tendon rupture was confirmed on radiological imaging, but the investigations also noted the presence of severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis of the ipsilateral, native knee joint. The combined procedure took place in one surgical sitting. The total knee replacement with patella resurfacing was performed first and assisted by computer navigation. The quadriceps tendon reconstruction was then conducted sequentially using the patient’s hamstring tendons (semitendinosus and gracilis). The tensile strength was reinforced with use of a Ligament Augmentation and Reconstruction System (LARS) ligament. Initial outcomes were excellent, and these results were maintained at 6 months postoperatively, with the patient reporting no pain and having full range of movement.ConclusionOur techniques used have not previously been reported, but are successful options in treating coexisting chronic quadriceps tendon rupture and ipsilateral knee osteoarthritis. The advantage of using computer navigation with an extramedullary femoral jig can lead to improved accuracy of bone cuts, which is important in the presence of anatomical disruption. Chronic failures of the extensor mechanism require different approaches depending on the inherent and underlying pathology. We feel that the multidisciplinary team approach to the management and use of two surgeons with differing expertise added to the successful outcome of this complex case."
pub.1018844344,A Novel Approach for Dynamic Testing of Total Hip Dislocation under Physiological Conditions,"Constant high rates of dislocation-related complications of total hip replacements (THRs) show that contributing factors like implant position and design, soft tissue condition and dynamics of physiological motions have not yet been fully understood. As in vivo measurements of excessive motions are not possible due to ethical objections, a comprehensive approach is proposed which is capable of testing THR stability under dynamic, reproducible and physiological conditions. The approach is based on a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation where a robotic physical setup interacts with a computational musculoskeletal model based on inverse dynamics. A major objective of this work was the validation of the HiL test system against in vivo data derived from patients with instrumented THRs. Moreover, the impact of certain test conditions, such as joint lubrication, implant position, load level in terms of body mass and removal of muscle structures, was evaluated within several HiL simulations. The outcomes for a normal sitting down and standing up maneuver revealed good agreement in trend and magnitude compared with in vivo measured hip joint forces. For a deep maneuver with femoral adduction, lubrication was shown to cause less friction torques than under dry conditions. Similarly, it could be demonstrated that less cup anteversion and inclination lead to earlier impingement in flexion motion including pelvic tilt for selected combinations of cup and stem positions. Reducing body mass did not influence impingement-free range of motion and dislocation behavior; however, higher resisting torques were observed under higher loads. Muscle removal emulating a posterior surgical approach indicated alterations in THR loading and the instability process in contrast to a reference case with intact musculature. Based on the presented data, it can be concluded that the HiL test system is able to reproduce comparable joint dynamics as present in THR patients. "
pub.1011960386,Recutting the distal femur to increase maximal knee extension during TKA causes coronal plane laxity in mid-flexion,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of distal femoral cut height on maximal knee extension and coronal plane knee laxity.
METHODS: Seven fresh-frozen cadaver legs from hip-to-toe underwent a posterior stabilized TKA using a measured resection technique with a computer navigation system equipped with a robotic cutting guide. After the initial femoral resections were performed, the posterior joint capsule was sutured until a 10° flexion contracture was obtained with the trial components in place. Two distal femoral recuts of +2mm each were then subsequently made and the trials were reinserted. The navigation system was used to measure the maximum extension angle achieved and overall coronal plane laxity [in degrees] at maximum extension, 30°, 60° and 90° of flexion, when applying a standardized varus/valgus load of 9.8 [Nm] across the knee.
RESULTS: For a 10 degree flexion contracture, performing the first distal recut of +2mm increased overall coronal plane laxity by approximately 4.0° at 30° of flexion (p=0.002) and 1.9° at 60° of flexion (p=0.126). Performing the second +2mm recut of the distal femur increased mid-flexion laxity by 6.4° (p<0.0001) at 30° and 4.0° at 60° of flexion (p=0.01), compared to the 9 mm baseline resection (control). Maximum knee extension increased from 10° of flexion to 6.4° (± 2.5° SD, p<0.005) and to 1.4° (± 1.8° SD, p<0.001) of flexion with each 2mm recut of the distal femur.
CONCLUSIONS: Recutting the distal femur not only increases the maximum knee extension achieved but also increases coronal plane laxity in midflexion."
pub.1142178247,The Oxford Domed Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Replacement implant: Increasing wall height reduces the risk of bearing dislocation,"Due to lateral ligament laxity, bearing dislocation occurs in 1%-6% of Oxford Domed Lateral replacements. Most dislocations are medial but they do rarely occur anteriorly or posteriorly. The aim was to decrease the risk of dislocation. For a bearing to dislocate the femoral component has to be distracted from the tibial component. A robotic-path-planning-algorithm was used with a computer model of the implant in different configurations to determine the Vertical Distraction needed for Dislocation (VDD). With current components, VDD anteriorly/posteriorly was 5.5 to 6.5 mm and medially was 3.5 to 5.75 mm. A thicker bearing increased VDD medially and decreased VDD anteriorly/posteriorly (0.1 mm/1 mm thickness increase). VDD medially increased with the bearing closer to the tibial wall (0.5 mm/1 mm closer), or by increasing the tibial wall height (1 mm/1 mm height increase). VDD anteriorly/posteriorly was not influenced by bearing position or wall height. To prevent collision between the femoral and tibial components an increase in wall height must be accompanied by a similar increase in minimum bearing thickness. Increasing the wall height and minimum bearing thickness by 2 mm and ensuring the bearing is 4 mm or less from the wall increased the minimum VDD medially to 5.5 mm. The lower VDD medially than anteriorly/posteriorly explains why medial dislocation is more common. If the wall height is increased by 2 mm, the minimum bearing thickness is 5 mm and the surgeon ensured the bearing is 4 mm or less from the wall, the medial dislocation rate should be similar to the anterior/posterior dislocation rate, which should be acceptable."
pub.1084249158,A Novel Implant System for Unloading the Medial Compartment of the Knee by Lateral Displacement of the Iliotibial Band,"BACKGROUND: Medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) typically occurs with excessive mechanical load within the medial compartment, resulting in degeneration of the articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: A novel extracapsular implant (Latella Knee Implant) has been developed to unload the medial compartment of the knee. The implant displaces the iliotibial band (ITB) over the lateral femoral condyle, thereby increasing its effective moment arm, resulting in a transfer of load from the medial compartment to the lateral compartment of the knee. A cadaveric study was performed to evaluate the effect of altering the moment arm of the ITB on knee biomechanics.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS: A 6-degrees-of-freedom robotic testing system was utilized to measure medial and lateral compartment loads in 8 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees at various ITB loads and knee flexion angles. Measurements were made with and without the implant in place. The system measured the compartment forces at flexion angles between 0° and 30° under 3 simulated loading conditions (300 N quadriceps, 100 N hamstrings, and [1] 0 N ITB, [2] 50 N ITB, [3] 100 N ITB).
RESULTS: Lateral displacement of the ITB between 15 and 20 mm resulted in medial compartment unloading between 34% and 65%.
CONCLUSION: Unloading the medial compartment with this novel implant has the potential to address the treatment gap for patients with medial knee OA.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Currently, there exists a treatment gap for patients with medial compartment OA who have exhausted conservative management but whose disease and symptoms do not warrant more invasive surgical procedures. An extracapsular implant to unload the medial compartment could fill this treatment gap by providing patients and surgeons with a less invasive option for early to mid-stage OA. Unloading the medial compartment may alleviate pain and improve function, allowing patients with early-stage medial OA to remain active longer prior to considering more invasive options such as arthroplasty."
pub.1063820568,Anatomical Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction after Valgus High Tibial Osteotomy,"BACKGROUND: Although anatomical double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction can successfully restore normal knee biomechanics for knees with typical varus-valgus alignment, the efficacy of the same reconstruction method for knees after a valgus high tibial osteotomy is unclear.
HYPOTHESIS: Anatomical double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for valgus knees after a high tibial osteotomy cannot restore normal knee kinematics and can result in abnormally high in situ forces in the ligament graft.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS: Ten cadaveric knees were subjected to valgus high tibial osteotomy followed by an anatomical double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The valgus knees were tested using a robotic/universal force-moment sensor system before and after the ligament reconstruction. The knee kinematics in response to anterior tibial load and combined rotatory loads, as well as the corresponding in situ forces of the anterior cruciate ligament bundles and grafts, were compared between the ligament-intact and ligament-reconstructed valgus knees.
RESULTS: After reconstruction, the anterior tibial translation and internal tibial rotation for the valgus knee decreased approximately 2 mm and 2 degrees , respectively, at low flexion angles compared with those of the anterior cruciate ligament-intact knee (P < .05). The in situ forces in the posterolateral graft became 56% to 200% higher than those in the posterolateral bundle of the intact anterior cruciate ligament (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Performing an anatomical double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on knees after valgus high tibial osteotomy may overconstrain the knee and result in high forces in the posterolateral graft, which could predispose it to failure.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Modifications of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction procedures to reduce posterolateral graft force may be needed for valgus knees after a high tibial osteotomy."
pub.1051702858,Grundlagen und neue Konzepte in der computernavigierten Hüftendoprothetik,"Combined component placement of cup and stem is closely correlated to stability, functionality and wear in total hip replacement (THA). Computer-navigated orthopedic surgery offers a reliable control method for a complex three-dimensional situation. Imageless navigation systems without the need of preoperative or intraoperative image acquisition and exposure to radiation have been proven to increase the accuracy of positioning the acetabular component and measure intraoperative leg length and offset changes precisely. A new development in this field is the noninvasive external femoral reference marker array system in conjunction with an imageless measurement technique. The future generation of imageless navigation systems will switch from simple measurement tasks to an integral part of the surgical process in navigated THA. The aim will be to find an optimized complementary component orientation with improved postoperative functionality and optimized range of motion without impingement."
pub.1158385189,Resultados clínicos de artroplastia total de cadera asistida por brazo robótico en España: estudio preliminar,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical, radiological and functional results of the first Spanish series of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty assisted by Mako® (Stryker) robotic arm at the Hospital Clínico San Carlos (HCSC) in Madrid.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective and descriptive study analyzing the first 25 patients who underwent robotic-assisted THA at the HCSC, with a minimum follow-up of 4months. Demographics, imaging studies (Mako® processing, Rx and CT), clinical parameters, functionality (modified Harris) and associated complications were evaluated.
RESULTS: Average age was 67.2years (min 47, max 88), being 56% male population sample. 88% involves primary coxarthrosis, 4% post-traumatic coxarthrosis, 4% secondary avascular necrosis and 4% secondary femoroacetabular impingement. Average surgery time was 116.9min (min 92, max 150). The average time of the first five surgeries was 122.6min, and, regarding the last five interventions, it was 108.2min. Found medical intraoperative complications were four intraoperative markers loss. Average admission time was 4.4days (min 3, max 7), with an average postoperative hemoglobin decrease of 3.08±1.08g/dL, requiring a transfusion in 12% of the cases. Three medical complications have been registered in the meantime of the admission, with a relevant case of a confusional syndrome and a fall, which resulted in a non-displaced AG1 periprosthetic fracture. The analysis of the positioning of registered implants with Mako® system shows 40.55±1.53 acetabular inclination degrees and 12.2±3.6 acetabular anteversion degrees. The postoperative image study carried out on patients, are consistent with Mako® s results, as it shows an acetabular inclination of 41.2±1.7 in Rx, as well as acetabular anteversion of 16±4.6 in CT. Hip length variance ranges depending on preoperative values of 3.91mm (SD: 3.9; min -12, max 3) to 1.29mm (SD: 1.96) after surgery registered with Mako®, with an increase of an average hip length of 5.64mm (SD: 3.35). Rx simple study results show a postoperative difference between both hips of 0.5±3.08mm, which is consistent with Mako® results. Native femoral offset was stable after surgery with a showing difference both pre and post operative of the intervened hip of 0.1mm (SD: 3.7), registered with Mako®. Preoperatory modified Harris punctuation was 41.6±13.3, improving to postoperative values of 74.6±9.7 after four months since the surgery. No complications were registered in immediate postoperative (4month).
CONCLUSIONS: Total hip arthroplasty robot-assisted achieves an adequate precision and repeatability of the implant positioning and the postoperative hip dysmetry without showing an increase of associated complications to the technique applied. Surgery time, complications and functional results in a short-time period are similar to conventional techniques applied to great series previously published."
pub.1166403710,[Research progress of functional alignment robot assisted knee replacement].,"The correct alignment of the knee joint is considered to be one of the most influential factors in determining the long-term prognosis after total knee arthroplasty(TKA). In order to achieve the correct alignment goal, many different alignment concepts and surgical techniques have been established. For example, mechanical alignment(MA), kinematic alignment(KA) and functional alignment(FA) have their own characteristics. MA focuses on achieving neutral alignment of the limbs, parallel and equal bone gaps during stretching and flexion. KA aims to restore the patient 's natural joint line, make the joint level and angle normal and improve the physiological soft tissue balance, and strive to reproduce the normal knee function;among them, functional alignment(FA) developed with robot-assisted surgery technology is a relatively new alignment concept. It not only considers the alignment of the body, but also aims to achieve flexion and extension balance, while respecting the native soft tissue capsule. It not only restores the plane and slope of the in situ joint line accurately during the operation, but also takes into account the balance of soft tissue, which is a better alignment method. Therefore, it is of great significance to correctly construct the lower limb force line of patients, which is helpful to restore knee joint function, relieve pain symptoms and prolong the service life of prosthesi. However, compared with traditional TKA, the operation time of robot-assisted FA-TKA is prolonged, which means that the probability of postoperative infection will be greater. At present, most studies of FA technology report short-term results, and the long-term efficacy of patients is not clear. Therefore, long-term research results are needed to support the application of this technology. Therefore, the author makes a review on the research status of functional alignment."
pub.1077301929,[Determination of femoral anatomic axis in robot-assisted surgery of total knee replacement].,"Determination of femoral anatomic axis plays an important role in robot-assisted surgery of total knee replacement. In traditional total knee replacement surgery, the axis is obtained by inserting a rod into femoral lumen. However, in the robot-assisted total knee replacement based on CT model. the femoral anatomic axis must be determined preoperatively. Because the lengths in femurs are quite different in different patients, besides noises, the upper segment and lower segment of the femur influence the design of the axis greatly. Traditionally, the femoral anatomic axis is obtained by using the least-squares method directly. However, this method is easily disturbed by noise. To avoid the noise disturbance of CT data, the least median of squares method is used to fit the femoral anatomic axis for its characteristic of robust regression. The least median squares method eliminates the disadvantage brought by the method of least squares. In finding the best-fit line, genetic algorithms are used in the paper. In our experiment, we use the proposed method to fit the femoral anatomic axis and obtain an excellent result."
pub.1061170687,Anatomy-based registration of CT-scan and intraoperative X-ray images for guiding a surgical robot,"We describe new methods for rigid registration of a preoperative computed tomography (CT)-scan image to a set of intraoperative X-ray fluoroscopic images, for guiding a surgical robot to its trajectory planned from CT. Our goal is to perform the registration, i.e., compute a rotation and translation of one data set with respect to the other to within a prescribed accuracy, based upon bony anatomy only, without external fiducial markers. With respect to previous approaches, the following aspects are new: 1) we correct the geometric distortion in fluoroscopic images and calibrate them directly with respect to the robot by affixing to it a new calibration device designed as a radiolucent rod with embedded metallic markers, and by moving the device along two planes, while radiographs are being acquired at regular intervals; 2) the registration uses an algorithm for computing the best transformation between a set of lines in three space, the (intraoperative) X-ray paths, and a set of points on the surface of the bone (imaged preoperatively), in a statistically robust fashion, using the Cayley parameterization of a rotation; and 3) to find corresponding sets of points to the X-ray paths on the surfaces, our new approach consists of extracting the surface apparent contours for a given viewpoint, as a set of closed three-dimensional nonplanar curves, before registering the apparent contours to X-ray paths. Aside from algorithms, there are a number of major technical difficulties associated with engineering a clinically viable system using anatomy and image-based registration. To detect and solve them, we have so far conducted two experiments with the surgical robot in an operating room (OR), using CT and fluoroscopic image data of a cadaver bone, and attempting to faithfully simulate clinical conditions. Such experiments indicate that intraoperative X-ray-based registration is a promising alternative to marker-based registration for clinical use with our proposed method."
pub.1142687327,Power-Tool Use in Orthopaedic Surgery,"BACKGROUND: Power tools are an integral part of orthopaedic surgery but have the capacity to cause iatrogenic injury. With this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of iatrogenic injury due to the use of power tools in orthopaedic surgery and to discuss the current methods that can be used to reduce injury.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of English-language studies related to power tools and iatrogenic injuries using a keyword search in MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases. Exclusion criteria included injuries related to cast-saw use, temperature-induced damage, and complications not clearly related to power-tool use.
RESULTS: A total of 3,694 abstracts were retrieved, and 88 studies were included in the final analysis. Few studies and individual case reports looked directly at the prevalence of injury due to power tools. These included 2 studies looking at the frequency of vascular injury during femoral fracture fixation (0.49% and 0.2%), 2 studies investigating the frequency of vertebral artery injury during spinal surgery (0.5% and 0.08%), and 4 studies investigating vascular injury during total joint arthroplasty (1 study involving 138 vascular injuries in 124 patients, 2 studies noting 0.13% and 0.1% incidence, and 1 questionnaire sent electronically to surgeons). There are multiple methods for preventing damage during power-tool use. These include the use of robotics and simulation, specific drill settings, and real-time feedback techniques such as spectroscopy and electromyography.
CONCLUSIONS: Power tools have the potential to cause iatrogenic injury to surrounding structures during orthopaedic surgery. Fortunately, the published literature suggests that the frequency of iatrogenic injury using orthopaedic power tools is low. There are multiple technologies available to reduce damage using power tools. In high-risk operations, the use of advanced technologies to reduce the chance of iatrogenic injury should be considered.

pub.1045769122,Stability of tuberosity reattachment in proximal humeral hemiarthroplasty,"Hemiarthroplasty can be an effective treatment for 4-part fractures of the proximal humerus; however, results are often unpredictable. Proper surgical technique is critical for success. Reconstruction of the displaced tuberosities should attempt to impart maximal interfragmentary stability. To our knowledge, a comparison of different tuberosity reconstruction methods has not been reported. We evaluated 5 techniques of tuberosity reattachment on 8 humeri. Four-part fractures were simulated by an oscillating saw in fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders. In the control construct, the greater and lesser tuberosities were attached to the humeral shaft with nylon strap ties (2.4 x l mm) applied at 9.1 N with closure of the rotator interval. Five anatomic reconstructions were then performed:(1) the control tuberosities were attached to each other with strap ties, and (2) the control tuberosities were attached to each other with strap ties, incorporating the anterior fin of the prosthesis. To each of these 3 constructs, a circumferential cerclage (4.8 x 1.25-mm strap tie) applied at 39.2 N was placed around the tuberosities and incorporated into the medial hole of the prosthesis (techniques 3, 4, and 5). Through use of a robot articulator at a rate of 10 degrees /s, passive external rotation from 0 degrees to 60 degrees was performed on the control and the 5 test constructs of each specimen. Interfragmentary displacement of the bony fragments was measured with mercury strain gauges and strain calculated. This strain was minimal and statistically less (P <.05) in those constructs in which a cerclage was used. Incorporation of the nylon strap into the fin of the prosthesis did not enhance stability. In those constructs in which a cerclage was used, maximal displacement was 0.14 +/- 0.7 mm (38% +/- 19% strain), as compared with 0.72 +/- 0.5 mm (204% +/- 133% strain) without it. Reconstruction of 4-part proximal humerus fractures with hemiarthroplasty should incorporate a circumferential medial cerclage. This will decrease interfragmentary motion and strain, maximize fracture stability, and facilitate postoperative rehabilitation."
pub.1140666090,Acromioclavicular joint reconstruction implants have differing ability to restore horizontal and vertical plane stability,"PURPOSE: Persistent acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) instability following high grade injuries causes significant symptoms. The importance of horizontal plane stability is increasingly recognised. There is little evidence of the ability of current implant methods to restore native ACJ stability in the vertical and horizontal planes. The purpose of this work was to measure the ability of three implant reconstructions to restore native ACJ stability.
METHODS: Three groups of nine fresh-frozen shoulders each were mounted into a robotic testing system. The scapula was stationary and the robot displaced the clavicle to measure native anterior, posterior, superior and inferior (A, P, S, I) stability at 50 N force. The ACJ capsule, conoid and trapezoid ligaments were transected and the ACJ was reconstructed using one of three commercially available systems. Two systems (tape loop + screw and tape loop + button) wrapped a tape around the clavicle and coracoid, the third system (sutures + buttons) passed directly through tunnels in the clavicle and coracoid. The stabilities were remeasured. The data for A, P, S, I stability and ranges of A-P and S-I stability were analyzed by ANOVA and repeated-measures Student t tests with Bonferroni correction, to contrast each reconstruction stability versus the native ACJ data for that set of nine specimens, and examined contrasts among the reconstructions.
RESULTS: All three reconstructions restored the range of A-P stability to that of the native ACJ. However, the coracoid loop devices shifted the clavicle anteriorly. For S-I stability, only the sutures + buttons reconstruction did not differ significantly from native ligament restraint.
CONCLUSIONS: Only the sutures + buttons reconstruction, that passed directly through tunnels in the clavicle and coracoid, restored all stability measures (A, P, S, I) to the native values, while the tape implants wrapped around the bones anteriorised the clavicle. These findings show differing abilities among reconstructions to restore native stability in horizontal and vertical planes. (300 words)."
pub.1057425094,Intraoperative 3D-Rekonstruktion des PMMA-Köchers zur computerassistierten Revisionshüftendoprothetik auf Basis von 2D-Röntgen-Bildgebung,"AIM: Computer-assisted cement removal out of the femoral medullary canal requires the exact definition of the plug's shape within a 3D coordination system. Aiming at a sufficiently precise reconstruction based on segmentation of just a few 2D X-ray images a special mathematic procedure is needed for automatic surface interpolation. The geometric specification of the resulting virtual model should take into account the characteristic geometry of the navigated tools in order to achieve the best possible removal.
METHOD: Studies were performed on anatomic specimens of entire human femora, that underwent cemented THA before being cut every 5 mm. The cross-sections were scanned at the high resolution of 600 dpi. Segmentation of the cement was performed with the help of a virtual deformable template and was both used for simulation of X-ray projections from various points of view and for validation of the reconstructed 3D model. By this means systematic errors such as those possible during X-ray acquisition, tracking or segmentation could be avoided and the precision of the procedure could be measured exclusively.
RESULTS: With increasing number of X-rays the distance from the reconstructed 3D model to the original could continuously be reduced. Using only two x-rays a maximum error was measured with 6.5 mm, whereas 5 pictures taken from different angles showed to be enough to ensure an error below 1 mm in the distal part of the femur. By the use of 6 or more pictures no significant improvement could be attained.
CONCLUSION: The innovative procedure is essential for future 2D image-based fluoroscopic navigation of PMMA removal and bears the options of computer-controlled and robotic material working, respectively."
pub.1176100981,[A retrospective study on two different surgical robots to assist total knee arthroplasty].,"OBJECTIVE: To compare early clinical and imaging results of domestic HURWA and imported Brainlab Knee3 surgical robot-assisted knee replacement.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 93 patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) who underwent robot-assisted descending total knee arthroplasty(TKA) from January 2021 to July 2023, and they were divided into BRATKA group and HRATKA group according to use of robotic system. There were 40 patients in BRATKA group, including 16 males and 24 females, aged from 55 to 90 years old with an average of (64.3±7.0) years old;27 patients with grade Ⅲ and 13 patients with grade Ⅳ according to Kellgren-Lawrence(K-L);18 patients on the right side and 22 patients on the left side;the courses of disease ranged from 1 to 30 years with an average of (15.3±7.6) years;imported Brainlab Knee3 surgical robot assisted system was adopted. There were 53 patients in HRATKA group, including 18 males and 35 females, aged from 52 to 81 years old with an average of (64.4±8.5) years old;30 patients with grade Ⅲ and 23 patients with grade Ⅳ;21 patients on the right side and 32 patients on the left side;the courses of disease ranged from 1 to 32 years with an average of (16.4±7.9) years;HURWA surgical robot assisted system was adopted. Operation time, perioperative total blood loss, incision length and postoperative complications were compared between two groups. Deviation angle of hip-knee-ankle angle(HKAA) before operation and on the first day after operation was compared between two groups. Later tibal component (LTC), frontal femoral component (FFC), later femoral component (LFC) and frontal tibal component(FTC) at 1 day after on the first day after operation was compared between two groups. Knee Society score(KSS), visual analogue scale (VAS) and range of motion (ROM) of knee joint were compared between two groups before operation and on the 3rd and 90th day after operation.
RESULTS: Both groups were followed up for 11 to 18 months with an average of (14.4±2.1) months, and the wounds of all patients healed well. Operation time and incision length of BRATKA group were (132.1±34.6) min and (12.9±1.9) cm, while (94.1±10.8) min and (14.8±2.1) cm in HRATKA group, respectively, and the differences between two groups were statistically significant(<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There were no significant difference in perioperative total blood loss and preoperative deviation angle of HKAA between two groups(<i>P</i>&gt;0.05). Deviation angle of HKAA, FFC angle and LFC angle in BRATKA group were (1.90±0.91) °, (87.90±1.51) ° and(9.00±3.2) °, respectively;while (0.93±1.04) °, (89.03±0.96) ° and (7.63±0.59) ° in HRATKA group, respectively, and the differences between two groups were statistically significant (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There were no significant differences in FTC and LTC between two groups(<i>P</i>&gt;0.05). There were no significant differences in VAS of knee rest and exercise, KSS score and ROM of knee joint between two groups bef"
pub.1141915455,[Comparative study of intra- and post-operative inclination and anteversion angles of acetabular cup in robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty].,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the inclination and anteversion angles of the acetabular cup measured by intraoperative robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) and postoperative X-ray films and CT imaging.
METHODS: The clinical data of 54 patients (54 hips) who underwent robot-assisted THA between May 2020 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, there were 26 males (26 hips) and 28 females (28 hips), with an average age of 58.4 years (range, 39-71 years). The body mass index was 19.2-29.3 kg/m <sup>2</sup>, with an average of 25.2 kg/m <sup>2</sup>. All the patients had their first THA, including 31 cases of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, 12 cases of hip arthritis, 8 cases of femoral neck fracture, and 3 cases of developmental dysplasia of the hip. The anteversion and inclination angles of the acetabular cup were obtained through the surgical data in the robot host system. All patients underwent X-ray and CT scan examination within 2-7 days after operation to obtain the postoperative anteversion and inclination angles of the acetabular cup. According to the concept of ""Lewinnek safe zone"", the proportion of acetabular in the safe zone intra- and post-operation were compared.
RESULTS: The operation time was 57.8-89.2 minutes, with an average of 68.3 minutes; the intraoperative blood loss was 125.0-450.0 mL, with an average of 204.8 mL. No adverse events such as dislocation of hip joint and infection occurred during hospitalization. The anteversion angle of acetabular cup was (40.8±0.6)° during operation and (41.2±2.8)° after operation, with no significant difference ( <i>t</i>=1.026, <i>P</i>=0.307). The anteversion angle of acetabular cup measured during operation was (17.6±1.4)°, which was significantly smaller than that measured after operation (23.4±3.8)°( <i>t</i>=10.520, <i>P</i>=0.000). According to ""Lewinnek safe zone"", 54 hips (100%) were in the safety zone during operation, and 16 hips were out of the safety zone, 38 hips were in the safty zone after operation, the ratio of the hips in the safty zone was 70.4%, showing a significant difference ( <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>=18.783, <i>P</i>=0.000).
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted THA can obtain accurate placement of the acetabular cup, but there is a large deviation between the anteversion angle of the acetabular cup in the lateral position during operation and the supine position after operation. Further study is needed to define the intraoperative placement position of the acetabular cup."

Methods: The clinical data of 15 patients (17 hips) underwent MAKO robot assisted complex THA between May 2020 and June 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 5 males and 10 females with the age ranged from 19 to 70 years (median, 49 years), included 9 cases (9 hips) of developmental dysplasia of the hip (Crowe type Ⅱ in 5 hips, type Ⅲ in 1 hip, and type Ⅳ in 3 hips), 1 case (2 hips) of rheumatoid arthritis, 2 cases (3 hips) of ankylosing spondylitis, 3 cases (3 hips) of secondary arthritis with a history of acetabular fracture and internal fixation. The acetabular cup abduction angle and anteversion angle were measured at 3 months after operation, and compared with those measured by MAKO robot system before and immediately after operation. The femoral offset and leg length discrepancy (LLD) were measured at 3 months after operation, which were compared with those before operation. Harris hip score (HHS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) score were used to evaluate hip function before operation and at 3 months after operation.
Results: All 15 patients (17 hips) completed the operation successfully. The operation time was 75-175 minutes, with an average of 116.3 minutes; the intraoperative blood loss was 100-800 mL, with an average of 381.3 mL. Two patients were not included in the statistics because of intraoperative and postoperative complications, the remaining 13 patients (15 hips) had no serious complication such as vascular and nerve injuries, and 3 patients had intermuscular vein thrombosis. The 13 patients (15 hips) were followed up 3-15 months, with an average of 8 months. At last follow-up, the position of prosthesis did not change and there was no signs of loosening. There was no significant difference in acetabular abduction angle at immediate and 3 months after operation when compared with preoperative one ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05), and the acetabular anteversion angle was significantly lower than that before operation ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in acetabular abduction angle and anteversion angle between at immediate and 3 months after operation ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). The LLD, offset, HHS score, and VAS score were significantly improved at 3 months after operation when compared with preoperative ones ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05).

pub.1144499789,Comparison of hip offset and rotation center reconstruction between robot-assisted and manual total hip arthroplasty,"Objective  To compare the differences of hip offset and rotation center reconstruction between robot-assisted and manual total hip arthroplasty (THA).   Methods  Patients underwent robot-assisted and manual THA from May to September of 2020 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were enrolled in this study. The patients included 27 patients (28 hips) in robot-assisted THA (rTHA) group and 29 patients (31 hips) in manual THA (mTHA) group. In rTHA group, there were 16 males and 11 females, with a mean age of (59±13) years. In mTHA group, there were 18 males and 11 females, with a mean age of (63±14) years. Basic information, including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), diagnosis and functional scoring etc, were recorded. In rTHA group, Mako robot system was used for preoperative planning, intraoperative real-time location and navigation. In mTHA group, traditional preoperative template design and surgical procedure were carried out. Operation time and functional scoring were compared postoperatively. Femoral offset, acetabular offset, global offset, rotation center changes in vertical and horizontal directions were measured on pelvis X-ray and analyzed. The correlation between intraoperative feedback of global offset change in robot system and postoperative measured global offset were analyzed.   Results  Operation time in rTHA group was (80±10) min, which was statistically longer than that in mTHA group ((58±18) min, P <0.001). With 6 months′ follow-up, the Harris scoring in rTHA group was 94.9±2.8, which was statistically higher than that in mTHA group (93.1±2.8, P =0.017), however there was no statistic difference in WOMAC scoring between rTHA and mTHA group (7.0±3.8 vs 7.1±2.4, P =0.840). Absolute global offset change within 5 mm, 5-10 mm and lager than 10 mm were 71.4%(20/28), 28.6%(8/28) and 0 in rTHA group, which were 45.2%(14/31), 29.0%(9/31) and 25.8%(8/31) in mTHA group (all P <0.05). A positive relation was found between intraoperative feedback of global offset change in robot system and postoperative measured global offset in rTHA group ( r =0.77, P <0.001). It was found that rotation center changes concentrated in outer upper quadrant in both groups, and rotation center change in rTHA group concentrated mainly in the area less than 10 mm, however, rotation center change in mTHA group was more dispersive compared with rTHA group.   Conclusion  rTHA may accurately reconstruct hip offset and rotation center, intraoperation feedback of global offset change may be an effective reference."
pub.1141915457,[Biomechanical analysis of sitting-up movement of knee joint after robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Navio robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) on the biomechanics of knee joint during sitting-up movement, and to determine whether UKA can maintain the biomechanical characteristics of knee joint.
METHODS: The clinical data of 8 patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis treated with medial fixed platform of Navio robot-assisted UKA between January 2018 and January 2019 and had the complete follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed. There were 4 males and 4 females; the age ranged from 58 to 67 years, with an average of 62.3 years. The disease duration was 6-18 months, with an average of 13 months. The varus deformity ranged from 4° to 6°, with an average of 5°; the knee flexion range of motion was 0°-130°, with an average of 110°. All patients had no extension limitation. The imaging data of bilateral knees during sitting-up movement were collected by biplane C-arm X-ray machine at 3 weeks before operation and 7 months after operation. The three-dimensional models of femur and tibia were established by dual-energy CT scanning, and the three-dimensional models of femur and tibia were matched and synchronized with the femur and tibia in X-ray film by automatic matching tracer software. The biomechanical parameters of femur and tibia were measured, including internal rotation/external rotation, varus/valgus, forward/backward displacement of medial and lateral tibia contact center, and lateral compartment joint space.
RESULTS: Eight patients were followed up 5-7 months, with an average of 6.4 months. In the comparison of the affected side before and after operation, except for the difference of varus/valgus which was significant ( <i>t</i>=4.959, <i>P</i>=0.002), the differences in other indicators was not significant ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). There were significant differences in varus/valgus and internal rotation/external rotation between healthy and affected sides at 3 weeks before operation ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the differences in other indicators was not significant ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). At 7 months after operation, the difference in the forward and backward displacement of medial tibia contact center was significant ( <i>t</i>=3.798, <i>P</i>=0.007), and the differences in other indicators was not significant ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: UKA can effectively correct the varus and valgus of the knee joint, and restore the rotational biomechanical characteristics of the affected knee joint. It does not affect the establishment of the lateral compartment joint space, but the medial and lateral tibia contact center still changes."
pub.1139799448,"Restricted Kinematic Alignment, the Fundamentals, and Clinical Applications","<b>Introduction:</b> After a better understanding of normal knee anatomy and physiology, the Kinematic Alignment (KA) technique was introduced to improve clinical outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The goal of the KA technique is to restore the pre-arthritic constitutional lower limb alignment of the patient. There is, however, a large range of normal knee anatomy. Unusual anatomies may be biomechanically inferior and affect TKA biomechanics and wear patterns. In 2011, the leading author proposed the restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) protocol, setting boundaries to KA for patients with an outlier or atypical knee anatomy. <b>Material and Equipment:</b> rKA aims to reproduce the constitutional knee anatomy of the patient within a safe range. Its fundamentals are based on sound comprehension of lower limb anatomy variation. There are five principles describing rKA: (1) Combined lower limb coronal orientation should be ± 3° of neutral; (2) Joint line orientation coronal alignment should be within ± 5° of neutral; (3) Natural knee's soft tissues tension/ laxities should be preserved/restored; (4) Femoral anatomy preservation is prioritized; (5) The unloaded/most intact knee compartment should be resurfaced and used as the pivot point when anatomical adjustment is required. An algorithm was developed to facilitate the decision-making. <b>Methods:</b> Since ~50% of patients will require anatomic modification to fit within rKA boundaries, rKA is ideally performed with patient-specific instrumentation (PSI), intra-operative computer navigation or robotic assistance. rKA surgical technique is presented in a stepwise manner, following the five principles in the algorithm. <b>Results:</b> rKA produced excellent mid-term clinical results in cemented or cementless TKA. Gait analysis showed that rKA TKA patients had gait patterns that were very close to a non-operated control group, and these kinematics differences translated into significantly better postoperative patient-reported scores than mechanical alignment (MA) TKA cases. <b>Discussion:</b> Aiming to improve the results of MA TKA, rKA protocol offers a satisfactory compromise that recreates patients' anatomy in most cases, omitting the need for extensive corrections and soft tissue releases that are often required with MA. Moreover, it precludes the reproduction of extreme anatomies seen with KA."
pub.1020814716,Robot-aided in vitro measurement of patellar stability with consideration to the influence of muscle loading,"BackgroundAnterior knee pain is often associated with patellar maltracking and instability. However, objective measurement of patellar stability under clinical and experimental conditions is difficult, and muscular activity influences the results. In the present study, a new experimental setting for in vitro measurement of patellar stability was developed and the mediolateral force–displacement behavior of the native knee analyzed with special emphasis on patellar tilt and muscle loading.MethodsIn the new experimental setup, two established testing methods were combined: an upright knee simulator for positioning and loading of the knee specimens, and an industry robot for mediolateral patellar displacement. A minimally invasive coupling and force control mechanism enabled unconstrained motion of the patella as well as measurement of patellar motion in all six degrees of freedom via an external ultrasonic motion-tracking system. Lateral and medial patellar displacement were measured on seven fresh-frozen human knee specimens in six flexion angles with varying muscle force levels, muscle force distributions, and displacement forces.ResultsSubstantial repeatability was achieved for patellar shift (ICC(3,1) = 0.67) and tilt (ICC(3,1) = 0.75). Patellar lateral and medial shift decreased slightly with increasing flexion angle. Additional measurement of patellar tilt provided interesting insights into the different displacement mechanisms in lateral and medial directions. For lateral displacement, the patella tilted in the same (lateral) direction, and tilted in the opposite direction (again laterally) for medial displacement. With regard to asymmetric muscle loading, a significant influence (p < 0.03, up to 5 mm shift and 8° tilt) was found for lateral displacement and a reasonable relationship between muscle and patellar force, whereas no effect was visible in the medial direction.ConclusionThe developed experimental setup delivered reproducible results and was found to be an excellent testing method for the in vitro analysis of patellar stability and future investigation of surgical techniques for patellar stabilization and total knee arthroplasty. We demonstrated a significant influence of asymmetric quadriceps loading on patellar stability. In particular, increased force application on the vastus lateralis muscle led to a clear increase of lateral patellar displacement."
pub.1170970811,Advances in the Treatment of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"Osteochondral lesion of the talus (OLT) is a localized cartilage and subchondral bone injury of the talus trochlea. OLT is caused by trauma and other reasons, including osteochondritis dissecans of the talus (OCD) and talus osteochondral tangential fracture. OLT can develop from being asymptomatic to subchondral bone cysts accompanied by deep ankle pain. OLT tends to occur on the medial and lateral sides of the talar vault. OLT seriously affects the patients' life and work and may even lead to disability. Herein, we reviewed advances in the treatment of OLT and the strengths and weaknesses of various treatments. Different treatment methods, including conservative treatments and surgical treatments, can be adopted according to the different subtypes or clinical symptoms of OLT. Conservative treatments mostly relieve symptoms in the short term and only slow down the disease. In recent years, it has been discovered that platelet-rich plasma injection, microfracture, periosteal bone grafting, talar cartilage transplantation, allograft bone transplantation, reverse drilling under robotic navigation, and other methods can achieve considerable benefits when each of these treatment methods is applied. Furthermore, microfracture combined with platelet-rich plasma injections, microfracture combined with cartilage transplantation, and various other treatment methods combined with anterior talofibular ligament repair have all led to good treatment outcomes."
pub.1085106907,Can we use the ipsilateral Hamstrings for ACL Reconstruction in case of medial collateral ligament insufficiency?," Aims and Objectives: Semitendinosus and gracilis muscles (hamstring muscles) are frequently harvested autologous tendon grafts of the knee e.g. for cruciate ligament reconstruction. This study investigated the joint-stabilizing effects of these muscles in case of insufficiency of the medial collateral ligament (MCL). Hypotheses: First, both the semitendinosus and the gracilis muscles can actively stabilize the joint against valgus stress in the medial collateral unstable knee. Second, this stabilizing influence of these muscles decreases with increasing flexion angle   Meterials and Methods: Kinematics were examined in ten fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees using a robotic/UFS testing system and an optical tracking system. The knee kinematics under 5 Nm and 10 Nm valgus stress were determined in the a) MCL intact and b) MCL deficient knee in different flexion angles, respectively using the following simulated muscle loads: 1) 0 N (Idle), 2) 200 N semitendinosus load (ST) and 3) 280 N combined semitendinosus and gracilis load (STGT).   Results: Cutting the MCL increased valgus angle under all tested conditions and angles in contrast to the MCL intact knee by 4.3-8.1 degrees for 5 Nm, 6.5-11.9 degrees for 10 Nm valgus torque; P<.01; RM-ANOVA). Applied 200 N simulated ST load reduced the valgus angle significantly in 0°, 10°, 20° and 30° of flexion under 5 Nm and 10 Nm (P< .05) valgus stress. In 0°, 10° and 20° these values were close to the MCL intact joint under the respective torque (both P >.05). The combined 280 N simulated STGT load reduced significantly valgus angle in 0°, 10° and 20° of flexion under 5 Nm and 10 Nm of valgus stress (P< .05) to values near the intact joint (5 Nm: 0°, 10°; 10 Nm: 0°, 10°, 20° - P >.05). In 60° and 90° of flexion ST and STGT loads could not decrease resulting valgus angle of the MCL deficient knee (without hamstring load; P>.05 or valgus increase P<.05).   Conclusion: In this human cadaveric study semitendinosus and gracilis muscles can successfully stabilize against valgus stress in the MCL insufficient knee in near-to-extension flexion angles. In the valgus-unstable knee, hamstring muscles should be preserved in (multi-) ligament surgery, but also in joint arthroplasty and osteosynthesis if possible. "
pub.1165278385,Unicompartmental knee prosthesis.,"In a patient with severe unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis where conservative treatments have been exhausted, with painful symptoms located on the affected side and with a reducible axis, the unicompartmental knee prosthesis (UKP) is the first option for our work group. Within the study to confirm the diagnosis and plan the surgery, weight-bearing knee x-rays, Rosenberg x-rays, and teleradiographs of the lower extremities stand out. The objective of surgery is to replace the affected area, restoring the anatomy with an adequate balance of soft tissues. Regarding alignment, the challenge is not to overload the opposite side or that of the prosthesis. There are mobile and fixed plates and although the clinical and survival results are similar, in recent years with the incorporation of robotic surgery, the balance has tipped towards the use of fixed plates. The clinical and functional results are better and there are fewer complications than when total knee prostheses (TKP) are used in the same type of patients. The survival studied in registries is lower than for TKP, but when used in high-flow centers where the percentage of UKP is close to a third of the total with strict patient selection, the duration is as good as in PTR."
pub.1057440712,Nervenschäden nach robotergestütztem totalen Hüftgelenksersatz: Fallserie mit 29 Patienten,"AIM: In Germany computer-assisted hip replacement (CAHR), e. g., ROBODOC, has been carried out in several thousand cases. After a period of enthusiasm, the technique now faces growing resistance from both patients and physicians. After CAHR many patients complain about persistent pain and problems with walking. Due to these problems, patients very often ask whether they have a nerve injury. In general, it is important to know whether or not there is a specific risk of nerve injuries with CAHR. At present neurological data are inconsistent, and neurophysiological studies have not yet been reported.
METHODS: We have analysed a case series of 29 patients after CAHR with ROBODOC in 30 operated joints. All patients underwent a systematic neurological and neurophysiological examination.
RESULTS: In 3 out of 30 operated sites functionally relevant nerve injuries were found, which led to disability in the first year after surgery. Permanent disability due to nerve injury was not found.
CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of a specific risk of nerve injury after CAHR. The incidence of partial and transient nerve damage in the first year after operation might be higher than in classical hip replacement (3.1 %)."

METHODS: Patients who were scheduled for primary unilateral TKA between October 2020 and December 2020 were eligible in this randomized controlled trial. According to the random number table method, they were allocated to the traditional TKA group and the RATKA group [application of the Yuanhua robotic-assisted TKA (YUANHUA-TKA) system during operation]. A total of 63 patients met the selection criteria were enrolled in the study, of which 3 cases voluntarily withdrew from the trial. And finally 60 cases were enrolled for analysis; of which 28 cases were in the RATKA group and 32 cases were in the traditional TKA group. There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, duration of osteoarthritis, surgical side, and preoperative knee visual analogue scale (VAS) resting and motion scores, joint range of motion (ROM), Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, stiffness, and function scores, hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) deviation ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). The operation time and intraoperative blood loss of the two groups were recorded. Knee joint VAS resting and motion scores, ROM, KSS scores, and WOMAC pain, stiffness, and function scores were used to evaluate the knee joint function and pain. Gait analysis (flexion and extension angle) was conducted at 3 months after operation. The full length X-ray films of lower limbs and anteroposterior and lateral X-ray films of knee joint were taken. The HKA deviation, lateral tibia component (LTC), frontal femoral component (FFC), frontal tibia component (FTC), and lateral femoral component (LFC) measured on the X-ray films were used to evaluat the lower limb alignment and prosthesis position.
RESULTS: The operations of the two groups completed successfully; the incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no complications related to the operation occurred.

pub.1008457458,Pfannenposition und Orientierung im Vergleich,"Background. Aim of this in-vitro study was to compare the hip cup placement for total hip replacement when using different navigation systems compared with the traditional, non-navigated technique. Methods. Five different navigation systems were used: the CT-less systems Navitrack™, Orthopilot™ and Surgetics Station™, as well as the CT-based Navitrack™ and VectorVision™. Three different surgeons carried out five cup implantations using all navigation systems and the manual approach on a surgery dummy. Cup orientation (inclination and anteversion) and the cup position (achieved cup center) were determined with a coordinate measuring machine. Results. In the manual group the variability of the cup orientation was higher in comparison and hardly influenced by the surgeon. Navigation was identified as a significant factor for smaller deviations from planned inclination and anteversion angles (p<0,001 for both). Cup position was not affected by surgeon in the manual group (p=0,966). Compared with manual technique, the cup misplacement vector was significantly smaller in the CT-Navitrack group (p<0,001) but higher in the Navitrack (CT-less) and VectorVision group (p<0,001). Conclusions. The use of computer navigation will help the surgeon to orientate the acetabular component more accurately but not necessarily with regard to cup positioning."
pub.1029575676,Primäre Rotationsstabilität von roboterunterstützt und manuell implantierten Hüftendoprothesenschäften,"In our study we compared the primary rotatory stability of hip endoprostheses implanted with the help of a robot and manually implanted stems. We examined three different types of prosthesis stems: Osteolock (Stryker-Howmedica), CBC (Mathys), and Excia (Aesculap). Ten stems of each prosthesis type were implanted in identical polyurethane foam blocks: five were implanted manually and five with the help of a robot (CASPAR, URS-Ortho). After implantation, the stem was subjected to a defined rotatory stress. The torsional moment necessary to break the stem out of the foam was documented with the help of special software. The force-displacement diagrams after robot-assisted implantations were homogeneous for each type of prosthesis. After manual preparation, the diagrams were very inhomogeneous. The rotatory test also showed very consistent results for the robot-implanted stems. The range of results after manual implantation was much higher. In all types of prostheses the use of the robot system led to a higher rotatory stability compared to the manual group. The CBC stem was most stable for rotatory forces after robot-assisted implantation compared to the other two types. After manual implantation there was no difference in stability between the different stems."
pub.1141915452,[Short-term effectiveness of Mako robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty via posterolateral approach].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the short-term effectiveness of Mako robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) via posterolateral approach.
METHODS: The clinical data of 64 patients (74 hips) treated with Mako robot-assisted THA via posterolateral approach (robot group) between May 2020 and March 2021 were retrospectively analyzed and compared with the clinical data of 52 patients (55 hips) treated with traditional THA via posterolateral approach (control group) in the same period. There was no significant difference in general data such as gender, age, side, body mass index, disease type, and preoperative Harris score between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. Acetabular inclination angle, acetabular anteversion angle, and lower limbs discrepancy were measured after operation. At last follow-up, the improvement of hip pain and function was evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Harris score, and forgetting joint score (FJS-12).
RESULTS: In the robot group, 3 patients (including 1 patient with acetabular fracture during operation) were converted to routine THA because the pelvic data array placed at the anterior superior iliac spine was loose, resulting in data error and unable to register the acetabulum; the other patients in the two groups completed the operation successfully. The operation time and intraoperative blood loss in the robot group were significantly higher than those in the control group ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). All patients were followed up 1-10 months, with an average of 4.6 months. In the robot group, 1 patient with ankylosing spondylitis had acetabular prosthesis loosening at 2 days after operation, underwent surgical revision, and 10 patients had lower limb intermuscular vein thrombosis; in the control group, 1 patient had left hip dislocation and 5 patients had lower extremity intermuscular vein thrombosis; there was no complication such as sciatic nerve injury, incision exudation, and periprosthetic infection in both groups. There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the robot group and the control group (17.2% <i>vs.</i>11.5%) ( <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>=0.732, <i>P</i>=0.392). At last follow-up, the acetabular anteversion angle and FJS-12 score in the robot group were was significantly greater than those in the control group, and the lower limbs discrepancy was significantly less than that in the control group ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05); there was no significant difference in acetabular inclination angle and VAS score between the two groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05).

pub.1019665840,Präzision in der orthopädischen Computernavigation,"Navigation has become increasingly integrated into orthopaedic surgery, especially in the area of endoprosthetic procedures. Simplification of the instrumentation along with the use of imageless systems has increased the ease of use for the orthopaedic surgeon. Principle navigation systems enable an accuracy of corrections and alignments within intervals of 1 mm or 1°. Consequently, potential intra- and interobserver failures during the registration procedure typically range within a few millimetres or degrees. Analysis of the actual algorithms used for the registration process of the lower extremity mechanical axis and the articular surfaces reveal valid and reproducible results.With the help of navigation, it is possible to achieve a higher degree of precision in total hip and knee implant placement, including a distinct reduction in variance as compared to conventional techniques. Similarly, application of navigation during a high tibial osteotomy or at the osteotomy of the distal radius also enables a more precise correction of the axis of the affected extremity, in addition to improved reproducibility. Despite these promising early results, large prospective clinical studies comparing conventional techniques versus computer assisted navigation are thus far only available for total knee arthroplasty. Whether navigated prosthesis placement can truly extend the longevity of an implant will require continued observation in the years to come. In addition, further prospective studies are required to determine the benefit of navigation in other orthopaedic procedures."
pub.1017565711,Robot-assisted surgery in total hip replacement,"The most important prerequisite for permanent fixation of an implant is primary stability. Osteointegration of the implant is a major goal in cementless total hip replacement (THR). This means direct contact between bone and implant, leading to fixation of the implant in the bone without the interference of fibrous tissue. In addition to the design of the implant, the structure of the implant surface and the material of the implant, the specific operational technique plays a major role in permanent fixation. Only the conical fixation of femoral implants guarantees high primary stability in cementless THR. The type of fixation of the implant in the femoral cavity and the resulting load transfer from implant to bone has a decisive effect on the durability of the prostheses. In order to achieve optimal primary fixation of the implant, robot-assisted implantation of the cementless implant has been performed at the Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik Frankfurt am Main since the summer of 1994. After preoperative planning at a three-dimensional graphic work station these data are transferred to the robot, which transforms the preoperative planning by milling the femoral cavity with the highest precision. So far this type of surgery has been performed on 300 patients. The encouraging postoperative results prompted us to install the second system of Robodoc at the Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik Frankfurt."
pub.1148220782,Study on the correlation between early three-dimensional gait analysis and clinical efficacy after robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"Purpose:  Robot-assisted technology is a forefront of surgical innovation that improves the accuracy of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). But whether the accuracy of surgery can improve the clinical efficacy still needs further research. The purpose of this study is to perform three-dimensional (3D) analysis in the early postoperative period of patients who received robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA), and to study the trend of changes in gait parameters after RATKA and the correlation with the early clinical efficacy.   Methods:  Patients who received RATKA in the Center of Joint Surgery, the First Hospital Affiliated to Army Military Medical University from October 2020 to January 2021 were included. The imaging parameters, i.e., hip-knee-ankle angle, lateral distal femoral angle, medial proximal tibial angle, posterior condylar angle were measured 3 months post-TKA. The 3D gait analysis and clinical efficacy by Western Ontario Mac Master University Index (WOMAC) score were performed pre-TKA, 3 and 6 months post-TKA. The differences in spatiotemporal parameters of gait, kinetic parameters, and kinematic parameters of the operated limb and the contralateral limb were compared. The correlation between gait parameters and WOMAC scores was analyzed. Paired sample t -test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to analyze the difference between groups, and Spearman correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation.   Results:  There were 31 patients included in this study, and the imaging indexes showed that all of them returned to normal post-TKA. The WOMAC score at 3 months post-TKA was significantly lower than that pre-TKA, and there was no significant difference between at 3 and 6 months. The 3D gait analysis results showed that the double support time of the operated limb reduced at 3 and 6 months (all p < 0.05), the maximum extension and maximum external rotation of the knee joint increased at stance phase, and the maximum flexion angle, the range of motion and the maximum external rotation increased at swing phase. Compared with the preoperative data, there were significant improvements (all p < 0.05). Compared with the contralateral knee joint, the maximum external rotation of the knee joint at swing phase was smaller than that of the contralateral side, and the maximum flexion and extension moment was greater than that of the contralateral knee. The maximum external rotation moment of the joint was greater than that of the contralateral knee joint ( p < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between the single support time pre-TKA and the WOMAC score at 3 months ( p = 0.017), and the single support time at 3 months was negatively correlated with the WOMAC score at 6 months ( p = 0.043). The cadence at 6 months was negatively correlated with the WOMAC score at 6 months ( p = 0.031). The maximum knee extension at stance phase at 6 months was negatively correlated with the WOMAC score at 6 month ( p = 0.048). The maximum extern"

He relates the history of VBGs whose indications for the wrist are often many and varied for the treatment of scaphoid non-union and Kienböch's disease. Within the hand the indication for compound VBGs is dominated by thumb reconstruction (skin and bone grafts). Compound VBGs and VBJGs used in an emergency for hand trauma, harvested from another irrecoverable long finger (bank finger) are extremely varied and adapted to each particular case. For secondary joint reconstruction in the adult, VBJGs must be discussed along with prosthetic arthroplasties (radio-carpal, lower radio-ulnar, trapezo-metacarpal, interphalangeal). For children VBJGs with an included growth plate maintain their indication. The immediate future of VBGs is that of a better knowledge of bone necrosis and bone innervation as well as an improvement in surgical techniques: microsurgery and robotics, mini-invasive surgery (wrist arthroscopy). The near future for VBGs is to control bone consolidation thanks to progress in the bio-engineering of bone tissue, which may make them obsolete and, for VBJGs, vascularised joint allografts, thanks to progress in immunosuppressant treatments. Although the immediate future and this near future may be envisaged according to the current advances, the same is not true for the distant future which remains totally unforeseeable, although this might involve regeneration and construction of organs by man himself."
pub.1079184612,Local infiltration anesthesia: does it really work?,"Postoperative pain control after major surgeries such as total hip arthroplasty (THA) is so important because leads to an increased mobilization, decreased opioids consumption and hospital stay, all of which are the major concerns after THA surgery. Perioperative local infiltration anesthesia (LIA) is one of the recent techniques for achieving these purposes (1-3). LIA to the operation site is a simple way and have demonstrated great impacts on abdominal, thoracic, and plastic surgical setting. Actually, it is a widely used analgesic technique in recent years. In this technique, a solution including long-acting local anesthetic combined with opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or steroids are used (3,4). It can be done anytime related to surgery and preemptive usage of this modality is encouraged as well. In one study conducted by Ong et al. (5), it was indicated that preemptive LIA improved analgesic consumption and time to first pain relieving request, but it did not result in any decrease in postoperative pain scores. However, it has been shown that patients who received infiltration with local anesthetics experience lower pain scores as well as lower analgesic requirement. The effects of LIA could differ according to the type of surgical procedures, type and dosage of the used local anesthetic, adding adjuvants to local anesthetic, injection only into incision site or the whole wound, flap or joint and the use of intraarticular catheters for postoperative infusion. Shin et al. showed that preoperative bilateral superficial cervical plexus block and ropivacaine wound infiltration were more effective for reducing pain scores than ropivacaine wound infiltration alone in patients undergoing robotic thyroidectomy, which shows the efficacy of performing multiple injections for pain control (6)."

This method has been discussed controversially from the beginning of its clinical application in Germany. Criticism increased recently especially in respect of alleged malpractice. Aim of this study was to describe the consequences of the results of a systematic review and the evaluation of malpractice accusations for statutory health insurance and medical advisory services.
METHOD: Robot-assisted total hip replacement was evaluated by a Health Technology Assessment report, especially concerning proof of clinical benefit and specific complications of this method. 44 cases of alleged malpractice reported to health insurance were assessed as well and compared with the results of the systematic review.
RESULTS: The HTA report showed no proof of clinical benefit but pointed to increased rates of complications. In the 44 evaluated cases the entire range of endoprosthesis- but no robot-specific complications could be identified.
CONCLUSION: Patients must be informed about risks, complications, benefits and especially alternatives to a robot-assisted operation. The prospective procedure of management of assumed malpractice concerning Robodoc can not be standardised, but each case must be evaluated individually. Consequently, implementation of a structured malpractice management system for health insurance and medical advisory services should be useful. Additionally, health service should implement an ""early warning system"" for innovative procedures."
pub.1122513991,Role of 3D intraoperative imaging in orthopedic and trauma surgery,"Intraoperative three-dimensional (3D) imaging is now feasible because of recent technological advances such as 3D cone-beam CT (CBCT) and flat-panel X-ray detectors (FPDs). These technologies reduce the radiation dose to the patient and surgical team. The aim of this study is to review the advantages of 3D intraoperative imaging in orthopedic and trauma surgery by answering the following 5 questions: What are its technical principles? CBCT with a FPD produces non-distorted digital images and frees up the surgical field. The high quality of these 3D intraoperative images allows them to be integrated into surgical navigation systems. Human-robot comanipulation will likely follow soon after. Conventional multislice CT technology has also improved to the point where it can be used in the operating room. What can we expect from 3D intraoperative imaging and which applications have been validated clinically? We reviewed the literature on this topic for the past 10 years. The expected benefits were determined during the implantation of pedicular screws: more accurate implantation, fewer surgical revisions and time savings. There are few studies in trauma or arthroplasty cases, as robotic comanipulation is a more recent development. What is the tolerance for irradiation to the patient and surgical team? The health drawbacks are the harmful radiation-induced effects. The deterministic effects that we will develop are correlated to the absorbed dose in Gray units (Gy). The stochastic and carcinogenic effects are related to the effective dose in milliSievert (mSv) of linear evolution without threshold. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) states that irradiation for medical purposes with risk of detriment is acceptable if it is justified by an optimization attempt. The radioprotection limits must be known but do not constitute opposable restrictions. The superiority of intraoperative 3D imaging over fluoroscopy has been demonstrated for spine surgery and sacroiliac screw fixation. How does the environment need to be adapted? The volume, access, wall protection and floor strength of the operating room must take into account the features of each machine. The instrumentation implants and need for specialized staff result in additional costs. Not every system can track movements during the CBCT acquisition thus transient suspension of assisted ventilation may be required. Is it financially viable? This needs to be calculated based on the expected clinical benefits, which mainly correspond to the elimination of expenses tied to surgical revisions. Our society's search for safety has driven the investments in this technology. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V, Expert opinion."
pub.1057161200,6-Jahres-Ergebnisse nach roboterunterstützter Hüftendoprothesenimplantation – eine prospektive Studie,"AIM: In our prospective study we evaluated the clinical and radiological results of 36 patients who had a robot-assisted implantation of a cementless hip endoprosthesis.
METHOD: All patients underwent a standardised examination preoperatively, 1 year after the operation and 6 years postoperatively. We evaluated the pain of the patients with the help of a visual analogue scale, the range of motion of the hip joint and subjective and objective parameters according to the Harris hip score and the Merle d'Aubigné score. With X-rays loosenings and movement of the stems were evaluated. All patients were operated by the same team.
RESULTS: The clinical results were very good. A highly significant pain reduction could be documented. We also saw a significant improvement in the range of motion and the hip scores. In 1 case a loosening of the stem happened after 5 years, in another patient the stem broke out a few days after implantation. The reason for this was not a mistake of the robot but the wrong preoperative planning. Other complications were not observed.
CONCLUSION: Considering the good biochemical results in the literature, our study suggests good long-term results after robot-assisted hip surgery. The drawbacks and complications of robot-assisted hip surgery, which were documented especially in the popular press, cannot be confirmed."
pub.1012286027,Qualitätssteigerung in der präoperativen Planung und intraoperativen Umsetzung durch die Verwendung von computerassistierten Systemen und Operationsrobotern – eine experimentelle Untersuchung,"Summary. 14 human femurs were scanned by CAT and 3D reconstructed. In every specimen digital documentation of CCD and antetorsion (AT) angle was performed. With a special software package (Orthodoc) virtual preoperative planning for implantation of a cementless total hip alloplasty was undertaken. The specimens were randomised into two groups, one of which had manual and the other one robot implantation of the femoral component. After implantation all specimens were evaluated again by CAT and CCT and AT angle were documented again. The preoperative CCD angle was 126.7 ° (SD = 4.0) in the manual group and 127.8 ° (SD = 4.3) in the robodoc group. Postoperatively the angle averaged 131.9 ° (SD = 0.8) in the manual group and 133.2 ° (SD = 1.9) in the robodoc group. Significant differences were found for the AT angle in both groups. The preoperative AT angle in the manual group was 31.3 ° (SD = 8.8), decreasing to 20.5 ° (SD = 9.5) after implantation. In the robodoc group this angle was 30.9 ° (SD = 8.0) before and 31.3 ° (SD = 8.7) after implantation. The difference between pre- and postoperative AT angle averaged 10.8 ° (SD = 6.4) in the manual group and only 0.4 ° (SD = 0.9) in the robodoc-group. Conclusion: With the technique used, preoperative planning in hip alloarthroplasty is much more accurate than with the conventional technique with plain X-ray. The virtual preoperative planning can be transferred to the intraoperative setting with high precision. These factors may lead to an increase in outcome quality."
pub.1103283772,[The hardware techniques for the restoration of the gait stereotype in the patients following total hip replacement: the personalized approach].,"BACKGROUND: total hip replacement has long ago become the «golden standard» for the treatment of dysplastic coxarthrosis in thousands of the patients receiving it every year. In the meantime, the analysis of the specialized literature gives evidence of the lack of a systematic and personified approach to the rehabilitation treatment.
AIM: The objective of the present study was to improve medical rehabilitation of the patients following the total hip replacement and to develop the personalized programs for walking modality reconstruction taking into consideration the age and the body weight of the patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 240 patients were available for the observation including 184 women and 56 men. They were divided into three study groups and one control group, with the differentiation into the following three subgroups: one comprised of the patients of moderate acerage age and body weight, the other containing the obese patients (BMI>35), and the third one involving the elderly patients (age >70 years); each subgroup consisted of 20 patients. All the patients received the early basic rehabilitation treatment, those in the study groups had to perform in addition the robotic training based on the use of hardware techniques supplemented by passive mechanotherapy and electromyostimulation designed to restore the walking stereotype with three types of devices: body weight unloading, video-reconstruction associated with biological feedback and robototherapy.
RESULTS: The comparative analysis of the effectiveness of various methods of gait reconstruction has demonstrated the high effectiveness of the application of the hardware technique in the patients of moderate acerage age and body weight. At the same time, the elderly patients had a significantly higher rate of successful walking reconstruction efficiency under the influence of the video-associated training with biological feedback (3 times that achieved with training using the device for unloading the body weight and 4 times compared with the result of a course of robotic walk. The evaluation of the application of the techniques for the gait stereotype reconstruction in the obese patients gave evidence of the advantage of the Lokomat robotic trainings that produced 6 times better results than unloading of the body weight and 5 times better ones than the video-associated training with biological feedback.
DISCUSSION: The results of the present study are on the whole comparable with the data reported by other authors although its design was different from that of the majority of the published studies in that our patients were allocated to different subgroups for the further personalization of the methods applied to restore the gait stereotype. The factors limiting the use of the results of this study include the medium-high level of the patients' welfare most of whom are residents of the city of Moscow and Moscow region characterized by a relatively high quality and accessibilit"
pub.1057432813,Primäre Rotationsstabilität von roboterunterstützt und manuell implantierbaren Hüftendoprothesenschäften,"AIM: In our study we compared the primary rotatory stability of hip endoprostheses which were implanted with the help of a robot with that of manually implanted stems.
METHOD: We examined three different types of prosthesis-stems: Osteolock (Stryker-Howmedica), CBC (Mathys), Excia (Aesculap). Furthermore, we examined two types of prostheses which could not be implanted with a robot (Sl-Plus/Endoplus; Hipstar/Stryker-Howmedica). 10 stems of each prosthesis type were implanted in identical polyurethane foam blocks; 5 of them were implantated manually, 5 with the help of a robot (CASPAR, URS-Ortho). After implantation, a defined rotatory stress was put on the stem with the help of a torquing machine. The torsional moment which was necessary until the stem broke out of the foam was documented with the help of special software.
RESULTS: In all types of prostheses the use of the robot system led to a higher rotatory stability compared to the manual group. Among the three tested types of prosthesis stems, the CBC stem is significantly more stable for rotatory forces after robot-assisted implantation compared to the other two types. After manual implantation there was no difference in stability between the different stems. The Zweymüller stem and the Hipstar prosthesis did very well, even in comparison to the robot-implanted group. The results of the Zweymüller stem and the robot-implanted CBC Stem were similar, and a significantly higher rotatory stability of the Hipstar prosthesis compared to every other stem was observed.
CONCLUSION: Using a robot, the rotatory stability of hip endoprostheses can be improved. However, the design of the stems seems to be even more important for the stability than the implantation technique."
pub.1163387151,Does Preoperative Pharmacogenomic Testing of Patients Undergoing TKA Improve Postoperative Pain? A Randomized Trial,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenomics is an emerging and affordable tool that may improve postoperative pain control. One challenge to successful pain control is the large interindividual variability among analgesics in their efficacy and adverse drug events. Whether preoperative pharmacogenomic testing is worthwhile for patients undergoing TKA is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are the results of preoperative pharmacogenetic testing associated with lower postoperative pain scores as measured by the Overall Benefit of Analgesic Score (OBAS)? (2) Do the results of preoperative pharmacogenomic testing lead to less total opioids given? (3) Do the results of preoperative pharmacogenomic testing lead to changes in opioid prescribing patterns?
METHODS: Participants of this randomized trial were enrolled from September 2018 through December 2021 if they were aged 18 to 80 years and were undergoing primary TKA under general anesthesia. Patients were excluded if they had chronic kidney disease, a history of chronic pain or narcotic use before surgery, or if they were undergoing robotic surgery. Preoperatively, patients completed pharmacogenomic testing (RightMed, OneOME) and a questionnaire and were randomly assigned to the experimental group or control group. Of 99 patients screened, 23 were excluded, one before randomization; 11 allocated patients in each group did not receive their allocated interventions for reasons such as surgery canceled, patients ultimately undergoing spinal anesthesia, and change in surgery plan. Another four patients in each group were excluded from the analysis because they were missing an OBAS report. This left 30 patients for analysis in the control group and 38 patients in the experimental group. The control and experimental groups were similar in age, gender, and race. Pharmacogenomic test results for patients in the experimental group were reviewed before surgery by a pharmacist, who recommended perioperative medications to the clinical team. A pharmacist also assessed for clinically relevant drug-gene interactions and recommended drug and dose selection according to guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium for each patient enrolled in the study. Patients were unaware of their pharmacogenomic results. Pharmacogenomic test results for patients in the control group were not reviewed before surgery; instead, standard perioperative medications were administered in adherence to our institutional care pathways. The OBAS (maximum 28 points) was the primary outcome measure, recorded 24 hours postoperatively. A two-sample t-test was used to compare the mean OBAS between groups. Secondary measures were the mean 24-hour pain score, total morphine milligram equivalent, and frequency of opioid use. Postoperatively, patients were assessed for pain with a VAS (range 0 to 10). Opioid use was recorded preoperatively, intraoperatively, in the postanesthesia care unit, and 24 hours after discharge from the postanesthes"

Seven patients had lost follow-up and missing data, so they were excluded and the remaining 127 patients were included for analysis, including 66 patients in the trial group and 61 patients in the control group. There was no significant difference ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05) in gender, age, body mass index, side, duration of osteoarthritis, Kellgren-Lawrence grading, preoperative Knee Society Score (KSS) and Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score between the two groups. The trial group completed the TKA by domestic robot-assisted osteotomy according to the preoperative CT-based surgical planning. The control group was performed by traditional osteotomy plate combined with soft tissue release. Total operation time, osteotomy time of femoral/tibial side, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. The radiographs were taken at 5 and 90 days after operation, and hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), lateral distal angle of femur (LDFA), and posterior tibial slope (PTS) were measured. The difference between the measured values of the above indexes at two time points after operation and the preoperative planning target values was calculated, and the absolute value (absolute error) was taken for comparison between the two groups. The postoperative recovery of lower limb alignment was judged and the accuracy was calculated. KSS score and WOMAC score were used to evaluate the knee joint function of patients before operation and at 90 days after operation. The improvement rates of KSS score and WOMAC score were calculated. The function, stability, and convenience of the robot-assisted system were evaluated by the surgeons.
Results: The total operation time and femoral osteotomy time of the trial group were significantly longer than those of the control group ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the tibial osteotomy time and the amount of intraoperative blood loss between the two groups ( <i>P&gt;</i>0.05).

pub.1132413908,Influence of Comprehensive Joint Loads on Tibial Implant Micromotion in Total Ankle Arthroplasty," Category: Ankle   Introduction/Purpose: Biologic fixation of total joint replacements by bone ingrowth requires minimal bone-implant micromotion [1]. Computational finite element (FE) models used to evaluate the interaction between implant and bone typically only consider simplified loading conditions based on the peak compressive force which occurs near toe-off [2,3]. However, a previous study focused on cementless knee replacements demonstrated that peak micromotion during activity cycles occurred with sub-maximal forces and moments [4]. Our objective was to calculate multi-axial loading at the ankle joint throughout level walking and evaluate tibial fixation of ankle replacements under these loading conditions. We hypothesized that peak micromotion would occur with sub-maximal loads and moments instead of at the instant of peak compressive load.   Methods: Our validated six-degree-of-freedom robotic simulator utilizes in vivo data from human subjects to replicate the individual bone kinematics in cadaveric specimen throughout activity [5]. We rigidly fixed retro-reflective markers using bone pins to the tibia, talus, and calcaneus bones of three cadaveric specimens to record individual bone kinematics using motion capture cameras. We recorded the ground reaction and muscle-tendon forces during the simulated stance phase of level walking. Musculoskeletal models were then developed in OpenSim using the specimen-specific morphology and implant position from CT- scans and from the simulator outputs to determine the loading profile at the ankle joint during stance. The calculated loads were then applied to specimen-specific finite element models to evaluate the bone-implant interaction. Peak micromotion at each time point of loading was measured and compared to the loading profile to determine if it corresponded with the peak compressive load.   Results: For all specimens, the peak compressive load at the ankle joint was accompanied by multi-axial moments and relatively small shear forces (Figure 1). The peak compressive load for each specimens was between 750 N and 850 N and occurred during 75-80% of gait. The largest moment experienced by all specimens was an internal moment late in stance. The peak micromotion for each specimen did not correspond to the instance of peak compressive load, as indicated in Figure 1. Instead, peak micromotion occurred at 54%, 88%, and 96% of gait. For each specimen, these instances corresponded to the combination of a sub-maximal compressive load with high eversion and internal moments.   Conclusion: We have developed a workflow to calculate ankle joint loads corresponding to cadaveric simulations that reproduce a daily activity based on in vivo data. The specimen-specific, multi-axial loading profile at the ankle for our initial results suggests that peak micromotion at the bone-implant interface of the tibial implant does not coincide with the peak compressive force. The instant of peak compressive load may not c"
pub.1057206958,Evolution im Operationssaal,"Noch nie hat ein technologischer Fortschritt vor der Medizin haltgemacht, so auch nicht der Computer. Computer haben die ärztliche Praxis und das Krankenhaus längst erobert. Und dennoch waren die ersten Roboter im Operationssaal eine „Revolution“. Zum ersten Mal ist der Computer direkt in das Arzt-Patienten-Verhältnis eingedrungen. Der Operationsroboter hat sich angemaßt, präziser und damit sogar besser zu sein als die menschliche Hand. Diese Zeitschrift hat sich in zahlreichen Artikeln mit dieser Thematik beschäftigt. In Editorials wurde davor gewarnt, dass die primär euphorisch begrüßte Technologie ausschließlich zu Marketingzwecken missbraucht werde und damit im Chaos enden könnte 3. Zu einer analog der in den USA von der Food and Drug Administration ausgesprochenen beschränkten Zulassung der Technologie kam es nicht, sodass vor allem falsche Indikationsstellungen und ungeeignete Operationsstrategien zum Niedergang der Robotertechnologie geführt haben. Demgegenüber hat sich die computergestützte Navigation beim Hüft- und Kniegelenkersatz stetig weiterentwickelt, denn schonende Operation heißt die Herausforderung an das Chirurgenteam von morgen. Der kleine Schnitt ist sinnbildlich geworden für den schonenden Eingriff, die rasche Genesung des Patienten und damit auch für ein kosteneffizientes Gesundheitssystem. Wenn der Operateur aber bei minimalinvasiven Zugängen eine eingeschränkte Sicht auf das Operationsumfeld hat, dann werden Navigationshilfen, neue Bilddarstellungsformen und technisch intelligente Instrumente benötigt. Auch hierzu sind in der Zeitschrift für Orthopädie bzw. Zeitschrift für Orthopädie und Unfallchirurgie zahlreiche Artikel erschienen. Ihr gemeinsamer Tenor war, dass sich mit Navigationshilfen die Präzision des operativen Eingriffs verbessern lässt, ein genereller Einsatz vor allen Dingen an Kostenfaktoren scheiterte. Diesen beiden Gesichtspunkten wenden sich nun die Beiträge von Prymka und Hassenflug 5 sowie von König et al. 2 zu. Prymka und Hassenflug berichten in ihrer Studie erstmals über längerfristige, nämlich 6-Jahres-Ergebnisse nach roboterunterstützter Hüftendoprothesenimplantation. Die Ergebnisse bei 32 Patienten werden von ihnen sehr positiv bewertet. Vor allem die allseits mit der Roboterimplantation in Verbindung gebrachten glutealen Insuffizienzen traten nicht auf. Auch Schmerzbefunde im Bereich der zur Referenzierung eingebrachten vormaligen Schraubenkanäle wurden nicht beobachtet. Damit reihen sie sich in die Gruppe derjenigen Autoren ein, die die Probleme nach der Implantation vor allem auf Anwenderfehler zurückführen 1. König und Mitarbeiter haben sich in ihrer Arbeit mit einer breiten Anwendung der Navigation entgegenstehenden Kostenfrage beschäftigt. Sie konnten belegen, dass wie in zahlreichen anderen Publikationen auch die navigierten Knie- und Hüftendoprothesen präziser implantiert werden konnten. Diesem für den Patienten bedeutsamen Nutzen steht ein vermeintlich höherer Kostenaufwand gegenüber, da die"

pub.1142709985,Advances in Surgical Techniques for Robotic Computer-Navigated Total and Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty has become increasingly commercially available as both technology developers and surgeons attempt to address specific limitations of conventional jig-based alignment techniques in order to improve resection accuracy and precision. Semi-active and passive systems predominate in the North American and European markets and can provide surgeons additional instruments for intraoperative calibration and balance assessment or directly assist in performing personalized resections. Recently published and ongoing clinical investigations seek to determine if robotic assistance may result in improved radiographic or clinical outcomes for patients undergoing either unicompartmental or total knee arthroplasty. A number of studies evaluating conventional and robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty did not identify significant radiographic or clinical outcome differences, though heterogeneity in robotic system design and application may limit the generalization of focused studies. Conversely, some studies that identified significant differences noted that robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty may be associated with fewer alignment outliers as well as increased surgical time—at least initially for unfamiliar surgeons. Further limitations include limited follow-up for newer systems on the market as well as the associated variety of arthroplasty implants and authors’ surgical techniques. Future studies will help surgeons and patients determine if intraoperative robotic assistance may be beneficial in total knee arthroplasty."

pub.1129793198,"The Impingement-free, Prosthesis-specific, and Anatomy-adjusted Combined Target Zone for Component Positioning in THA Depends on Design and Implantation Parameters of both Components","BACKGROUND: Lewinnek's recommendation for orienting the cup in THA is criticized because it involves a static assessment of the safe zone and because it does not consider stem geometry. A revised concept of the safe zone should consider those factors, but to our knowledge, this has not been assessed.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) To determine the shape, size, and location of target zones for combined cup and stem orientation for a straight stem/hemispheric cup THA to maximize the impingement-free ROM and (2) To determine whether and how these implant positions change as stem anteversion, neck-shaft angle, prosthetic head size and target range of movements are varied.
METHODS: A three-dimensional computer-assisted design model, in which design geometry was expressed in terms of parameters, of a straight stem/hemispheric cup hip prosthesis was designed, its design parameters modified systematically, and each prosthesis model was implanted virtually at predefined component orientations. Functional component orientation referencing to body planes was used: cups were abducted from 20° to 70°, and anteverted from -10° to 40°. Stems were rotated from -10° to 40° anteversion, neck-shaft angles varied from 115° to 143°, and head sizes varied from 28 to 40 mm. Hip movements up to the point of prosthetic impingement were tested, including simple flexion/extension, internal/external rotation, ab/adduction, combinations of these, and activities of daily living that were known to trigger dislocation. For each combination of parameters, the impingement-free combined target zone was determined. Maximizing the size of the combined target zone was the optimization criterion.
RESULTS: The combined target zones for impingement-free cup orientation had polygonal boundaries. Their size and position in the diagram changed with stem anteversion, neck-shaft angle, head size, and target ROM. The largest target zones were at neck-shaft angles from 125° to 127°, at stem anteversions from 10° to 20°, and at radiographic cup anteversions between 17° and 25°. Cup anteversion and stem anteversion were inverse-linearly correlated supporting the combined-anteversion concept. The range of impingement-free cup inclinations depended on head size, stem anteversion, and neck-shaft angle. For a 127°-neck-shaft angle, the lowest cup inclinations that fell within the target zone were 42° for the 28-mm and 35° for the 40-mm head. Cup anteversion and combined version depended on neck-shaft angle. For head size 32-mm cup, anteversion was 6° for a 115° neck-shaft angle and 25° for a 135°-neck-shaft angle, and combined version was 15° and 34° respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The shape, size, and location of the combined target zones were dependent on design and implantation parameters of both components. Changing the prosthesis design or changing implantation parameters also changed the combined target zone. A maximized combined target zone was found. It is mandatory to consider both components to determ"
pub.1016597863,Current status and perspectives of shoulder replacement,"Basis of the modern shoulder implants is the Neer II-system, a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation. The second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the Neer II prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head- and shaft-sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation-translation-mechanism. The third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation. The latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3-dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthestic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry. This achieves a 3-dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane. Besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established – the replacement of the humeral head articular surface. A hemispheric surface prosthesis – cup arthroplasty – is cemented onto the residual humeral head, which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal. Bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi-rotational head system. Their indication is limited to pre-existing lesions of the rotator cuff and/or the glenoid surface. The inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid. The hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component. This implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences. The role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration. A fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus, the centre of rotation, and the anatomical retroversion. Positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process. A failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result. The shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented, cementless or hybrid techniques. Today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist. Their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups – the keel – and the peg-shaped glenoid components. The peg-shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear-forces. Cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylen inlay and a surface treated metal-back with an integrated fixation system. These fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to sp"
pub.1137864558,289 Blood Loss in Robotic-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty: A Retrospective Analysis,"Abstract  Introduction Significant blood loss is associated with a delayed postoperative recovery in joint arthroplasty. Emerging evidence suggests robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty reduces soft-tissue trauma, length of stay, and can facilitate a faster recovery. This study compares the total blood loss in patients undergoing robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty compared to conventional methods.   Method Patients undergoing robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or unicomparmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) were identified using patient records. Robotic-assisted groups were compared against contemporary sex-matched controls undergoing jig-based arthroplasty. The mean total blood loss was estimated using the Gross equation. Statistical significance was identified using the Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively.   Results Robotic TKA and UKA groups were successfully matched to contemporary controls (n = 50 in all groups). No differences in preoperative haematological parameters or blood volume were found between the robotic-assisted and control groups. Robotic TKA experienced 23.7% less blood loss compared to control TKA (911.0ml vs 1193.7ml, p < 0.01) which was found to be statistically significant. There was a non-significant difference in mean total blood loss in robotic UKA compared to control UKA (821.7ml vs 854.7ml, p = 0.69).   Conclusions The use of a robotic surgical system reduces blood loss in TKA but not UKA in knee arthroplasty. "
pub.1123891459,Research progress in the use of surgical robotic systems in arthroplasty,"With the application of robotic-assisted arthroplasty in the clinical setting during the last two decades, passive, semiautonomous, and autonomous surgical robotic systems have been developed and utilized in a wide range of surgical procedures. Such procedures include total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. These robotic platforms can be divided into open platforms and closed systems. A navigation component is indispensable for all kinds of surgical robotic systems used in arthroplasty. Navigation components need two disparate approaches to realize three-dimensional reconstruction. Some robotic systems require preoperative imaging examination for navigation, while others only need intraoperative anatomic landmark identification. The following four types of FDA-approved surgical robotic systems are currently available for arthroplasty, the Robodoc autonomous system, the Rio haptic system, the iBlock cutting guide, and the Navio handheld system. Robotic-assisted arthroplasty reportedly facilitates more accurate milling, cutting, and drilling, allowing component alignment and bone morphing to be performed with higher precision and closer to preoperative planning. These advantages result in better postoperative function restoration and patient satisfaction. The learning curve is also acceptable for these systems. Nonetheless, robotic systems are still somewhat disappointing, because they are typically associated with prolonged surgical procedures and require adequate surgical field exposure. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness ratio of this technology in China is required for further investigation. Future designs of robotic arthroplasty systems should aim to overcome the current shortcomings in terms of security and reliability, facilitating further automation of more surgical procedures and reduction in the size of the systems."
pub.1146584375,Robotic-Assisted Surgical Systems for Knee Arthroplasty,"Overall, there was no consensus in the evidence to indicate that robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty provided any superior clinical effectiveness outcomes when compared to conventional techniques.
 No evidence indicated that robot-assisted knee arthroplasty had worse clinical outcomes than conventional techniques. Evidence did support the association of robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty with decreased length of hospital stay and increased operative time.
 Further adequately powered studies of short-term and long-term clinical effectiveness for robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty are required to definitively demonstrate any potential benefits for patients requiring knee arthroplasty.
 Robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty was consistently modelled as cost-effective when clinical inputs included improved quality of life and reduced rates of surgical revisions when compared with conventional techniques. The clinical effectiveness evidence reviewed in this report was unable to adequately support these clinical inputs as accurate."
pub.1117365276,Evolution of Robotics in Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery has been available clinically in some form for over two decades, claiming to improve total joint arthroplasty by enhancing the surgeon’s ability to reproduce alignment and therefore presumably to better restore kinematics. Various current systems include a robotic arm, robotic-guided cutting jigs, and robotic milling systems with a diversity of different navigation strategies using active, semi-active, or passive control systems. A review of previous designs and clinical studies demonstrate that these robotic systems decrease variability and increase precision, primarily focusing on component positioning and alignment. Some early clinical results indicate decreased revision rates and improved patient satisfaction with robotic-assisted arthroplasty. The future design objectives include precise planning and even further improved consistent intraoperative execution. Robotics has proven to be beneficial, reliable, and cost-effective in numerous other industries and is likely to continue to expand in the field of orthopedic surgery."

pub.1117365271,Total Knee Arthroplasty Technique: NAVIO,"Robotic-assisted surgery for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) continues to gain popularity as orthopedists seek to enhance their abilities to place implants more precisely and consistently. However, the benefits of robotic assistance must be weighed against factors such as increased surgical time, cost, and learning curve challenges. Furthermore, due to the paucity of data on many of these newer systems, clinical studies have yet to determine their long-term benefits. Robotic-assisted navigation does provide distinct 3D data during preoperative planning that allows the surgeon to increase implant placement accuracy.

The increasing adoption of computer-assisted and robotic assisted techniques in total joint arthroplasty has been found to enhance the accuracy of component placement. Short-term studies have indicated improved survival rates in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty with the use of robotic assistance. While robotic technology has proven beneficial in revising procedures like converting unicompartmental knee arthroplasty to TKA, there is limited information on its application in revising primary TKA. This case report details the use of robotic-assisted technology with CORI system in the revision of TKA.

Since the advent of computer-assisted navigation for TKA, which was first introduced and validated on cadavers in total knee arthroplasty in 1996, this technology has been adapted to TSA to improve component position. An additional technique for improving glenoid component position is patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) guides. PSI systems involve the use of custom-made guides constructed from CT-based 3D preoperative computer templating. While robotic-assisted total knee and total hip arthroplasty is currently commercially available, robotic-assisted TSA is not. However, in 2022, a cadaveric study on a novel TSA robotics platform was published.

These systems are currently used worldwide for total knee arthroplasty. Many studies have clearly demonstrated that robotic systems can accurately and reliably control variables such as lower leg alignment, joint-line maintenance, soft tissue balance, and component positioning. In addition, they are more accurate and reliable than those used for conventional total knee arthroplasty. To date, however, few studies have assessed the survivorship and functional outcomes of robot-assisted surgery, and we found no sufficiently powered studies that compared these two parameters between robot-assisted and conventional knee arthroplasty.

Far removed from the autonomous robots depicted in science fiction, these robotic systems operate under the skilled guidance of surgeons, who control specialized instruments via intuitive consoles and often with the help of robotic product specialists. This symbiotic relationship between man and machine has propelled robotic surgery to the forefront of medical innovation, offering a plethora of benefits that transcends the limitations of conventional surgical techniques. In orthopedic surgery, robotic-assisted knee and hip arthroplasty has experienced rapid growth, and the next field of interest is, without a doubt, shoulder arthroplasty. Digitalization and the use of robotics in shoulder arthroplasty has drawn a lot of attention with the goal to improve the correction of joint deformities and component implantation, possibly leading to enhanced patient outcomes. This next evolution in surgical technology aims to make shoulder replacements more accurate and reproducible in both easy and challenging shoulders and usable by both low-volume and highly experienced surgeons.

Between 1st May 2021 and 31st August 2022, 539 consecutive patients who underwent 564 primary total hip arthroplasties were identified from the local registry database. Data were prospectively collected, and included patient demographics, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, surgical approach, robotic-assistance, Oxford Hip Score (OHS), EQ-5D-3L and EQ-VAS pre-operatively and at twelve months. Robotic-assistance, compared against manual total hip arthroplasty, was associated with an enhanced median (interquartile range) OHS (46 [42 – 48] vs 43 [36 – 47], p-value < 0.001), EQ-5D-3L (5 [5 – 7] vs 6 [5 – 8], p-value 0.002), and EQVAS (90 [75 – 95] vs 80 [70 – 90], p-value 0.003) at twelve months after surgery. Robotic-assistance was confirmed to be an independent predictor of a greater OHS at twelve months on a multivariate linear regression analysis (p-value 0.001). Robotic assistance was superior to manual total hip arthroplasty in enhancing patient reported outcomes at twelve months after surgery."

We review the surgical technique as well as clinical and economic results associated with the introduction of a commercially available robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty system (OMNIBotics®) in both an academic teaching and a community hospital setting. Clinical results demonstrate highly accurate and reproducible component placement and overall leg alignment, high patient satisfaction and knee functional outcomes as measured by the new Knee Society and KOOS scores, as well as a shortened length of stay and reduced 90-day readmission rates and overall episode of care costs when compared with manual intramedullary-based instrumentation."
pub.1148410045,Overview of Robotics in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (RATKA) has developed over the last three decades aiming to improve functional outcomes, patient satisfaction and implant survivorship by augmenting the accuracy of implant positioning and alignment over conventional jig-based arthroplasty. This is achieved by enhancing the accuracy of femoral and tibial bone cuts, to best restore a patient’s knee kinematics and soft tissue balance. A number of robotic systems exist, which operate differently and should be considered on their individual merits. This chapter explores the MAKO Robotic-Arm (Stryker Ltd., Kalamazoo, MI, USA), which is a semi-active robotic arm with a sawblade which acts within stereotactic boundaries as pre-defined in the pre-operative plan. There are five distinct steps involved in RATKA, with an associated learning curve. RATKA has shown to reduce periarticular soft tissue trauma, leading to reduced post-operative pain, earlier rehabilitation and improved early functional outcomes. These early advantages are yet to show improvements in long-term outcomes, which will become more apparent as the technology develops. There are substantial setup costs which cannot be overlooked, but is hoped will be recouped through improved outcomes in the long-term. Although questions remain, it is clear that robotic technology is the beginning of a revolution in total knee arthroplasty."

pub.1150448666,Robotic-Arm Assisted Technology’s Impact on Knee Arthroplasty and Associated Healthcare Costs,"Background: The number of total knee arthroplasties (TKA) carried out globally is expected to substantially rise in the coming decades. Consequently, focus has been increasing on improving surgical techniques and minimizing expenses. Robotic arm–assisted knee arthroplasty has garnered interest to reduce surgical errors and improve precision.  Objectives: Our primary aim was to compare the episode-of-care cost up to 90 days for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and TKA performed before and after the introduction of robotic arm–assisted technology. The secondary aim was to compare the volume of UKA vs TKA.  Methods: This was a retrospective study design at a single healthcare system. For the cost analysis, we excluded patients with bilateral knee arthroplasty, body mass index >40, postoperative infection, or noninstitutional health plan insurance. Costs were obtained through an integrated billing system and affiliated institutional insurance company.  Results: Knee arthroplasty volume increased 28% after the introduction of robotic-assisted technology. The TKA volume increased by 17%, while the UKA volume increased 190%. Post introduction, 97% of UKA cases used robotic arm–assisted technology. The cost analysis included 178 patients (manual UKA, n = 6; robotic UKA, n = 19; manual TKA, n = 58, robotic TKA, n = 85). Robotic arm–assisted TKA and UKA were less costly in terms of patient room and operating room costs but had higher imaging, recovery room, anesthesia, and supply costs. Overall, the perioperative costs were higher for robotic UKA and TKA. Postoperative costs were lower for robotic arm–assisted surgeries, and patients used less home health and home rehabilitation.  Discussion: Surgeons performed higher volumes of UKA, and UKA comprised a greater percentage of total surgical volume after the introduction of this technology. The selective cost analysis indicated robotic arm–assisted technology is less expensive in several cost categories but overall more expensive by up to $550 due to higher cost categories including supplies and recovery room.  Conclusions: Our findings show a change in surgeons’ practice to include increased incidence and volume of UKA procedures and highlights several cost-saving categories through the use of robotic arm–assisted technology. Overall, robotic arm–assisted knee arthroplasty cost more than manual techniques at our institution. This analysis will help optimize costs in the future."
pub.1107911768,Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Unicompartmental arthroplasty (UKA) is a highly effective treatment for isolated compartmental arthritis in the knee, especially among high volume surgeons. Implant loosening and technical problems related to bone resection and implant positioning may lead to higher rates of failure compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA), particularly for low volume and novice surgeons. Robotic-assisted UKA was developed in an effort to improve implant positioning and kinematics, reduce technical error, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Two semiautonomous robotic systems have demonstrated high levels of accuracy and precision compared to conventional techniques, quantify soft tissue balance, and preserve the bone by optimizing bony resections. Short-term clinical data is encouraging, but mid- and long-term data is needed to confirm that clinical benefits arise from the enhanced precision of robotic assistance. Cost-effectiveness and surgical efficiency continue to serve as barriers to more widespread adoption of robotic technology. Future study of mid- and long-term outcomes, as well as patient functional outcomes, will provide important insight into the cost-benefit analysis."

Five case studies were used to present the functionality of a novel robotic system in allowing intraoperative adjustments based on objective measures for several primary total knee arthroplasty cases. The robotic system allows the surgeon to drive every step of the case, turning the subjective nature of conventional knee replacement into a more objective and scientific approach for restoration of alignment, gap balancing, joint space restoration, femoral rotation, and Q-angle restoration. The robotic system allowed precise intraoperative adjustments, as demonstrated by these cases, and is a promising step towards more personalized total knee arthroplasty made possible by utilizing real-time objective measures."

Her symptoms are limited to the medial compartment and no longer respond to conservative treatment. One of the most promising aspects of robotic‐assisted knee arthroplasty is the achievement of more accurate component positioning by eliminating human error and variability. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the impact of robotic‐assisted surgery on the accuracy of final component position. With robotic‐assisted surgery, there is the potential for less invasive, more tissue‐friendly, and more patient‐specific surgical techniques. Evidence from RCTs has produced mixed results in terms of differences in operative time for robotic versus conventional TKA.

pub.1145900056,59 Robotic-Assisted Knee Replacement Surgery & Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Abstract  Aim An increasing proportion of knee arthroplasties are performed using robotic-assisted surgical techniques. While these techniques are associated with shorter lengths of stay, better patient outcomes and lower revision rates, the increase in intra-operative time and requirement for extra instrumentation, such as array pins, may lead to an increased risk of infection. Therefore, this review reports summary rates of surgical site infection (SSIs) in robotic-assisted knee arthroplasties.   Method The protocol for this review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane and CINAHL databases were searched from 2004 to November 2020 to reflect modern robotic surgical practice. The primary outcome was overall number of SSIs that occurred within one year of the primary operative procedure, which was sub-classified into either deep or superficial and pin-site infections. Risk of bias was assessed via the Cochrane RoB2 tool. Conventional Q and I2 tests for heterogeneity were performed with subsequent meta-analysis using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.   Results From 1052 studies identified, 17 were included, of which 13 were deemed to have an overall ‘low’ risk of bias. This review included 4400 unicompartmental and 1883 total knee arthroplasties. The summary rate of overall SSIs within one year of primary robotic knee arthroplasty was 0.568% (SE=0.183, 95% CI=0.209–0.927). This rate fell to 0.154% (SE=0.069, 95% CI=0.018–0.290) for deep infections and 0.347% (SE=0.109, 95% CI=0.133–0.561) for superficial and pin-site infections.   Conclusions The rates of surgical site infection were found to be low in robotic knee arthroplasty, however, further research is required to compare outcomes with conventional knee arthroplasty. "

pub.1117365285,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Robotic Arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted technology was introduced into orthopedic procedures nearly two decades ago with the hope of reducing human error by improving mechanical alignment and joint kinematics. Four robotic systems are approved variably for use in the United States today as technologies for improving implant precision in total knee, total hip, unicompartmental knee, and patellofemoral arthroplasty procedures. Although evidence has strongly supported significant improvements in radiographic outcomes, the long-term clinical benefits and their associated economic implications are not well defined. Further complicating matters, institutions considering the implementation of robotic-assisted systems should anticipate other potential associated costs (e.g., capital investments, maintenance fees, disposable costs, and preoperative imaging requirements) specific to the different platforms. These costs can add a significant financial burden to the overall value of these procedures depending on the negotiated financial agreement, robotic life span, and institutional case volume. Therefore, in order to remain economically feasible, these costs must be offset by high case volumes and improvements in outcomes. Given the current performance-based healthcare environment, it is crucial that clinicians ensure that value-based goals are achieved."

The purpose of this study was to further evaluate if robotic-assisted TKAs result in improved inpatient post-operative outcomes compared to conventional TKAs. Materials and Methods After IRB approval, a retrospective chart review of 100 robotic-assisted primary TKAs and 100 matched controls undergoing conventional TKA was performed. Patients underwent primary TKA from 2016 to 2018 with minimum 6-month postoperative follow-up by a single fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeon at a high-volume joint center. Exclusion criteria included <6 month postoperative follow-up, incomplete chart information, inflammatory arthritis, and BMI >40. Demographics and post-operative outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), opioid consumption, duration of opioid use, and discharge status, were recorded. Results There were no significant differences in pre-operative demographics between the two groups. A decrease in LOS (1.58 vs. 2.18 days, p < 0.001) and morphine equivalents (73.52 vs. 102.50, p = 0.017) was reported for the robotic TKA group compared to the control group. The robotic group also reported fewer patients at six weeks postoperatively requiring opioids compared to the control group (37 vs. 61, p = 0.001). Average KOOS Jr at 6-months postoperatively was 81.73 for the control group and 78.22 in the robotic group (p = 0.039). Conclusion Robotic-assisted TKA patients experienced significantly decreased LOS, morphine equivalents, and opioid usage at 6-week postoperatively, indicating that there are early clinical benefits of robotic-assisted TKA. No significant differences between the robotic and control groups were reported in pre-operative KOOS Jr. Although average 6-month postoperative KOOS Jr was slightly higher for the control group, the difference was clinically insignificant.

pub.1156322627,Robotic-Assisted Patellofemoral Arthroplasty,"Isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis is a common that commonly affects younger patients prior to onset of multicompartmental knee osteoarthritis. Operative management of patellofemoral osteoarthritis has developed significantly since its origins in the 1950s, as advances in operative techniques and implant designs have led to improved functional outcomes and implant survivorship. Patellofemoral arthroplasty has grown in popularity in recent years as it is less invasive in nature and offers improved patient function relative to total knee arthroplasty for younger, more active patients. As developments in robotic arm technologies have grown exponentially over the past decade, robotic-assisted patellofemoral arthroplasty has become an increasingly utilized intervention. There are few long-term follow up studies assessing outcomes due to the novelty of this technique, however, early data points toward benefit in component alignment and patient outcomes."
pub.1122138860,Interesting Cases in Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Introduction:
                  Robotic-arm assisted surgery allows for the execution of well-aligned knee arthroplasty regardless of pre-existing deformity. This case series is presented to show the utility of robotic-arm assisted TKA in achieving well-balanced, well-aligned results in a variety of challenging scenarios.
                  Methods:
                  We present seven challenging cases of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty. There were two conversion TKAs following a previous surgery. One case featured a previous tibial plateau fracture treated with a plate and screws construct while another featured a prior femoral nail with significant bony overgrowth. Five cases of severe deformity were also identified, with one tibial nonunion, two valgus knees and one patient with two varus knees due psoriatic arthritis treated with staged bilateral TKAs. Patient clinical history, physical examinations, intraoperative surgical techniques and postoperative courses were recorded.
                  Results:
                  All cases were able to utilize effective preoperative planning to obtain precise intraoperative bone cuts and component positioning. Each of the seven cases achieved well-balanced, well-aligned arthroplasties. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. At latest follow up, all patients showed significant improvements in pain and ambulation compared to preoperative exams.
                  Discussion:
                  Robotic-arm assisted surgery allows for the integration of preoperative CT scans to establish and execute a surgical plan with precision. Despite the complexity of these cases, excellent results were achieved without the need for revision-type components. These cases display the ability of robotic-arm assisted surgery to achieve consistent well-aligned results with minimal bone loss in challenging total knee arthroplasty cases."
pub.1117365281,General Concepts in Robotics in Orthopedics,"Robotic technology has been used to assist in orthopedic procedures since 1985. In recent years, this technology has rapidly expanded in its use. While available robotic technologies share a goal of optimizing precision and accuracy of bone preparation, there are different strategies to achieve these goals. Planning of bone preparation can be performed by creating a three-dimensional model based on a preoperative CT scan (so-called image-based technology), or it can be done entirely intraoperatively by mapping the condylar surfaces and tensioning the soft tissues after arthrotomy, without the need for a preoperative scan (image-free). The three types of robotic-assisted platforms – including autonomous, semiautonomous, and passive systems – allow varying degrees of surgeon control. Autonomous systems only require the surgeon to perform the initial planning, dissection, and approach, and the rest of the procedure can be completed without surgeon input. Conversely, the semiautonomous systems require surgeon involvement; however, they provide constraint to inhibit deviation from the planned operative procedure. Passive systems complete the entirety of the procedure under continuous and direct control of the surgeon, without providing protective feedback by the system. Finally, the current systems also provide safeguards against inadvertent bone preparation, by either constraining the robotic tool haptically or modulating the exposure and/or speed of the robotic bur. The aim of this chapter is to provide a discussion of these key distinguishing elements of current robotic systems available within the orthopedic armamentarium."

pub.1027324724,Robotics in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has become the standard procedure in the management of degenerative joint disease after conservative therapy options have been exhausted. However, despite conscientious planning and carefully performed procedures, surgeons are often unsatisfied with implant alignment. Various authors described significant axial or rotational malalignment, and mediolateral and ventrodorsal tilt.1–4 Seemingly small displacements of 2.5 mm potentially alter the range of motion by as much as 20°.5 None of the contemporary improvements in implant design and instrumentation has alleviated these problems.This led to the development of various robotic systems for improved precision in surgery. Robots are able to accurately position and move tools, thereby reducing human error. These systems rely on preoperative imaging, registration, and planning. The first clinical use was reported 1985 in the field of neurosurgery.6 Orthopedic surgeons started using robotic devices around 1992 for total hip arthroplasty.7 The active surgical robot CASPAR® (Computer-Assisted Surgical Planning and Robotics) was adapted for total hip and knee arthroplasty and for anterior cruciate ligament repair.8 The first robot-assisted knee replacement with this system was performed in March of 2000 in the Orthopedic Center Kassel. A total of 108 consecutive cases were operated on at this institution and followed-up for at least 5 years in a prospective study.9"
pub.1117365284,Perioperative Pain Management Protocols for Robotic-Assisted Knee and Hip Arthroplasty,"There have been significant advances in perioperative pain management in total and partial joint arthroplasty focused on multimodal pain control regimens. The primary goal of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) and partial knee arthroplasty (PKA) is to alleviate pain to maximize functionality and improve quality of life. However, surgery is associated with significant short-term pain. Failure to control postoperative pain results in decreased patient satisfaction, prolonged hospital stays, and increased healthcare costs. This chapter will review recent developments in perioperative pain management for hip and knee replacement including medications, preemptive analgesia, regional anesthesia, intra-articular injections, and postoperative protocols. In most circumstances, there are no significant alterations in perioperative pain management protocols, whether or not robotic assistance is utilized."

A three-dimensional reconstruction is processed from a lower limb CT scan of the patient and is used for preoperative and intraoperative planning. Using a navigation-based system established on infrared optical arrays, with stable sensors fixed to the patient’s femur and tibia, the surgeon is able to perform surgery with the assistance of a robotic arm that provides neurosensory haptic feedback for bone preparation. This system is based on the concept of patient-specific knee arthroplasty, based on the patient’s anatomy, allowing the surgeon to avoid overcorrection and components’ malalignment during implant placement.The sequence of five phases is the base of every Mako RA-UKA: system setting, preoperative planning and surgical setting, system registration, intraoperative planning and soft-tissue balancing, and finally haptically controlled bone preparation."

pub.1121303414,26 NAVIO Surgical System—Handheld Robotics,"Robotics-assisted arthroplasty has gained increasing popularity as orthopedic surgeons aim to increase the accuracy and precision of implant positioning. With advances in computer-generated anatomy data through image-free data collection, surgeons have the ability to better predict and influence surgical outcomes. Based on planned implant position and soft-tissue considerations, robotics-assisted systems can provide surgeons with planning tools to make informed decisions for knee replacement specific to the needs of the patient and with intelligent tools to implement those decisions. This is achieved by customizing the surgical cuts rather than prosthesis designs, while staying within clinically acceptable boundaries. Postoperative alignment of knee implants has been shown to influence patient outcomes in terms of implant longevity and functionality. The use of robotics in orthopedic surgery has helped to minimize human error, and in turn reduce implant wear and theoretically lead to longer prosthesis survivorship. This chapter provides a framework for the surgical techniques for using the NAVIO surgical system to perform partial and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The NAVIO system supports unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, patellofemoral knee arthroplasty, bicruciate retaining, cruciate-retaining or bicruciate sacrificing TKA."

Robodoc is an active-autonomous, image-based, robotic milling system which enables the surgeon to attain a consistently accurate implant component positioning. The Robodoc system is capable of achieving this through an image-based preoperative planning system which allows the surgeon to create, view and analyze the surgical outcome in 3D. The accuracy and precision of component positioning have been attributed to the following factors: (1) customized distal femoral resection; (2) accurate determination of the femoral rotational alignment; and (3) minimization of errors and maintenance of bone temperature with robotic milling. Despite all these advantages, there is still a paucity of long term, high-quality data that demonstrates the efficacy of Robodoc TKA. Questions regarding radiation risks, prolonged surgical duration and cost-effectiveness remain unanswered. The objectives of this chapter are to describe: (1) Robodoc surgical technique; (2) limitations and complications; and (3) clinical and radiological outcomes."
pub.1170784880,COMPUTER NAVIGATION AND ROBOTIC SURGERY DURING TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a successful treatment for knee osteoarthritis. The emphasis on optimal sizing and alignment of the components has led to an increase in the use of tools that allow for preoperative planning and verification of intraoperative steps. Computer navigation and robotic surgery have emerged as valuable tools for planning and performing surgery with greater precision and consistency. Objective. The aim of this paper is to organise information on the use of robotic systems in total knee arthroplasty based on own personal experience and analysis of contemporary literature sources. Methods. This study analysed professional articles that discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using robotic systems during knee arthroplasty. The information was obtained from electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar, with a search span of over 20 years. Computerised or navigation devices allow the surgeon to enter anatomical data via an interface and receive feedback on the alignment of the implant and the knee as a whole, but cannot be programmed to perform additional tasks. Currently, several patented systems are available, and rapid technological advances in computer processing power have allowed for the rapid development of robotic surgical systems. Robotic systems usually provide feedback similar to navigation systems, but they can also be programmed to assist in specific surgical tasks. It is expected that these systems will become more reliable and accurate in the future, potentially leading to a reduced role for physicians in certain aspects of the surgical process, limiting their involvement to supervision, and thus improving the workflow of the operating room. The integration of new technologies, such as mixed reality, which overlays simulated images on real-life images, is expected to further expand the range of capabilities of these devices. But for now, it is crucial to establish the long-term outcomes of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty as a process to determine the viability of widespread adoption of these devices."

Although unicompartmental knee arthroplasty may pose lower risk of perioperative complications and achieve better functional outcomes than total knee arthroplasty, a high degree of accuracy of implant positioning and soft tissue balance are required to optimize durability and implant survivorship. First-generation robotic technology improved substantially implant position compared with conventional methods; however, high capital costs, uncertainty regarding the value of advanced technologies, and the need for preoperative computed tomography scans were barriers to broader adoption. This article reviews the next-generation robotic technology—an image-free handheld robotic sculpting tool—which offers an alternative method for optimizing implant positioning and soft tissue balance without the need for preoperative computed tomography scans and with price points that make it suitable for use in an outpatient surgery center."

Despite advances over the last few decades, some patients continue to be dissatisfied with their arthroplasty. Component alignment has become a focus, as malalignment has persisted despite improvements in surgical technique. While technology such as navigation, patient-specific instrumentation (PSI), and robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) may enhance surgical execution, it remains unclear whether more accurate alignment can actually improve survivorship or patient satisfaction. At the current time, navigation, PSI, and RAS are more costly than conventional techniques. In order for more widespread adoption, incremental clinical gains and enhanced cost-effectiveness must be demonstrated. There are, however, specific cases where advanced technology has a role such as severe extra-articular deformities and obstruction of the femoral canal."
pub.1168708545,Evaluating the Cost of Robotic-assisted Total and Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"<h2>Purpose</h2> <p>As uptake of robotic-assisted arthroplasty increases there is a need for economic evaluation of the implementation and ongoing costs associated with robotic surgery. The aims of this study were to describe the in-hospital cost of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) and robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RA-UKA) and determine the influence of patient characteristics and surgical outcomes on cost.</p><h2>Methods</h2> <p>This prospective cohort study included adult patients (&ge;&thinsp;18 years) undergoing primary unilateral RA-TKA and RA-UKA, at a tertiary hospital in Sydney between April 2017 and June 2021. Patient characteristics, surgical outcomes and in-hospital cost variables were extracted from hospital medical records. Differences between outcomes for RA-TKA and RA-UKA were compared using independent sample t-tests. Logistic regression was performed to determine drivers of cost.</p><h2>Results</h2> <p>Of the 308 robotic-assisted procedures, 247 were RA-TKA and 61 were RA-UKA. Surgical time, time in the operating room, and length of stay were significantly shorter in RA-UKA (p&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001); whereas RA-TKA patients were older (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.002) and more likely to be discharged to in-patient rehabilitation (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.009). Total in-hospital cost was significantly higher for RA-TKA cases (<span>$</span>18,580.02 vs <span>$</span>13,275.38; p&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001). Robotic system and maintenance cost per case was <span>$</span>3,867.00 for TKA and <span>$</span>5,008.77 for UKA. Patients born overseas and lower volume robotic surgeons were significantly associated with higher total cost of RA-UKA. Increasing age and male gender were significantly associated with higher total cost of RA-TKA.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2> <p>Total cost was significantly higher for RA-TKA than RA-UKA. Robotic system costs for RA-UKA are inflated by the software cost relative to the volume of cases compared with RA-TKA. Cost is an important consideration when evaluating long term benefits of robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty in future studies to provide evidence for the economic sustainability of this practice.</p>"
pub.1117365286,Risks and Complications of Autonomous and Semiautonomous Robotics in Joint Arthroplasty,"Robotic systems have been introduced in orthopedic surgery to improve clinical outcomes. While there may be improved accuracy and decreased risk of outliers with robotic systems, there are also drawbacks to the usage of robot assistance. The main risks of the use of autonomous and semiautonomous robotic systems in joint arthroplasty are radiation exposure, pin-related complications, registration malfunction, potential soft tissue damage, and longer operating times. Image-based systems require a preoperative CT scan to pre-plan the surgery; therefore, patients are more exposed to radiation compared to conventional joint arthroplasty. Robot assistance relies on accurate registration of anatomic surface landmarks, using pins with reference arrays and markers. Registration malfunction may occur because of abnormal anatomy or system-related issues (e.g., software or marker dysfunction). Unnecessary soft tissue damage is another risk associated with the use of robotic systems, as the system only tracks bone and not soft tissues. Therefore, muscles and ligaments around the joint must be protected during the procedure to prevent damage, as is suggested by several studies. Finally, current literature shows that operating times are extended with the use of robot assistance, particularly with regard to total joint arthroplasty."
pub.1166283882,Robotic Systems in Knee Surgery: Current Concepts and Future Perspectives,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a successful and highly effective procedure in most patients with tricompartmental knee arthritis. Despite the innovations in surgical techniques due to planning software and technological innovations, patients’ dissatisfaction after TKA is still high, at up to 20%. Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) could be considered as a future option for improving outcomes due to its higher accuracy, precision, and reliability. Robotic systems can be classified as fully active, semi-active, or passive depending on the surgeon’s involvement during the procedure, and as imageless or image-based according to the necessity of radiological exams for the pre-operative planning. Three of the most well-known robotic systems for knee surgery are MAKO® (Stryker Ltd., Kalamazoo, MI, USA), NAVIO® (Smith & Nephew, Andover, TX, USA), and ROSA® (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA). These systems show differences in terms of surgeon involvement, the use of CT scans or X-rays for pre-operative planning, the possibility to perform both unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and TKA (or even total hip arthroplasty THA), and in the different kinds of knee prosthesis that can be implanted.

The purpose of this study is to report the midterm patient reported outcomes and survivorship of a computer-navigated TKA system with a robotic cutting guide. This patient cohort is the first IRB approved series of patients treated in the United States with this robotic knee system. This study serves as a midterm follow-up study on for this cohort, upon which learning curve, intra-operative efficiency, and deformity management were previously reported

With the ever-growing adoption of robotic technology in arthroplasty, we wished to evaluate its impact on LOS. The objectives of this study were to compare LOS and discharge disposition following robotic-arm assisted (RO THA) versus conventional technique Total Hip Arthroplasty (CO THA). This large-scale, single institution study included patients of any age undergoing primary THA (N = 1,732) for any cause between May 2019 and January 2023. Data extracted included patient demographics, LOS, need for Post Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU) admission, anaesthesia type, readmission within 30 days and discharge dispositions. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were also employed to identify factors and patient characteristics related to delayed discharge. The median LOS in the RO THA group was 54 hours (34, 78) versus 60 (51, 100) in the CO THA group, p<0.001. Discharge disposition was comparable between the two groups. In the multivariate model, age, need for PACU admission, ASA score > 2, female gender, general anaesthesia and utilisation of the conventional technique were significantly associated with LOS > 2 days. Our study showed that robotic-arm assistance was associated with a shorter LOS in patients undergoing primary THA and no difference in discharge destination. Our results suggest that robotic-arm assistance could be advantageous in partly addressing the upsurge of hip arthroplasty procedures and the concomitant health care burden; however, this needs to be corroborated by long-term cost effectiveness analyses and data from randomised controlled studies."

A 70-year-old woman with osteoarthritis underwent robotic-assisted bicruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty. At 8 months after surgery, persistent knee pain and swelling of the knee joint were noted after fall in knee. We diagnosed a failure between the femoral and tibial components following an ACL injury. Proximal ACL injury and spin out of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene were confirmed. We selected a constrained condylar knee prosthesis due to large bone attribution after femoral and tibial component removal. Postoperative three-dimensional computed tomography images suggested that excessive internal rotational alignment of the tibial component caused stress on the ACL."
pub.1168201664,Comparison of Short-term Results: Robotic-assisted vs. Conventional Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty," Introduction: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty is becoming widely accepted as a method to improve intra-operative measures and post-operative functional outcomes. While there is a large body of evidence supporting robotic-assisted unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA), few studies have examined the outcomes of this technology in simultaneous bilateral TKA procedures. Thus, the purpose of the study is to compare the clinical outcomes between patients undergoing simultaneous robot-assisted bilateral total knee arthroplasty (raTKA) versus conventional bilateral total knee arthroplasty (convTKA).   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 140 simultaneous bilateral TKA cases (61 conventional, 79 robot-assisted) performed by a single surgeon in a single institution from January 1, 2015 to December 11, 2020. The institution’s electronic medical records were reviewed for patient demographic information, operative data, and post-operative complications. Outcomes Based Electronic Research Database (OBERD) records were reviewed for patient-reported outcomes (Oxford Knee Score and SF-12 Version 1) preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.   Results:  Both raTKA and convTKA groups exhibited clinically relevant improvements beyond the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in SF-12 physical and Oxford Knee Scores at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-surgery. There were no statistically significant differences found between the two groups in terms of postoperative SF-12 scores, Oxford Knee Scores, complications, or revision rates. The raTKA group had a longer length of stay (2.6 versus 2.2 days, P =0.001) and a significantly different discharge disposition with more patients entering acute rehab compared to the convTKA group (20 versus 7 patients respectively, P =0.031).    Conclusion: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty has a non-inferior impact on short-term patient outcomes compared to conventional methods in patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty.

pub.1103702982,Robotics in Total Hip Arthroplasty—A Current Review,"Abstract
                  Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) is gaining popularity among surgeons and patients alike. This technology has been available clinically in some form for over two decades. This technology claims to improve component positioning, decrease complications, and improve clinical outcomes. Historical and modern systems have shown both advantages and disadvantages while assisting THA procedures. Robotic arms and milling systems have been utilized with both fully active and semi active technology platforms designed to perform or assist the surgeon with various portions of the procedure. The future design objectives include precise planning and even further improved consistent intraoperative execution. Robotics has proven to be beneficial, reliable, and cost effective in numerus other industries and is likely to continue to expand in the field of orthopaedic surgery. This article will review the historical and current technology being utilized for robotic-assisted THA."
pub.1166009323,Computer and Robotic Assisted Orthopaedic Knee Arthroplasty Surgery Who drives innovations?,"Computer assisted and Robotic technology in orthopaedic surgery is still not commonplace compared to un-assisted, conventional orthopaedic surgery. We analysed the relationship between patents and publications trend and question whether we could recognise a pattern which would confirm industry-driven innovation in orthopaedic surgery.
                  Following the same methodology used by Dalton et al. in 2016, we searched pubmed for publications between 1980 and 2018 concerning unicompartmental, patient specific instrumentation, navigation and robotic knee arthroplasty, and patents registered under the “knee arthroplasty” or “knee replacement” label over the same period. Data was plotted using 4 point moving averages.
                  Between 2004 and 2008, the number of publications regarding navigation multiplied by 20 following the number of patents registered during the same period. From 2008 onwards, the number of navigation publications declined while Patient Specific Instrumentation (PSI) publications increased also following patent investments from orthopaedic companies. Finally, robotic publications grew significantly pulled by massive patent registrations after 2012.
                  It seems that the industry has finally found a lucrative economical model after many years of trial and errors and sustained driving innovations."
pub.1013125709,"Bi-Unicompartmental, Robot-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty","Robot-assisted surgery has had a significant effect on modern arthroplasty in the United States. Extensive research has hinted at the potential of robotics to improve different aspects of surgery (eg, higher precision and associated favorable clinical outcomes). In addition to technical advances in surgery, there is also progress regarding knee implant design, for example, implants designed to obviate the need for sacrificing cruciate ligaments of the knee during surgery, which is believed to lead to preferable functional outcomes and more natural knee motion. Robotic assistance is considered valuable in this instance, owing to higher levels of accuracy and more accurate implant alignment. In this article, we summarize advantages and issues associated with robot-assisted surgery. We briefly discuss less-invasive, ligament-retaining surgery and alternatives to traditional total knee arthroplasty. We present preliminary data regarding patient-reported outcomes from total knee arthroplasty and a less-invasive alternative treatment. We also present the specific surgical technique used in our clinic (bi-unicompartmental knee arthroplasty), which combines the advantages of modern tissue-sparing multicompartmental knee arthroplasty and robot-assisted bone preparation."

Restoration of normal biomechanical functions and physiological hip restoration are key surgical goals for success of THA. Robotics is a recently tested method for advancing outcomes of THA. In this review, the advantages and disadvantages of robots’ use during THAs from a biomechanical standpoint are analyzed. It has been observed that analysis of revision ratesRevision rate, hip dislocationHip dislocation, accurate cup positioning, and implant design and placement plays a crucial role in biomechanical success. Additionally, robotics technologies are proven to have better precisionPrecision and cup placements when compared to surgeon-only THAs. Challenges faced for robotics’ use during THA include surgeon training, extended surgical hours, and economical costsEconomical costs. Analysis of dislocation and revision rates provides mixed results for robotics success during THAs; however, these mixed results can be due to factors such as surgeon’s success during the surgery, programming success of the robot for the particular application, and planning of the surgery noting that robots are shown to have successful precision in the literature."

Current semiautonomous and autonomous robotic systems have shown improvements in accuracy and reduction in alignment errors compared to conventional techniques. While some recent studies are beginning to show an impact on function, pain, and costs, the majority of available studies have not shown a link between accuracy and quantified soft tissue balance achieved with robotic assistance and a measurable influence on function or durability. Nonetheless, even with an equivalence of outcomes, robotic-assisted TKA will potentially redefine the emerging paradigm of TKA if costs can be controlled, efficiencies improved, and ergonomics enhanced."

Since the cutting force is reduced by this system, the displacement of the bone is minimized during the bone cutting process. Therefore it makes a possibility to fix the target bone using “safer” and “less-invasive fixation technique."
pub.1092939043,Lateral Approach in Robotic Assisted Knee Joint Arthroplasty,"Recently, computer-aided robotic systems, such as Robodoc® system and Makoplasty® system, have been used to enable surgeons to improve the accuracy of cutting and alignment in knee and hip arthroplasty [1,2,3]. The incision is normally done at the anterior part of the knee and the cutting is performed from the frontal direction during the TKA because enough working space of the tools is required during cutting process. Currently minimal invasive surgery (MIS) is the most popular keyword in the arthroplasty [4], and at this moment the MIS could not be performed common in the TKA using the robotic system. This MIS TKA could be achieved in lateral direction, and different cutting process also changes the robot configuration, which mainly affect the system accuracy. In this study, we investigated what additional advantages could be achieved in the bone cutting process laterally using laboratory-level less-invasive TKA surgical robot system.Copyright © 2011 by ASME"

The long-term outcomes of THA can be influenced by many factors including implant position. Suboptimal implant position has been associated with instability as well as accelerated bearing wear. Unfortunately, many manual aligning tools have not predictably improved alignment. Alternative strategies to improve implant alignment have evolved to include navigation as well as robotics. The initial experience was with active robotic systems with highly accurate and reproducible results. The past decade has seen the emergence of haptically guided systems that allow the surgeon to retain some control of component insertion.

With the recent introduction of robotic-assisted joint replacement, Computed tomography (CT) has become part of required pre-operative planning. The aim of this study is to quantify and characterise incidental CT findings, their clinical significance, and their effect on the planned joint arthroplasty. All consecutive patients undergoing an elective TJA (total joint arthroplasty; hip or knee) were retrospectively identified, over a 4-year period (December 2019 and November 2023). Data documented and analysed included patient demographics, type of joint arthroplasty, CT findings, their clinical significance, as well as potential delays to the planned arthroplasty because of these findings and subsequent further investigation. A total of 987 patients (female: 514 patients (52.1%)) undergoing TJA were identified (THA: 444 patients (45.0%); TKA: 400 patients (40.5%); UKA: 143 patients (14.5%)). Incidental findings within imaged areas were identified in 227 patients (23.0%). Of these findings, 74 (7.5%) were significant, requiring further investigation or management, 40 (4.1%) of which represented potential malignancy and 4 (0.4%) resulting in a new cancer diagnosis. A single patient was found to have an aneurysm requiring urgent vascular intervention. Surgery was delayed for further investigation in 4 patients (0.4%). Significant findings were more frequent in THA patients (THA: 43 (9.7%) TKA/UKA: 31 (5.7%) Within our cohort, 74 (7.5%) patients had significant incidental findings that required further investigations or management, with 4 (0.4%) having a previously undiagnosed malignancy.

pub.1009471915,Monitoring and robotizing shoulder arthroplasty for training and optimization of suturing techniques,"ObjectiveShoulder arthroplasty with a humeral head prosthesis is used to treat complex proximal humeral fractures, and the outcome depends on the placement and integrity of sutures. The object of this research is to determine the forces supported by sutural filaments that bind the tuberosities to the prosthesis in proximal humeral fractures. Knowledge of these forces facilitates comparison of different suturing strategies that may improve the surgical procedure and provide better outcomes.MethodA robotic workstation and a set of sensor modules were designed and built to emulate post-surgery rehabilitation geometry and forces with the required precision and repeatability. This system allows monitoring the forces supported by each sutural thread, as well as measurement of the millimeter scale displacements between the bone fragments produced postoperatively during rehabilitation movements. Several common suturing strategies carried out by orthopedists in shoulder arthroplasty with placement of a humeral head prosthesis were emulated using the robotic system.ResultsBased on in vitro laboratory experiments, the shoulder arthroplasty suture that supports higher strains was identified. The sutural band with maximum stress was not the same when the humerus is immobilized after surgery and in the postoperative rehabilitation phase.ConclusionThe robotic system for shoulder arthroplasty with humeral head prosthesis placement provides biomechanical insight with quantitative analysis of the force distribution regarding the suturing strategy used in the procedure. The suture most likely to fail early when increasing tension in the rotator cuff muscles is the one passed through both tuberosities. The clinical significance of these findings is identification of the need to avoid shortening the humeral height or increasing retroversion in this procedure."
pub.1103198869,Robotic Primary and Revision THA for the Femoral Side,"Robot-assisted THA for femoral side is one of the oldest appreciations of robotics in orthopedic surgery. The first active robotic system, ROBODOC, has been used in many countries. Originally, it utilized pin-based registration system and required locator pin implantation in the patient femur before THA. Subsequently, non-pin-based surface registration technique was developed, which eliminated the need for pin implantation and pin-related complications. Besides the function of femoral milling during primary THA, this system can also selectively remove bone cement from the femoral canal during revision THA. Although one study shows a higher revision rate of robotic femoral surgery than a conventional technique, many studies show accurate femoral preparation, same or slightly better postoperative function, better alignment of the stem, less fat embolism, less stress shielding, and a lower incidence of femoral fracture by using the robot than conventional techniques."

Robotic THA has been shown to be superior in restoring the centre of rotation, combined anteversion, offset and leg length, which are critical surgeon-controlled variables that influence postoperative outcomes. Furthermore, robotic THA has been associated with a reduced length of stay and a trend towards a reduced risk of peri-operative complications. Limitations of robotic THA include the substantive installation costs, learning curve, additional radiation exposure and the limited compatible implants. The potential of this technology is immense and as more data emerge, we will be able to ascertain the impact of robotics on revision rates and long-term functional and patient-reported outcomes."
pub.1163497854,A detailed retrospective analysis of time taken in conventional total knee arthroplasty and comparision with navigation assisted total knee arthroplasty,"Introduction: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a prevalent procedure for alleviating pain and restoring joint function in patients with knee joint deterioration. Navigation-assisted robotic total knee arthroplasty (NARTKA) is an emerging technique aiming to improve surgical precision and patient outcomes. Concerns regarding prolonged surgery duration and associated morbidities have driven interest in advanced technologies. This study investigates the impact of robotic assistance on surgery time, focusing on NARTKA and its additional steps.Methodology: A retrospective study was conducted at Apollo Hospitals Chennai from January to June 2023, involving 60 patients who underwent conventional or NARTKA. Only experienced surgeons (≥ 15 years) were included. The study aimed to compare surgical time between conventional TKA and NARTKA, as well as analyze time consumption in various NARTKA steps.Results: Comparative analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in mean time between Incision time, Bone pin time, Bone registration time, Balancing time, Bone preparation time, Implant trial time, and Final implantation time in robotic TKA (P=0.891). Similarly, there was no significant difference in time between Incision time and final implantation time between Conventional TKA and Robotic TKA (P=0.219).Conclusion: While NARTKA shows slightly extended surgical duration compared to traditional TKA, the difference is not significant for highly experienced surgeons. Areas for improvement include bone registration and ligament balancing, which could enhance efficiency. Modifications to navigation-assisted robotic equipment and improved training for surgical staff are crucial. As technology evolves, advanced methods may outpace traditional approaches in terms of speed."
pub.1174127692,Mid-Flexion Instability in Total Knee Arthroplasty: Insights from Robotic-Assisted Surgery,"Despite technological advancements with robotic-assisted surgery, instability remains a challenge in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Mid-flexion instability (MFI) has been reported to cause patient dissatisfaction. With no universal diagnostic criteria, the MFI concept is still ambiguous, and no specific treatment algorithm is defined. This study aims to analyze the MFI concept and risk factors and investigate how robotic surgery, compared to manual TKA, could impact the MFI concept. A comprehensive investigation of the current literature regarding MIF, focusing especially on its relationship with robotic surgery TKA, was conducted using the PubMed and Scopus databases. The MIF concept remains poorly understood, so it is crucial to prevent it by recognizing risk factors, which are technique-related, implant-related, and patient-related. Since robotics offers optimal balancing in TKA and reduces causes affecting MFI, it could indirectly impact and prevent this complication. This review suggests that robotics utilization improving TKA balancing has the potential to impact and reduce MFI. However, further research in this area is essential to provide insight regarding the role of robotics in mitigating the MFI risk."

This study reports on the less documented knee kinematics and kinetics of uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) patients during walking as a secondary outcome measure of a RCT between a fixed bearing UKA robotic procedure versus a mobile bearing UKA manual procedure.
                  Three dimensional, instrumented, gait analysis was performed 5 years after 49 medial osteoarthritis UKA patients received surgery. 27 were randomised to receive a robotic assisted UKA and 22 to receive a manual implant surgery.
                  The robotic assisted group showed a significant increased range of motion in stance during walking. 59% of the robotic assisted group achieved a bi-phasic sagittal knee moment, in comparison of 50% of the manual group. Significantly higher peak values of the varus knee and internal rotation moments were measured for the robotic assisted group during early and late section of the gait cycle, respectively. This indicates that larger normalised forces are applied through the knee during flat ground walking in the robotic assisted group.
                  The robotic assisted group showed biomechanical benefits over the manual group for walking tasks. Poor fixation outcomes are avoided in patients with normal knee moments."

With the growth of robotics, we must determine if the proposed benefits are worth the increased cost. The purpose of this study was to evaluate inpatient post-operative and post-discharge outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery vs. conventional manual instrumentation, specifically time to discharge, discharge status and opioid consumption post- operatively. Knee Injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) was calculated for each group as well.
                  After IRB approval, a retrospective chart review of 100 robotic assisted primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 100 matched controls undergoing conventional TKA was performed. Baseline demographics were recorded as well as post-operative outcomes including length of stay, opioid consumption, discharge status and duration of opioid use. All patients underwent primary TKA from 2016-2018 with minimum 6- month follow-up by a single fellowship trained arthroplasty surgeon at a high-volume joint center. Exclusion criteria included < 6 month f/u, incomplete chart information, inflammatory arthritis, BMI >40.
                  Patients had similar pre-operative demographics including age, BMI, gender, opioid use and baseline depression rates. The robotic assisted TKA group had statistically significant decreased LOS (1.58 vs. 2.18 p< 0.001) and morphine equivalents during their hospital stay (73.52 vs. 102.50 p< 0.02). The robotic group had fewer patients at six weeks requiring opioids (37 vs. 61 p=0.001). Six month post- operative KOOS was 81.73 in the control group and 78.22 in the robotic group, (P>0.05).
                  Robotic-assisted TKA was associated with statistically significant decreased hospital LOS, morphine equivalents, and opioid usage at the 6-week follow up appointment.

pub.1103196813,Robotic UKA,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a reliable, although technically challenging, treatment option for osteoarthritis. Successful clinical outcomes depend on accurate implant placement, lower limb alignment, and soft tissue balance intraoperatively. Robot-assisted systems aim to improve the surgical accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of clinical outcomes. Semi-active UKA systems with a minimally invasive approach have been developed and are becoming more interesting. These robotic systems can be either image-based or imageless. Recently, two robotic systems have been approved for UKA by the US Food and Drug Administration: the MAKO Robotic Arm, which is an image-based system, and the Navio Precision Free-Hand Sculptor (PFS), which is an image-free system. Several studies have shown that robotic UKA offers greater accuracy of the mechanical axis, implant positioning, and soft tissue balance than conventional UKA. They concluded that robot-assisted UKA achieved more reproducible, accurate, and precise bone cuts, suggesting that the system could improve surgical survivorship. Although robot-assisted UKA has a high capital cost, some studies have shown that it is cost-effective under the following conditions: (1) centers must perform at least 94 cases annually in (2) patients younger than age 67 years, and (3) the 2-year revision rate does not exceed 1.2%. Thus, these early results and cost-effectiveness analyses seem promising. The limitation of robotic surgery may be the longer learning curve regarding the operative time, although some studies reported that the robot-assisted UKA system significantly decreased the learning curve over that required for UKA with traditional instrumentation."

Operative times, implant positioning, reoperations and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS; Oxford Knee Score, EuroQol-5D, and Forgotten Joint Score) were recorded. There was a learning curve of 11 cases with the system that was associated with increased operative time (13 minutes, p<0.01) and improved insert sizing over time (p=0.03). There was no difference in implant survival (98.2%) between learning and proficiency phases (p = 0.15), and no difference in survivorship between ‘high’ and ‘low’ usage surgeons (p = 0.23) at 36 months. There were no differences in PROMS related to the learning curve. This suggested that the learning curve did not lead to early adverse effects in this patient cohort. The introduction of a robotic-arm assisted UKA system led to learning curves for operative time and implant sizing, but there was no effect on patient outcomes at early follow- up. The short learning curve was independent of UKA usage and indicated that robotic-arm assisted UKA may be particularly useful for low-usage surgeons."
pub.1021424799,Advantages of a Cementless Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Approach,"Medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a procedure designed for resurfacing the medial compartment in isolated medial compartment degenerative joint disease. Many long-term studies have reported the success of UKA. Despite recent interest and isolated reports of success, significant issues still exist today with early failure in UKA. Medial UKA is a promising alternative to total knee arthroplasty for isolated medial compartment degenerative joint disease. Potential advantages of this treatment option compared with total knee arthroplasty include improved patient satisfaction, more consistent return to sporting activities, quicker recovery, decreased complication risk, and greater range of motion. With the introduction of robotic arm tools to help improve accuracy and reliability of implant position, we may be able to decrease failure rates in UKAs. In addition, cementless technologies are promising approaches to improve the durability of UKA fixation. Robotic arm techniques coupled with cementless fixation strategies may dramatically reduce the incidence of aseptic loosening in UKA."
pub.1172649640,Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Should Surgeons Be Wearing Ear Protection During Primary Total Joint Arthroplasty?," Background: The risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) to orthopedic surgeons due to occupational exposures is unknown. A level of 85 decibels (dB) over an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) is considered hazardous.   Question/Purpose: We sought to identify whether manual and/or robotic arthroplasty procedures increase surgeons’ risk of developing NIHL.   Methods:  At our institution, we prospectively collected intraoperative recordings with a microphone attached to the surgeon during manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA), manual total hip arthroplasty (THA), and robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA). Recordings taken in the operating room without operating room staff present served as baseline controls. The 172 recordings consisted of 46 baseline, 42 THA, 40 TKA, and 44 RTKA recordings. Decibel levels were reported as “maximum dB level” (the highest sound pressure level using an A-weighted dB scale), “LA eq ” (the equivalent continuous sound level), “LC peak ” (the peak sound pressure level using a C-weighted dB scale), and “TWA” (the average dB level projected over an 8-hour period). The percentage of allowable daily noise dose was reported as “dose” and the measured dose projected over 8 hours as “projected dose.”    Results: The recordings of surgeries had average maximum dB levels ranging from 106.0 to 108.0 dB, all significantly greater than controls. Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasties had the highest average dose (18.7%) and average projected dose (252.0%).   Conclusions: Our review of recordings at a single institution found that noise levels of RTKAs surpassed projected doses of 100%. Orthopedic surgeons performing more than 2 RTKAs per day may be at increased risk of NIHL. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of measures such as ear protection to minimize surgeons’ exposure. "
pub.1175987476,Comparison of learning curves and short-term outcomes: ROSA versus MAKO robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty," Background: With increasing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures performed in the US and improved techniques, robotic-assisted TKA has become more common. While current evidence supports the MAKO robotic arm system in TKA, fewer studies exist regarding the newer ROSA knee system, its learning curve, and clinical outcomes.   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 210 consecutive robotic-assisted TKA cases (95 ROSA, 115 MAKO) performed by a single surgeon at a single institution from February 7, 2017 to April 15, 2022. Patient demographics, operative data, and post-operative complications were collected. Additionally, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (Oxford Knee Score, SF-12 Version 1, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement) were collected preoperatively and postoperatively (6 mo and 1 y).   Results:  Steady state was reached at 9 cases in the ROSA group and at 6 cases in the MAKO group. The ROSA group’s operative time was statistically significantly longer than the MAKO group (97 vs. 91 mins, P =0.023). There were no significant differences between the ROSA and MAKO groups in terms of tourniquet use or patellar resurfacing. There were no statistically significant differences found between the two groups for PROs, 90-day complications, or all-time revision rates.    Conclusions: ROSA and MAKO robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty both have minimal learning curve lengths of 9 and 6 cases, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative outcomes between the two robotic-assisted systems through 1-year post-surgery. "
pub.1118066507,Does Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty Improve Accuracy of Cup Positioning?,"Abstract
                  Acetabular component malpositioning is a frequent cause of complications in total hip arthroplasty including instability, increased wear, osteolysis, impingement, and revision surgery. Recently, robotics and navigation have been introduced to improve cup positioning in total hip arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of postoperative acetabular component positioning using MAKO robotic-assisted versus manual acetabular component placement. A consecutive series of 100 total hip replacements were performed in 100 patients. The first 50 were performed using manual techniques, while the second 50 were performed using MAKO-guided acetabular component placement. Postoperative anteroposterior pelvis radiographs were used to determine the postoperative anteversion and inclination of the cup relative to the goal of 15 and 45°, respectively. In the manual group, the average anteversion and inclination was 14.3 and 44.2°, respectively, with 28% within 5° and 82% within 10° of the goal alignment, respectively. In the robotic group, the average anteversion and inclination was 15.1 and 45.6°, respectively, with 54 and 88% within 5 and 10° of the goal alignment, respectively. This equated to a statistically significant improvement in the number of acetabular components placed within 5° of the target alignment with the use of robotic guidance (p = 0.0142). From the authors' study, they were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in acetabular component alignment with the use of robotic techniques. Additional studies are needed to demonstrate improvement in clinical outcomes as a result of improved accuracy and precision of acetabular component placement."
pub.1009083059,Robotic Patellofemoral Replacement,"Patellofemoral arthritis is a relatively rare and challenging disease. Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) can be an effective treatment; however, its use remains somewhat controversial due to its high failure rates and variable results. There have been numerous studies published in the literature regarding first- and second-generation implant designs. The evolution of implant design, surgical technique, and patient selection has resulted in better midterm outcomes using second-generation designs. For the younger, more active population, PFA provides an alternative to total knee arthroplasty that allows patients to increase their activity level and decrease pain. PFA is a promising alternative to total knee arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral arthritis. Although first-generation implants were associated with high failure rates at midterm follow-up, second-generation implants have yielded more positive and promising midterm results. Surgical indications and patient selection are crucial to minimize poor results. In addition, new technologies such as computer navigation and robotics have shown favorable good short-term results. Robotic-assisted second-generation designs are promising approaches to improve implant positioning and good midterm follow-up."
pub.1095158222,MBARS: Mini Bone Attached Robotic System for Joint Arthroplasty,"A mini bone attached robotic system (MBARS, see Fig. 1) was developed for shaping of the bone cavity in joint arthroplasty. While the system is designed for a general use in joint replacement procedures, the initial implementation was for Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) procedure. The current application is image-based, with the plans to develop an image-free approach in which all data collection and planning is performed intra-operatively in the robot coordinate system, eliminating the need for external tracking in the operating room. Experiments conducted using the first MBARS prototype supported the feasibility of the approach. The applied methodology could be extended to other orthopaedic procedures to improve the accuracy and operational time. Moreover, it enables use of the next generation, more anatomically shaped implants and related minimally invasive surgical procedures."
pub.1024722960,Surgical Tool Based Preoperative Planning System for Total Hip Arthroplasty,"In preoperative planning of total hip arthroplasty, a type, a size and a place of a femoral stem is planned on plane radiographs or computed tomography images. However, the shape of the natural medullary cavity of the femur on these images differs from a prepared one expanded with reamers and rasps to insert the stem. This difference makes it hard to select an appropriate stem and its position without imagining behavior of surgical tools. In this paper, we propose a surgical tool based preoperative planning system for total hip arthroplasty to obtain a minimally invasive position of the stem."

Method We systematically searched on four databases till September 2021. The outcomes were pooled as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) or risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence interval. We used RevMan to perform the analysis.   Results There were 22 included studies. There were no significant differences between the robotic-assisted UKA and the conventional one in satisfaction rate (RR=1.05, 95% CI [0.98, 1.14], p=0.19), complication rate (RR=0.62, 95% CI [0.32, 1.19], p=0.15), and range of motion (MD= -0.23, 95% CI [-5.76, 5.30], p=0.93). However, robotic-assisted UKA showed significant favouring in the outliers of limb alignment (RR= 0.46, 95% CI [0.29, 0.74], p=0.001). On the other hand, the conventional UKA had better surgical time than the robotic assisted one (MD=20.89, 95% CI [11.87, 29.90], p<0.00001).   Conclusions There were mainly no significant differences between robotic-assisted UKA and the conventional one in several outcomes such as the satisfaction rate, complication rate, and others. However, robotic-assisted UKA significantly favoured outliers of tibial alignment, and outliers of limb alignment, but prolonged surgical time than the conventional group. "
pub.1100623053,New and evolving technologies for knee arthroplasty—computer navigation and robotics: state of the art,"Computer-assisted navigation was introduced as an adjunct to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with the potential of improving positioning and alignment of TKA implants. Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) can be divided into: passive (navigated TKA) or semiactive and active (robotic TKA). Passive CAS has shown improved results regarding alignment in TKA compared with conventional instrumentation but it has several possible complications such as registration errors, pin site complications, increased surgical time and a potentially longer learning curve. Robotic TKA has been developed to eliminate the possible error in the preparation of bone surfaces by the surgeon. There is still little evidence on these systems but the early results are encouraging. Despite better results in accuracy with both CAS systems, clinical benefits are still subject of debate. Additional research is required to fully define the costs and benefits of robotics in regular medical practice."

pub.1105582399,Does robotic-arm assisted total hip arthroplasty benefit short-term clinical outcomes? A pair match-controlled study,"Recent advances have made robotic assistance a viable option in total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the clinical outcomes of this procedure relative to THA without robotic assistance have yet to be reported. This study presents short-term outcomes of robotically assisted THA compared to a pair-matched control group of patients that underwent THA without robotic assistance.
                  Data were prospectively collected on all THAs performed from July 2011 to January 2015. Patients were included if they underwent primary THA treating idiopathic osteoarthritis and were eligible for minimum two-year follow-up. Outcomes were measured using Harris Hip Score (HHS), the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12), pain on a visual analog scale (VAS), and satisfaction from 0-10. Patients that underwent THA with robotic assistance were matched 1:1 with THA patients without robotic assistance for age, sex, BMI, and approach.
                  There were 85 patients in each study group. There were no significant differences in the demographic factors matched for. Both HHS and FJS-12 were significantly higher in the robotic assistance group at minimum two-year follow-up. VAS was lower in the robotic assistance group, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.12). There was a not a significant difference in patient satisfaction. There was no significant difference in the rate of postoperative complications or subsequent revisions between groups.
                  Robotically assisted THA is safe and may lead to superior short-term outcomes compared to THA without robotic assistance."

And no functional difference were found between two knee alignment methods durning walking."
pub.1122138893,Robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty improves precision and delivers early outcomes superior to manual approach,"Haptic robotic-arm assisted technology improves accuracy in unicompartmental knee replacement through utilizing a preoperative 3-D plan, optical navigation for real-time intraoperative feedback on soft tissue laxity, and robotic arm for precise bone preparation. This technology became clinically available for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in 2016. We present outcomes from the early adoption of this technique.
                  A retrospective chart review compared data from the first 120 robotic-arm assisted TKAs performed December 2016 through July 2018 to the last 120 manually instrumented TKAs performed May 2015 to December 2016, prior to robotic technology adoption.
                  Robotic surgery was associated with significantly increased anesthesia (212 vs 187 mins, p < 0.01) and operative (135 vs 112 minutes, p < 0.01) time. The robotic group had a lower hospital length-of-stay (2.7 vs. 3.4 days, p < 0.001). Discharge to home was not statistically different between robotic and manual groups (89% vs. 83%, p = 0.2). Robotic technology was associated with decreased variability in implant positioning, with smaller variances in the lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA; 3.5 vs 6.6 degrees, p < 0.01) and posterior tibial slope (1.8 vs. 5.3 degrees, p < 0.01). Mean limb alignment, as measured by tibiofemoral angle, was slightly less valgus in the robotic group (3.9 vs 4.4 degrees, p = 0.09). Postoperative range of motion was significantly increased for robotic-arm assisted TKA patients, with less flexion contracture at 2-weeks (1.8 vs. 3.3 degrees, p < 0.01), 7-weeks (1.0 vs. 1.8 degrees, p < 0.01), and 3-months (0.6 vs 2.1 degrees, p = 0.02) post-surgery.

The robotic-assisted cohort yielded a similar mean skin-to-skin surgical time of 80.35 minutes compared to 79.35 minutes for the manual cohort (p=0.8895), along with a shorter hospital stay of 0.96 days compared to 1.59 days (p<0.0001). The robotic-assisted cohort resulted in a lower blood loss of 199.8 cc compared to 310.1 cc for the manual cohort (p<0.0001). Standard deviation for incision length was 81% of the value in robotic-assisted cases when comparing with manual cases (2.2 cm vs. 2.7cm). Robotic-assisted THA cases demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with a higher 6-week postoperative HHS (81.0 vs. 78.4), physical VR-12 (39.5 vs. 35.9), and LEAS (9.2 vs. 8.0). The EQ-5D treatment effect size at 6-weeks postoperative for robotic-assisted cases exceeded a large effect with a value of 0.91, while the effect size for manual cases was 0.59. Robotic-assisted 3-D patient specific planning and haptically guided robotic-assisted surgical execution demonstrated an improved operative experience relative to blood loss, and incision length. The robotic cohort also yielded improved early clinical and functional outcomes when comparted to manual techniques at six weeks. These early, enhanced robotic-assisted THA results support surgeons using robotics with the goals of decreased patient pain, greater range of motion, and increased joint stability."

As robotic technology evolves, its application in knee replacement surgery holds potential for better therapeutic effects and advancements toward more accurate, safe, and efficient procedures, benefiting patients and advancing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA)."
pub.1003185910,The Use of ROBODOC in Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are successful procedures in terms of restoring patient mobility and relieving pain. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the importance of restoring knee alignment in achieving long term clinical results. Similarly, successful hip replacement requires strong osseointegration, restoration of offset, leg length, and version to prevent complications. Computer navigation and robotic systems have been developed to increase implant placement accuracy and achieve improved long term results. ROBODOC was the first active robotic system created to be used in orthopaedic surgery. Its design is based on computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM). Each case is preoperatively planned using CT scans and then ROBODOC precisely executes the plan on the bone. Initial studies, however, showed increased surgical time and blood loss. Subsequent improvements of the device have reduced or eliminated these concerns. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that ROBODOC’s ability to place implants within the bone according to the preoperative plan is greatly improved over a conventional manual technique and that outliers have been virtually eliminated."

The postoperative Harris score and FJS score were higher, and the VAS score was lower in the robotic-assisted group compared to the conventional group.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Robotic-assisted THA demonstrates advantages in intraoperative precision and postoperative efficacy in treating patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip compared to the conventional manual approach.</p>"
pub.1174609432,Robotic Arm–Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Results in Smaller Femoral Components and Larger Tibial Baseplates Than the Manual Technique,"Background Robotic systems for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may utilize computed tomography three-dimensional modeling and intraoperative ligamentous balancing data to assist surgeons with implant size and position. This study evaluated the effect of such robotic systems on implant selection. Methods We reviewed 645 TKAs performed with a single prosthetic design at 2 academic medical centers between 2016 and 2022. A robotic system was utilized in 304 TKAs, 341 were conventionally instrumented. Implant sizing was compared between cohorts. Multivariate analyses assessed for confounding and effect modification on the basis of demographics. Results The 2 cohorts exhibited no significant differences in age (P = .33), weight (P = .29), or race (P = .24). The robotic-arm cohort had fewer women (58.9% vs 66.7% P = .04) and was taller on average (66.3 in vs 65.0 in P < .001). Mean polyethylene liner thickness was larger in the manual cohort (10.3 robotic and 10.6 manual; P < .00). On multivariate analysis, robotic-arm TKAs had larger tibial components (P < .001) and smaller femoral components (P = .017). Conclusions Robotic-arm assisted TKA with computed tomography–based three-dimensional planning was associated with a larger mean tibial component size and a smaller mean femoral component size when compared to conventionally instrumented TKAs. Observed differences likely reflect differences in the data informing implant size selection; effects on clinical outcomes warrant further study."
pub.1155990184,Is robotic assistance more eye-catching than computer navigation in joint arthroplasty? A Google trends analysis from the point of public interest,"<p>Computer-assisted navigation system (CAS) and robotic assisted surgery (RAS) have been widely used in joint arthroplasty, but few studies focused on public interest. We aimed to evaluate current trend and seasonality of public interest in CAS and RAS arthroplasty over the past 10 years, and forecast the future development. All data related to CAS or RAS arthroplasty from January 2012 to December 2021 were collected through Google Trends. Public interest was described by relative search volume (RSV). Pre-existing trend was evaluated by linear and exponential models. Time series analysis and ARIMA model were utilized to analyze the seasonality and future trend. R software 3.5.0 was for statistics analysis. Public interest in RAS arthroplasty has been continuously increasing (P &lt; 0.001) and exponential model (R<sup>2</sup>=0.83, MAE=7.35, MAPE=34%, RSME=9.58) fitted better than linear one (R<sup>2</sup>=0.78, MAE=8.44, MAPE=42%, RSME=10.67). CAS arthroplasty showed a downtrend (P&lt;0.01) with equivalent R<sup>2</sup> (0.04) and accuracy measures (MAE=3.92, MAPE=31%, RSME=4.95). The greatest popularity of RAS was observed in July and October, while the lowest was in March and December. For CAS, a rise of public interest was in May and October, but lower values were observed in January and November. Based on ARIMA models, the popularity of RAS might continuously increase and nearly double in 2030, along with a stability with slight downtrend for CAS. Public interest in RAS arthroplasty has been continuously increasing and seems to maintain this uptrend in the next 10 years, whereas popularity of CAS arthroplasty will likely remain stable.</p>"
pub.1175168523,1016 Qualitative Account of an Arthroplasty Elective Experience at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York,"Abstract  Aim Junior doctors applying for Core Surgical Training are awarded points for completing a surgical elective. As a final year medical student in 2023, I travelled to The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York, at the Complex Joint Reconstruction Centre for four-weeks. I aim to showcase the benefits of travelling abroad for UK medical students interested in orthopaedic surgery.   Method This is a qualitative account of my experiences working with attendings and research fellows in the Complex Joint Reconstruction Centre at HSS.   Results I attended clinics and scrubbed into theatres using a variety of innovative robotic technology in knee arthroplasty, including robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty (Mako Smart Robotics™ and ROSA® Knee System) and computer-assisted technology (Intellijoint KNEE® Surgical Inc, Kitchener, Ontario). I was actively involved in departmental research meetings, drafting two case reports in cementing techniques to improve Varus-Valgus alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). I attended 3D printing workshops which produced custom-implants for complex revision cases.   Conclusions An elective at HSS gave me an insightful experience with furthering my understanding of complex orthopaedic conditions, taught by pioneering orthopaedic surgeons in the USA. I broadened my experience in Trauma & Orthopaedics, which has allowed me to make a more informed decision in pursuing this specialty. I encourage medical students and junior doctors to pursue similar experiences to further their passion for orthopaedic surgery. "
pub.1040935158,Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty has become a common procedure for treatment of severe osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and post-traumatic arthritis. In the past, failure of total knee arthroplasty was commonly attributable to aseptic loosening, often associated with component malalignment, soft tissue imbalance. With improved surgical instrumentation and soft tissue balancing techiniques, failure secondary to mechanical loosening has been minimal. But surgeons are still dissatisfied with implant malalignment. Correct tibiofemoral alignment seems to be particularly important since it is generally agreed that axial deviation and imprecise implantation may lead to loosening of the implant component. Navigation systems and robotic techniques could potentially solve problems of imprecision in traditional total knee arthroplasty. It is expected that the success rate and longevity of total knee arthroplasty will be improved during the twenty first century."
pub.1156068737,Computer-assisted robotic system for autonomous unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Robotic-assisted technology has proven to enhance the accuracy of bone resection and implant placement. However, robotic-assisted technology suffers from slow speed and high cost. Moreover, usually surgeries require the performance of radioactive scans. Therefore, the aim of this research is to build a low-cost autonomous system to perform rUKA (robotic Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty). A novel image-free registration process has been developed to eliminate the need for radioactive scans. Additionally, a CNC machine was built to perform autonomous resection. The proposed system was tested on a set of artificial tibia bones, and analysing their surfaces of the proposed system on the tibia bones was compared to Mako and BlueBelt systems. Mean error of the tibial resections was 1.9 mm compared to 2.87 mm for the Mako system, and 3.07 mm for the BlueBelt. The maximum error for the proposed system was 2.9 mm compared to 4.99 mm in the Mako and 4.5 mm in BlueBelt.

Literature in the past has demonstrated that reducing the joint line can result in greater failure rates.</p><h2>Methods:</h2> <p>This is a Prospective cohort investigation of patients who had medial UKA between March 2017 and March 2022.All patient&rsquo;s preoperative and postoperative radiological joint line assessments were examined by two observers by Weber's methods. Robotic-assisted UKA performed with hand-held image-free robots was compared to conventional UKA groups.</p><h2>Results</h2> <p>The distal position of the femoral component was higher in Group B utilizing conventional tools than in Group A employing robotic-assisted UKA. This positional difference was statistically significant. The mean difference among the pre-operative and post-operative joint lines in Group A was 1.6&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;0.49 (range 0.8mm to 2.4mm), while it was 2.47&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;0.51 (range 1.6mm to 3.9mm) (p 0.005) in Group B. In Group A, a greater percentage of the subjects (64%) attained a femoral component position within two millimeters from the joint line, whereas just 18% in Group B did.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>When compared with the conventional UKA technique, the meticulous attention to detail and planning for ligament rebalancing when using the Robotic-assisted UKA technique not solely enhance surgical precision for implant placing but additionally provides excellent native joint line restoration and balancing. For validation of its longevity and survivability, the cohort must be tracked for a longer period of time.</p>"

pub.1038541754,A Non-CT Based Total Knee Arthroplasty System Featuring Complete Soft-Tissue Balancing,"The postoperative result of a total knee arthroplasty strongly depends on surgical performance. Since the classical instrumentation does not allow the surgeon to find the optimal positions of components in any situation and to perform an adequate ligament balancing, we developed a non-CT based computer-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty system. The system contains four main parts: the anatomy registration, the soft-tissue balancing navigation, the planning, and the resections navigation part. The registration of the patient anatomy allows the alignment of the prosthesis component according to the mechanical axis. Beside this, the implementation of soft tissue balancing and intraoperative planning is required for a good postoperative kinematics result. We collected early experiences in various in-vivo and in-vitro tests, where the average postoperative Varus/Valgus angle was 1.8 degree."

However, literature on the mid-term outcomes is limited especially that of hand-held robotic-assisted devices. We present one of the longest follow-up series to date using this novel technology and discuss the learning curve for introducing robotic technology into our practice. The purpose of this single-surgeon study is to evaluate the survival, patient-reported outcomes and learning curve for handheld boundary-controlled robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (HBRUKAs) at our hospital. This retrospective study evaluates 100 cases (94 Medial, 6 Lateral) performed by a single surgeon between October 2012 and July 2018. 52% were males, mean age was 64.5y (range 47.3y-85.2y) and mean BMI was 31.3 (range 21.8–43). Both inlay (40%) and onlay (60%) designs were implanted. Patients were followed up routinely at 1 and 5 years with Oxford Knee Scores (OKS) recorded. The learning curve was determined by tourniquet times. At a mean follow-up of 4.3 years (range 1.6y–7.3y), survivorship was 97%. There were three revisions: One case of aseptic loosening (1.5y), one case of deep-infection (3.8y) and one case of contralateral compartment osteoarthritis progression (5y). Mean 5-year OKS was 39.8. A 14.3% reduction in mean tourniquet times between the first 25 cases (105.5minutes) and subsequent cases (90.4minutes) was seen. This single-surgeon study showed good survivorship and patient-reported outcomes for HBRUKAs at our hospital. A learning curve of approximately 25 cases was shown, with significant decreases in tourniquet times with respect to increased surgeon experience."

pub.1022964566,Robotic Lateral and Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for end-stage degenerative disease of the knee limited to one compartment is a viable alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). UKA necessitates less bone resection and tissue disruption, reduces blood loss, and preserves cruciate ligaments. UKA can be performed in either of the 3 knee compartments with medial compartment the most common. Lateral compartment UKA is a technically difficult surgery, but robotic systems can mitigate the difficulty for surgeons. Recently, robot-assisted systems have become available for UKA that have been shown to improve accuracy of component placement and allow for intraoperative real-time dynamic ligament balancing. A 3-dimensional model of the patient’s anatomy is created from a preoperative computed tomography scan of the patient’s knee, which is mapped to anatomical landmarks registered intraoperatively. Components are then placed for an operative resection plan. The robot-assisted system provides haptic feedback to the surgeon during bone resection, including an alert, should the high-speed burr leave the preplanned resection area. Postoperative measures have shown superior accuracy of component accuracy with robotic systems compared with conventional UKA surgical techniques. Currently, short-term and midterm clinical outcomes of robot-assisted UKA are available that appear similar to those of conventional UKA."
pub.1134356835,The introduction of robotic-arm assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty: Learning curve and effect on theatre utilization.,"Background: The objective of this study was to report on the learning curve associated with the introduction of robotic-arm assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty with a focus on operating theatre utilization. Methods: A total of 339 primary THA cases (225 robotic-arm assisted, 114 conventional) were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective observational study. All patients underwent hybrid THA by a single surgeon using a posterolateral approach. The anaesthetic, intraoperative, and postoperative protocols remained unchanged during the study. Total case time was defined as the interval from arrival to the operating theatre complex to entering the recovery area. Results: 281 cases were included in the theatre utilization analysis. There were no differences in the demographics between the robotic-arm assisted and conventional THA cases in terms of age (p=0.463) or gender (p=0.953). Total case time for conventional THA was 100 minutes (95% CI: 98.04 to 102.06) and 127.6 minutes (95% CI: 125.5 to 129.63) for robotic-arm assisted. Robotic-arm assisted THA (n=188) cases were analysed in sequential groups of 50 (Groups A to D). Robotic arm THA total case time decreased by 16 minutes between Group A (mean 135.44, 95%CI:131.21 to 139.6) and Group D (mean 119.45, 95%CI: 115.88 to 123.01). Robotic THA cases were associated with a 35% increase in total case time in the early phase which reduced to a 19% increase after 150 cases. Conclusion: Operating theatre utilization analysis revealed increased total case time in robotic-arm assisted cases which gradually improved over the duration of the study."
pub.1145656702,COMPARISON BETWEEN IMAGE-FREE ROBOTIC ASSISTED AND CONVENTIONAL TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY: POSTOPERATIVE CT ASSESSMENT OF ALIGNMENT,"Background: Navio Surgical System, a newer-generation robotic technology, is an image-free roboticassisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) offering several advantages over older versions, including CT scan, the potential to dynamically assess soft tissue over a range of motion and the ability to use haptic control in bone preparation.
 Objective: The study aimed to compare the accuracy of component alignment between image-free robotic-assisted and conventional TKA.
 Methods: Forty patients were randomly assigned to two groups, 20 image-free robotic-assisted and 20 conventional TKA. The primary outcome was prosthetic alignment including mechanical axis alignment, epicondylar axis alignment and posterior tibial slope. The secondary outcomes included postoperative blood loss and operative time.
 Results: Significant difference were found in the postoperative mechanical axis between the image-free robotic group and the conventional group (1.15°±1° vs. 1.88°±1.19° deviated from neutral mechanical alignment, p = 0.043). There was significant difference in femoral rotational alignment between groups (1.00°±0.75° vs. 2.33°±0.96° deviated from the epicondylar axis, p<0.001). The mean posterior tibial slope did not significantly differ (3.89°±1.66° vs. 4.12°±1.37°, p=0.639). The operative time in the image-free robotic group was significantly longer than that of the conventional group (102.80 ± 11.18 min vs. 62.90 ± 3.28 min, p <0.001). Total blood loss in the image-free robotic group was significantly higher than conventional group (2.24±0.49 g/dl vs. 1.64±0.68 g/dl, p = 0.001).
 Conclusion: Image-free robotic-assisted TKA constituted a surgical procedure which could provide better accuracy in prosthetic alignment in both mechanical axis and rotational axis compared with conventional TKA. However, the image-free robotic assisted TKA involved higher blood loss and longer operative time."

pub.1173803757,Physical and Mental Demand During Direct Anterior Total Hip Arthroplasty: Comparison of Robotic-Assisted and Conventional Techniques,"Introduction The adoption of new techniques, such as the direct anterior (DA) approach, and technologies, such as robotic assistance, in total hip arthroplasty (THA) has the potential to alleviate the intraoperative physical and mental demand that surgeons experience. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the physical and mental demand of surgeons performing conventional DA THA with fluoroscopy and robotic-assisted DA THA without fluoroscopy. Methods Two orthopaedic surgeons completed bilateral DA THA’s on six cadaveric specimens. To assess physical demand, heart rates (HR), respirations, HR variability (stress), calories burned, and sweat loss were recorded using smartwatches. Surgeons completed a modified SURG-TLX questionnaire to assess physical and mental demand. Data were pooled together and two-sample t-tests were performed. Results Physical and mental demand metrics such as maximum HR, maximum stress, mean caloric expenditure and sweat loss were lower in robotic-assisted DA THA without fluoroscopy. Robotic-assisted THA was associated with a decreased percentage change for both the overall procedure and all surgical steps. Robotic-assisted THA also resulted in a significant difference in percentage change for maximum HR during acetabular reaming. Via questionnaire results, surgeons reported that robotic-assisted DA THA was significantly less physically and mentally demanding compared to conventional DA THA for the overall procedure and acetabular reaming. Discussion It is important to understand how robotic-assisted THA impacts the health of the surgeons using them. Robotic-assisted DA THA without fluoroscopy resulted in less physical and mental demand for orthopaedic surgeons for the overall procedure and individual surgical steps."
pub.1107139367,"Conventional vs Robotic Arm Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) Surgical Time, Transfusion rates, Length of Stay, Complications and Learning Curve","Background: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is increasingly more popular with our aging population. Robotic arm assisted THA uses patient specific information gathered from a pre-operative CT scan and correlation with intraoperative checkpoints to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of component positioning. Despite the various advantages robotic arm assisted THA can offer, there are still concerns regarding increased surgical time, technical complexity, complications and costs.Method: Retrospective review of a single surgeons’ last 45 conventional THA performed prior to changing to the robotic arm assisted system with the first 45 robotic arm assisted THA. Surgical time, Length of stay (LOS) in hospital, LOS in rehabilitation, transfusion rates and any complications were compared.Results: Average surgical time was 96.7 mins for the rob otic group and 84.9 mins for conventional group; however each robotic operation was approximately one minute shorter than the previous operation and the average time for the last 10 cases reduced to 82.9 mins. Compared to conventional THA there is no increased risk of complications or transfusions and interestingly there may be less chance of intraoperative acetabular fractures due to the single ream, minimal bone resection technique. LOS in the robotic group that did not go to rehabilitation was shorter by approximately 1 day and although statistically analyse for LOS in rehabilitation was not done due to small numbers there was a tendency for shorter LOS in the robotic group as well.Conclusion: This reduction in LOS, comparable surgical times and potential for less complications may outweigh the increased initial costs associated with the robotic system."

The technology has evolved rapidly with widespread introduction of computerized knee instrumentation in 2002. Techniques continue to be developed which integrate this new technology with knee arthroplasty procedures. We demonstrate our current method of doing computer-assisted total new arthroplasty based on 6 years of experience and more than 1200 consecutive cases.

pub.1121300997,28 Unicompartmental Knee Replacement Utilizing Robotics,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is a procedure that has demonstrated varying results historically. The primary issue identified was component malpositioning. The introduction of robotics into the surgical armamentarium over the past decade has led to the ability to have reproducible accurate component positioning with these implants and therefore has led to a resurgence of this procedure with the addition of new technology. The robotic systems available have evolved over the past decade to allow precise execution of the surgeon’s preoperative plan by minimizing aberrant bony resection, and allowing dynamic intraoperative ligamentous balancing. Herein, we describe our experience using the MAKO RIO system. A step-by-step instruction guide is provided within this chapter. Short-to-medium-term outcomes reported (revision rates) are comparable to historical rates seen for total knee arthroplasties within the literature. Long-term outcomes are not yet available for these implants, therefore future research must be performed to identify long-term revision rates and complications."
pub.1062160406,A New Methodology of Finding Optimal Toolpath and Tooling Strategies for Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty,"Robotic total hip arthroplasty is a procedure in which a milling operation is performed on the femur followed by insertion of a prosthetic implant. Although surgeons operate the robots, they do not control the choice of robotic tools and cutting strategies of the robot. Toolpath parameters, such as feedrate, tool geometry, and spindle speeds, govern the cutting forces of the robot. This research covers a methodological approach for finding optimal parameters such that cutting forces and surgical times are reduced. Many different types of orthopedic surgical burs were retrofitted into an advanced computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine, and the characteristics of each tool were evaluated. A simulation cutting model was then developed to find the parameters that could remove the most material in the fastest amount of time without violating any of the safety constraints of surgery. The new methodology proposed not only finds the theoretical optimal parameters but also expedites the process of finding sufficient parameters for orthopedic surgery."
pub.1163100233,INCIDENTAL FINDINGS AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PREOPERATIVE CT IMAGING FOR THE PLANNING OF ROBOTIC ARTHROPLASTY,"Abstract  Introduction Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is one of the commonest and most successful orthopaedic procedures, used for the management of end-stage arthritis. With the recent introduction of robotic assisted joint replacement, Computed Tomography (CT) has become part of required pre-operative planning. The aim of this study is to quantify and characterise incidental CT findings, their clinical significance, and their effect on planned joint arthroplasty.   Methodology All consecutive patients undergoing an elective TJR (hip or knee arthroplasty) were retrospectively identified, over a 3-year period (December 2019 and December 2022). Data documented and analysed included patient demographics, type of joint arthroplasty, CT findings, their clinical significance, as well as potential delays to the planned arthroplasty because of these findings and subsequent further investigation.   Results A total of 624 patients (637 studies, 323 (51.8%) female, 301 (48.2%) male) were identified of which 163 (25.6%) showed incidental findings within the long bones or pelvis. Of these 52 (8.2%) were significant, potentially requiring further management, 32 (5.0%) represented potential malignancy and 4 (0.6%) resulted in a new cancer diagnosis.   Conclusion It is not currently national standard practice to report planning CT imaging as it is deemed an unnecessary expense and burden on radiology services. Within the study cohort 52 (8.2%) of patients had a significant incidental finding that required further investigation or management and 4 (0.6%) had a previously undiagnosed malignancy. In order to avoid the inevitability of a missed malignancy on a planning CT, we must advocate for formal reports in all cases. "
pub.1171550502,ROBOTIC-ASSISTED TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY IS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLIER RETURN OF SYMMETRICAL LIMB FUNCTION COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY," Introduction Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has demonstrated significant benefits, including improved accuracy of component positioning compared to conventional jig-based TKA. However, previous studies have often failed to associate these findings with clinically significant improvements in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide a more nuanced assessment of a patient's functional recovery after TKA. This study aims to compare outcomes of patients undergoing robotic-assisted and conventional TKA in the early postoperative period using conventional PROMS and wearable sensors.   Method 100 patients with symptomatic end-stage knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary TKA were included in this study (44 robotic-assisted TKA and 56 conventional TKA). Functional outcomes were assessed using ankle-worn IMUs and PROMs. IMU- based outcomes included impact load, impact asymmetry, maximum knee flexion angle, and bone stimulus. PROMs, including Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol-Five Dimension (EQ-5D-5L), EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12) were evaluated at preoperative baseline, weeks 2 to 6 postoperatively, and at 3-month postoperative follow-up.   Results By postoperative week 6, when compared to conventional TKA, robotic-assisted TKA was associated with significant improvements in maximum knee flexion angle (118o ± 6.6 vs. 113o ± 5.4; p=0.04), symmetrical loading of limbs (82.3% vs.22.4%; p<0.01), cumulative impact load (146.6% vs 37%; p<0.01), and bone stimulus (25.1% vs 13.6%; p<0.01). Whilst there were no significant differences in PROMs (OKS, EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS, and FJS-12) at any time point between the two groups, when comparing OKS subscales, significantly more robotic-assisted TKA patients achieved an ‘excellent’ outcome at 6 weeks compared to conventional (47% vs 41%, p= 0.013).   Conclusions IMU-based metrics detected an earlier return to function among patients that underwent robotic-assisted TKA compared to conventional TKA that PROMs were unable to detect within the first six weeks of surgery.

The detailed planning of the operation and its realisation during the operation itself through milling of the seat of the prosthesis are some of the essential and still undisputed advantages of the computer-assisted robotic and navigation techniques. Use of the operation robot is particularly appropriate in the presence of posttraumatic or postoperative sequelae and malalignments, when former implant bearing sites are involved, and when there are zones of sclerosis in the proximal femur, which could cause problems for a surgeon using the conventional implantation technique."
pub.1032447526,The History of Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Because of increases in degenerative diseases and trauma of the hip joint, diverse treatment modalities have been developed. Because of this increase in demand in the field of hip joint medicine, the need for scientific studies in orthopaedics have been considered to be more important. In fact, currently, total hip arthroplasty is the most commonly performed reconstructive hip procedure. Total hip arthroplasty evolved as a result of many improvements in the design of a femoral head prosthesis, the availability of suitable component materials and manufacturing techniques, a better understanding of hip mechanics, and the need for resurfacing the acetabulum. An awareness of the history of hip arthroplasty is necessary to appreciate not only its current status, but also its future. This article discusses the history of and current trends in hip arthroplasty including implant design, materials, and the renewed interest in resurfacing procedures, minimally invasive techniques and robotic surgery."

pub.1181225911,Patient Perception of Robotic Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Qualitative Study,"Introduction: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most commonly performed orthopedic surgeries, at a prevalence of around 0.8% in the United States. Robotic-assisted technology has the goal of optimizing outcomes by improving acetabular cup positioning, center of hip rotation, and more. Patient perceptions regarding this procedure are not clearly delineated in the literature; therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess why patients choose to undergo robotic-assisted THA and whether they would recommend a similar procedure. Methods: All patients who underwent robotic-assisted THA between May 31, 2017 and December 13, 2018 were given a 12-question survey to complete. The final cohort consisted of 51 patients composed of 32 men and 19 women with a mean age of 67 years (range, 40 to 84 years). All de-identified surveys were evaluated for assessment. Results: Ninety-two percent would recommend robotic-assisted THA as opposed to conventional THA, with 70% stating the main influencer in their decision was physician input. 68 percent believed they would achieve better outcomes with robotic THA as opposed to their conventional counterparts. Seventy-two percent thought their components would be placed in a more optimal position using robotics. 49% believed they would have less pain with robotic-assisted THA. However, most patients stated they believe they would have no difference in length-of-stay or infection risk compared to manual THA. 53 percent of patients stated there would be similar operating room time between robotic and manual THA. Discussion: The majority of our cohort believed there were benefits to undergoing robotic-assisted THA. Physician input was the major contributing factor. Larger prospective studies in the future with less limitations should evaluate how attitudes and beliefs may influence patient-reported satisfaction and outcomes post-operatively."

The HemiSPAIRE technique in hip hemiarthroplasty for displaced intracapsular fractures has been compared with the standard lateral approach (advocated by NICE) in a pragmatic, superiority, multicentre, randomised controlled trial into postoperative mobility and function. This NIHR funded study was recruited between November 2019 and April 2022 and the results are reported in this presentation. The author has used the SPAIRE technique in 1026 routine primary total hip replacements since February 2016. The technique is described along with results from NJR data. SPAIRE is most challenging in patients with small anatomy, reduced offset, with an external rotation deformity. Particularly in these, but in all cases, MAKO robotic assistance facilitates accurate implantation of prostheses and precise recreation of biomechanics. The MAKO robot has been used in all cases since 2018 and SPAIRE/MAKO is now the standard of care in the author's practice. To evaluate whether robotic-assisted tendon-sparing posterior approaches (piriformis sparing and SPAIRE), improve patient outcomes in total hip arthroplasty compared with a robotic-assisted standard posterior approach, the NIHR Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme has recently funded the HIPSTER trial (HIP Surgical Techniques to Enhance Rehabilitation). This is a single-centre, double-blinded, parallel three-arm, randomised, controlled, superiority trial; recruitment is in progress. The greatest value of robotic assistance may be when it is used in combination with tendon-sparing surgery. Data is being gathered to evaluate whether the SPAIRE/MAKO technique confers benefits with regard the speed of post-op mobilisation as well as accelerated return to unrestricted function."
pub.1152441388,Learning Curve in Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Several innovations have been introduced in recent years to improve total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Robotic-assisted surgery is gaining popularity for more precise implant placement while minimizing soft tissue injury. The main concerns are increased cost, operative time, and a significant learning curve. This systematic review aims to analyze the surgical time learning curve, implant placement accuracy, and complications related to robotic-assisted TKA (raTKA). A systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The research was conducted up to September 2022 in four databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), with the following key terms: “robotic-assisted”, “total knee arthroplasty”, “robotic”, “TKA”, “learning”, and “TKR”. The methodology quality of the studies was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria. This systematic review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), ID: CRD42022354797, in August 2022. Fifteen clinical studies that analyzed the raTKA learning curve of 29 surgeons and 2300 raTKAs were included in the systematic review. Fourteen surgeons reported the presence of an inflection point during the learning curve. Few studies have reported the learning curve of raTKA regarding lower limb alignment, component position, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. The main finding of this systematic review is that the procedure number required to reach the learning plateau is about 14.9 cases. Furthermore, an average decrease in surgical time of 23.9 min was described between the initial and proficiency phases; the average surgical time in the two phases was 98.8 min and 74.4 min, respectively. No learning curve was observed for implant placement and lower limb alignment because the implants were correctly placed from the first raTKAs. No significant complication rates were reported during the raTKA learning curve."

Computer-assisted surgery technology in UKA has already resulted in improved postoperative alignment, reduction of outliers and better postoperative clinical results. Robotic systems have been integrated in orthopedic surgery in 1992, while robotic-assisted UKA has gained wide acceptance in recent years. Currently, robotic systems can be classified in active, passive and semiactive systems. Semiactive systems, also called haptic or surgeon-guided robotic systems, allow the surgeon to use the robot to perform the surgery. In this case, the permanent input of the surgeon is mandatory to perform the procedure. Here we describe the procedure of robotic-assisted UKA using the MAKO haptic robotic system and discuss the clinical results."
pub.1155311847,DO TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTIES PERFORMED WITH ROBOTIC ASSISTANCE HAVE BETTER PROM SCORES AT SIX MONTHS POST SURGERY WHEN COMPARED WITH TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTIES PERFORMED WITH CONVENTIONAL INSTRUMENTATION?,"In this study we compare survivorship and patient reported outcome measures in robotically assisted versus conventional Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA).
                  This paper investigates the hypothesis that implant survival and PROMS following THAs performed with robotic assistance were not different to outcomes following conventional THAs.
                  Data included all patients undergoing THA for osteoarthritis between 19 April 2016 and 31 December 2020. Analysis of PROMS outcomes was restricted to those who had completed PROMS data preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively.
                  There were 157,647 procedures, including 3567 robotically assisted procedures, available for comparison of revision rates. 4557 procedures, including 130 robotically assisted procedures, had PROMS data available. The revision rate of primary THA performed with robotic assistance was not statistically different from THA performed by conventional methods (4 year cumulative percent revision 3.1% v 2.7%; HR = 1.05, p=0.67). The Oxford Hip Score, VAS for pain and the EQ-VAS score for overall health showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. The EQ-5D Utility Score showed an improved score (median score 1 v 0.88; OR = 1.58, p=0.007) for the robotically assisted group compared to the conventional group.
                  Robotic assisted THA was not associated with significant improvement in early revision or joint-specific PROMs. The findings may have been biased, in either direction, by unmeasured patient, surgeon, hospital and prosthesis factors. The findings (including the difference in health-related quality of life) may have also been influenced by lack of blinding. Future research should include methods to minimise these biases."

pub.1168881624,Limitations in Transitioning from Conventional to Modern Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Review,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has undergone significant evolution from the initial concept of ivory components to the integration of artificial intelligence. Modern technologies, such as computers and surgical robots, are now employed to precisely place implants and achieve a neutral joint configuration with minimal incisions. Despite these advancements, achieving the desired preoperative outcome remains a challenge. Accurate implant alignment continues to be a prominent limitation in the field. Malalignment results in unbalanced stresses, restricted range of motion, patient discomfort, and ultimately, TKA failure. This study reviews the limitations of commercially available TKA techniques, including navigated TKA, robotic-assisted TKA, and artificial intelligence-based approaches. Compared with the conventional TKA, navigated TKA offers the advantage of smaller incisions, but does not consistently achieve the planned implant position. Conversely, robotic-assisted surgery theoretically provides perfect neutral alignment, but its widespread use is hindered by high operational costs and associated complications. While machine learning can predict the outcomes, its current level of accuracy is not yet clinically acceptable. Although most of the calculations for Patient-specific implants are performed during preoperative session, reducing surgery duration, drawbacks include the added expense of CT scans and MRI images, while the promised results have yet to be consistently achieved."

The MAKO RIO robotic surgery system has previously shown improvements in in knee flexion during weight acceptance (WA) in comparison to conventional methods at a one year follow up. This study aimed to determine if these improvements remained at five years follow up. Twenty five MAKO and 21 conventional knees were tested using three dimensional gait analysis to measure knee kinematics. Results demonstrated that the MAKO group achieved significantly greater knee flexion in WA than the conventional group which was consistent with results are one year.

pub.1122138839,A Retrospective Comparison of Functional Outcomes of Robotic-Assisted and Conventional Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is effective for alleviating symptoms of arthritis in a single knee compartment; however, errors in alignment and instability may predispose to failure. Robotic technology has improved precision, but its impact on functional recovery after UKA remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare early functional recovery, pain, and radiographic alignment in UKA performed with either robotic assistance or conventional methods.
                  METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing UKA by a single physician from January 2015 to March 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), KOOS Jr, and VAS (0-10) outcomes scores were collected preoperatively, 1, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Radiographic alignment was assessed at the initial postoperative visit.
                  RESULTS: There were 161 patients, 65 conventional and 96 robotic. At baseline, there was no difference in average age, BMI, or outcomes scores between the two groups. Average preoperative pain was significantly higher in conventional patients (6.1 vs. 5.4; p=0.04). At 3 weeks post-op, conventional UKA patients still had significantly higher pain levels (3.9 vs. 3.1; p=.02). Both groups showed significant improvement in LEF (p<.0001) scores over time (p<.0001). Significant improvement in KOOS Jr. scores from pre-op (52.3) to 6 and 12-weeks postoperatively (67.6, 69.8; p<0.001). When comparing PCS of the VR/SF-12, the robotic-assisted group had significantly higher improvement compared to the conventional group at 6-weeks (40.6 vs. 35.6; p=0.02).
                  CONCLUSION: Robotic assisted UKA resulted in fewer radiographic outliers, and more rapid recovery with less early postoperative pain although functional differences tended to equilibrate by 3 months postoperatively."

pub.1121298758,27 Development of an Active Soft-Tissue Balancing System for Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty is an ideal surgical application for robotic assistance because accurate soft-tissue balance and implant positioning are critical for achieving superior clinical outcomes. OMNI has developed and commercialized the world’s first robotic-assisted system that integrates robotic ligament tensioning with bone resection planning to predict and achieve a well-balanced and well-aligned knee replacement. A novel robotic ligament tensioning tool, called the BalanceBot, is inserted into the knee to quantify the soft-tissue envelope throughout the range of knee motion. Predictive Balancing then allows the surgeon to predict postoperative ligament balance based on a virtual 3D implant plan before making bone cuts. The bone anatomy is reconstructed intraoperatively based on image-free 3D BoneMorphing technology, which eliminates the need for preoperative 3D imaging modalities and their associated cost, time, and radiation exposure burdens. A miniature semiactive bone-mounted robotic cutting guide called the OMNIBot is used to guide the resections according to the surgeon’s plan. The BalanceBot is then used to assess the final soft-tissue tension and balance achieved, closing the loop on the surgeon’s plan and minimizing the amount of ligament releases required to achieve a balanced knee. In this chapter we describe the evolution of the development of the system, with a specific focus on the initial development, validation, and clinical application of the BalanceBot. Early clinical results demonstrate a high level of patient satisfaction and warrant further clinical use and studies to evaluate the impact on longer term patient outcomes."

                  There is a lack of data concerning the use of the robotic device for patients with other potentially complex surgical factors.  Therefore, the purpose of this series was to present cases in which the robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA) application was used in the setting of extra-articular deformities to educate the surgeon community on this potentially useful method to address these complex cases.
                  Methods:
                  Three cases of patients who underwent RATKA in the setting of pre-operative extra-articular deformities were identified.  One had femoral and tibial fracture malunion, another had proximal tibial fracture nonunion, and another with a healed tibial plateau fracture. Patient clinical histories, intra-operative surgical techniques, and post-operative outcomes were obtained.  Specific focus was placed on the surgical management of the patient’s pre-existing deformity.

                  The robotic software was able to appropriately consider the extra-articular deformity in the pre-operative and real-time updated intra-operative plans.  Doing so, the surgeon achieved a balanced and aligned TKA. No intra-operative or post-operative complications occurred. Antero-posterior and lateral radiographs demonstrated well fixed and aligned femoral and tibial components with no signs of loosening or osteolysis. On physical exam, all patients had excellent range of motion with mean flexion of 122 degrees (range: 120 to 125 degrees of flexion) at final follow-up.
                  Discussion:
                  Utilizing pre-operative CT-scans with a 3D plan for robotic-arm assisted surgery allowed for appropriate assessment of the deformity pre-operatively and execution of a plan for a balanced and aligned total knee arthroplasty. We have demonstrated excellent results utilizing robotic-arm assisted TKA in these complex cases."
pub.1148044186,MODERN TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENTS OF HIP AND KNEE ARTHROPLASTY,"Total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty is an effective surgical treatment for late-stage osteoarthritis. Objective. Highlight the most significant technological developments in the design of implants and assistive technologies for hip and knee arthroplasty. Results. The development of hip and knee arthroplasty is associated with the desire to improve treatment outcomes, reduce complications and increase the survival of implants. The emphasis is placed on some of the most interesting, in our opinion, trends in this area. It has been shown that metal-to-metal friction steam implants are used to replace the articular surface of the hip joint, but the method is the best option only for active men with a large hip joint. New approaches involve the use of friction pairs «ceramic – ceramic» or «metal – polyethylene». The creation of smaller femoral components of endoprostheses (mini-legs) for THA is aimed at preserving bone tissue and achieving physiological load. Dual mobility endoprostheses are increasingly preferred for primary THA. The creation of implants with a porous surface (in particular, with the use of additive technologies) is promising to increase their osteointegration and antibacterial properties. The latest direction is the creation of robotic support systems for joint replacement operations, which will improve the accuracy of implant positioning, reduce blood loss, improve functional results, as well as achieve after TKA balance of ligaments and joint space by accurately determining its size and accuracy resection of the femur. However, high-evidence clinical trials are needed to find convincing longterm results for this approach to become standard in hip and knee arthroplasty. Conclusions. Robotic surgery is one of the most interesting developments in hip and knee surgery. The growth in the use of this technology has shown convincing long-term results. "
pub.1105582402,Technique and Accuracy Assessment of a Novel Image-Free Handheld Robot for Knee Arthroplasty in Bi-Cruciate Retaining Total Knee Replacement,"Bi-cruciate retaining knee implants are anatomically designed for use in early surgical intervention, for patients with less severe arthritic disease. Patient satisfaction after total knee replacement is directly related to knee stability and proprioception, particularly for high-demand, active patients. While preservation of all intact and healthy ligaments may be the key to achieving such results of satisfaction, balancing four ligaments in a bi-cruciate procedure is more technically challenging then a conventional total knee replacement. Robotics-assisted arthroplasty has been gaining popularity as a tool to increase accuracy and precision of implant positioning. Robotics-assisted systems can provide surgeons with virtual tools to make informed decisions for knee replacement, specific to the needs of the patient. Here, we are introducing a semiautonomous handheld robotic system support for a bi-cruciate retaining knee implant design. The system supports image-free anatomic data collection and streamlined intraoperative surgical planning with dynamic gap balancing before any bone preparation. In this study, we evaluate the surgical technique and accuracy of implant placement in synthetic bone and cadaver experiments."
pub.1156911260,Rise of the robots: are they coming?,"The use of technology has increased over the last decade across all surgical specialties. Robotics is the ultimate tool and can accomplish accuracy and consistency for surgeons executing their preoperative plan. In orthopedic surgery, robotic-assisted knee and hip arthroplasty techniques have experienced rapid growth, and the next field of interest is, without a doubt, shoulder arthroplasty. While the survival rates extend to over 90% at 10 years of follow-up and overall satisfaction rates are very high, some report that up to 10% of the patients with a shoulder replacement remain dissatisfied with their postoperative range of motion and overall functional outcome. There have been numerous advances in implant designs and materials as well as the introduction of enhanced recovery programs, however, reported patient outcomes, and reoperation rates may not always have significantly benefited from those advances in shoulder arthroplasty over the last two decades. Lately, the digitalization of shoulder arthroplasty has drawn a lot of attention with the intent to improve the correction of joint deformities and component implantation, possibly leading to enhanced patient outcomes after shoulder arthroplasty. The potential benefits of shoulder robots are multiple. First, by converting data from imaging or intraoperative anatomy mapping, a patient-specific 3-dimensional representation of the joint may facilitate surgical planning and subsequent boundary control for the bony resections, reaming, and implant positioning. Second, the system may allow intraoperative assessment of the range of motion and joint stability. Third, research may be facilitated and encouraged by supporting case-by-case data collection. This next evolution in surgical technology aims to make shoulder replacements accurate and reproducible in both easy and challenging shoulders and usable by both low-volume and highly experienced surgeons."

pub.1122138902,The Effect of the PCL on Kinematics as it Relates to Soft-Tissue Preservation from Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgery,"The use of haptic-based robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (hRATKA) has demonstrated a decrease in soft tissue damage. Hampp et al. [4] compared the soft tissue damage in a cadaveric study between manual total knee arthroplasty (MTKA) and hRATKA and found that the hRATKA specimens had significantly less damage to the PCL than the MTKA specimens [4]. The purpose of this study is to look at the effect of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) on kinematics, as defined by anterior-posterior (AP) tibial translation, during stair climb. Using a 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) joint motion simulator, the stair climb profile was run on four cadaveric knee specimens with the PCL intact and the PCL cut. In the PCL deficient condition, there was more posterior tibial motion than when the PCL was intact, and this was more noticeable during the high flexion portion of the profile. These findings speak to the importance of soft tissue preservation, and the development of haptic-based robotic-arm assisted TKA can help prevent soft tissue damage to the PCL."
pub.1117365283,Perioperative Protocols to Facilitate Early Discharge and Rapid Recovery After Robotic Surgery,"Robotic surgery has been developed with the goals of improving accuracy of component position, reducing surgical exposure, optimizing functional outcomes, and improving implant durability. As robotic surgical technology matures, the ancillary technologies that support the procedures themselves evolve concurrently. Facilitating processes around robotic surgery requires attention to several perioperative elements in order to optimize success. Appropriate preoperative planning to help with execution of the surgery, to optimize the patient physically and medically, and to set patient expectations will ensure a smooth transition toward early discharge and full recovery. Self-directed home exercising, to support or supplant formal physical therapy, as well as multimodal pain management to limit narcotic consumption, both inhospital and at home, will help maximize clinical results and patient satisfaction. Web-based rehabilitation, augmented by burgeoning technologies, promises to offer improved results at a lower cost. Finally, it is important to prepare the clinic, hospital, and staff accordingly for the transition to rapid recovery and early discharge after robotic surgery."
pub.1171371231,RESULTS OF ROBOTIC ASSISTED VS CONVENTIONAL TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY AT 1 YR FOLLOW UP,"Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a prevalent condition among older individuals, causing significant discomfort and impairments in quality of life. Conventional total knee arthroplasty (COTKA) is a common treatment, but issues such as inadequate soft tissue balance and prosthesis misalignment can impact outcomes. Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) has emerged as a potential solution, offering enhanced precision in prosthesis placement. While observational studies suggest benefits, comprehensive reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes of RATKA compared to COTKA in adult patients with primary knee OA. Methods: This prospective study was conducted at a specialized orthopedic center, involving patients diagnosed with symptomatic knee OA eligible for total knee replacement (TKR). Patients were allocated to either conventional TKR (Group A) or robotic-assisted TKR (Group B). Outcome measures included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), patient satisfaction, and quality of life assessments. Radiological outcomes were assessed using standardized radiographs. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Baseline characteristics showed similar distributions between Group A (n=30) and Group B (n=30). Clinical outcomes demonstrated significant improvements over time in both groups, with Group B consistently outperforming Group A across all measures. Notably, Group B exhibited lower pain scores (VAS), higher functional scores (KSS), lower disability scores (WOMAC), higher patient satisfaction, and better quality of life assessments. Radiological outcomes also favored Group B, with improved mechanical axis deviation and component positioning. Conclusion: Robotic-assisted TKR demonstrated superior clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes compared to conventional TKR in patients with knee OA. These findings support the growing body of evidence favoring the use of robotic technology in TKR procedures, particularly for optimizing implant placement and alignment. Future research should focus on cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes to further inform clinical practice and enhance patient care."
pub.1163100181,ROSA VERSUS MAKO: COMPARING SURGICAL ACCURACY IN ROBOTIC TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY,"Abstract  Introduction There is increasing adoption of robotic surgical technology in Total Knee Arthroplasty - The ROSA® knee system can be used in either image-based mode (using pre-operative calibrated radiographs) or imageless modes (using intra-operative bony registration). The Mako knee system is an image-based system (using a pre-operative CT scan). This study aimed to compare surgical accuracy between the ROSA and Mako systems with specific reference to Joint Line Height, Patella Height and Posterior Condylar Offset.   Methodology This was a retrospective review of a prospectively-maintained database of the initial 100 consecutive ROSA TKAs and the initial 50 consecutive Mako TKAs performed by two high volume surgeons. To determine the accuracy of component positioning, the immediate post-operative radiograph was reviewed and compared with the immediate pre-operative radiograph. Patella height was assessed using the Insall-Salvati ratio.   Results There was no significant difference between ROSA TKA and Mako TKA with regards to restoration of joint line height, ROSA mean 0.2mm versus Mako mean 0.3mm (p<0.05), posterior condylar offset, ROSA mean 0.16mm versus Mako mean 0.3mm (p<0.05), and patella height, ROSA mean 0.02 versus Mako mean 0.03 (p<0.05)   Conclusion This study is the first study to compare the accuracy of the ROSA and MAKO knee systems in total knee arthroplasty. Both systems are highly accurate in restoring native posterior condylar offset, joint line height, and patella height in TKA with no significant difference demonstrated between the two robotic systems.

Methods For conducting this study, we searched four electronic databases. The outcomes were pooled as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence interval. We used RevMan for performing the analysis.   Results We included nine studies. The data showed a significant favoring of robotic-assisted TKA than the conventional one in mechanical alignment, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and femoral coronal outliers (MD= -1.10, 95% CI [-1.51, -0.69], p<0.00001), (MD= -1.19, 95% CI [-2.35, -0.03], p=0.04), and (RR= 0.49, 95% CI [0.30, 0.80], p=0.004) respectively. On the other hand, the conventional TKA was better in range of motion-flexion (long-term) than the robotic-assisted one (MD= -3.02, 95% CI [-3.68, -2.37], p<0.00001). However, there were no significant differences between them in knee society score-knee score, knee society score-function score, change in hospital for special surgery, and change in range of motion-extension (MD= -0.36, 95% CI [-2.43, 1.70], p=0.73), (MD= -0.34, 95% CI [-2.36, 1.68], p=0.74), (MD=0.78, 95% CI [-0.84, 2.40], p=0.34), and (MD=0.16, 95% [-1.32, 1.64], p=0.83) respectively.   Conclusion Robotic-assisted TKA had better outcomes than conventional TKA regarding mechanical alignment and WOMAC. However, the conventional approach showed a better range of motion-flexion in the long term. More data is needed for the long-term outcomes. "

To further understand robotic TKA learning curve, we evaluated early postoperative outcomes of robotics vs. manual TKA, based on surgeon experience. Methods: Patients (> 64 years) from the Medicare database, with primary, unilateral, elective TKA (“index”) from October 2015 to December 2019 were identified and categorized based on robotic vs. manual surgery, and surgeon experience: low-count surgeons had < 40 cases in the 12-months pre-index; medium-low, medium- high and high count surgeons had 41-80, 81-120 and 121-160 cases, respectively. The low-count robotic cohort (RC) was compared to the low, medium-low, medium-high, and high count manual cohort (MC) for the length of the hospital stay (LOS), and rates of home and skilled nursing facility (SNF) discharge. Descriptive statistics (means and proportion with 95% confidence intervals) were performed. Results: 296 low-count robotic cases were compared to 209,494 low-count manual and 252,905 medium-low, medium-high and high-count manual cases. The low-count RC had an average LOS of 2.03 days (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.86-2.20) vs. 2.20 days (95%CI: 2.20-2.21) for the low-count MC. 82.4% patients (95%CI: 78.1%-86.8%) from the low-count RC were discharged home vs. 74.2% (95%CI: 74.0%-74.4%) in the low-count MC and 83.6% (95%CI: 83.3%-84.0%) in the high-count MC. Discharge to SNF affected 15.2% (95%CI: 11.1%-19.3%) in the low-count RC vs. 21.0% (95%CI: 20.9%-21.2%) and 15.2% (95%CI: 14.9%-15.4%) in the low-count and medium-high MC, respectively. Conclusion: Patients operated with robotic surgery by surgeons with low yearly volume had a LOS and probability of home discharge similar to that of patients operated with manual surgery by high-volume surgeons. Patients in the robotic group also had a lower rate of SNF discharge compared to the patients in the manual surgery group, with surgeons of similar experience."

The purpose of our study is to assess the outcome of robotic-assisted THA compared to conventional THA in patients younger than 35 years old.
                  
                  Methods: A retrospective analysis of 123 patients younger than 35 years old that underwent primary unilateral THA between January 2013 and April 2018 was conducted. Patients were divided into two cohorts: (1) robotic-assisted THA and (2) conventional-THA (c-THA). Demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were carefully studied. Radiographic analysis included measurement of postoperative acetabular anteversion and inclination angles as well as postoperative leg length discrepancies. Chi square and unpaired student t-tests were performed for all categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
                  Results: Of the total 123 patients, 30 patients (32 hips) were in the robotic-THA cohort, and 93 patients (100 hips) were in the conventional-THA cohort. Patients in the robotic-THA cohort were younger (26.6±6.2 vs. 29.0±5.3; p=0.03), had a higher mean BMI (29.8±8.2 vs. 25.7±5.9; p=0.03) at surgery. The most common indication for THA was DDH and osteonecrosis. The acetabular component was positioned within Lewinnek’s safe zone more often in the robotic-THA cohort compared to the c-THA cohort (94% vs 65%; p<0.01) (Figures 1 and 2). Leg length discrepancies were similar between both cohorts. Patients in the c-THA group were more likely to experience clinically significant higher rates of dislocation (2.9% vs. 0), revision (6.8%), any postoperative complication (7.8%), and 90-day readmission (2.9) following THA.
                  Conclusion: Robotic THA can help improve outcomes in younger THA recipients. Future studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up times should evaluate outcomes in this historically technically demanding patient population."

                  This study performed a healthcare utilization analysis between robotic-arm assisted and manual TKA techniques at three intervals to better understand intra-episode trends that can lead to optimized care pathways. Specifically, we compared: (1) index costs; and (2) discharge dispositions; as well as (3) 30-; (4) 60-; and (5) 90- day: a) total episode-of-care costs, b) post-operative healthcare utilization, and c) readmissions.
                  Methods
                  The Medicare 100% Standard Analytical Files was queried for robotic and manual TKAs (rTKA and mTKA) performed between January 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017. Based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 1:5 propensity score matching, 519 robotic and 2,595 manual TKA patients were analyzed. Total episode payments, healthcare utilization, and readmissions, at 30-, 60-, and 90-day time points were compared between cohorts with a generalized Linear Model, Binomial Regression, log link, Mann-Whitney, and Pearson's Chi Squared tests with p<0.05 for statistical significance.
                  Results
                  The robotic vs. manual cohort average total episode payment was $17,768 vs. $19,899 (p<0.0001) at 30-days; $18,174 vs. $20,492 (p<0.0001) at 60-days; and $18,568 vs. $20,960 (p<0.0001) at 90-days. At 30 days, 47% fewer rTKA patients utilized SNF services (13.5 vs. 25.4%, p<0.0001 and had lower SNF costs at 30- ($6,416 vs. $7,732; p = 0.0040), 60- ($6,678 vs. $7,901, p=0.0072), and 90-days ($7,201 vs. $7,947, p=0.0230). rTKA patients also utilized fewer home-health visits and costs at each time point (p<0.05). Additionally, 31.3% fewer rTKA patients utilized emergency room services at 30-days postoperatively. The robotic cohort had significantly fewer 90-day readmissions (5.20 vs. 7.75%; p=0.0423).
                  Discussion
                  Robotic TKA is associated with significantly lower 30-, 60-, and 90-day post- operative costs and healthcare utilization. These results are of marked importance given the emphasis to contain and reduce healthcare costs for total joints arthroplasties.

pub.1181262545,Robotic-Assistance in Total Hip Arthroplasty Is Associated With Decreased Dislocation Rates,"Background As the use of robotics in total hip arthroplasty (THA) continues to gain popularity, differences in clinical outcomes when compared to manual techniques have remained unclear. This study aimed to compare postoperative complications between patients undergoing robotic-assisted techniques and manual THA for primary osteoarthritis at 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years. Methods Using an all-payer national database, we identified 405,048 patients who underwent either robotic-assisted or manual THA for primary osteoarthritis. A propensity match was performed for age, sex, a comorbidity index, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and diabetes, resulting in 7652 patients in each cohort. We assessed postoperative outcomes, including surgical site infections, pulmonary emboli, venous thromboemboli, wound complications, dislocations, aseptic revisions, periprosthetic joint infections, and periprosthetic fractures. We completed bivariate analyses via chi-square tests to assess categorical variables. We utilized student’s t-tests to compare continuous variables, including ages and comorbidities. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for complications using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The robotic-assisted cohort had lower rates of dislocation at 90 days (0.93 vs 1.41%, OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.88, P = .007), 1 year (1.32 vs 1.92%, OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.88, P = .004), and 2 years (1.66 vs 2.1%, OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-0.99, P = .049). Total surgical complications were significantly lower in the robotic-assisted cohort at 1 year (5.29 vs 6.16%, OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98, P = .0205), but were similar at 90 days and 2 years. At 90 days, the rates of medical complications, including surgical site infections, pulmonary emboli, venous thromboemboli, and wound complications, were similar (all P > .05). The rates of periprosthetic joint infections, aseptic revision, periprosthetic fractures, and aseptic loosening were similar at all time points (all P > .05). Conclusions Patients who underwent robotic-assisted THA had lower rates of dislocation at 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years. This finding supports the use of robotic assistance in THA, though further research is needed to confirm and strengthen these findings."

Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we analyzed demographics, prevalence of comorbidities, total cost, and length of stay (LOS) for 88,415 RA-TKA cases identified during this period. Our analysis revealed a significant increase in RA-TKA procedures, from 5,330 in 2016 to 39,495 in 2019. Patients undergoing RA-TKA were slightly younger, with an average age of 66.2 years. The average hospital stay was 1.89 days, and total charges averaged $65,891. We also examined various comorbidities and demographic factors, including race, median household income, and hospital teaching status. The results show that RA-TKA usage in the US has grown substantially, with specific demographic and clinical patterns. Further studies on the long-term outcomes of RA-TKA are needed to fully understand the benefits of this technology."

Robotic assistance and use of burr-all techniques have been shown to aid with component placement and enhance precision and limb alignment. Methods In this study, we report a medial vertical shear periprosthetic tibial plateau fracture after an uneventful robotic-assisted UKA using a burr-all technique presented 3 weeks postoperative. An analysis of the available literature was performed to investigate possible risk factors for periprosthetic fractures after UKA. Results After confirming good implant fixation to the fragment, the patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF). At six weeks, postoperative X-rays revealed adequate consolidation and correct alignment of the fracture. The patient was pain-free at four months follow-up. Periprosthetic risk factors post-UKA were found to be similar to those identified for TKAs, special considerations for depth of resection into the proximal medial tibia, pin placement into the medial edge of the tibial plateau, and positioning of sagittal saw cuts. Conclusion Meticulous care should be exercised during the preparation of the tibial plateau for a burr-all robotic assisted burr-all UKA to maintain stability. When loosening is ruled out, an ORIF with a plate in a buttress mode can be a feasible approach to treat a vertical shear periprosthetic tibial plateau fracture."
pub.1135264677,A Detailed analysis of Time taken in Robotic Surgery for Total Hip Replacement Arthroplasty and comparison with computer assisted navigation in Total Hip Replacement Arthroplasty,"The accuracy of implantation using navigation and robotic hip replacement (THR) has been proven and accepted. Time taken for the use of technology, has been one of the major factors quoted by many surgeons for not using it. Aim was to analyse the time taken during different steps of the procedure and identify which part needs further improvement. Secondary aim was to compare the time with computer navigation technology. 20 total joint replacements were carried out with MAKO robotic system using extended software version, which includes both acetabular and femoral guidance. The times of different surgical steps were noted. After the incision was made, and joint exposed the trackers for the pelvis and femur were then inserted, tightened and verification pins inserted. Femoral registration matching was started at 15 minutes (SD5.4 Range7-22). Femoral Neck Cut level was made at 22.5 minutes (SD4.5 Range15-29). It took mean 7.5 minutes to match the femoral anatomy to preop CT scan anatomy. Pelvic registration matching was done at 42.4 minutes (SD5.9 Range33-50). It took average 8.4 minutes to match pelvic anatomy. Bone reaming was with robotic arm at 50.8minutes (SD5.5 Range40-57). The cup was impacted at 56.2 minutes (SD5.2 Range45-60). Cementing stem added 14 minutes. The navigation hip replacement surgery took mean 60 minutes in uncemented and 72minutes for cemented stems. Robotic technique took 10 minutes longer. There is room for improvement in two main modifiable steps. Total registration matching time which took 16 minutes and using a uncemented stem. Should time constraint supersede accuracy achievable with technology?"
pub.1110140465,A Novel Patient-Specific Instrument Design Can Deliver Robotic Level Accuracy in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: A previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) by our group found that robotic assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) surgery was significantly more accurate than conventional instrumentation. The aim of this study was to determine whether a low-cost novel PSI design could deliver the same level of accuracy as the robot in a more time efficient manner. Methods: Thirty patients undergoing medial UKA took part. Tibial component position was planned using a low dose CT-scan, and compared to a day 1 postoperative CT-scan to determine the difference between the planned and achieved position. Operations were performed by one expert surgeon using PSI (Embody, London, UK). Oxford knee scores (OKS) and EQ-5D-5L were collected preoperatively and at 12 months postoperatively. Results: The mean absolute difference between planned and achieved tibial implant position using PSI was 2 (sd 1) in the coronal plane, 1.8 (sd 1.5) in the sagittal plane, and 4.5 (sd 3.3) in the axial plane. These results were not significantly different to the thirteen historical robotic cases (mean difference 0.5, 0.5, and 1.7, p=0.1907, 0.2867 and 0.1049 respectively). PSI mean operating time was on average 62 min shorter than the robotic group (p<0.0001). There was a significant increase in mean OKS (p<0.0001) and EQ-5D-5L index (p<0.0001). No complications were reported. Conclusions: In conclusion, this clinical trial demonstrates that for tibial component positioning in UKA, a novel design PSI guide in the hands of an expert surgeon, can safely deliver comparable accuracy to a robotic system, whilst being significantly faster."
pub.1003437261,A laboratory-level surgical robot system for minimal invasive surgery (MIS) total knee arthroplasty,"Recently, commercially available computer-aided surgical robot systems have been introduced to enable surgeons to improve the accuracy of cutting and alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The minimal invasive surgery (MIS) in the TKA has been increased since MIS can improve the surgical outcomes such as the recovery time and hospital stay by reducing the incision in surgery. However, current surgical robot systems do not provide the MIS TKA capability. In this study, we developed a laboratory-level surgical robot system to cut the bone from the lateral direction of the knee joint to provide MIS TKA. TKA experiments with saw bones of femur were compared between the conventional approach and the MIS approach. The incision length for the working space of the cutting tool and bone cutting time were decreased in lateral direction bone cutting. In addition, the cutting surface was smoother and the ranges of motion of all six joints were decreased in lateral direction bone cutting. Moreover, the cutting accuracy in terms of the lengths and angles of five cutting planes in femur were smaller in lateral approach than those in conventional approach. Therefore, consideration of bone cutting from the lateral direction in robotic TKA surgery should be necessary to improve the surgical outcomes in knee arthroplasty. The developed surgical robot system could be a platform of various orthopedic robotic surgeries."
pub.1135264786,Predictability of implants size in Robotic Surgery for Total Knee and hip Replacement Arthroplasty,"Accuracy of implantation using computer assisted navigation and robotic total knee replacement arthroplasty (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) has been proven. Templating the pre-operative radiographs has become standard. This gives an insight into the pre op planning and the sizes most likely to be used. This helps to reduce the inventory for storage of implants and cost. While the templating of radiographs has been helpful, implant sizes prediction remains less than desirable. Aim of present study was to look at the predictability of implant sizes in CT planning for robotic surgery. 30 MAKO robotic joint replacements were performed (15TKR/15THR) with pre op CT scans for implant size. For TKR, the sizes used were mean 5 in femur and tibia (SD1 and range 3-7). In tibia, size used was same as predicted. In the femur in two cases the size was reduced by one to balance the gaps. Insert thickness was increased by one size in 4 cases. For THR, the acetabular cup, femur, head diameter and offset were predicted 100%. The neck length had to be changed in some cases by up to two sizes. for balance/stability. In conclusion the CT scan pre-operative planning for MAKO robotic knee joint replacement can predict 100% times the size of tibia, within one size of femur and insert for TKR. These figures are better than published predictability of templates of plain radiographs where implant size was predicted 42% for femoral and 37% acetabular components while 87% of the femoral components and 78% of the acetabular cups were accurate within one size up and down."

Se han estudiado las posibles múltiples causas de esta insatisfacción, tomando mucha fuerza en el último tiempo el debate en torno al tipo de alineamiento utilizado en cirugía protésica de rodilla, sobre todo, considerando el advenimiento y las ventajas que trajo consigo la cirugía robótica. El alineamiento mecánico, se ha considerado a lo largo de los años como el estándar de oro en prótesis de rodilla, pero durante el siglo XXI se han creado nuevas filosofías, muchas de ellas gracias a los avances en cirugía robótica. En el presente trabajo dividiremos los alineamientos en 3 grandes grupos, se comentarán las características generales de cada uno, así como también el enfoque actual utilizado en nuestra institución, donde creemos que la cirugía robótica llegó para cambiar el juego.
Abstract Total knee arthroplasty is a widely used surgery to treat moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis, usually with favorable outcomes but a controversial patient dissatisfaction rate. Potential multiple causes of this dissatisfaction have been extensively studied, with a recent growing debate surrounding the type of alignment for knee arthroplasty, especially considering the advent and advantages brought by robotic surgery. Over the years, mechanical alignment has been the gold standard in knee arthroplasty. However, in the 21st century, new rationales have emerged, many resulting from robotic surgery. In this study, we categorized alignments into three major groups, discussing the general characteristics of each one and the current approach used in our institution, believing robotic surgery is a game changer."

pub.1168717721,Computer-Assisted Navigation in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Total hip arthroplasty is an art of reproducing the biomechanics of the hip joint. A good pre-operative planning is essential, which is a challenge as it is done in 2D radiographs for a 3D joint. Using conventional techniques, it is even harder to reproduce the pre-operative plan intraoperatively. Technical help minimises the errors. Computer-assisted navigation is one such help. It helps with the reproduction of the plan as it gives intra-operative real-time feedback to the surgeon. Thus, surgeon can achieve pre-planned position and orientation of the prosthesis, reproducing the biomechanics. This in turn helps with leg length and offset change as planned. This helps with balancing the soft tissues and minimising the complications."
pub.1143438157,Individualized Functional Knee Alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Robotic-assisted Technique," Introduction: The use of robotic technology is becoming a well-recognized alternative to conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The quantitative soft tissue information generated in robotic surgery can be used to balance the knee and achieve functional alignment (FA) of the components. This paper describes a novel FA technique using an individualized preoperative plan that is then adjusted to achieve soft tissue balance.   Materials and Methods: We report on surgical technique, indications, considerations, and complications after our experience of performing 650 functionally aligned TKAs. We collected 2-year patient reported outcomes on 165 TKAs in this series (165 of 193 TKAs have reached 2 years follow-up in the series of 650 TKAs; 85% follow-up rate).   Results:  We found significant postoperative improvements with few infections and no revisions for mechanical reasons 2 years after surgery with this technique. Patients had improved knee range-of-motion (105 degrees° flexion preoperatively vs. 125 degrees flexion postoperatively; P <0.001), higher Forgotten Joint Scores (17 preoperatively vs. 77 postoperatively; P <0.001), improved Oxford Knee Scores (22 preoperatively vs. 43 postoperatively; P <0.001), higher KOOS Jr scores (48 preoperatively vs. 88 postoperatively; P <0.001) and lower visual analogue score pain scores (70 preoperatively vs. 12 postoperatively; P <0.001) 2 years postoperatively.    Discussion: The described surgical technique is a promising method for conducting a robotic TKA. Benefits of FA include improved efficiency with preresection balancing, reduced soft tissue releases compared with a mechanical alignment technique, and accurate bony cuts with robotic assistance. Further studies are required to compare this technique with established methods to determine any differences in outcomes. "

pub.1169296781,Roboterassistierte Knieendoprothetik,"Restoration of a neutral lower limb alignment was considered the gold standard in total knee arthroplasty (TKA); however, as 10–20% of the patients are dissatisfied following TKA, alternative alignment philosophies were proposed in order to improve clinical and functional outcomes. Indeed, previously published studies report a wide variability of coronal lower limb alignment, suggesting that a correction to neutral inevitably changes the patients’ natural alignment to an unphysiological state associated with altered ligament balance and overall joint kinematics in a relevant proportion of cases. As a consequence, personalized alignment strategies, which aim to restore the patient’s constitutional alignment, have gained popularity in TKA. Preoperative analysis of the patient’s individual knee phenotype is crucial for a personalized arthroplasty approach. Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) classification defines 9 distinct knee phenotypes by the combination of coronal leg alignment and joint line orientation and allows for the assessment of the prearthritic lower limb alignment. With the implementation of robotic technologies (rTKA), these highly individualized alignment strategies can be precisely applied. Intraoperative virtual component placement allows for real-time simulation of postoperative alignment and gap balance. Using rTKA, the intraoperative plan is executed with high precision, thus targeted component alignment is achieved accurately and alignment outliers are significantly reduced compared to conventional TKA. This article summarizes current evidence on constitutional knee phenotypes and alternative alignment strategies. Finally, we propose an approach for the application of CPAK classification in total knee arthroplasty using robotic technology."

                    Aims
                    Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) has been introduced to provide accurate bone cuts and help achieve the target knee alignment, along with symmetric gap balancing. The purpose of this study was to determine if any early clinical benefits could be realized following TKA using robotic-assisted technology.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    In all, 140 consecutive patients undergoing RA-TKA and 127 consecutive patients undergoing conventional TKA with minimum six-week follow-up were reviewed. Differences in visual analogue scores (VAS) for pain at rest and with activity, postoperative opiate usage, and length of stay (LOS) between the RA-TKA and conventional TKA groups were compared.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Patients undergoing RA-TKA had lower average VAS pain scores at rest (p = 0.001) and with activity (p = 0.03) at two weeks following the index procedure. At the six-week interval, the RA-TKA group had lower VAS pain scores with rest (p = 0.03) and with activity (p = 0.02), and required 3.2 mg less morphine equivalents per day relative to the conventional group (p < 0.001). At six weeks, a significantly greater number of patients in the RA-TKA group were free of opioid use compared to the conventional TKA group; 70.7% vs 57.0% (p = 0.02). Patients in the RA-TKA group had a shorter LOS; 1.9 days versus 2.3 days (p < 0.001), and also had a greater percentage of patient discharged on postoperative day one; 41.3% vs 20.5% (p < 0.001).
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Patients undergoing RA-TKA had lower pain levels at both rest and with activity, required less opioid medication, and had a shorter LOS.

pub.1160305920,The role of robotics in trauma and orthopaedics,"Whilst robotics have been used in surgery since their first application in neurosurgical biopsies in 1985, many surgeons have limited familiarity or experience with robotics through access or exposure to current or developing applications, particularly the systems that have brought robotics to orthopaedics. This paper reviews the well-established applications of operative orthopaedic robotics, developing and future applications, and extraoperative surgical robotics, with due consideration to their limitations. This review describes the different types of fundamental robotic systems, including master–slave, passive, semi-active and active systems. Its discussion of system types gives the reader insight into the different relationships between surgeon and robot, varying from full active systems, autonomous image-based surgical operating, through to the master–slave direct relationship with the surgeon, with the robot's replication of the surgeon's live tracked movements. A review of widely adopted systems within arthroplasty and developing concepts allows the reader to develop their understanding of how these systems operate and their future potential, giving a broad understanding of robotics. This narrative review discusses the fundamentals of orthopaedic robotics, as systematic reviews of each application, their data sets and evidence have been documented elsewhere. The paper concludes by highlighting the advantages of robotic systems in orthopaedic surgery, such as precision and reproducibility, and insight into the future of orthopaedic robotics and provides a useful basis for understanding the role of robotics in orthopaedics and their potential applications for surgeons."

pub.1140441208,Is Robotic TKA Having Added Advantage over Conventional TKA? A Comparative Study of Functional and Radiological Outcome of Robotic versus Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Abstract Objective Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is most commonly performed procedure in patients who are not showing improvement in pain, activities of daily living, and quality of life by conservative modalities. Precise component implantation and soft tissue management is required to achieve desired outcome following TKA. 1.3% patients remain disappointed due to persistent pain, 24% due to instability, and 2.5% due to malalignment following TKA. Robotic TKA is associated with the use of customized implants and bone cuts leading to precise component implantation and reduced deviation from mechanical axis in coronal, transverse, and sagittal plane and proper soft tissue management. This study compares conventional against robotic TKA in terms of clinical, functional, and radiological outcome. Materials and Methods This is a prospective randomized control trial carried over period of 3 years where patients were selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly divided into both groups and compared using their pre- and postoperative radiological and functional outcomes as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications and statistical significance of difference was calculated. Results There was no significant difference in terms of ROM, KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), (Knee Society Score) KSS, Eq. 5D, (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) WOMAC, and (visual analog scale) VAS scores while we found significant difference in mechanical axis deviation, femoral and tibial implant alignment in both planes. Discussion Advantages of using robotic TKA are customized preoperative planning, implants, cuts, accuracy of the intraoperative procedure, and radiological superiority with no significant differences in clinical and functional outcomes. In fact, robotic TKA is associated with steep learning curve, increased cost, and operative time. Still there are no added complications caused by it."

These data were then compared to a sample of patients operated on by standard manual technique. Both groups were operated on by the same surgical team, in the same hospital, and were subjected to the same recommendation and rehabilitation protocols. Surgeries were performed from November 2017 to March 2019 at a hospital in Asl Toscana Sudest. Endpoint of our study is to verify the rate of improvement – which is assumed to be stable one year after surgery – and how the satisfaction rate increases over time. Another aim is to determine – through the use of Forgotten Joint Score questionnaires and the satisfaction scale – whether there is a difference between arthroplasty operated on by standard manual technique vs robotic-assisted method one year after surgery. Method: Patients who undergone robotic-assisted surgery were evaluated before surgery, at discharge, 1, 4 and 12 months after surgery. 70 robotic-assisted THA patients were studied for a whole year, while 31 standard-technique THA patients were evaluated only 12 months after surgery. PROMs post-surgical evaluations occurred during follow-up visits by orthopedists and physiotherapists. Harris Hip Score (HHs), Oxford Hip score (OHS), EQol VAS (Dimension Visual Analogue Scale), LiKert satisfaction scales were used. Likert scale was administered only 4 and 12 months after (no significant results before this time). The Forgotten Joint Scale (FJS) and the satisfaction scale were administered 1 year after surgery both in robotic-assisted and standard manual THA patients (70 robotic-assisted THA vs 31 standard THA). They were operated on in the same period by the same surgical team, with the presence of a senior surgeon, and were subjected to the same rehabilitation protocols by the same team of physiotherapists.Results: 70 robotic-assisted THA were analyzed (30 l, 40r), with a mean age of 63, 76 years. The average hospital stay in acute care settings was 3.07 days. 40 patients then continued in the rehabilitation department after discharge for further 2.98 days. HHs scale gave a value of 54, 94±14, 71 before surgery and 98, 63±2, 54 one year after surgery. OHS scale reported a value of 21, 27±9, 24 before surgery and 47±2, 06 one year after surgery.

Despite logbook evaluation and surgical work-based assessments, the question remains: can registrars perform elective surgery upon qualification? In South Africa, obstacles to elective surgical training include the trauma workload, financial constraints, fellowships and the Covid pandemic. In hip and knee arthroplasty, new approaches like the direct anterior approach (DAA) and robotic-assisted knee surgery also contributed to the dilution of cases available for registrar training. There are concerns that orthopaedic registrars do not perform enough cases to achieve surgical proficiency. Review of the last 4 years of registrar logbooks in hip and knee arthroplasty surgery performed in a single tertiary academic hospital in South Africa. We included all primary total hip replacements (THR), total knee replacements (TKR) and hemiarthroplasties (HA) done for neck of femur (NOF) fractures between 1 April 2019 and 30 March 2023. Differentiation between registrar assisting, registrar performing with consultant supervision and registrar performing independent surgery was done. 990 hip arthroplasties (472 Primary THR, 216 NOF THR, 302 NOF HA) and 316 Primary TKR were performed during the study period. In primary elective THR the posterior approach was dominant and used in 76% of cases. In NOF THA the DAA was dominant used in 98% of cases. Primary TKR robotic-assisted technologies was used in 27% (n=94) cases. Registrars as the primary surgeon were the highest in NOF THA at 70% of cases and the lowest performing TKR at 25%. During 3-month rotations, an average registrar performed 12 (2 TKR and 10 THR) and assisted in 35 (10 TKR and 25 THR) cases.

Robotic assisted surgery (RAS) with navigation (NAV) has been proposed as a potential solution to assist surgeons when performing these difficult cases. Here, we present the case of a complex primary TKA in a patient with posttraumatic valgus arthritis performed using a novel RAS system with NAV. Appropriate balance was unable to be achieved with bony cuts alone, as the knee was found to be tight laterally in extension following bone preparation. Soft tissue releases were ultimately required. Use of the novel RAS system with NAV allowed for a titrated soft tissue release resulting in a balanced knee without overcorrection of the patient’s deformity. We also present a similar case of a patient with valgus knee OA in which there was residual tightness laterally in flexion. The different management strategies for each of these cases is discussed. Finally, we provide a review of the available literature regarding TKA in valgus knee OA and propose a new classification system and treatment algorithm that can be employed using a novel RAS system with predictive balancing technology to achieve optimal alignment and soft tissue balancing in valgus knees that remain unbalanced following bony cuts."
pub.1168318368,Comparative Analysis of the Immediate Post-operative Outcomes between Conventional and Fully Automatic Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: Different techniques employed during conventional and robotic assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty may lead to variation in the immediate post-operative outcomes. Primary objective of the study was to evaluate the differences in the post-operative pain, analgesics use and length of stay between the RA-TKA and C-TKA. Secondary objective was to study the patient reported outcome measures at six months post TKA. Materials & Methods: It is a retrospective review of two cohort of patients (C -TKA and RA-TKA) who were operated between January to April 2022. Patients were given the option between C-TKA and RA- TKA. Sample size was estimated to be 28 patients in each group with α error of 0.05 and power of study being 80%. An independent observer analyzed the post-operative parameters like analgesic use, length of stay, VAS score and Oxford Knee Score at 6 months post TKA. Results: 30 patients in two cohorts were studied. There was no statistically significant difference between the two cohorts as regards the pre-operative patient characteristics. RA- TKA group had a shorter hospital stay (days) than the C-TKA group (3.24±0.50 and 4.07± 0.52, P <0.0001). Pain score (VAS score) was lower in RA -TKA than C-TKA cohort (POD1 5.23 ± 0.50 and 5.93 ± 0.52 POD2 4.40 ± 0.56 and 5.03 ± 0.49, p value <0.0001). R- TKA patients required significantly lower morphine milligram equivalent and NSAIDS than the C-TKA patients (p =0.0005 and p <0.001 respectively). The OKS at 6 months was lower in C-TKA than RA-TKA (32.5± 2.3 C-TKA vs. 33.8±1.5 RA-TKA, p value 0.0120). Conclusions: RA,-TKA cohort showed significant early advantages like decreased post-operative analgesia usage, shorter length of stay and lower pain scores on day 1 and 2 than the C TKA group. The OKS at 6 months was slightly better in RA-TKA vs. C-TKA. Keywords: Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty, Conventional total knee arthroplasty, Visual analog scale score, Analgesic."

One such technology that has been developed and implemented for high-volume orthopaedic practice is the use of a robotic-assistant system. The Robotic Surgical Assistant (ROSA, ZimmerBiomet, Warsaw, IN) allows for the surgeon to maintain full autonomy and control of operative decision-making while providing precise, objective, and real-time data for intraoperative adjustments, thus allowing the surgeon to both individualize and reproduce the Total Knee Replacement. This article explains a high volume Surgeon’s experience utilizing this technology, its potential benefits, and how it can be implemented for use in high-throughput private orthopaedic practice."

Tools range from image analysis for 3D exploration of diagnostic information to surgical navigation where the geometrical relationships of instruments and implants are displayed relative to anatomical structures. These capabilities have led to a re-thinking process on how anatomical structures and their relationships should be adequately described. Also, through a less subjectivity-prone relationship description-methodology, an effort to more accurately understand the consequences of a certain therapy action involving geometrical realignment of anatomical structures is underway.

A case study on alignment and balancing for TKA.,"Computer technology is ubiquitous and relied upon in virtually all professional activities. Confounding this is orthopaedic surgery where less than 5% of surgeons are using computer-assisted technologies routinely. However, the impact of Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS) may go beyond adoption in theatre.
                  We searched pubmed for all knee arthroplasty papers concerning knee alignment and balancing between 1976 and 2016, dividing the results into those related to CAOS and those not.  Results were grouped by technology.
                  Between 2001 and 2008, the number of publications regarding knee navigation multiplied by 20 mainly focused on this topic of alignment and balancing, with alignment papers paralleled between navigation and non-navigation until 2010. After 2010, when navigation publications decline the number of articles related to the knee alignment and balancing without navigation increased granting the value of assessing accurately intraoperative kinematic data to improve Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) outcomes. From 2008, patient specific instrumentation (PSI) publications greatly increase, but navigation decreases, while robotic publications rise from 2014.
                  CAOS surgery publications on the search topic of alignment and balancing increased greatly between 2001 and 2018 which may suggest the impact of CAOS technology on this important knee orthopaedic forum segment."
pub.1036837882,Robotic Arm-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: Preoperative Planning and Surgical Technique,"Since its introduction, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been controversial because of poor early clinical outcomes due to implant design, bony fixation, surgical instrumentation, and technique. Improvements in surgical technique and implant design have resulted in improved results and greater survivorship. The ability to obtain accurate implant placement includes avoiding independent as well as combined potential errors. Alignment in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes on each prepared condyle as well as the preservation of the joint line and the resulting overall limb alignment are critical to obtain a successful outcome. Relating to surgical technique, early failure of UKAs results from poor bone preparation, implant malposition, aseptic loosening of the tibial and femoral component, overloading the contralateral compartment, and poor cement technique."
pub.1122138883,1-Year Patient Outcomes for Robotic-Arm Assisted vs. Manual Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Introduction:
                  Robotic-arm assisted (RAA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been shown to potentially have certain pre- and intra-operative advantages over manual techniques. Although there are many studies on the alignment advantages when using the robotic-arm assisted (RAA) system for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there have been questions regarding patient-reported outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use this index to compare: 1) total; 2) physical function; and 3) pain scores for manual vs. RAA patients.
                  Methods:
                  We compared 53 consecutive robotic-arm assisted to 53 consecutive manual TKAs. No differences in pre-operative scores were found between the cohorts. Patients were administered a modified WOMAC satisfaction survey pre-operatively, and at 1-year post-operatively. Univariate analyses and multivariate models with stepwise backward linear regression were utilized to evaluate the associations between outcome scores and surgical technique, age, sex, as well as body mass index (BMI).
                  Results:
                  The RAA cohort had significantly improved mean total (6±6 vs. 9±8 points, p=0.03) and physical function scores (4±4 vs. 6±5 points, p=0.02) when compared to the manual cohort. The mean pain score for the RAA cohort [2±3 points (range, 0 to 14 points)], was also lower than that for the manual cohort [3±4 points (range, 0 to 11 points) (p=0.06)].
                  On backward linear regression analyses, RAA was found to be significantly associated with more improved total (beta coefficient [β]-0.208, SE [standard error] 1.401, p<0.05), function (β=0.216, SE=0.829, p<0.05), and pain scores (β-0.181, SE=0.623, p=0.063). The RAA technique was found to have the strongest association with improved scores.
                  Conclusion:
                  With newer surgical technologies constantly being introduced, it is imperative to continue to evaluate these new modalities, particularly in their abilities to improve patient satisfaction outcomes. This study suggests that RAA patients may have short term improvements at minimum 1-year post-operative. However, longer-term follow up with greater sample sizes are needed to further validate these findings."
pub.1171550503,IN VIVO ACCURACY OF A NEW ROBOTICALLY ASSISTED SYSTEM FOR TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY," Introduction Recent technological advancements have led to the introduction of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty to improve the accuracy and precision of bony resections and implant position. However, the in vivo accuracy is not widely reported. The primary objective of this study is to determine the accuracy and precision of a cut block positioning robotic arm.   Method Seventy-seven patients underwent total knee arthroplasty with various workflows and alignment targets by three arthroplasty-trained surgeons with previous experience using the ROSA® Knee System. Accuracy and precision were determined by measuring the difference between various workflow time points, including the final pre-operative plan, validated resection angle, and post-operative radiographs. The mean difference between the measurements determined accuracy, and the standard deviation represented precision.   Results The accuracy and precision for all angles comparing the final planned resection and validated resection angles was 0.90° ± 0.76°. The proportion within 3° ranged from 97.9% to 100%. The accuracy and precision for all angles comparing the final intra- operative plan and post-operative radiographs was 1.95 ± 1.48°. The proportion of patients within 3° was 93.2%, 95.3%, 96.6%, and 71.4% for the distal femur, proximal tibia, femoral flexion, and tibial slope angles when the final intra-operative plan was compared to post-operative radiographs. No patients had a postoperative complication requiring revision at the final follow-up.   Conclusions This study demonstrates that the ROSA Knee System has accurate and precise coronal plane resections with few outliers. However, the tibial slope demonstrated decreased accuracy and precision were measured on post-operative short-leg lateral radiographs with this platform. "

pub.1126082746,The Place for Innovative Technology,"The perioperative management of lower extremity total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients is constantly evolving. Several innovations have been developed to facilitate rapid recovery after these procedures. Some of the outcomes that are targeted for improvement include reducing perioperative complications, decreasing length of hospital stay, promoting early functional recovery, and improving patient satisfaction. Technology has been developed to address these objectives in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. The development of mobile health platforms and telehealth systems for preoperative education has shown to improve patient participation compared to in-person presurgical classes. Intraoperative innovations with robotic-assisted arthroplasty may effectively reduce postoperative pain and length of hospital stay. Postoperative technology with wearable technology and mobile applications has allowed closer monitoring of patient outcomes and functionality. These innovations may reduce cost of home care, physical therapy, and other services while maintaining or even improving patient outcomes. All of these new technologies for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care will be reviewed."
pub.1148868477,Novel total hip surgery robotic system based on self-localization and optical measurement,"This paper presents the development and experimental evaluation of a surgical
robotic system for total hip arthroplasty (THA). Although existing robotic
systems used in joint replacement surgery have achieved some progresses, the
robot arm must be situated accurately at the target position during operation,
which depends significantly on the experience of the surgeon. In addition,
handheld acetabulum reamers typically exhibit uneven strength and grinding
file. Moreover, the lack of techniques to real-time measure femoral neck length
may lead to poor outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a real-time
traceable optical positioning strategy to reduce unnecessary manual adjustments
to the robotic arm during surgery, an end-effector system to stabilise
grinding, and an optical probe to provide real-time measurement of the femoral
neck length and other parameters used to choose the proper prosthesis. The
lengths of the lower limbs are measured as the prosthesis is installed. The
experimental evaluation results show that, based on its accuracy, execution
ability, and robustness, the proposed surgical robotic system is feasible for
THA."
pub.1111037703,Robotic Surgery in the Orthopedic Field,"Of the many factors that affect the clinical outcomes of orthopedic surgery, the surgical procedure is the most important. Robotics have been developed to perform the surgical procedures more accurately and consistently. Robotic surgical procedures in the orthopedic field were developed 20 years ago. Some designs of surgical robots have disappeared due to practical problems and complications, and an another design of surgical robots is emerging. To date, the use of robot surgery in arthroplasty is still controversial in terms of the clinical outcomes, practicality, and cost-effectiveness, even though it has been reported to be effective in the alignment and positioning of components in the field of artificial joints. Early robotic surgery was based mainly on active robot surgery according to the scheduled operation without the intervention of the operator. Recently the semi-active system of robotic surgery has been introduced. In a semi-active system, the robot constrains the surgeon to a haptic boundary defined by the computer based on the 3-dimensional imaging preoperative plan, and the operator can change the preoperative plan through real-time feedback during operation."

Patients with limited preoperative range of motion (ROM) are inherently at risk for worse outcomes. Prior literature has demonstrated the utility of robotic-assisted TKA (raTKA) regarding gap balancing and coronal deformity, however it has not been previously described in context of the preoperatively stiff knee. Here, we report a case of a patient undergoing primary TKA for severe osteoarthritis with significant preoperative stiffness resulting in severely limited ROM of only 5 degrees. This was performed with the use of a navigated raTKA system in conjunction with dynamic predictive balancing technology. With this method, the knee was balanced through bony cuts without the need for extensive soft tissue releases. This patient had excellent improvement in ROM and KOOS Scores at 3-month follow up. This patient’s early post-operative results demonstrate the potential benefits of utilizing raTKA for preoperative stiff knees and may lay groundwork for future literature."

Robotic-arm assisted technology is designed to constrain a sawblade in a haptic zone to help ensure that only the desired bone cuts are made. The objective of this cadaver study was to quantify the extent of soft tissue damage sustained during TKA through a robotic-arm assisted (RATKA) haptically guided approach and conventional MTKA approach. Four surgeons each prepared 3 RATKA and 3 MTKA specimens for cruciate retaining TKAs. RATKA was performed on one knee, with MTKA on the other. Postoperatively, 2 additional blinded surgeons, assessed and graded damage to 14 key anatomic structures. A Kruskal-Wallis hypothesis test was performed to assess for statistical differences of soft tissue damages between RATKA and MTKA cases. A p-value <0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance, and p-values were adjusted for ties. Significantly less damage occurred to the PCL in the RATKA than the MTKA specimens (p<0.0001). RATKA specimens had less damage to the dMCL (p=.149), ITB (p=0.580), popliteus (p=0.248), and patellar ligament (p=0.317). The results of this study indicate that RATKA may result in less soft-tissue damage than MTKA, especially to the PCL."

Robots have been used to operate on humans for 20 years, but the adoption of the technology has lagged behind that of the manufacturing industry. The use of robots in surgery should enable cost savings by reducing instrumentation and inventories, and improving accuracy.

pub.1122138882,One and Two Year Postoperative Patient Reported Outcomes of Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty is a successful procedure. However, there is still area for improvement as up to 15-20% of patients remain unsatisfied. Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) may improve patient outcomes by providing a reproducible way of obtaining neutral mechanical alignment of the limb, which has been shown to reduce early revisions and correlate with patient reported outcomes after surgery.
                  We prospectively enrolled 106 patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA by a single surgeon performing a measured-resection femur-first technique using the OMNIBotic system. Patients completed a KOOS and New Knee Society Score (KSS) pre-operatively and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (M) postoperatively. Changes in the five KOOS sub-scales were compared to available literature data from the FORCE – TJR cohort, as well as to individual studies reporting on conventional and computer-assisted TKA.
                  When compared to FORCE-TJR 6-month (M) and 2-year (Y) data, the RAS cohort had significantly higher improvements at 6M for pain (40.5 vs. 31.1, p<.001) and at 2Y for all five KOOS sub-scores. The larger improvement was due to the RAS cohort having lower baseline KOOS scores than the FORCE-TJR cohort, except for the Sports-Recreation sub-score, which was similar pre- operatively but significantly higher post-operatively for the robotic cohort. Rates of dissatisfaction with knee pain level and function using the KSS after RAS were 3.0%, 1.0%, and 2.7% at 6, 12, and 24M postoperatively, respectively.
                  Despite having poorer joint function and higher pain pre-operatively, robotic-assisted TKA patients achieved excellent self-reported outcomes, with significantly higher levels of improvement through two years post-surgery when compared with large national cohort studies. Further controlled clinical studies are warranted to determine if these results translate to other groups of surgeons, centers and patients."
pub.1162768041,HOW MUCH CAN A SURGEON TRUST A ROBOT FOR HIP ARTHROPLASTY?,"The variables involved in a robotic THA can exceed 52: many parameters as pelvic orientation with CT scan, templating, offset, and leg-length, acetabular reaming, femoral osteotomy, mapping the anatomy; predefining safe zones, robotic execution, femoral head size, thickness of PE etc. with several variables for each parameter, with a total number of variables exceeding 52. This familiar number is the number of cards in a standard deck. The number of possible combinations (factorial 52! = 10^67) to shuffle the cards (and may be to perform a THA) is greater than the number of atoms on earth! Thinking that artificial intelligence and robotics can solve these problems, some surgeons and implant manufacturers have turned to artificial intelligence and robotics. We asked two questions:1) can robot with artificial intelligence really process 52 variables that represent 10^67 combinations? 2) the safety of the technology was ascertained by interrogating Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database about software-related recalls in computer-assisted and robotic arthroplasty [1], between 2017 and 2022.    1) The best computers can only calculate around 100 thousand billion combinations (10^14), and with difficulty: it takes more than 100 days to arrive at this number of digits (10^14) after the decimal point for the number π (pi). We can, therefore, expect the robot to be imperfect.   2) For the FDA software-related recalls, 4634 units were involved. The FDA determined root causes were: software design (66.6%), design change (22.2%), manufacturing deployment (5.6%), design manufacturing process (5.6%). Among the manufacturers’ reasons for recalls, a specific error was declared in 88.9%. a coding error in 43.8%. 94.4% software-related recalls were classified as class 2. Return of the device was the main action taken by firms (44.4%), followed by software update (38.9%).   3) In the same period, no robot complained about its surgeon!    Hip surgeon is as intelligent as a robot and almost twice as safe."
pub.1172563821,Partial Knee Replacements,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a reliable treatment modality for osteoarthritis of the knee that is mainly limited to one knee compartment. Isolated medial compartment arthritis is the most common manifestation, which is due to the mechanical axis alignment of the lower extremity that places 60% of weight-bearing forces through the medial compartment in a normally aligned limb. In combination with physical exam, radiographs are the standard imaging modality to aid in diagnosis of isolated knee compartment disease that would benefit from UKA compared to a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Positioning of the implants in UKA is of the utmost importance. Implants that are too small or do not match the native knee anatomy may lead to instability, while implants that are too large or “over-stuffed” may place excess pressure on the contralateral knee compartment. This excess pressure can cause progressive osteoarthritis of the remaining native compartments and an overall painful knee. Robotic assistance may be utilized for UKA to improve implant positioning compared to conventional, jig-based UKA. Aseptic loosening and progression of arthritis in the previously unaffected knee compartments are the most common complications associated with UKA. Advantages of UKA over TKA include faster recovery and return to function, fewer complications, and maintenance of native unaffected bone and soft tissue anatomy, while presenting only potentially marginally inferior longevity."

pub.1085250766,Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: state of the art,"The popularity of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for the treatment of isolated compartment osteoarthritis of the knee has risen over the past 2 decades. Currently, UKA covers 10% of all knee arthroplasties worldwide. Although indications have been extended, results have proven that patient selection plays a critical role in the success of UKA. From the current perspective, age, body mass index, patellofemoral osteoarthritis, anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and chondrocalcinosis are no longer absolute contraindications for UKA. Motivated by the desire to improve survivorship rates, patient-reported outcomes and reduce complications, there have been many technological advances in the field of UKA over the recent years. The aim of this review was to evaluate the current indications, surgical techniques, modes of failure and survivorship results of UKA, by assessing a thorough review of modern literature. Several studies show that innovations in implant design, fixation methods and surgical techniques have led to good-to-excellent long-term survivorship, functional outcomes and less complications. Until now, resurgence of interest of cementless designs is noted according to large national registries to address problems associated with cementation. The future perspective on the usage of UKA, in particular the cementless design, looks promising. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in robotic-assisted techniques in order to optimise result by controlled soft-tissue balancing and reproduce alignment in UKA. Future advances in robotics, most likely in the field of planning and setup, will be valuable in optimising patient-specific UKA."
pub.1135264772,A Detailed analysis of Time taken in Robotic Surgery for Total Knee Replacement Arthroplasty and comparison with computer assisted navigation in Total Knee Replacement Arthroplasty,"The accuracy of implantation using computer navigation and robotic total knee replacement (TKR) has been proven. Time taken during surgery has been a factor for surgeons for not using the technology. Aim of this study was to analyse time taken in different steps and identify which part needs improvement. Robotic time was compared to computer navigation. Methods: 15TKR were performed with MAKO robot. Software for the ligament balancing was used. All had CT scan preoperatively. Time of different surgical steps was recorded. Time for computer navigation was recorded too. After joint exposure, trackers and verification pins for tibia and femur were inserted. Femoral registration matching started at 10.8 minutes (SD3.3 Range7-20). It took 3.2 minutes to match femoral anatomy to CT scan. Tibial registration done at 14.1minutes (SD3 Range10- 23). Once matching was accepted to required accuracy, tibial cut was made at 22.2 minutes (SD4.4 Range 15-30). Next the soft tissues were assessed with tensioner. It took 6.3 minutes (SD 5.6). Final femoral preparation done at 35.7 minutes (SD 5.6 Range25-45). Trial performed at 52 minutes (SD7.3 Range42-63). Implants were cemented at 63.4 minutes (SD8 Range50-72). Wound closed at 77.6 minutes (SD9.5 Range65-97). The computer navigated TKR surgery took 70 minutes on an average. Compared to navigation, robotic technique took approximately 7 minutes longer, not significantly different. This could be due to learning curve of the surgical and theatre team. Improvement is required in different steps. The familiarity of staff will increase the efficiency. Registration matching took 11.4 minutes. Femoral preparation took 17 minutes. These steps could be streamlined."

pub.1148410044,Patient-specific Instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most successful surgeries done in modern era. The volume of the TKA surgery has risen exponentially in the last two decades. Quantum leaps in surgical techniques, improved implant designs, metallurgy, and manufacturing technology have contributed immensely to achieve the present day superior outcomes, low complication rates, long-term implant survival, and high patient satisfaction rates worldwide. With the prevalent conventional surgical pathways and widely available high performance implants, presently 15-year survivorship of TKA is reported well above 90%; possible newer avenues to improve outcomes in the knee arthroplasty surgery are likely to come forth with the evolution of computer-aided surgery (CAS), robotics, customized instrumentation, and implants. Patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) in TKA surgery is one such innovative technology with a promising future. With rapid advancements in Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology commonly referred to as 3D printing and availability of advanced 3D modeling software; PSI in TKA surgery has emerged as a versatile tool to fill in the vast gap between conventional instrumentation and costly alternatives like CAS and robotic surgery in addressing some of the surgical issues affecting outcomes and implant survival in TKA surgery. To be universally acceptable for mainstream applications, it is imperative that future technologies are not only highly effective but also remain time and cost-efficient."
pub.1164020187,An Early-stage Comparison of Functional Outcomes Following Robotic-assisted Versus Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis," Introduction: Conventional total knee arthroplasty (cTKA) is used to relieve pain and restore knee function and stability. Robotic-assisted TKA (rTKA) was introduced to improve the placement of surgical implants, decrease postoperative complications, and improve implant longevity. To date, studies examining functional outcomes and patient-reported pain between rTKA and cTKA in the short-term postoperative period are limited, and a meta-analysis of such early-stage outcomes has yet to be accomplished. Our study aims to evaluate the differences in function, alignment, and pain between rTKA and cTKA within 6 months postoperatively through meta-analysis.   Materials and Methods: A literature search of the PubMed and Cochrane electronic databases was performed in December 2021 with Medical Subject Headings and search terms limited to “knee replacement,” “knee arthroplasty,” and “robotic knee surgery.” Subsequent analysis was conducted on all retrieved studies written in English.   Results:  Thirteen clinical studies were considered for systematic review, of which nine were included in meta-analysis. 1,336 cases of TKA were analyzed: RTKA ( n = 618) and cTKA ( n = 718). There were no significant differences between rTKA and cTKA in range of motion (mean difference,-0.08°; P = 0.55), functional score of the Knee Society Score (mean difference, 0.04; P = 0.78), oxford knee score (mean difference, −0.04; P = 0.81), and Functional score of the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC-F) (mean difference, −0.42; P = 0.41). There were no significant pain differences in Short Form Health Survey Bodily Pain (mean difference, −0.08; P = 0.64) and pain score of the WOMAC (WOMAC-P) (mean difference, −0.25; P = 0.47). However, rTKA subjects achieved more accurate mechanical axis alignment than cTKA subjects (mean difference, −0.50°; P < 0.01).    Conclusion: Although limb alignment correction is more accurate in rTKA than cTKA, functional and pain metrics are comparable between the two procedures within 6 months’ follow-up, suggesting no added clinical benefits for rTKA versus cTKA.

pub.1050114792,Navigation and Robotics for Orthopaedic Surgery,"Computer assisted surgery (CAS) systems such as surgical robots and surgical navigation were clinically introduced into the field of orthopaedic surgery in the 1990’s. The first surgical robot was the ROBODOC, which milled bone for implants according to preoperative CT-based planning. More flexible navigation systems were then developed following the advent of position sensors which could be used in the surgical field. Spine and hip applications used CT-based navigation which required registration of each real object and its virtual model. Imageless navigation was used for total knee arthroplasty. These CAS systems have been reported to provide better radiographic results in pedicle screw insertion and total joint arthroplasties compared with procedures performed without them. It was initially thought both systems would help inexperienced surgeons to perform like experienced surgeons. However, eliminating human error in handling these systems is still an issue and training is necessary to bring out the benefits of their use while avoiding accidents due to misuse. On the other hand, simple CAS systems such as fluoro-navigation were developed to reduce OR time and radiation exposure. Their applications were expanded to fracture, spine, and joint surgeries. Recently, a tide of minimally invasion surgery (MIS) has come to orthopaedic surgeries and the role of CAS in the safe and accurate execution of MIS procedures has been recognized. In line with this, some navigation and robotic systems have started to be used for MIS total hip and knee arthroplasties. To enhance CAS for MIS procedures, we developed two types of systems. One uses laser guidance to control the entry point and direction of any straight surgical tools. The laser beams project directly into the surgical field indicating a point on the tissue concerned and illuminating straight tools to show the direction in which they should be operated. We used this laser guidance system clinically for acetabular reaming and cup placement in total hip arthroplasty; for femoral head preparation in hip resurfacing arthroplasty; and for pedicle screw insertion. Laser guidance increased the feasibility of navigation systems; however, 1mm and 1degree are the limits of accuracy with a hand-held tool. As a system to control of straight surgical tools more accurately than laser guidance, we developed a needle insertion robot."

pub.1163699363,Robotic Systems and Navigation Techniques in Orthopedics: A Historical Review,"Since the da Vinci surgical system was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, the development and deployment of various robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) systems have been largely expedited and boomed. With the rapid advancement of robotic techniques in recent decades, robot-assisted systems have been widely used in various surgeries including orthopedics. These robot-related techniques are transforming the conventional ways to conduct surgical procedures. Robot-assisted orthopedic surgeries have become more and more popular due to their potential benefits of increased accuracy and precision in surgical outcomes, enhanced reproducibility, reduced technical variability, decreased pain, and faster recovery time. In this paper, robotic systems and navigation techniques in typical orthopedic surgeries are reviewed, especially for arthroplasty. From the perspective of robotics and engineering, the systems and techniques are divided into two main categories, i.e., robotic systems (RSs), and computer-aided navigation systems (CANSs). The former is further divided into autonomous RS, hands-on RS, and teleoperated RS. For the latter, three key elements in CANS are introduced, including 3D modeling, registration, and navigation. Lastly, the potential advantages and disadvantages of the RS and CANS are summarized and discussed. Future perspectives on robotics in orthopedics, as well as the challenges, are presented."
pub.1151575979,Navigation und Robotik,"Total knee arthroplasty ranked 14th among the 20 most frequently performed surgical procedures in Germany in 2020. Thus, the implantation of a knee endoprosthesis can be classified as a routine procedure. Despite the high implantation numbers, the clinical success of bicondylar knee arthroplasty can be optimized as 15–17% of patients are dissatisfied. Therefore, the improvement of outcome, implant longevity, and the continuous improvement of surgical techniques are important. The use of assistance systems, e.g., navigation and robotics, improve implant positioning and thus alignment of the leg axis, which influence the clinical outcome and implant longevity. Data whether implantations using different assistance systems lead to an improvement of clinical outcome, survival rate, patient satisfaction, and increased implantation precision are controversially discussed. The evidence regarding the different assistance systems is also heterogeneous. Despite the partly controversial and inhomogeneous data situation, meta-analyses allow assessment of the benefit of the different assistance systems for total knee arthroplasty."

The translation of the tibiofemoral contact points with flexion is important in the overall understanding of knee kinematics and knee stability, particularly in high flexion. In this study, cadaveric knees were used in conjunction with a robotic testing system and TekScan® film to quantify the tibiofemoral contact between 0°–150° for two TKA designs. We found that, for both TKAs, with increasing knee flexion, the peak contact point moved posteriorly and that the contact area decreased with increasing knee flexion.Copyright © 2003 by ASME"
pub.1151529932,การผ่าตัดเปลี่ยนข้อเข่าเทียมด้วยหุ่นยนต์ช่วยผ่าตัด,"Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is considered the gold standard of treatment for patients with severe knee arthrosis who failed conservative treatment. Conventional TKA is generally accepted as the standard technique which shows excellent long-term result. Whereas, robotic assisted TKA, has become an interesting technique recently. Main goal of robotic assisted TKA is to minimize human errors in surgical technique. Theoretically advantages are ability to plan the size and position of implants based on preoperative imaging and by assisting surgeons to more precisely and more accurately prepare the bone, minimized soft tissue injury, the physiological kinematics of the joint and the overall alignment of lower limb are also better restored. In this article, we demonstrate basic principles, basic instruments and summarize basic steps of robotic assisted TKA into four main steps; preoperative imaging process, bone registration process, preoperative planning process and bone cutting process. We review various robotic systems and categorize into different groups base on requirements of preoperative imaging usage and level of interaction of the surgeon in operations. The different robotic systems were subdivided into image-based/imageless and active/passive/ semi-active. We also report outcomes of this technology from literatures reviews."
pub.1176256936,Chapter 67 Robotic technology in orthopedic joint and hip surgery,"Robotics in orthopedic surgery has been used clinically in recent decades, with its first use in 1992. Robots must, by definition, play some role in surgery to be classified as such, and can vary in active, passive, and semiactive. In addition to this categorization, they can also vary according to the way in which surgery is performed and the bone-cutting methods. Robots in orthopedic surgery have a flow with four stages such as setup, registration, planning, and execution, and the order of execution may vary according to the use of preoperative images. Knee and hip arthroplasties are procedures that classically present excellent results with robotic assistance, and their use has increased significantly in recent years. Nevertheless, there is still a long path to follow, in the scientific field, until the benefits of the technique are definitively proven."

pub.1127324143,Comparison of component positioning in robot-assisted and conventional total hip arthroplasty,"Aim: For primary total hip arthroplasty, many authors reported that inappropriate component positioning may lead to unfavorable results and complications. In the last two decades, robotic systems were developed to improve component positioning in total hip arthroplasty. However, there are few reports in the literature concerning its efficacy. In this study, we aimed to compare the accuracy of component positioning between robot-assisted and conventional total hip arthroplasty. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, forty-four patients were operated using robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and 60 patients were operated using primary conventional manual arthroplasty (CMA). Measurements were done in standing orthogonal antero-posterior x-ray (AP) views to evaluate acetabular inclination, anteversion, and leg length discrepancy. Results were compared between RAS and CMA groups. Results: The average deviation from desired acetabular inclination was 8o in the CMA group, 4.7o in the RAS group, between which the difference was statistically significant (P=0.023). Concerning acetabular inclination, 72% of the patients in the CMA group remained in the safe zone described by Lewinnek while 94% of the patients in the RAS group remained in the same safe zone. The mean deviation from desired anteversion was 6.7o in the CMA group and 5.6o in the RAS group. The difference between two groups was not significant (P=0.209). The two groups were similar in terms of leg length discrepancy (P=0.238). Conclusion: We achieved more consistent acetabular component positioning with robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty compared with conventional total hip arthroplasty. Thus, more patients remained within Lewinnek’s safe zone in the robot-assisted surgery group."

Methods We comprehensively summarized and evaluated the results of several studies on the frequency, causes, countermeasures, and treatments after THA. Results We found that surgeon experience, mobility of the lumbosacral spine, and femoral head size influence the dislocation rate after THA, and that dual-mobility acetabular components, lipped liners, and intraoperative support systems, including navigation and robotics, can decrease the dislocation rate. Conclusions Dual-mobility and lipped liners improve stability after THA; however, their indications should be carefully considered.

The argument is made for systems to be cost effective and simple in order that they can be justified for a large range of surgical procedures. The case is made for robotic systems to have a clear justification, with benefits compared to those from cheaper navigation systems. The need to have robust systems, that require little surgical training and no technical presence in the operating room, is also discussed. An active constraint medical robot, the Acrobot System, is described together with its use in a prospective randomized controlled trial of unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA), comparing the performance of the Acrobot System with conventional surgery. Twenty-eight patients awaiting UKA were randomly allocated to have the operation performed conventionally or with the assistance of the Acrobot. The results of the trial are presented together with a discussion of the need for measures of accuracy to be introduced so that the efficacy of the robotic surgery can be immediately identified, rather than having to wait for a number of years before long-term clinical improvements can be demonstrated"

An example of implantable joint actuator with angular position sensor as an actuated artificial joint is proposed here. The proposed elbow prosthesis is supposed to be implanted inside of the human arm by elbow arthroplasty and acts as an inner skeleton power assist robot. We have designed and developed a prototype of implantable 2 DOF inner skeleton robot (i.e., robotic elbow prosthesis) to assist the elbow flexion-extension motion and forearm supination-pronation motion. The robotic prosthesis is controlled based on the activation patterns of the muscles electromyogram (EMG) signals by applying a fuzzy-neuro control method.

pub.1169575703,Robotic-assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty in Secondary Osteoarthritis of The Hip Joint Due to Developmental Hip Dysplasia: A Systematic Review And Meta-analysis,"Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (raTHA) was introduced in recent decades, offering proven advantages in improving the acetabular cup placement. However, the use of raTHA requires specific equipment and additional cost of $1,788 per case, raising the question of its cost-effectiveness. We believe that the use of raTHA may be substantially advantageous in complicated cases such as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) with deformed anatomy, where proper prosthesis alignment is hard to achieve. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the 2020 PRISMA to evaluate the benefits of raTHA over conventional total hip arthroplasty in DDH patients. From 80 studies that we found, only three were eligible. We primarily focused on the radiological outcomes and complications. However, functional outcomes were not compared and analyzed due to differences in reporting formats among the original studies. The analyses proved that raTHA was associated with a significantly increased rate of cup placement within Lewinnek's and Callanan’s safe zone. All studies had no report of any complications and revisions during the short term follow-up. Although statistical precision may have been affected by a limited number of studies, our review offers the first and most recent evidence-based analysis of the use of raTHA in secondary osteoarthritis caused by DDH. This meta-analysis revealed the potential benefits of the raTHA in improving radiological outcomes, which may outweigh the total costs in such well-selected cases."

pub.1169945197,Computer-Assisted and Robotic Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasties,"Computer-assisted and robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKA) have improved positioning and reproducibility and are a rare surgical procedure in France. Navigation can be performed by navigating tibial resection alone or by navigating tibial and femoral resection. Navigation is used to place a UKA with navigation on the tibial plateau and femoral condyle. Preoperative preparation requires radiographic measurement of two elements, and a semicircular frame is fixed under navigation control to the femoral reference screw. The Navio® system from Smith & Nephew and the MAKO® system from Stryker can be used to implant a medial UKA with isolated navigation on the tibial plateau. The NAVIO® system does not require preoperative imaging and is based on kinematic preoperative image acquisitions and acquisition of points of interest. Dynamic acquisition of the hip, ankle and knee axis of flexion is essential for effective dynamic planning. Points of interest are acquired on the femur and tibia, and the desired position is determined in three spatial planes. The femoral component should be as close as possible to the intercondylar notch to improve contact points between the femoral and tibial implants. The tibial and femoral components should be positioned in varus/valgus, tibial slope, rotation and mediolateral positioning. The MAKO® system (Stryker) consists of four components: an infrared camera, a screen for the surgeon, a control console for the engineer, and a robotic arm. It is used to plan the positioning of the implants and assess mobility of the knee. Positioning of femoral and tibial sensors percutaneously, acquisition of points of interest, ligament balance, preoperative planning, bone cuts, tests, and results are similar to the NAVIO® system. Robotic UKA has a significant advantage in terms of aberrant values, restitution of the joint space, and faster procedure times due to preoperative planning and the robotic arm. It also reduces the risk of complications in the tibial implant."

Robotic-arm assisted system have been developed to improve the accuracy of implant placement. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of robotic-arm assisted (Robo-THA), CT-based navigated (Navi-THA), and manual (M-THA) cup position and orientation in THA for DDH. A total of 285 patients (335 hips) including 202 M-THAs, 45 Navi-THAs, and 88 Robo-THA were analyzed. The choice of procedure followed the patient's preferences. Horizontal and vertical center of rotation (HCOR and VCOR) were measured for cup position, and radiographic inclination (RI) and anteversion (RA) were measured for cup orientation. The propensity score-matching was performed among three groups to compare the absolute error from the preoperative target position and angle. Navi-THA showed significantly smaller absolute errors than M-THA in RI (3.6° and 5.4°) and RA (3.8° and 6.0°), however, there were no significant differences between them in HCOR (2.5 mm and 3.0 mm) or VCOR (2.2 mm and 2.6 mm). In contrast, Robo-THA showed significantly smaller absolute errors of cup position than both M-THA and Navi-THA (HCOR: 1.7 mm and 2.9 mm, vs. M-THA, 1.6 mm and 2.5 mm vs. Navi-THA, VCOR:1.7 mm and 2.4 mm, vs. M-THA, 1.4 mm and 2.2 mm vs. Navi-THA). Robo-THA also showed significantly smaller absolute errors of cup orientation than both M-THA and Navi-THA (RI: 1.4° and 5.7°, vs. M-THA, 1.5° and 3.6°, vs. Navi-THA, RA: 1.9° and 5.8° vs. M-THA, 2.1° and 3.8° vs. Navi-THA). Robotic-arm assisted system showed more accurate cup position and orientation compared to manual and CT-based navigation in THA for DDH. CT-based navigation increased the accuracy of cup orientation compared to manual procedures, but not cup position."
pub.1129393253,Robotic arm assisted surgery in orthopaedics: a Health Technology Assessment evaluation in Liguria Region,"Background: Robotic surgery is a mini-invasive technique that involves the execution of interventions with collaborative robots. Among them, the MAKO system is a high-tech robotic platform for prosthetic surgery in orthopaedics. Liguria faces the problem of the balance between demand and offer of arthroplasty due to the high presence of the elderly concerning its demographic configuration. The high passive mobility due to the interventions of orthopaedic prostheses and the presence on Ligurian soil (Local Health Unit 5, LHU5) of a robotic system for the prosthetic implant, suggest to perform an assessment of the assistant consequences, economic, social and ethical caused by the adoption of MAKO technology with an HTA approach. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of the scientific literature to find evidence on the benefit of MAKO robotic-arm assisted surgery for partial (UKA) or total (TKA) knee arthroplasty. Data on the number of admissions for UKA and TKA interventions and the hospital stay average in Liguria was extracted from the regional database. Results: The literature search identified 14 papers. Most of them were not considered with proper evidence because not being peer-reviews published in an indexed journal, studies conducted on cadavers, limited to the operative phase and lacking clinical outcomes, non-experimental studies, studies without comparators or with inadequate comparators. Thus, we selected 3 studies. Focusing on the LHU5 data from the regional database, we observed an annual increase of about 90% in hospitalizations and an average decrease of 3-day hospitalization days. Conclusions: The type of studies and the evidence available are rather thin and not consolidated either from clinical effectiveness or safety or cost-effectiveness. It is not possible today to estimate adequately how and how much these costs will be translated into practical clinical benefits and possible economic savings. Therefore, it is believed that the adoption of this technology should exclusively take place in the context of a research activity aimed at defining all the possible dimensions of the technology (safety-efficacy-cost/effectiveness)."
pub.1100988280,Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Demonstrated Soft Tissue Protection,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) typically addresses end-stage osteoarthritis. While TKA procedures have demonstrated clinical success, occasionally intraoperative complications can occur. This cadaver study examined the potential benefits of soft tissue protection in robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA). Six cadaver knees were prepared using RATKA by a single surgeon from a high-volume TKA joint center with no former clinical robotic experience, and compared to seven manually performed cases as a control. The presence of soft tissue disruption was assessed by having the surgeon perform visual evaluation and palpation of the medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and the patellar ligament after the procedures. The amount of tibial subluxation and patellar eversion was recorded for each case.
                  For all RATKA cases, there was no visible evidence of disruption of any of the ligaments. All RATKA cases were successfully left with a bone island on the tibial plateau, which protected the PCL. Tibial subluxation and patellar eversion were not required for visualization. In two of the seven MTKA cases, there was slight disruption noted of the PCL, although this did not lead to any apparent change in the functional integrity of the ligament. All MTKA cases required tibial subluxation and patellar eversion to achieve optimal visualization.
                  Aspects of soft tissue protection were noted in this cadaver study for RATKA. Standard retraction techniques during cutting are recommended. This is the first study to have soft tissue injury parameters assessed for RATKA, and may serve as a platform for future studies."
pub.1034895406,Direct Navigation of Surgical Instrumentation,"Hip and knee arthroplasty have a big impact on population health and economics due to the large number of procedures and their relative high costs. Joint replacements are complex surgeries, which require skillful surgeons and numerous mechanical instruments. When many such instruments make contact with the patient’s tissue, they are bound to add to the overall infection risk.Newer patient-specific instruments address part of this burden but introduce new challenges due to the extra manufacturer planning, surgeon approval and custom jig manufacturing steps and their associated scalability and potential liability issues. Alternatively, real-time direct navigation of bones and bone resection instrumentation, which we call here Navigated Freehand Cutting (NFC), can help reduce implant-specific jigs for arthroplasty. It could also lead to cheaper, faster, easier and perhaps even better surgical procedures, by reducing the risk of infection.In this chapter we briefly contrast standard mechanical instrumentation for arthroplasty with modern variations and alternative approaches, including conventional navigation techniques (i.e. navigated jigs) and active and passive robotics. We also describe the progress citing various bench and cadaveric experiments on our approach of Navigated Freehand Cutting."
pub.1159959512,BONE CUTS AND IMPLANT PLACEMENTS ACCURACY IN TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY PERFORMED WITH AN ACTIVE ROBOTIC SYSTEM,"INTRODUCTION Robotic systems are increasing in popularity for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), particularly for their ability to integrate 3D preoperative planning and computer-assisted robotic cutting devices, potentially minimizing errors associated with bone resections and implant placements. However, there remains a paucity of literature on the accuracy of these novel solutions. OBJECTIVE To assess the bone cuts and implant placements accuracy of an active robotic system for TKA. METHODS Two experienced orthopedic surgeons performed TKA on ten cadaveric legs using the TSolution One Surgical System (THINK Surgical, CA, USA). Metallic beads were implanted in the legs to allow registering the planning with the actual bone cuts and implant placements. CT scans were used for 3D preoperative planning. Intraoperatively, the surgeons exposed the knee through a medial parapatellar approach, located points on the joint surfaces using a digitizer to register the virtual bones in the planning to the actual bones, supervised the robotic arm cutting the bones, applied bone cement, impacted the implants, and sutured the knee. Postoperative CT scans were acquired to evaluate the procedure. The accuracy was assessed by comparing the position and orientation of planned versus actual cuts and implant placements in the three anatomical planes. The rotation of the tibia in the transverse plane was not assessed, resulting in an assessment of accuracy for 11 degrees of freedom. RESULTS The root mean square (RMS) values for all bone cut errors were below 2mm or 2°. The RMS errors for implant placements were below 2mm or 2°, except for femoral and tibial flexion-extension angles (both RMS values 2.9°). CONCLUSION This study confirmed the ability of the TSolution One Surgical System to achieve accurate bone cuts and implant placements, with most errors being below 2mm or 2°. The study also suggested that such accurate implant placements require both accurate bone cuts and proper implantation technique. An originality of this study was to measure simultaneously the bone cuts and implant placement accuracy using a particularly robust method combining metallic beads and CT artifact-free implants. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal implant placements and thus fully release the potential of robotic systems in TKA.

pub.1155689595,ROBOTIC-ARM ASSISTED UNICOMPARTMENTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY HAS A LEARNING CURVE OF 11 CASES AND INCREASED OPERATIVE TIME,"Source of the study: University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand
                  Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has benefits for patients with appropriate indications. However, UKA has a higher risk of revision, particularly for low-usage surgeons. The introduction of robotic-arm assisted systems may allow for improved outcomes but is also associated with a learning curve. We aimed to characterise the learning curve of a robotic-arm assisted system (MAKO) for UKA in terms of operative time, limb alignment, component sizing, and patient outcomes.
                  Operative times, pre- and post-surgical limb alignments, and component sizing were prospectively recorded for consecutive cases of primary medial UKA between 2017 and 2021 (n=152, 5 surgeons). Patient outcomes were captured with the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12) and re-operation events up to two years post-UKA. A Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) method was used to estimate learning curves and to distinguish between learning and proficiency phases.
                  Introduction of the system had a learning curve of 11 cases. There was increased operative time of 13 minutes between learning and proficiency phases (learning 98 mins vs. proficiency 85 mins; p<0.001), associated with navigation registration and bone preparation/cutting. A learning curve was also found with polyethylene insert sizing (p=0.03). No difference in patient outcomes between the two phases were detected for patient-reported outcome measures, implant survival (both phases 98%; NS) or re-operation (learning 100% vs. proficiency: 96%; NS). Implant survival and re-operation rates did not differ between low and high usage surgeons (cut-off of 12 UKAs per year).
                  Introduction of the robotic-arm assisted system for UKA led to increased operative times for navigation registration and bone preparation, but no differences were detected in terms of component placement or patient outcomes regardless of usage. The short learning curve regardless of UKA usage indicated that robotic-arm assisted UKA may be particularly useful for low-usage surgeons."
pub.1146866567,Total Knee Arthroplasty with Significant Osteolysis following Gore-Tex Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Recommendations on Reducing Risk of Arthroplasty Failure,"Synthetic substitutes for ligament reconstruction surgery have been widely used in orthopaedic surgery; however, many have been susceptible to mechanical failure and associated with osteolysis. A 58-year-old male underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for valgus knee osteoarthritis on the background of a Gore-Tex anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction over 30 years prior. Radiographic imaging preoperatively demonstrated extensive osteolysis, particularly on the tibial side. At the time of arthroplasty, the extent of osteolysis was noted to be greater than that on the preoperative imaging. The patient underwent a robotic-assisted TKA with the use of a cemented stemmed tibial prosthesis and bone grafting. The patient was prescribed a period of protected weightbearing following the procedure. Our recommendations for undertaking arthroplasty with a Gore-Tex graft in situ are as follows: (1) thorough preoperative workup including computed tomography imaging to identify tunnel widening and osteolysis; (2) ensure that additional bone allograft is available for the procedure; (3) use of cemented implants where there has been significant osteolysis; (4) removal of the entire synthetic graft with copious irrigation post-removal to ensure the joint does not remain exposed to particulate debris; (5) grafting of the tunnels and bone defects post-removal of synthetic graft; (6) use of a stemmed prosthesis to bypass any cortical defects and reduce the risk of subsidence of the component."

However, the technique still focuses on mechanical alignment philosophies, with minor adaptions. This chapter is meant to highlight the surgical technique of robotic assistance and its suitability for achieving true kinematic alignment (KA) in TKA and discusses its potential benefits over conventional or other computer-assisted techniques. The first section gives a brief overview on current devices for robotic-assisted TKA. Differences between the systems and their underlying principles are discussed. Special focus is on the potential advantage of image-based concepts with three-dimensional KA planning. The second section outlines a step-by-step algorithm for a kinematically aligned preplan and discusses the major parameters of interest. How this plan can be adapted to individual anatomic variations is outlined. In the third section, we describe a distinct intraoperative workflow for KA using image-based robotics. It is based on a hybrid approach, with a true measured resection philosophy for the femur to restore the native joint surfaces, and a gap-balanced tibial resection to restore a rectangular extension space. For illustration, three clinical cases are discussed in terms of implant alignment and balancing."
pub.1152033999,Surgical Approaches Used for Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a surgical procedure performed when the patient’s hip joint is worn or damaged. The main aim of the surgery is to reduce the pain experienced by the patients while simultaneously increasing their potential range of motionRange of motion (RoM), thus allowing them to return to their daily activities without experiencing severe painSevere pain that could potentially interfere with their performance. There are a variety of approaches that could be employed for THA, and the main differences involve the positioning of the patient on the operating table, as well as the methodology used to access the hip joint, which subsequently leads to distinct positive outcomesPositive outcomes alongside negative impacts. In this work, we review research literature for each approach and highlight the strengths as well as the weaknesses of each individual approach."
pub.1144264276,US National Databases – Total Knee Arthroplasty: Lessons Learned,"National orthopedic registries have been developed to track revisions as a function of surgeon, patient, and implant characteristics, but administrative claims data sets and large clinical registries are still heavily relied upon to help evaluate less common risk factors. A multitude of national or regional administrative claims databases and clinical registries are available for studying trends in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), each with its own unique data structure, collection method, sampling scheme, and geographic scope within the United States. In addition to epidemiology and general outcomes, unique aspects of the data sets have allowed the assessment of robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), risk factors, post-TKA complications, and strategies for preventing venous thromboembolic events after TKA. However, the study of cementless TKAs using administrative claims data sets and large clinical registries has been limited. Despite an impressive sample size, large-scale databases have notable limitations."
pub.1103529227,MODERN TRENDS IN ORTHOPEDICS: THE KNEE ARTHROPLASTY,"Using PubMed the authors analyzed publications dedicated to knee arthroplasty that were published in 2011. The modern trends of knee joint replacement include improvement of implants and instruments; partial knee replacement as alternative to TKA; reducing of surgical trauma due to less-invasive approaches; achieving of deep flexion after TKA; using of computer navigation and individual cutting blocks to make surgery more precise; optimization of rehabilitation process in pre-, intra-and postoperative period; including multimodal pain control; development of complex strategies for prevention of intra- and postoperative complications. In this review the attention was attracted to the most discussed in 2011 subjects: development of new designs and materials of knee implants; navigation, robotics and individualized resection blocks; partial knee replacement; infection, blood loss and venous thromboembolism after TKA; influence of different factors on arthroplasty outcomes, especially components and leg alignment, patella resurfacing, PCL retention or substitution, uncemented fixation, mobility of PE insert, severe pre-op deformities or stiffness, previous intra-articular fractures and tibia or femur osteotomies, soft tissue deficit etc."
pub.1160639443,Application status and prospect of domestic artificial intelligence and orthopaedic robot in arthroplasty surgery,"In recent years, artificial intelligence and orthopaedic robots, as a research hotspot and an important development direction in the medical field, provide accurate preoperative planning and surgical navigation for orthopaedic surgery. Artificial intelligence and orthopaedic robotics can truly achieve the precision of arthroplasty surgery. Artificial intelligence has great advantages in image diagnosis of joint disease, image segmentation, preoperative planning and other aspects. Through more accurate intelligent image segmentation and more efficient and accurate preoperative planning, it can effectively reduce the difficulty of complex primary joint replacement and revision surgery, reduce the cost of communication between clinicians and engineers, and theoretically improve the accuracy of prosthesis selection. Based on X-ray or CT scan, the orthopaedic robot can perform accurate bone operation during surgery on the basis of accurate preoperative planning, avoid the deviation brought by the surgeon's experience and operation, achieve the homogeneity of the surgical level of different levels of doctors, reduce the learning curve of arthroplasty surgery, and have theoretical advantages in complex surgery."
pub.1128872604,The Future of TKA,"Although total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered to be a cost-effective intervention, most patients do not experience natural joints, and it is reported that up to 20% of them are dissatisfied [1, 2]. A systematic review of gait analysis after TKA indicates that patients display significant kinematic differences from normal controls [3]. Due to the significant deficiencies in both our knowledge and technology in the past, we were far from replicating normal knee kinematics with TKA. These limitations in TKA function and patient satisfaction should stimulate us to restart the entire development process. Enhancements in our understanding of knee anatomy and biomechanics may suggest ways of improving TKA outcomes. Implant design needs to be advanced to reproduce the anatomy and kinematics of native knees. More precise surgical techniques with navigation, patient-matched instrumentation and robotics need to be further refined. The future of TKA is to produce more natural knee joints, with resultant improved patient satisfaction and ultimately a forgotten joint."
pub.1116668470,Protesi femoro-rotulea,"Patellofemoral osteoarthritis is a common cause of anterior knee pain. Some authors reported an incidence of 9% in population over 40 years, with a higher prevalence in females. Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) is a good option for patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis, preserving tibio-femoral joints. First generation implants (in-lay design) have shown high failure rates at medium term follow-up. Second generation prostheses (on-lay design), with an anterior femoral cut based on total knee replacement, have allowed for improvement at medium and long term. A proper patient selection is mandatory for the success of this procedure. The ideal candidate has isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis non responsive to conservative treatment and an age between 40 and 60 years.The main cause of PFA failure is progression of tibio-femoral arthritis. In this case, good results have been provided by the association of PFA and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Conversion of a PFA to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) does not add particular difficulties compared to primary TKA. More studies are required to confirm long-term results and the application of robotic technologies to PFA."
pub.1014515512,Direct Anterior Approach Using Image-Free Navigation,"As described in an earlier chapter, the direct anterior approach is a single-incision approach. The skin incision is made two fingerbreadths distal to the anterior superior iliac spine at the ventral border of the tensor fasciae latae muscle. The surgical portal lies between the lateral border comprised of the tensor muscle and the sartorius and rectus femoris muscle medially. The entire length of the incision will vary slightly depending on body habitus, but 8 cm is the typical incision length in our patient population. Special retractors developed for this procedure allow for excellent access to the acetabulum. With angulated reamer handles and cup introducers, acetabular preparation and cup implantation can be accomplished without the need for a larger incision. Femoral preparation and implantation are facilitated using special retractors that elevate the femur to a position that permits satisfactory access for stem preparation and using instruments with an anterior offset."
pub.1175673486,Development and Efficacy of a Novel Knee Simulator for Robotic Surgery,"Simulation in the medical field provides interactive training system set in a realistic clinical scene for training healthcare staff to increase patient safety [1]. The advantages of training by simulation are the opportunity for the learner to have reproducible and standardised experiences where they can participate actively and not as a passive observer, also it is possible to take part of the learning curve of specific tasks outside the surgery room [2]. Knee replacement surgery is nowadays a diffuse surgery, often robotics. A crucial step for a successful surgery is the ligament balancing after prosthesis mounting [3], but no realistic simulators exist. Simulation-based orthopaedic training commonly relies on physical simulators [4], given the need of realistic tactile and force feedback. Within the Next Generation EU project ECS00000017, PNRR-Tuscany Health Ecosystem we designed and developed an anatomically realistic knee simulator, introducing a ligament component addressed to training in robotic knee arthroplasty."
pub.1155689657,INTRODUCTION OF ROSA ROBOTIC ARM SYSTEM FOR TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY IS ASSOCIATED WITH A MINIMAL LEARNING CURVE FOR OPERATIVE TIME,"The introduction of robotics for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) into the operating theatre is often associated with a learning curve and is potentially associated with additional complications. The purpose of this study was to determine the learning curve of robotic-assisted (RA) TKA within a multi-surgeon team.
                  This prospective cohort study included 83 consecutive conventional jig-based TKAs compared with 53 RA TKAs using the Robotic Surgical Assistant (ROSA) system (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) for knee osteoarthritis performed by three high-volume (> 100 TKA per year) orthopaedic surgeons. Baseline characteristics including age, BMI, sex and pre-operative Kellgren-Lawrence grade were well-matched between the conventional and RA TKA groups. Cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis was used to assess learning curves for operative times for each surgeon. Peri-operative and delayed complications were reviewed.
                  The CUSUM analysis for operative time demonstrated an inflexion point after 5, 6 and 15 cases for each of the three surgeons, or 8.7 cases on average. There were no significant differences (p = 0.53) in operative times between the RA TKA learning (before inflexion point) and proficiency (after inflexion point) phases. Similarly, the operative times of the RA TKA group did not differ significantly (p = 0.92) from the conventional TKA group. There was no discernible learning curve for the accuracy of component planning using the RA TKA system. The average length of post-operative follow-up was 21.3 ± 9.0 months. There was no significant difference (p > 0.99) in post-operative complication rates between the groups.
                  The introduction of the RA TKA system was associated with a learning curve for operative time of 8.7 cases. Operative times between the RA TKA and conventional TKA group were similar. The short learning curve implies this RA TKA system can be adopted relatively quickly into a surgical team with minimal risks to patients."
pub.1143800020,"Radiographic Outliers, Revisions, and Functional Outcomes in Fixed-Bearing Medial Unicompartmental Arthroplasty","Background and Hypothesis: Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty (UKA) is a technically demanding procedure vulnerable to errors in component positioning. Recent studies suggest robotic-assistance improves precision of implant placement, minimizes outliers, and improves survivorship. However, we have previously demonstrated an experienced surgeon can match robotic accuracy. This study evaluated revision rates and functional outcomes of radiographic outliers in manual UKA. Experimental Design or Project Methods: A retrospective review of 222 consecutive fixed-bearing medial UKAs was conducted. Implant positioning and alignment were assessed radiographically measuring tibial coronal (TCA), femoral coronal (FCA), tibial sagittal (TSA) and femoral sagittal (FSA) angles as well as implant overhang. UCLA Activity Level and all-cause survivorship were evaluated. Student’s t-test, Chi square, and Kaplan Meier curves were used in analyses with alpha ≤ .05 designating statistical significance. Results: Using previously published alignment goals, our manual UKAs achieved the following targets: 92% for TCA, 100% for FCA, 88% for TSA, and 100% for FSA. For implant overhang, 100% met medial, anterior, and posterior targets. Our manual UKAs achieved desired alignment and overhang goals more frequently than previously published manual success. Survivorship free from aseptic revision in this study was 96% at 8.5 years. Additionally, there was no difference in UCLA Activity Level improvement comparing outliers and non-outliers (p³0.159). Conclusion and Potential Impact: Manual UKAs performed by an experienced surgeon showed improved success in achieving alignment and implant overhang goals compared to published manual UKA data and similar success compared to published robotic-assisted UKA data. We found no differences in revision rates or functional outcomes between outliers and non-outliers using previously published targets. For robotic assistance to be cost effective, it must demonstrate improved outcomes or survivorship when compared to manual UKAs. Our results contradict recently published claims that manual alignment outliers and failure rates fail to meet expectations for UKA."
pub.1140220664,Robotic-Assisted Surgery in Orthopaedics,"This chapter analyses the existing literature and provide technical tips in performing robotic total hip arthroplasty (THA). The number of hip replacements performed in the United Kingdom continues to rise, and in 2018, 106,116 hip replacements were undertaken. The term ‘robot’ is coined from the Czechoslovakian word ‘robata’, meaning forced labour. Various types of robotic devices are in use in orthopaedics and are broadly divided into haptic and autonomous systems. Haptic systems work as a master–slave for the orthopaedic surgeons and can be completely controlled by them. In autonomous systems the robots operate independently and the surgeon is able to shut off the switch in case of emergency. Implant position is the most important surgeon-controlled factor which determines a range of outcomes, including the amount of remaining bone stock following THA, the stability of the joint, the biomechanics and function of the soft-tissue envelope around the hip joint and, ultimately, the survival of the prosthesis."

pub.1142694474,Advanced Surgical Techniques for Tibiofemoral Unicompartmental Knee Replacement,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a valid treatment option for patients in whom severe joint damage and complete loss of joint space are present in one compartment. The primary indication is symptomatic isolated painful arthritis marked by moderate to severe joint line pain and/or stiffness that limits daily activities. Preexisting joint arthritis in another compartment of the knee is the principal contraindication because of the noteworthy evidence that this is the leading cause of failure. Robotic-assisted surgical navigation improves accuracy in UKA (postoperative limb alignment, component positioning, and soft tissue balancing) using less invasive techniques. The UKA operative technique described in this chapter uses an implant that is positioned using three-dimensional modeling and computer-assisted robotic surgical navigation. It is important that the patient has realistic expectations regarding what this operation may and may not accomplish. Low-impact activities such as walking, swimming, golfing, light hiking, and bicycling can often be performed by 3 months. Running and high-impact athletic or occupational activities are not advised.

pub.1053967138,Robotic surgery: from autonomous systems to intelligent tools,"SUMMARY A brief history of robotic surgery is provided, which describes the transition from autonomous robots to hands-on systems that are under the direct control of the surgeon. An example of the latter is the Acrobot (for active-constraint robot) system used in orthopaedics, whilst soft-tissue surgery is illustrated by the daVinci telemanipulator system. Non-technological aspects of robotic surgery have often been a major impediment to their widespread clinical use. These are discussed in detail, together with the role of navigation systems, which are considered a major competitor to surgical robots. A detailed description is then given of a registration method for robots to achieve improved accuracy. Registration is a major source of error in robotic surgery, particularly in orthopaedics. The paper describes the design and clinical implementation of a novel method, coined the bounded registration method, applied to minimally invasive registration of the femur. Results of simulations which compare the performance of bounded registration with a standard implementation of the iterative closest point algorithm are also presented, alongside a description of their application in the Acrobot hands-on robot, used clinically for uni-condylar knee arthroplasty."

Methods: This retrospective observational study, conducted at the Centre of Excellence, Bone, Joint and Spine, Meitra Hospital, Kozhikode, Kerala, India, focused on patients aged 60 and above undergoing total                                                                       knee replacement for stage 4 osteoarthritis. The study included 75 consecutive cases of manual, computer- assisted, and robotic-assisted unilateral total knee arthroplasties performed between May 2021 and September 2022 (18 months). Data was collected from the hospital records. Results: The surgeon transitioned from learning to proficiency phase of RATKA after 14 cases. In the robotic learning phase, the overall operative time was 113.14 minutes (±8.96), significantly longer than the robotic proficiency phase's average of 98.24 minutes (±2.98) and that of CATKA (99.57±10.700 minutes) and manual TKAs (97.01±7.17 minutes). No statistically significant difference was observed in the global operative time between the proficiency phase RATKAs and the CATKA and manual groups (p=0.139). Conclusions: By optimizing techniques and modifying workflow, one can swiftly overcome the initial learning curve of RATKA and achieve operating times comparable to manual TKA. To enhance efficiency and productivity, the study proposes a revised workflow modifying various rate limiting surgical steps."
pub.1181265545,Factors Affecting Successful Restricted Kinematic Alignment With Robotic Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients With Severe Varus Preoperative Alignment,"Background Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains challenging in severe varus knees. We evaluated the impact of hip-knee-ankle varus deformity and osteophyte size on achieving restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) in robotic-arm-assisted TKA. Methods This retrospective study included 244 knees (194 patients) that underwent robotic-arm-assisted TKA for varus primary knee osteoarthritis at an academic institution. Intraoperative hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) and soft tissue balance were monitored to assess the success of rKA with osteophyte resection alone. For those that failed, medial collateral ligament needle pie-crusting was performed. Results Mean age was 65.3 years (range, 48-83). Mean preoperative HKA was 11.9° varus (range, 1.0°-32.0°), and HKA after osteophyte resection was 5.1° varus (range, 0°-19.0°). Mean HKA correction was 6.8° (range, 0°-18.0°). rKA was achieved in 36.9% at a boundary of ≤3° varus and up to 72.1% at ≤6° varus. Preoperative varus HKA was lower in successful cases across all target alignments (P < .05). Medial tibial osteophyte size was 6.1% ± 2.9% and was smaller in all groups that achieved rKA (P < .05). Both were positively correlated with degree of deformity correction, r = 0.718 (P < .01) and r = 0.281 (P < .01), respectively. Conclusions This study highlighted the importance of varus deformity and medial tibial osteophytes when adopting rKA. They were associated with increased failure to achieve rKA. rKA was reliably achieved in minimal varus deformities (HKA ≤ 5°), we recommend an expanded protocol of HKA ≤ 6° varus for mild deformities (HKA 6°-10°), and consider medial soft tissue release for moderate (HKA 11°-15°) and severe deformities (HKA ≥ 16°)."
pub.1135264770,Post-operative Virtual Range of Motion in Robotic-assisted THA Patients to determine Pre-operative Simulation Needs,"For preoperative simulations of hip range of motion to be useful in predicting complications after total hip arthroplasty (THA), the factors that could affect post-operative function must be considered including, but not limited to, bony impingement, pelvic position, and implanted vs. planned differences. This study retrospectively simulates ranges of motion to prosthetic and bony impingement of THA patients with known planned and implanted component positions and pelvic tilt to determine the factors and needs to accurately simulate range of motion preoperatively.
                  Twenty-two (22) anterolateral, cementless total hip arthroplasties were performed using robotic-arm assisted technology which allowed capture of the implanted stem version and position in addition to robotic-assisted cup placement to plan. With the known implanted positions and preoperative 3-dimentional (3D) bone models, six (6) hip maneuvers were virtually simulated in custom software. Correlations were evaluated between planned and implanted component positions, pelvic tilt, ranges of motion, and patient-reported outcomes.
                  Average ranges of motion to impingement were similar to those of previous simulation and navigation studies. Supine tilt varied from -10 ̊ (posterior) to 15 ̊ (anterior) with an average of 3.4±6.6 ̊. Very little correlation was seen between native or planned stem version and implanted stem version. Correlations were seen between some maneuvers such as internal rotation (IR) at 90 degrees flexion (F) (IR@90F) and combined component version and pelvic tilt. Bony impingement occurred during IR@90F in 9 of the 22cases. Pelvic tilt assessment, bony impingement detection, better prediction of implanted component position or the ability to execute a plan, such as robotically, would all provide a more accurate pre-operative simulation of the post-operative patient’s function."

pub.1164336988,"Mid-Term Survivorship, Radiographic and Functional Outcomes of Robotic-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty","Introduction: The use of robotic-arm assistance for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (RAUKA) has become an area of interest to overcome technical challenges, improve accuracy, and optimize patient outcomes. Due to the rise in osteoarthritis (OA) and robotic assistance, well-powered long-term studies are warranted. The aim of this study was to analyze midterm survivorship, radiographic changes, range of motion (ROM), and patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs) of RAUKA. Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent RAUKA for medial compartmental OA were identified from April 2009 to May 2014. The query yielded 162 knees with a mean follow up of 6.5 years. Primary endpoints were to compare survivorship, final mechanical axis alignment, radiographic changes, mean ROM, and changes to the following PROMs: Knee Society Score (KSS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Statistical analyses were primarily descriptive. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There were no revisions of the primary implant, one case required exchange of polyethylene bearing and debridement for deep infection, and five cases required additional surgical intervention with implant retention. Overall survivorship was 100%. Radiographic assessment demonstrated no mechanical loosening or osteolysis surrounding the implant. Mean ROM was 3 to 121.9º. Patients demonstrated a mean functional KSS of 78.55, IKDC of 78.22, and OKS of 43.94. Conclusions: The study supports excellent mid-term outcomes in patients undergoing RAUKA for medial compartment OA. Longer term follow-up studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of this technology for patients undergoing RAUKA for medial compartment OA."

Because of its simplicity, computer navigation will be an early tool in such areas as total joint replacement, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and placement of pedicle screws in complex spinal surgery. New techniques in Minimally Invasive Surgery will require the precision and digital ""surgical exposure"" offered by the computer. However, we anticipate in a few years, that robotics with computer activated technology will rise to an important role for the practicing surgeon. Surgeons who are comfortable with technology and yearn for better solutions with their techniques will benefit from the knowledge of this experience. Americans at the AAOS 2003 annual meeting in New Orleans, have now joined the wave of enthusiasm for computer assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) as well as the exciting new vistas of Minimally Invasive Surgery."
pub.1100988340,Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Demonstrated Greater Accuracy to Plan Compared to Manual Technique,"While total knee arthroplasty has demonstrated clinical success, final bone cut and final component alignment can be critical for achieving a desired overall limb alignment. This cadaver study investigated whether robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) allows for accurate bone cuts and component position to plan, compared to manual technique. Six cadaveric specimens (12 knees) were prepared by an experienced user of manual total knee arthroplasty (MTKA), who was inexperienced in RATKA. For each cadaveric pair, a RATKA was prepared on the right leg and a MTKA was prepared on the left leg. Final bone cuts and final component position to plan were measured relative to fiducials, and mean and standard deviations were compared.
                  Measurements of final bone cut error for each cut show that RATKA had greater accuracy and precision to plan for femoral anterior internal/external (0.8±0.5° vs. 2.7±1.9°) and flexion/extension* (0.5±0.4° vs. 4.3±2.3°), anterior chamfer varus/valgus* (0.5±0.1° vs. 4.1±2.2°) and flexion/extension (0.3±0.2° vs. 1.9±1.0°), distal varus/valgus (0.5±0.3° vs. 2.5±1.6°) and flexion/extension (0.8±0.5° vs. 1.1±1.1°), posterior chamfer varus/valgus* (1.3±0.4° vs. 2.8±2.0°) and flexion/extension (0.8±0.5° vs. 1.4±1.6°), posterior internal/external* (1.1±0.6° vs. 2.8±1.6°) and flexion/extension (0.7±0.6° vs. 3.7±4.0°), and tibial varus/valgus* (0.6±0.3° vs. 1.3±0.7°) rotations, compared to MTKA, respectively (where * indicates a significant difference between the two operative methods based on 2-Variances testing, with α at 0.05). Measurements of final component position error show that RATKA had greater accuracy and precision to plan for femoral varus/valgus* (0.6±0.3° vs. 3.0±1.4°), flexion/extension* (0.6±0.5° vs. 3.0±2.1°), internal/external (0.8±0.5° vs. 2.6±1.6°), and tibial varus/valgus (0.7±0.4° vs. 1.1±0.8°) than the MTKA control, respectively.
                  In general, RATKA demonstrated greater accuracy and precision of bone cuts and component placement to plan, compared to MTKA in this cadaveric study. For further confirmation, RATKA accuracy of component placement should be investigated in a clinical setting."
pub.1155311869,REMOTE EVALUATION OF POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES USING WEARABLE SENSORS COMPARING ROBOTIC-ASSISTED AND CONVENTIONAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY,"Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have failed to highlight differences in function or outcome when comparing knee replacement designs and implantation techniques. Ankle-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) can be used to remotely measure and monitor the bi-lateral impact load of patients, augmenting traditional PROMs with objective data. The aim of this study was to compare IMU-based impact loads with PROMs in patients who had undergone conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA), unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), and robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA).
                  77 patients undergoing primary knee arthroplasty (29 RA-TKA, 37 TKA, and 11 UKA) for osteoarthritis were prospectively enrolled. Remote patient monitoring was performed pre-operatively, then weekly from post-operative weeks two to six using ankle-worn IMUs and PROMs. IMU-based outcomes included: cumulative impact load, bone stimulus, and impact load asymmetry. PROMs scores included: Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol Five-dimension with EuroQol visual analogue scale, and the Forgotten Joint Score.
                  On average, patients showed improved impact load asymmetry by 67% (p=0.001), bone stimulus by 41% (p<0.001), and cumulative impact load by 121% (p=0.035) between post-operative week two and six. Differences in IMU-based outcomes were observed in the initial six weeks post-operatively between surgical procedures. The mean change scores for OKS were 7.5 (RA-TKA), 11.4 (TKA), and 11.2 (UKA) over the early post-operative period (p=0.144). Improvements in OKS were consistent with IMU outcomes in the RA-TKA group, however, conventional TKA and UKA groups did not reflect the same trend in improvement as OKS, demonstrating a functional decline.
                  Our data illustrate that PROMs do not necessarily align with patient function, with some patients reporting good PROMs, yet show a decline in cumulative impact load or load asymmetry. These data also provide evidence for a difference in the functional outcome of TKA and UKA patients that might be overlooked by using PROMs alone."
pub.1181391066,Conventional Vs. Robotic/Computer Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Meta-Analysis," 1. INTRODUCTION The utility of robotics in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains controversial. This systematic literature review with a meta-analysis was performed to determine if robotics/computer assisted (RAS/CAS) TKA improved patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) compared to conventional TKA.   2. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic literature search was performed for all studies comparing outcomes between Conventional and RAS/CAS TKA. Included studies directly compared RAS/CAS TKA and conventional TKA post-operative PROMs. Outcome measures included 2011 KSS, KSS, HSS, WOMAC, and OKS. Articles that did not directly compare RAS/CAS and conventional TKA and articles with Minors criteria <12 were excluded.   3. RESULTS Final analysis was performed on 22 studies which included 4009 TKAs with average follow-up of 52.9 months. 17 studies were evaluated for KSS scores, and moderate statistical heterogeneity was detected (τ 2 = 0.018; χ 2 = 28.29, df=16, p=0.03, I 2 =43). RAS/CAS TKA was favored over conventional TKA with a higher KSS score (SMD = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.0-0.21). 6 studies were evaluated for HSS scores and no statistical heterogeneity was detected (τ 2 = 0; χ 2 = 4.90, df=5, p=0.43, I 2 =0%), however RAS/CAS TKA was favored over conventional TKA with a higher HSS knee score (SMD = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.17-0.45).   4. CONCLUSIONS This review shows that RAS/CAS TKA demonstrates promise in improving PROMs post-operatively compared to conventional TKA. However, it remains unclear how much these improvements translate to clinical impact. Continued analysis is warranted to further elucidate the impact of RAS/CAS on TKA. "
pub.1122138864,A 90-Day Episode-of-Care Cost Analysis of Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Introduction
                  One way to potentially help contain the rising healthcare costs is the utilization of technological advances, such as robotic-assistive technology, for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a cost analysis between robotic-arm assisted TKA and manual TKA (mTKA) techniques. Specifically, we compared: 1) 90-day EOC costs, as well as several variables within the episode, including 2) index costs; 3) index lengths-of-stay (LOS); 4) discharge disposition; and 5) readmission rates.
                  Methods
                  A retrospective claims analysis was performed on Medicare FFS beneficiaries who underwent rTKA and mTKA procedures between January 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017. Patients were matched rTKA to mTKA in a 1-to-5 ratio, yielding 519 rTKAs and 2,595 mTKAs. The overall 90-day EOC costs, including the index procedures, LOS, discharge dispositions, and readmissions were compared between cohorts.
                  Results
                  Overall 90-day EOC costs ($18,568 vs. $20,960) as well as index facility costs ($12,384 vs. $13,024; p=0.0001) were found to be less than that for rTKA vs. mTKA. rTKA also accrued $1,744 fewer costs than mTKA (5,234 vs. $6,978; p=<0.0001) utilized fewer days in inpatient (4 vs. 7; p<0.0001) and SNF care (15 vs. 16; p=0.0642) as well as a 90-day readmission reduction of 33% (p=0.0423).
                  Discussion
                  The results from this study show rTKA to be associated with significantly lower 90-day EOC costs. These lower rTKA patient costs are likely attributable to the significantly lower index costs, increased likelihood of being discharged to home, shorter LOS, and decreased readmission rates, when compared to mTKA patient costs."
pub.1171460073,Building a successful robotic-arm assisted orthopedic surgery program,"Building a successful robotics team is a long journey with much effort before the first surgery. It starts with sound business development and, in case of acquiring a system, an implementation plan, to make it a success. The pathway to a successful Robotics program is much more than choosing the desired robotic arm-assisted surgery (RAS) brand. Success also depends on the specific pathway optimization aspects of RAS. High-over, all systems introduce the computer and robotic-arm into the operating room. But all systems have subtle, but significant, differences. An essential aspect of a successful RAS project is the implementation phase. After deciding to purchase a Robotic system, the following training and OR setup phase should be prepared and executed. When the robotic system enters the operating room, aspects like arm position using the arm board should be evaluated critically since the robot needs sufficient working space. A suboptimal positioning will disrupt the team dynamics and lead to preventable delay. RAS requires new or adjusted skills. Two crucial aspects are eye-hand-feet coordination in combination with a different focus of the surgeon (also screen instead of 100% surgery field) and new cognitive decision making features. Robotic surgery is a perfect example of how technology can change a surgical field. This data acquisition is probably the most fundamental, powerful aspect of adding the computer into the surgical process. The most used robotic-arm systems in hip and knee arthroplasty are semi-automatic systems, and practically all major orthopedic manufacturers offer a device. ORs are a highly capitalized section of hospitals, generating high costs and critical revenues. Therefore, taking a closer look at workflows, inventory management, and team efficiencies is crucial. Improving these aspects in the OR has a high return on investment. RAS helps accurately observe everything occurring within and around the surgical process. These new data opportunities open the opportunity to work with surgical data science (SDS)."

The World Health Organization estimates that several hundred million people already suffer from bone and joint diseases, with dramatic increases expected due to a doubling in the number of people over 50 years of age by 2020. In Europe, by 2010, for the first time there will be more people over 60 years of age than under the age of 20. A study based on the American National Hospital Discharge Survey (1996–1999) predicts that there will be more than 474,000 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures performed in the United States in 2030. This number is expected to increase in tandem with the life expectancy of the population."

pub.1012860825,ROBODOC achieves pinless registration," The ROBODOC 1 Surgical Assistant System provides computer assisted planning and execution of bone milling for total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty procedures. One key aspect of the robotic procedure is registration, the process of transforming the robot’s milling instructions from the image coordinate system used for planning into the robot coordinate system in which the plan is executed. The first‐generation system performed registration using fiducial markers (pins) implanted in the patient. These markers present various disadvantages to patients, surgeons, and clinics. As a result, users asked for a “pinless” single surgery system. The resulting design, DigiMatch, achieves registration by matching points digitized from the bone anatomy to a three‐dimensional surface model developed from a CT scan of the bone. The DigiMatch system is currently in routine use in many clinics in Europe, and is under clinical evaluation in the USA. "

Early biomaterial and design issues were addressed quickly, and the current differences and controversies in practice are based more on preference rather than principle. Research and development has focused increasingly on issues surrounding the procedure – use of patient specific data, computer assisted robotics, pain management and infection control – to improve clinical results as patient expectations rise and patient satisfaction and outcomes are the metrics demanded by health insurance payors and hospital administrators.

pub.1067838977,Robot-assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty after Chiari Pelvic Osteotomy: A Case Report,"Congenital hip dysplasia often requires surgical interventions in younger adults. 3D-navigated, robotic-assisted surgery for total hip arthroplasty may be beneficial in cases of pseudo-acetabulum and preceding treatments (Chiari Pelvic osteotomy) due to better pre-surgical planning and higher levels of precision associated with the technology, which may be associated with positive effects regarding short-term and long-term clinical outcomes. Here, we report the case of a 26-year-old Caucasian woman with a Crowe-IV dysplastic hip and pseudo-acetabulum. Earlier interventions included Chiari pelvic osteotomy, femoral osteotomy and femoral lengthening, which did not improve pain and function in the longer term. The surgical approach via robot-assisted surgery lead to positive outcomes in the short-term (four months post-surgery) and medium-term (17 months post-surgery) in this specific case. "

pub.1165002104,Randomized double controlled study of the accuracy of lower limb mechanical axis alignment,"The objectives of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are pain relief, increased range of motion, and alignment of the mechanical axis of the limb. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of alignment of the mechanical axis of the lower limb during robotic primary TKA in comparison with computer navigation and manual technique. A prospective double controlled study of 99 patients randomized into groups was performed. Group A (main) included 29 patients who underwent robot-assisted TKA, group B (control) included 32 patients who underwent standard endoprosthetic technique, and group C (control) included 31 patients who underwent computer-navigated arthroplasty. Telerentgenogram and computed tomographic examination were performed, and the accuracy of mechanical alignment of the limb axis was analyzed. In group A, the accuracy of the mechanical axis is up to ± 1° — 72%, from ±1º to ±3º — 28%, in group B up to ± 1° — 30%, from ± 1° to ±3° — 55%, and more than ± 3° — 15%, in group C up to ± 1° — 45%, from ± 1º to ±3º — 48%, more than 3º — 7%. The accuracy of the alignment of the mechanical axis of the limb with robotic TKA up to ±1° is 72%, statistically significantly exceeds manual technique (30%) and computer navigation (45%), which opens up new prospects in the survival of endoprostheses."
pub.1163530270,Robot-Assisted Partial Knee Replacement versus Standard Total Knee Replacement (RoboKnees): A Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background <p>Total knee arthroplasty is a common surgery for end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Partial knee arthroplasty is also a treatment option for patients with arthritis present in only one or two knee compartments. Partial knee arthroplasty can preserve the natural knee biomechanics, but these replacements may not last as long as total knee replacements. Robotic assisted orthopaedic techniques can help facilitate partial knee replacements, increasing accuracy and precision. This trial will investigate the feasibility and assess clinical outcomes for a larger definitive trial.</p>
Methods <p>This is a protocol for an ongoing parallel randomized pilot trial of 64 patients with uni- or bicompartmental knee arthritis. Patients are randomized to either receive robot assisted partial knee arthroplasty or manual total knee arthroplasty. The primary outcome for this pilot is investigating the feasibility for a larger trial. Secondary (clinical) outcomes include joint awareness, return to activities, knee function, patient global impression of change, persistent post-surgical pain, re-operations, resource utilization and cost-effectiveness, health-related quality of life, radiographic alignment, knee kinematics during walking gait, and complications up to 24-months post-surgery.</p>

pub.1160398175,Pose Quality Prediction for Vision Guided Robotic Shoulder Arthroplasty,"Surgical assistive robots offer the potential for drastically improved patient outcomes through more accurate, more repeatable surgical procedures like shoulder arthroplasty operations. Existing robotic systems typically rely on optical marker tracking and require invasive marker attachment for localization, complicating the surgical workflow and patient recovery. But moving towards a markerless system is very challenging, both because of the absolute difficulty and the large variation in localization conditions across thousands of surgical procedures. In this paper we propose an alternative approach: rather than try to create a “perfect” and fully generalizable markerless localization system, instead create a reliable and trustworthy localization system that is able to continually self-assess the likely quality of its localization esti-mates, and act accordingly. We propose a lightweight method for predicting vision-based pose estimation performance using internal pipeline artifacts (without needing external ground truth from a marker-based system). Using extensive real robot experiments with challenging actual imagery from surgery, we demonstrate our prediction system accurately self-characterizes the localization system's performance across a wide range of localization conditions, and demonstrate that this prediction system generalizes to a range of surgical conditions. We then show how online performance prediction can drive active robot navigation that minimizes localization error, reducing target pose estimation error by 96.1% for rotation and 96.7% for translation compared to rejected alternative trajectories."
pub.1156160301,ASSESSING PREOPERATIVE LOWER LIMB CORONAL ALIGNMENT IN THE SETTING OF KNEE ARTHROPLASTY: A COMPARISON OF WEIGHTBEARING HIP-KNEE-ANKLE RADIOGRAPHS WITH INTRAOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT USING CT-BASED NAVIGATION,"Accurate evaluation of lower limb coronal alignment is essential for effective pre-operative planning of knee arthroplasty. Weightbearing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs are considered the gold standard. Mako SmartRobotics uses CT-based navigation to provide intra-operative data on lower limb coronal alignment during robotic assisted knee arthroplasty. This study aimed to compare the correlation between the two methods in assessing coronal plane alignment.
                  Patients undergoing Mako partial (PKA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were identified from our hospital database. The hospital PACS system was used to measure pre-operative coronal plane alignment on HKA radiographs. This data was correlated to the intraoperative deformity assessment during Mako PKA and TKA surgery.
                  443 consecutive Mako knee arthroplasties were performed between November 2019 and December 2021. Weightbearing HKA radiographs were done in 56% of cases. Data for intraoperative coronal plane alignment was available for 414 patients. 378 knees were aligned in varus, and 36 in valgus. Mean varus deformity was 7.46° (SD 3.89) on HKA vs 7.13° (SD 3.56) on Mako intraoperative assessment, with a moderate correlation (R= 0.50, p<0.0001). Intraoperative varus deformity of 0-4° correlated to HKA measured varus (within 3°) in 60% of cases, compared to 28% for 5-9°, 17% for 10-14°, and in no cases with >15° deformity. Mean valgus deformity was 6.44° (SD 4.68) on HKA vs 4.75° (SD 3.79) for Mako, with poor correlation (R=0.18, p=0.38).
                  In this series, the correlation between weightbearing HKA radiographs and intraoperative alignment assessment using Mako SmartRobotics appears to be poor, with greater deformities having poorer correlation."

Longetivity of TKA primarily depends on proper implant alignment. The Aim of this study is to compare the precision of robotic assisted TKA with the ideally planned mechanical parameters in TKA.
                  A total of 50 robotic assisted TKA patients were included retrospectively in the study. Patient’s post operative mechanical femorotibial angle (mFTA), Lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (mPTA) in AP radiogram.and anterior femoral offset ratio, posterior condylar offset ratio, femoral component flexion, posterior tibial slope in lateral radiograms were evaluated with ideal values for specific parameter. Number of outliers were counted separately with values beyond 3 of malalignment.
                  The mean postoperative FTA, LDFA, mPTA recorded is 0.15 ±0.70, 89.78±0.79, 89.80±0.86 respectively. The mean postoperative posterior tibial slope, femoral flexion is 3.03±0.35, 3.14±0.60 respectively. All the parameters when compared with planned ideal values (i.e. mFTA= 0, mPTA=90, LDFA=90, Posterior tibial slope=3, femoral component flexion=3) did not show significant difference.
                  Study shows promising results with near normal execution of planned TKA. Robotic assisted TKA can be a game changer and a handy tool to improve the alignment of mechanical axis in TKAs."
pub.1092803275,A Robotic Model of Hip Dislocation Potential: Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus Femoral Head Resurfacing,"Hip dislocation often results from neck impingement and subsequent subluxation. Having a model to study impingent-free range of motion (ROM) and dislocation potential at the impingement postures can elucidate the contribution to joint stability of prosthetic design, component position, anatomical variables, and biomechanical factors. Much controversy surrounds the resurgence of femoral head resurfacing (FHR) and its biomechanical implications of retaining the femoral neck, particularly its head-neck ratio. We have developed a dynamic cadaveric robotics model that functions in real time under load-control parameters to recreate in vivo hip mechanics. This study specifically identifies and compares the impingent-free ROM and a stability index value that quantifies the dislocation potential in the native hip, femoral head resurfacing and total hip replacement (size 28, 36mm femoral heads).Copyright © 2011 by ASME"
pub.1135264669,Frequency of soft-tissue releases and their effect on patient reported outcomes in robotic-assisted TKA.,"Soft tissue releases are often required to correct deformity and achieve balance in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, releasing soft tissues can be subjective, highly variable and is perceived as an ‘art’ in TKA. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of soft tissue release required to achieve a balanced knee in tibial-first gap- balancing versus conventional, measured resection TKA, and its effect on outcomes.
                  Soft tissue releases were documented and reviewed in 1256 robotic-assisted gap- balancing and 85 robotic-assisted measured-resection TKAs. Knees were stratified by coronal deformity (varus: >2° varus; valgus: >2° valgus). Rates of releases were compared between the two groups and literature. A subset of these patients were also enrolled in a prospective study. KOOS outcomes were captured pre-operatively and at 6M post TKA.
                  The frequency of soft tissue release was significantly lower in the robotic gap- balancing group, with 21% of knees requiring release versus 40% (p=0.001) in the robotic measured resection group and 67% (p<0.001) for conventional measured resection. Pre-operative KOOS scores were similar between groups, however 6M scores showed a significant improvement in QOL, Sports and Symptoms scores in knees not released.
                  Robotic assisted TKA with predictive gap balancing was found to reduce the number of releases across all coronal angles compared to conventional instruments. Furthermore, performing a soft tissue release rather than bone resection to achieve balance, correlated with worse outcomes. Further research is required to understand when imbalance should be corrected with bone resection adjustment versus soft tissue release."

Real-time input and personalization help surgeons achieve their aim with robotic surgery. Method This single-center, non-randomized, retrospective study included male and female patients over 18 years with primary OA knee with Varus and Valgus deformity, and able to provide written informed consent. Patients with infected TKR requiring revisional surgery and those reluctant to engage in the trial were excluded. The accuracy and efficiency of the fully automated Joint Robot was measured by the difference between planned and measured resection thickness and angle. Results The study enrolled 100 patients of whom 53 % underwent RA-TKA of right knee and 47 % had left knee RA-TKA. Women patients dominated the study (69 %), and overall average age of the patients enrolled was 65.55 ± 9.15 years. The difference in mean resection thickness was well within the desired limit, with root mean square of 0.78 mm and 0.96 mm in medial distal and lateral distal planes; 0.94 mm and 1.13 mm in posterior femoral planes. Medial tibial as well as lateral tibial planes were 0.83 and 0.95 mm. The differences in mean resection angle were 0.77° (varus/valgus [V/V]), 0.98° (flexion/extension [F/E]) at distal femoral plane and 0.59° (V/V) and 1.5° (F/E) at posterior femoral plane. At tibial plane V/V was 0.76° and 0.85 °F/E. Conclusion The study's results support the efficacy and precision of RA-TKA, showcasing its ability to maintain resection thickness and angles in line with anticipated values. These findings solidify the reliability and safety of robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty, characterized by minimal variations in resection parameters."

pub.1122138863,Accuracy of Soft Tissue Balancing in Robotic-Assisted Measured-Resection TKA Using a Robotic Distraction Tool,"Achieving proper soft tissue balance during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can reduce post- operative instability and stiffness as well as improve patient reported outcomes. The objective of this study was to compare final intra-operative coronal balance throughout the knee range of motion in navigated robotic-assisted TKA when performed with quantifiable feedback from a robotic ligament tensioning tool versus with standard trials and navigation measurements alone.
                  The study included a prospective cohort of 52 patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA using a measured resection technique. The cohort was divided into two sequential groups: a non-sensor-assisted group (n=25) and a subsequent sensor-assisted group (n=27). Once bony cuts and soft tissue balancing was performed in the non-sensor cohort, the final tibiofemoral gaps were measured throughout the knee range of motion using a robotic-assisted tensioner with the surgeon blinded to the measurements. For the sensor cohort, the surgeon preformed soft-tissue releases or re-cuts in order to balance the knee using the gap measurement data from the robotic tensioner. The robotic-assisted tensioner was then used to measure the final medial and lateral gap measurements.
                  The average mediolateral gap difference throughout the range of flexion was 1.9 ± 0.7 mm with maximum difference of 7.8 mm for the non-sensor cohort. The sensor cohort had an average mediolateral difference of 1.5 ± 0.6 mm and a maximum difference of 3.8 mm. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant from 60 to 90 degrees of flexion. 38-41% of knees were balanced to within 1 mm mediolaterally in the non-sensor group compared to 48-70% for the sensor group when measured at various flexion angles. 65-76% of knees were balanced to within 2 mm for the non-sensor group compared to 78-86% for the sensor-assisted group. The number of knees requiring subsequent soft tissue releases was similar in each group. Soft tissue balancing with the aid of a robotic tensioning tool resulted in significantly more accurate soft tissue balance than when using navigation measurements and standard trials alone in this single surgeon study."

pub.1007585153,History of Robots in Orthopedics,"The concept of machines performing tasks normally done by humans was first introduced in 1921 by Czechoslovakian playwright Karel Capek. His play “Rossum’s Universal Robots” was a satirical piece intended to protest the growth of technology in Western civilization. However, much to his dismay the play had the opposite effect. Public fascination with robots increased and to this day is still a fascination of modern society. The word robot is derived from the Czechoslovakian word “robata” which is defined as forced labor or servitude. According to Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary its simplest definition is “a device that automatically performs complicated often repetitive tasks” [1]. The term robotics was first introduced by Isaac Asimov in 1938 in his short story “Runaround” for Super Science Stories Magazine. This was followed by a series of short stories that were later collected and published as “I Robot” in 1942. He used the term robotics to describe three laws governing robot behavior which later became the inspiration for the 2004 movie “I Robot”. In society today robots are used to perform highly specific and precise tasks that are impossible to perform or difficult to perform reproducibly by humans. They are utilized in manufacturing, exploration of space and the deep sea, and work in hazardous environments to name a few examples [2]."
pub.1127572963,Tricompartmental Knee Osteoarthritis: Total Knee Arthroplasty,"In tricompartmental knee osteoarthritis, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective technique when conservative treatment fails. Despite the excellent results of TKA in the medium and long term, however, 15–20% of patients are not satisfied with the procedure. To optimize the results, there are methods for controlling perioperative pain and the blood loss associated with the procedure, as well as new technologies (navigation, patient-specific techniques, and robotics). TKA is a cost-effective procedure; however, the exponential growth in its use has led to the development of fast-track protocols to accommodate its projected high demand. Due to its high risk of perioperative complications, simultaneous bilateral TKA should be carefully assessed, and candidates should be selected with care. National registries have evidenced the development and evolution of TKA in countries that have established these registries and have shown discrepancies between surgeon preferences from differing regions. These national registries are essential for managing the large-scale implementation of new designs and generating alerts when these designs are inadequate for patient safety and outcomes. Close international collaboration is therefore essential to better understanding the global approach for new TKA designs."
pub.1168879373,Robotergestützte Rehabilitation nach Knieendoprothese: Sinn oder Unsinn?,"Innovative technologies for postoperative patient rehabilitation consist of eHealth, virtual reality, telemedicine and wearables. The latter can be combined with robotic support structure and form the basis of robot-assisted rehabilitation devices. Besides the potential side effects of cost reduction, the relief of human resources, particularly in structurally disadvantaged regions, shows a potential socioeconomic benefit of these machines. The potential cost-effectiveness and the evaluation of clinical benefits in terms of patient-oriented aftercare remains the subject of current research. Two systematic reviews have shown that the use of these innovative devices may be a useful add-on strategy as part of conventional rehabilitation. For the early and midterm postoperative period, partly significant improvements of walking ability, range of motion, pain level and muscle function were observed. However, due to the limited patient numbers, the heterogeneity of the available studies, the associated potential bias (selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias), an evidence-based assessment of robotic-assisted rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty can currently not be undertaken. To date, these technologies seem to represent a useful add-on therapy within the postoperative rehabilitation process. Due to the upcoming structural and personal challenges in health systems, studies regarding robotic-assisted rehabilitation should continue to identify the best possible applications."
pub.1110761926,Accuracy of Robotic Arm Assisted Total Hip Replacement Planning Tool,"Background: Preoperative templating is an integral part of planning a successful total hip arthroplasty (THA), and helps minimise complications that can arise both intraoperatively and postoperatively. The aim of our study is to determine the reliability of the robotic arm assisted (MAKO fully enhanced) total hip replacement surgical system as a surgical planning tool (not to validate the robot in its execution as it has previously been done) in comparison to conventional acetate and digital templating.Method: The planning stages of fifty consecutive uncemented THA performed by a single robotic orthopedic surgeon was analyzed against what was achieved during the surgery. The variables analyzed were cup inclination, cup anteversion, combined anteversion, hip length, hip combined offset, femur size, femur component neck angle and cup size.Results: There was a significant correlation between planned and actual results. The component sizes were planned to accuracy within one size in 100% of femurs, 100% of femur neck-shaft angles and 98% of cups. Cup inclination, anteversion and combined anteversion were planned to accuracy within three degrees in 84%, 96% and 94% of cases respectively. Hip length and combined offset were planned to accuracy within three millimeters in 88% and 78% of cases respectively.Conclusion: The robotic arm assisted total hip replacement surgical system is a predictable and accurate planning tool and is superior to conventional acetate and digital templating.Level of evidence: Level III"

The main reasons are that they are safe, allow accurately controlling the range of movement of the individual’s lower-limbs, and can vary their speed and torque to make the movements, according to physiotherapist instructions. This work introduces the exoskeleton ALLOR (Advanced Lower Limb Orthoses for Rehabilitation), which was developed at UFES/Brazil, and presents an experimental protocol to be applied to rehabilitation of individuals with motor impairments. The proposed protocol is progressive and explores the different control strategies implemented in ALLOR: passive, mobilization, assisted, active and resisted, which are suitable for individual’s rehabilitation in three scenarios addressed in this work: stroke, total knee arthroplasty, and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Clinical and functional parameters are also proposed to assess improvements in motion characteristics and its impact over general quality of life, locomotion and pain in the individuals."

pub.1131074151,Total Hip Arthroplasty in Patients Younger than 35 Is Effective Regardless of Surgical Approach,"Abstract
                  Despite the increasing frequency of younger patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA), very few, if any, studies report on postoperative outcomes that specifically compare the two most commonly used approaches in this age group. The purpose of our study is to assess whether surgical approach affects postoperative outcomes in THA patients younger than 35 years. A retrospective analysis of 115 patients younger than 35 years that underwent primary unilateral THA between January 2013 and April 2018 was conducted. Patients were divided into two cohorts: (1) patients that underwent THA utilizing the anterior approach and (2) patients that underwent THA utilizing the posterior approach. Subanalysis controlling for surgical case complexity and use of robotic assistance was performed. Radiographic analysis included measurement of perioperative leg length discrepancies. Of the total 115 patients, 37 were in the anterior THA cohort, and 78 were in the posterior THA cohort. All baseline patient characteristics were similar among both cohorts. Patients in the anterior THA cohort had shorter mean operative times (95 vs. 121 minutes; p < 0.01) and shorter mean hospital length of stay or LOS (1.9 vs. 2.8 days; p < 0.01). Leg length discrepancies, dislocation, revision, and all-cause postoperative complication rates were similar between both cohorts. When excluding complex cases and use of robotic assistance (anterior n = 36, posterior n = 39), there was no difference in operative time, LOS, or postoperative outcomes. Our study suggests that surgically complex patients were more likely to undergo posterior rather than anterior THA. When controlling for surgical complexity and use of robotic assistance, no difference between approach with respect to operative time, hospital LOS, dislocation, revision, and all-cause postoperative surgical complication rates in THA recipients under 35 years of age was found. The results suggest that the anterior and posterior approaches can be equally effective for the majority of young THA patients."

pub.1171032852,Physical Human–Robot Interaction Based on Adaptive Impedance Control for Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty,"The performance of human–robot interaction can be enhanced by imposing force constraints through virtual fixture (VF) algorithms. In this article, an adaptive impedance-based VF scheme is proposed, aiming to improve the accuracy of human–robot interaction in robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RA-THA). We developed a multimode impedance controller that realizes four distinct functional modes according to boundary divisions of the VF: free dragging, position constraints, restriction, and restoration of manipulability. A variable impedance control algorithm that adaptively adjusts the damping, stiffness, and force limitations is proposed to achieve precise stopping of the robot at the VF boundary. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved via Lyapunov theory. Experimental results demonstrate that the controller delivers precise, smooth, and stable VF constraints, even at varying velocities and in complex force interactions. The VF constraints are accurate within 1 mm, effectively improving the accuracy of human–robot interaction in RA-THA."
pub.1140220665,Computer Navigation in Hip Arthroplasty,"This chapter describes the different types of computer navigation systems available and their use in total hip arthroplasty and hip resurfacing. It explores the limitations to navigation which have prevented a more widespread uptake. Hip arthritis is a major cause of disability worldwide. The key to the success of a total hip replacement is accurate alignment and stability of the components; a poorly aligned acetabular cup increases the risk of dislocation, reduces the range of motion and can also accelerate component wear, leading to early prosthesis failure. Orthopaedic procedures dealing with a nondeformable tissue such as bone are suitable for computerised guidance based on pre-operatively and intra-operatively obtained images. Computer-assisted surgery can take a number of forms ranging from active and semi-active robotic systems which rely, at least in part, on the robot performing part of the procedure to the more passive navigation systems which do not perform any part of the procedure."
pub.1139723996,Patient‐Specific Instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"This chapter presents a case scenario of a 65‐year‐old male patient with tricompartmental knee osteoarthritis. He is interested in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and has heard about “personalized” implants on social media. Patient‐specific instrumentation (PSI) has increased in popularity in recent years as orthopedic surgery responds to growing trend of personalized medicine. Multiple randomized controlled trials have compared PSI to standard instrumentation in terms of radiographic outcomes. Computer‐assisted navigation and robotic‐assisted total joint replacement surgery do appear to result in accurate component positioning. Patient‐specific instrumentation has a theoretical potential to alleviate at least some of these concerns, such as component position, unnecessary bony resection, and soft tissue dissection. PSI is available in one of two main ways: through the company providing the TKA implants or through the hospital, in form of three‐dimensional planning and printing of instruments, followed by on‐site sterilization and packaging. The chapter provides recommendations for implementing evidence‐based practice in the clinical setting."
pub.1068822315,Body-Supported Medical Robots: A Survey,"In medical robotics applications it is often advantageous for a robot to be directly mounted on or supported by the body of the patient during a medical procedure or examination. Whereas early medical robot systems were generally manipulator arms with a large base resting on the floor or mounted to the table next to the patient, several more recently developed systems rest directly on the patient. Body-supported medical robots can be designed to be much more compact and lightweight, leading to improved accuracy and safety and reduced cost, and are easier to set up and use in the operating room environment compared to conventional robot manipulator arms. Five examples of body-supported surgical robots are surveyed in this paper: The ARTHROBOT for total hip arthroplasty, PRAXITELES for knee arthroplasty, MARS for spinal pedicle screw placement and drill guiding, TER for remote ultrasound examinations, and LER for endoscope positioning in minimally invasive surgery."

It is well known that this intervention not only improves the quality of life, but also helps to restore the function of the joint and eliminate axial deformities. Purpose to compare early results of total knee arthroplasty using robot-assisted technology with conventional manual technique. Materials and methods 20 patients diagnosed with stage 3 osteoarthritis of the knee joint and varus deformity of the knee joint axis were included in a prospective randomized study. Patients were divided into 2 representative groups, 10 subjects underwent robot-assisted knee arthroplasty, and the conventional manual technique was used in the other 10 patients. For clinical assessment, functional scales KSS, WOMAC, Lysholm Score were used, postoperative radiographs were evaluated. Results According to clinical functional scales, 10 days after surgery, there was an improvement in performance in the patients of both groups (p < 0.05); the duration of the operation in the patients of both groups did not differ in general; intra-operative blood loss in the group with robot-assisted arthroplasty was lower; and assessment of postoperative results by radiological imaging showed a better component positioning according to preoperative planning in the robotic group. Discussion When the operation is performed by experienced surgeons, one can expect the correct position of the components and the balance of the ligamentous apparatus in standard arthroplasty.

pub.1038126864,History of Computer-Assisted Surgery,"When computer-assisted surgery was introduced in the early 1990s, the interest of orthopedic specialists was first focused on robotics. In 1995, when we started with computer navigation for the placement of pedicle screws at Ruhr University Bochum, no-one could imagine that this method would gain entry into orthopedic theaters. It involved timeconsuming planning and required preoperative computed tomography (CT); moreover, pairedpoint and surface matching during the operation was difficult for the surgeon (◘ Fig. 1.1)."
pub.1134261814,"Comparision of outcomes of posterior cruciate ligament substituting vs retaining in total knee arthroplasty-a prospective, randomised, open labelled study of 30 cases","Introduction: The role of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been widely discussed in the orthopaedic literature. Theoretical and functional arguments and survivorship have all been used to support both its retention and its substitution. Moreover, with the advent of robotics and ever evoluting kinematic surgical procedures, the results for the cruciate-retaining arthroplasties are found to be more variable than for the cruciate substituting arthroplasties. The present study is sought to investigate if there was a difference in the clinical outcome as measured by the commonly-used scoring systems which includes (International Knee Society Score, Western Ontario McMasters Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and the SF- 36 health survey along with the radiological scores and outcomes of the two procedures in TKA. Methodology and Results: We performed a prospective, randomized trial of 30 patients to compare the functional outcomes of a posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining and posterior- cruciate-ligament substituting total knee arthroplasty. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t-test and ANOVA test for multiple trials. At follow-up at 3 months, no statistically significant differences were found in the clinical outcome measurements for either design. The results of the WOMAC 35 score which were subdivided into pain, stiffness and function showed high scores for cruciate substituting groups for pain as compared to the cruciate retaining groups whereas, other parameters were same in both the groups. For other systems including SF-36 and knee society score the results did not seem to vary to a great extent statistically. Conclusion: To conclude the present study found almost similar results for Cruciate ligament retaining and substituting procedures in long term follow up at 3 months, with slightly better outcomes for Cruciate ligament retaining groups at the earliest phases pre operatively and post operatively."

pub.1175097696,Simulation of a Total Knee Arthroplasty System Based on Extended Reality,"Total arthroplasty is one of the most common knee surgeries and, due to the ageing of the population, the number of procedures performed each year is expected to increase. With almost a quarter of patients dissatisfied, systems for computer assistance in orthopaedic surgery have been on the rise, appearing to have better outcomes than conventional techniques by reproducing a planned alignment with a similar learning curve. The search for inexpensive solutions to improve these prototypes is extremely relevant since most systems in the market involve expensive robots. The development of a simulation for an extended reality system, specifically spatial augmented reality, with a projector and a depth camera to project the desired total knee arthroplasty bone cuts onto a simulated knee joint has been proposed. It was created with Gazebo and communicates with the Robotic Operating System (ROS) framework so that it can easily be transposed to the real world. An evaluation of the simulator was performed regarding the projection’s accuracy. The performance of the simulator was fitting for surgery, with the highest mean position error between the desired bone cut and the simulated bone cut of 1.11 ± 0.86 mm (minimum = 0.00 mm, maximum = 2.60 mm) for the tibia cut. These values could be further improved with the implementation of a feature-matching algorithm and a dynamic projection."
pub.1169417541,Endoprothetik im Wandel: die Rolle der künstlichen Intelligenz,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is very likely to be a pioneering technology in arthroplasty, with a wide range of pre-, intra- and postoperative applications. The opportunities for patients, physicians and healthcare policy are considerable, especially in the context of optimized and individualized patient care. Despite these diverse possibilities, there are currently only a few AI applications in routine clinical practice, mainly due to the limited availability of analyzable health data. AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained with. If the data is insufficient, incomplete or biased, the AI may draw false conclusions. The current results of such AI applications in arthroplasty must therefore be viewed critically, especially as previous databases were not designed a priori for AI applications. The successful integration of AI therefore requires a targeted focus on the development of a specific data structure. In order to exploit the full potential of AI, comprehensive clinical data volumes are required, which can only be realized through a multicentric approach. In this context, ethical and data protection issues remain a further question, and not only in orthopedics. Cooperative efforts at a national and international level are therefore essential in order to research and develop new AI applications."
pub.1169575699,3D Reconstruction of Femur using Ultrasound - Hand Guided Evaluation and Autonomous Robotic Approach,"Total Knee Arthroplasty is a frequently performed surgery. Patient specific planning and implants may improve surgical outcome. For this purpose, 3D models of the bones are required, which are typically generated by using computed tomography. A radiation free and cheaper alternative could be ultrasound. However, bone segmentation and a competitive method of creating a complete bone model are a challenge. In this work a fully-automatic bone reconstruction pipeline using ultrasound, which includes machine learning based image segmentation and an interpolation algorithm for missing areas using statistical shape models, is presented and evaluation results with free hand probe guidance are outlined. A mean surface distance error of 0.96 mm for femur bone reconstruction is achieved. Furthermore, a robotic scanning approach is presented to automate the entire process. Autonomous scanning of the anterior distal femur was successful for 4 out of 5 probands. On average, 54 % of the accessed bone surface could be reconstructed."
pub.1101239939,Osteotomies: Advanced and Complex Techniques,"We started performing precise surgery based upon CT plans in the last century – the first embodiment of this approach was a robotic assistant built for total knee replacement, the “Acrobot” [1]. Abundant evidence now exists to confirm that assistive technologies enable surgeons to achieve their preoperative goals [2]. The concept of planned surgery is therefore not novel. Patient-matched instruments share several key elements with the robotic platform, and these formed the basis of this current project. The essential elements include image segmentation, planning, and registration. We applied the know-how of these dimensions to design and build patient-matched guides for a range of tasks using biocompatible polymer 3D printers. Having established a workflow for arthroplasty, the adaptation of the same principles to osteotomy was a short step, requiring software to be developed to deliver semiautomated useful information regarding limb segment alignment and the shapes of bones."

pub.1128882052,Kinematic Alignment Total Knee Replacement with Personalized Instruments,"There is a very wide variation in patients’ knee anatomy. The precise restoration of this anatomy during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may improve knee balance, clinical function and patient satisfaction. In the early ages of TKA, implant sizes and surgical precision were limited. The amount of deviation from a patient’s anatomy that may impact on clinical results is not clear. However, in the era of personalized joint replacement, we believe that a precision of within 2 mm or 2° should be the goal. Performing a kinematically aligned (KA) TKA requires accurate planning of resections and precise tools to achieve the set goals. Patient-specific instrumentation is a very attractive solution. These patient-specific instruments (PSI) are constructed based upon preoperative planning using either tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging. 3D models of the patient’s knee, hip and ankle are reconstructed and anatomical landmarks are identified to set the parameters of tibia and femur resections according to the surgeon’s preferences. Compared to standard instruments, computer navigation or robotic surgery, PSI results in a shorter operating time and decreased instrumentation. PSI is a simple, standardised solution for a patient-specific restricted KA protocol in TKA, with many benefits to the surgeon and patient."

pub.1122138913,Robotic Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: Addressing 1-12 Degrees Valgus Knees,"The purpose of this work was to determine the number of soft tissue releases and component orientation of valgus cases performed with Robotic-Arm Assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA).
                  This study was a retrospective chart review of cases performed by a single surgeon from July 2016 to December 2017. 72 RATKA cases were defined as having a valgus deformity pre-operatively. Patient demographics and intraoperative surgical details were collected, including initial and final 3D component alignment, knee balancing gaps, full or partial releases. Post- operatively, radiographs, adverse events, and reduced WOMAC pain and KOOS Jr scores were collected at 6 months post-operatively.
                  Pre-operatively, knee deformities ranged from 1o to 12° with fixed flexion contracture. All knees were corrected within 2.5 degrees of mechanical neutral. Medial and lateral gaps were balanced in extension 100% of cases and flexion 93% of cases.
                  Radiographic evidence suggested well seated and well-fixed components. No revision and re- operation is reported. Patient reported outcomes measures collected at 6-month follow up indicated an improvement in WOMAC pain score from 9.6 to 3.2 and improvement in KOOS Jr from 44.7 to 74.4 points.
                  In this retrospective case review, soft tissue releases were not needed to address valgus knees ranging from 1-12° of deformity. The surgeon was able to balance the knee with bone resections and avoid disturbing the soft tissue envelope. While this study has a number of limitations, RATKA for valgus knees should continue to be investigated in a multicenter study."
pub.1122138833,Combining Multiple Technologies to Achieve Optimized Surgical Outcomes in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Purpose
                  Innovative technologies such as robotic assistance and intraoperative load sensors for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) aim to reduce outliers, as well as to address patient dissatisfaction. There is currently no information available that assesses the findings of using these technologies together during TKA.
                  Methods
                  Intraoperative data on alignment, gap spacing, and quantitative balance was prospectively collected in a cohort of 79 consecutive TKAs performed with robotic assistance. An instrumented trial component was utilized that captured medial and lateral tibio-femoral loads, allowing the quantitative assessment balance.
                  Results
                  Of the 79 knees, 58 (73%) had varus alignment and 21 (37%) had valgus. We divided these groups into correctable and fixed deformities. Correctable varus knees: At trial reduction 30% of the knees demonstrated quantitative imbalance at trial reduction. Fixed varus knees. At trial reduction 55% (of knees were deemed imbalanced. Correctable valgus knees: At trial reduction, 35% were imbalanced. Fixed valgus knees: Half of the knees (n=2) were imbalanced at trial reduction. The imbalance in all groups was addressed with combinations of bone and soft tissue adjustments so that at final implantation 99% of cases (n=78) were quantitatively balanced
                  Conclusion
                  While the robot was both precise and accurate with its cuts to create appropriate gap spaces, only 57% were quantitatively balanced. Ultimately, almost all knees were balanced with final implants, but that state required the use of additional techniques, including soft tissue and bony modifications. More data is needed to determine if these technologies will equate to increased clinical success."
pub.1093420698,Medical Robot and Master Slave System for Minimally Invasive Surgery,"A robotic surgical system reduces stress on the patient, equalizes differences in the quality of local medical service, and enhances emergency medical care and medical education. Robotic surgery is particularly appropriate for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) because it achieveshigh operational accuracy even in concealed regions. The minimallyinvasive surgical system introduced in this paper comprises master manipulators operated by a surgeon and slave manipulators that conduct the surgery. The system transmits the total environment of the operating room and reduces the load applied to soft tissues by approximately 30% by implementing an augmented force presentation capability for the surgeon. In the system developed for the total knee arthroplasty (TKA), minimal invasiveness was achieved by generating a tool path employing multiple degrees of freedom of the surgical robot to avoid injury to the soft tissues. The bone-cutting force and resulting temperature rise were limited by employing cutting conditions compatible with bone viability."
pub.1090687485,Prevention and Treatment of Limb-Length Discrepancy in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"The prevention of leg-length discrepancy after total hip arthroplasty requires a careful patient history, physical examination, and radiographic assessment. When the source and amount of preoperative leg-length discrepancy are understood, a careful preoperative plan can be designed to restore leg-length equalization. Intraoperative execution of the preoperative plan requires a systematic approach that depends partly on the chosen surgical approach. The use of the anatomic landmarks, intraoperative calipers, intraoperative radiographs, computer-assisted navigation, and robotic-assisted surgery all have excellent published results for restoring accurate leg lengths postoperatively. Some preoperative leg-length differences cannot be restored due to risk of nerve injury or hip stability and the patient should be counseled preoperatively to avoid postoperative patient dissatisfaction. Most postoperative leg-length discrepancies (between 5 mm and 1 cm) will not be noticeable to patients at 1 year postoperatively. Patients who remain symptomatic can usually be treated with a shoe insert to equalize leg lengths. In rare instances, a symptomatic patient may be unsatisfied with shoe inserts and revision surgery can be performed. Shortening of the operative limb can be performed with femoral head exchange or acetabular component revision. The discrepancy can also be addressed with a distal shortening femoral osteotomy. If the patient has contralateral hip osteoarthritis, planned lengthening can also be performed at time of subsequent total hip arthroplasty. This chapter outlines several techniques to help minimize an unexpected postoperative leg-length discrepancy and describes the treatment of symptomatic leg-length inequality."

pub.1156952250,Quantifying 30 Years of Technological Innovation in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Abstract
                  Technological innovation in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a critical component of health care delivery for improving patient outcomes. Analyzing the content of patents and trends in their activity over time can leverage insight into innovations in THA; however, these investigations remain underutilized. We aimed to quantify patent activity and relative growth pertaining to technologies in THA over a 30-year period. A query for patents relating to “hip replacement” or “hip arthroplasty” between 1989 and 2019 using an open-source patent database yielded 24,071 unique patents for analysis. These were grouped into 12 independent technology clusters using Cooperative Patent Classification codes. Annual patent activity for each cluster was normalized with a validated formula to control for exponential growth. The 5-, 10-, and 30-year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for each cluster were quantified and compared between clusters. Annual cumulative patent activity increased from 151 patents in 1989 to 1,182 patents in 2019, representing a 682.8% increase. The largest technology clusters concerned “drugs” (n = 6,429 patents), “instruments” (n = 4,014 patents), “materials” (n = 2,037 patents), and “components” (n = 1,946 patents). One-half of the identified clusters concerned developments in technology-assisted THA (patient-specific instrumentation, navigation, robotics, design/manufacturing, instruments, and computer modeling). The most rapidly growing technology within the past 5, 10, and 30 years was robotics (CAGR = 15.82%, 20.11%, and 9.50%, respectively). Within the past 5- and 10-year trial prostheses (CAGR = 10.76%) and design/manufacturing processes (CAGR = 10.27%), computer modeling (CAGR = 12.91%) and navigation (CAGR = 11.25%) were among the most rapidly growing clusters, respectively. The majority of patents pertaining to THA over the past 30 years have concerned developments in drugs, instruments, materials, and components. Within the past 10-years, substantial growth has been observed in patent domains related to technology-assisted THA. Monitoring of emerging technologies through patent metrics may provide valuable information for regulatory bodies and assess progress in the field of THA. This is a cross-sectional study with level of evidence IV."
pub.1146629459,Pre- and Intra-operative Dynamic Registration for Total Knee Arthroplasty Based on CT Image Annotation,"Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a promising technique with improved precision and stability when compared with the conventional TKAs performed by surgeons. This paper presents a pre- and intra-operative dynamic registration method based on Computed Tomography (CT) image annotation for an automated robotic surgery system for TKA. In order to register the pre-operatively planned travel path of the oscillating saw to the intraoperative position and orientation of the patient’s lower extremity, tracking tools were fixed to the femur and tibia before surgery for CT scanning. A CT annotation method is proposed to mark the points on the tracking tools’ spherical surfaces. Subsequently, the centers of the spheres are fitted and used to establish the respective coordinate systems. The transformation relationship between the image coordinate system and the pre-operative coordinate system can be obtained. The result shows that registration with a maximum error of 0.0719mm is achieved, which is precise enough to facilitate the intra-operative bone cuts and navigation."

A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract  Background Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an emerging technology that claims to position THA components with a very high degree of accuracy. It is unclear if this increase in accuracy leads to improved long-term functional outcomes of the patient.   Objectives This systematic review aims to compare robot-assisted THA to those done using conventional manual techniques, in terms of both short-term radiographic outcomes, as well as long-term clinical outcomes.   Methods This systematic review will be conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. A literature search will be conducted on the electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Ovid with a pre-determined search strategy. A manual bibliography search of included studies will also be done. Original articles in English that directly compare robot-assisted THA to manual THA will be included. Data on outcomes will be extracted from included studies and analysis carried out with the help of appropriate software. "
pub.1125858848,Role of alignment in successful clinical outcomes following medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: current concepts,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has become increasingly more common, indicating the necessity to better understand factors that may impact outcomes and survivorship. Overcorrection or undercorrection of a varus deformity can increase the risk of postoperative complications including contralateral, lateral compartmental osteoarthritis, component loosening, and component wear following medial UKA. There is no general consensus on the amount of alignment correction to optimise outcomes. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current literature related to alignment, intraoperative alignment correction, and the impact on outcomes and survivorship following medial UKA as well as to explore alternative surgical techniques including patient-specific instrumentation and robotic assistance when managing the varus-malaligned knee with medial UKA. Understanding each of these factors and how they interact is vital in providing patients with promising outcomes following UKA. The ideal alignment is unknown; however, the key is to avoid severe undercorrection and overcorrection of varus malalignment for superior outcomes following medial UKA."
pub.1131068884,Comparison of Precision for Manual versus Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty Performed by Fellows,"Abstract
                  Although various studies have shown that robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (RATHA) is associated with improved component positioning to plan and reduced intraoperative complications, there is still a learning curve for implementation even for experienced surgeons. This study assessed this learning curve for fellows during their training year, by comparing the accuracy and precision of acetabular component positioning, leg length, component offset, and center of rotation between manual THA (MTHA) and RATHA. Six fresh-frozen lower extremity specimens were utilized for surgical procedures performed by two adult reconstruction fellows who were halfway through their training year. The specimens were randomized to undergo one side with manual instrumentation and the contralateral side with RATHA. The final intraoperative surgical plan for rotation, cup orientation, leg length, and offset values were recorded and compared with the actual values measured by computed tomography (CT) scan. Using pre- and postoperative CT scans, the RATHA group was then compared with the MTHA group for accuracy and precision to plan. To assess differences in standard deviations of each measurement, 2-variances testing was performed using α = 0.05. To assess differences in central tendencies of each measurement for each group, Mann–Whitney U tests were performed using α = 0.05. RATHA exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) greater accuracy and precision to plan compared with MTHA in shell version (2.3 ± 1.2° vs. 7.8 ± 4.6°), shell inclination (2.1 ± 1.2° vs. 7.2 ± 3.2), and leg length discrepancy (0.8 ± 0.8 mm vs. 6.4 ± 3.7 mm). Center of head rotation was reported for each anatomical plane. There was no statistical difference in distance from original center of head rotation when considering the superoinferior, mediolateral, and anteroposterior planes as well as when combined as a total deviation in all three planes. The use of CT-guided preoperative planning and intraoperative robotic technology can help surgeons achieve desired implant placement. Results from this study indicate that with limited RATHA experience, surgeons in fellowship training were able to place THA components more accurately and precisely to plan for several important parameters compared with MTHA, namely shell inclination, shell anteversion, and leg length discrepancy."
pub.1122138891,Robotic use improves post-resection bone cuts during total knee arthroplasty,"The purposes of this study were to assess 1) number of bone recuts with manual TKA (MTKA) vs RATKA and 2) influence of robotics on surgeon’s posture and workload during recutting.
                  Two surgeons each performed three MTKAs and three RATKAs. Occurrence, time and type of post-resection recuts were recorded. Movement sensors were placed on surgeons to measure lower back, shoulder, and cervical movements. Data was analyzed for average angle, percent of time in high-risk range of motion (ROM), number of times in high-risk sustained positions, and repetitions per minute. Surgeons were surveyed to assess physical and mental effort on a 1-10 scale (1 as lowest effort).
                  Six TKAs required recuts, five MTKA and one RATKA. 5 were on tibia and 1 (MTKA) was on femur. Compared to RATKA, MTKA had: increased time to perform recut (4.8-minutes vs. 3.7-minutes), increased occiput and T3 (38.9 vs 17.0° and 16.0 vs 3.0°) average angles, increased lower back ROM, sustained positions, and repetitions (14 vs 0%, 1 vs 0, and 1.9 vs 0), increased non-dominant shoulder ROM and repetitions (22 vs 0% and 2 vs 1), reduced dominant shoulder ROM (56 vs 19%), increased mental (4.2 vs 2.8) efforts and increased physical (3.3 vs 1.7) efforts.
                  Results indicate RATKA may reduce incidence of post-resection bone recuts. Increased time and required efforts for MTKA may be due to setting up surgical cutting instruments. Whereas, for RATKA, recut changes are made on the robotic surgical screen and the robotic-arm is used to help perform the recut."
pub.1130329624,Development and Proof-of-Concept Study of a Novel Intraoperative Surgical Planning Tool for Robotic Arm-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background: Intraoperative surgical planning tools (ISPTs) used in current-generation robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) systems (such as Navio® and MAKO®) involve employment of postoperative passive joint balancing. This results in improper ligament tension, which may negatively impact joint stability, which, in turn, may adversely affect patient function after TKA. Methods: A simulation-enhanced ISPT (SEISPT) that provides insights relating to postoperative active joint mechanics was developed. This involved four steps: 1) validation of a multi-body musculoskeletal model; 2) optimization of the validated model; 3) use of the validated and optimized model to derive knee performance equations (KPEs), which are equations that relate implant component characteristics to implant component biomechanical responses; and 4) optimization of the KPEs with respect to these responses. In a proof-of-concept study, KPEs that involved two com - ponent biomechanical responses that have been shown to strongly correlate with poor proprioception (a common patient complaint post-TKA) were used to calculate optimal positions and orientations of the femoral and tibial components in the TKA design implanted in one subject (as reported in a publicly-available dataset). Results: The differences between the calculated implant positions and orientations and the corresponding achieved values for the implant components in the subject were not similar to component position and orientation errors reported in biomechanical literature studies involving Navio® and MAKO®. Also, we indicate how SEISPT could be incorporated into the surgical workflow of Navio® with minimal disruption and increase in cost. Conclusion: SEISPT is a plausible alternative to current-gen - eration ISPTs."

This is the first study to investigate the radiological accuracy of implant component position using the ROSA® knee system with specific reference to Joint Line Height, Tibial Slope, Patella Height and Posterior Condylar Offset. As secondary aims we compared accuracy between image-based and imageless navigation, and between implant designs (Persona versus Vanguard TKA).   Methodology This was a retrospective review of a prospectively-maintained database of the initial 100 consecutive TKAs performed by a high volume surgeon using the ROSA® knee system. To determine the accuracy of component positioning, the immediate post-operative radiograph was reviewed and compared with the immediate pre-operative radiograph with regards to Joint Line Height, Tibial Slope, Patella Height (using the Insall-Salvati ratio) and Posterior Condylar Offset.   Results Mean age of patients undergoing ROSA TKA was 70 years (range, 55 to 95 years). Mean difference in joint line height between pre and post-operative radiographs was 0.2mm (range −1.5 to +1.8mm, p<0.05), posterior condylar offset mean change 0.16mm (range −1.4 to +1.3mm, p<0.05), tibial slope mean change 0.1 degrees (p<0.05) and patella height mean change 0.02 (range −0.1 to +0.1 p<0.05). No significant differences were found between imageless and image-based groups, or between implant designs (Persona versus Vanguard).   Conclusion This study validates the use of the ROSA® knee system in accurately restoring Joint Line Height, Patella Height and Posterior Condylar Offset. "

pub.1130332925,Current state of total knee arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a successful and cost-effective treatment for end-stage degenerative arthritis. The aging of society and an increase in the prevalence of obesity has led to increases in the prevalence of arthritis and the incidence of TKA. Currently, the total number of procedures in Korea per year has reached 90,000. With the rapid growth, we need to know about the current state of TKA. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature regarding TKA. The main indication for TKA is end-stage arthritis with severe pain, reduced function, and no response to conservative management. Metal on the polyethylene-bearing surface and cobalt alloy are used in most TKAs. Despite good clinical outcomes and long-term survival rates after TKA in many papers, 20% of patients are dissatisfied with the outcome of surgery. To improve the patient’s satisfaction, surgeons should understand factors affecting patient’s satisfaction, including patient’s expectations, age, and preoperative mental state. Navigation-assisted surgery and robotic surgery have been introduced in knee arthroplasty to achieve more precise and accurate alignment. There is some evidence to suggest that computer-assisted surgery reduces revision rates. However, clinical efficacy is also controversial, and a long-term follow-up study is required. The common complications of TKA include infection, polyethylene wear, loosening, stiffness, periprosthetic fracture, and thromboembolism. An understanding of the potential complications and pitfalls of TKA is essential for prevention."

pub.1122138845,Early Revision Analysis of Robotic-Arm Assisted and Manual Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Background:
                  The purpose of this study was to evaluate hospital admissions for revision surgeries associated with robotic-arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (rUKA) vs. manual UKA (mUKA) procedures.
                  Methods:
                  Patients ≥18 years of age who received either a mUKA or a rUKA procedure were candidates for inclusion and were identified by the presence of appropriate billing codes. Procedures performed between March 1st, 2013 and July 31st, 2015 were used to calculate the rate of surgical revisions occurring within 24-months of the index procedure. Following propensity matching, 246 rUKA and 492 mUKA patients were included. Revision rates and the associated costs were compared between the two cohorts. The Mann-Whitney U test, was used to compare continuous variables, and fisher’s exact tests was used to analyze discrete categorical variables.
                  Results:
                  At 24-months following the primary UKA procedure, patients who underwent rUKA had fewer revision procedures (0.81% [2/246] vs. 5.28% [26/492]; p=0.002), shorter mean LOS (2.00 vs. 2.33 days; p>0.05), and incurred lower mean costs for the index stay plus revisions ($26,001 vs. $27,915; p>0.05) than mUKA patients. Length of stay at index, and index costs were also lower for rUKA patients (1.77 vs. 2.02 days; p=.0047) and ($25,786 vs. $26,307; p>0.05).
                  Conclusions:
                  Study results demonstrate that patients who underwent rUKA had fewer revision procedures, shorter LOS, and incurred lower mean costs (although not statistically different) during the index admission and at 24-months post-operative. These results could be important for payers as the prevalence of end-stage knee OA increases alongside the demand for cost-efficient treatments."

pub.1166009283,Improvement in primary resection accuracy with Image Free Robotic Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty compared to Navigation,"Aims: Several studies have been performed that compare the accuracy of Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (RATKA) to conventional instrumentation as well as navigation to conventional instrumentation, yet there is a lack of studies comparing RATKA to navigation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a contemporary image free navigation system for TKA in a cadaveric study using the same methodology as used previously to access the accuracy of a RATKA system and conventional instrumentation. Methods: Four orthopaedic surgeons performed bi-lateral TKA on 18 pelvis-to-toe cadaveric specimens without implantation using the BrainLab Knee3 navigation system. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were taken to access the resection accuracy of the navigation system relative to the planned alignment targets recorded intraoperatively. Results: The mean error in femoral coronal angle was 1.08° ± 0.87° compared to 1.39° ± 0.95° conventional and 0.63° ± 0.50° RATKA; the differences between navigation and RATKA were statistically significant. The mean error in the tibial coronal angle was 1.24° ± 1.13° compared to 1.65° ± 1.29° conventional and 0.93° ± 0.72° RATKA. The mean error in femoral flexion was 2.13° ± 1.87° compared to 3.27° ± 2.51° conventional and 1.21° ± 0.90° RATKA; the differences between navigation and manual and navigation and RATKA were statistically significant. The mean errors in the femoral rotation (navigation 1.30° ± 1.38°, conventional 1.00° ± 0.70°, RATKA 1.04° ± 0.81°) and tibial slope (navigation 1.89° ± 1.28°, conventional 1.63° ± 1.39°, RATKA 1.62° ± 1.13°) were similar between the groups. Conclusion: This study showed that for some metrics navigation improves resection accuracy compared to conventional instrumentation and RATKA further improves resection accuracy compared to CAS."
pub.1148571770,Is Robotic Arm Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty More Bone Preserving than Conventional Hip Replacements and Hip Resurfacing?,"Background: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common procedure that is increasingly being performed in younger patients. Deep acetabular reaming will result in more bone loss and the need for large acetabular components to be implanted. It can also lead to impingement, loosening, an altered center of rotation, and intraoperative periprosthetic fracture. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the single ream, robotic arm-assisted (RAA) THA can preserve a greater volume of bone stock compared to conventional hip replacement and resurfacing. Methods: We prospectively recruited 69 patients who had undergone primary THA using the Stryker Trident Acetabular System® in combination with the Stryker RAA System (MAKO)® and compared their mean reaming weight (g) with that of conventional hip replacement and resurfacing, as measured by Brennan et al. Comparison of acetabular reaming during hip resurfacing versus uncemented THA (J Orthop Surg. 2009; 17(1): 42- 4 6). Results: The mean reaming weight using the MAKO system was 9.08 g, which was 29% less than the reaming weight using uncemented THA and hip resurfacing of 12.75 g. None of the acetabular cups required screw fixation. During the 35 - month follow-up period, there were no complications related to cup placement or positioning. Conclusions: The use of RAA THA results in statistically significant preservation of acetabular bone compared to conventional hip replacement and resurfacing. This approach reflects the increased precision offered by RAA single reaming. Surgeons may consider utilizing RAA THA, particularly in younger patients, to better preserve bone stock as this could potentially impact future revision procedures."

pub.1135264681,Predictive Ligament Balancing in Robotic TKA – One Year Clinical Outcomes from a Multicenter Study,"This study reports on the one-year clinical results and patient reported outcomes (PROMs) associated with a new ‘predictive balance’ tibia-cut first total knee arthroplasty (TKA) technique that uses a robotic ligament tensioner. PROMs are compared to registry data and historical results in the literature.
                  Five hundred and thirty-three patients were prospectively enrolled and underwent robotic TKA (mean age: 67.7±8.4; females: 320; BMI: 31.2±4.9). Pre-op, three, six and 12-month WOMAC, UCLA activity scale, and HSS-Patient satisfaction assessments were completed by 533, 352, 314, and 256 patients, respectively, and compared to WOMAC registry data from the Shared Ortech Aggregated Repository (SOAR) and to historical satisfaction reports in the literature.
                  Despite having equivalent baseline PROM scores, predictive balance patients had significantly higher WOMAC scores at all post-operative timepoints (p<0.001) and higher UCLA activity scale scores at 3M and 6M (p<0.013). Overall patient satisfaction in the predictive balance cohort was 91.2%, 92.4%, and 96.5% at 3M, 6M and 1YR, respectively. Average length of stay was 1.6 days (±0.8). Surgical complications in this cohort were typical of TKA.
                  Limitations to this study include the lack of a closely matched control group. Nonetheless, first year results are promising with improved objective measures compared to large registry databases and recently reported patient satisfaction measures."
pub.1169247391,Individualizing Alignment in TKA with the Use of Image-Based Robotic Assistance,"Image-based robotic assistance has the potential to reduce surgical errors and revisions in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) as well as to improve patient outcomes. Especially, the latter is not only related to a higher precision of the bone cuts, but also to the possibility of individualizing the procedure and the component position.This chapter describes a step-by-step algorithm to analyze the knee based on the computed 3D knee model and discusses basic principles and goals. The preplanning is generally based on the principles of kinematic alignment (KA), but also a workflow for a restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) to correct for deformities is outlined.In the second section, a distinct intraoperative workflow for image-based robotic systems is outlined. It is based on a hybrid approach with a measured resection philosophy on the femur to restore the native joint surface and then a gap-balanced tibial resection to restore a rectangular extension space. In rKA, the need for additional soft tissue balancing is identified based on the analyzed gaps. For illustration, two clinical cases are discussed in terms of implant alignment and balancing algorithm for the mentioned two alignment philosophies."
pub.1171703977,FUTURE OF TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEWER TECHNOLOGIES,"Joint replacement and reconstruction is one of the most rewarding surgery done by Orthopaedic surgeons worldwide, and various researches are constantly being done to improve the outcomes of this already rewarding surgery. Total knee arthroplasty is a commonly performed surgery and has seen numerous advances in terms of implant design, surgical approaches and surgical methods over the past years. Patient specific instrumentation uses preoperative 3D model, constructed using preoperative radiographs of the lower limbs, CT scans and MRI. These 3D models are used to create disposable cutting blocks or positioning templates which are specific to the patient and take into account patient’s specific anatomical landmarks, deformities and osteophytes. Robotic assisted TKA is another step towards improving accuracy of the surgical procedure. Along with the accurate bone cuts it also aids in assessing the soft tissues balance and appropriate positioning of the implant components. Sensors in TKA helps in improving a vital component of total knee arthroplasty, namely ligament balancing. Though the other technologies can assess the ligament and soft tissue tension, but still the mainstay remains the assessment by the surgeon, which relies on the BMI, the inherent laxity, joint contractures etc"
pub.1160654648,Research progress on joint line reconstruction methods in total knee arthroplasty,"Objective  This study aimed to summarize the research progress on joint line reconstruction methods in total knee arthroplasty.   Methods  In the CNKI, Wanfang Data, and PubMed database, “关节线”“膝”“置换” and “knee” “replacement” and “joint line” were used as Chinese and English keywords to search for related studies from January 2008 to August 2022. A total of 711 articles were retrieved, and those with inconsistent content, low quality, duplication, low evidence level, and unavailable full text were excluded. In total, 53 articles were finally included and summarized.   Results  The common methods for the reconstruction of joint line inclination include mechanical alignment, anatomic alignment, kinematic alignment, and restricted kinematic alignment technique. The common anatomical landmarks that guide knee line reconstruction include the adductor tubercle, fibular head, tibial tubercle, and the medial and lateral condyles. The computer-aided navigation system was used to establish a three-dimensional skeletal model of the knee joint, determine the size of the prosthesis, and develop a surgical plan. The application of tracer technology can guide the precise osteotomy of the femur and tibia, which can improve the reconstruction of the joint line. The robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty system uses computer software to precisely execute the individualized surgical plan by using the intraoperative robotic device, thus improving the accuracy of knee line positioning. The 3D printing technology allows for the precise and individualized surgery by printing individualized knee models, creating osteotomy slot guides, and positioning nail guides, and spacer block tools with markers to guide intraoperative joint line positioning.   Conclusion  In total knee arthroplasty, according to the morphological characteristics of the patient's knee anatomical node, the selection of appropriate anatomical markers and alignment technology combined with computer-aided navigation technology, orthopedic robot surgery system, 3D printing technology, and other digital technologies, can improve the accuracy of the reconstruction of joint lines."
pub.1101087743,Bicruciate Retaining Designs,"Bicruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty dates back to the 1980s. The earliest of the prostheses saved all of the ligaments but included constraint in the surface design that led to a kinematic conflict and early failures. Townley and Cloutier developed successful designs that had good midterm results but they did not develop a significant following among the orthopedic surgeons of their time. With the introduction of minimally invasive surgery for total knee arthroplasty, the concept of sparing the anatomy brought surgeons back to the concept of saving all of the ligaments. In the past 5 years at least 2 new designs for the bicruciate ligament retaining TKA have been introduced. The new prostheses have improved anatomy and more sophisticated instrumentation for the surgical procedure. The clinical results are short-term, but they are encouraging. The operation can be performed routinely, the prosthesis is reliable, and patients are reporting improved KOOS scores. The future will show added technology for the operation with robotic assistance, pressure sensing devices for balancing, and smart instruments to assist in alignment. Hopefully, the more anatomic design will help the 15% of patients who are not satisfied with their TKA."
pub.1060339751,"Different Compartments, Different Operation","Unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) still polarizes and this even more when its indications and outcome for treatment of lateral osteoarthritis are discussed. Experience seems to be a key factor for success with this intervention. But this experience is hard to gather for a technique, indications of which are relatively scarce. Experience with medial UKA may help to achieve favorable outcome with treatment of the lateral compartment. However, not all the principles that apply for the medial side may easily be transferable to the lateral compartment. This article wants to highlight why lateral UKA may be challenging and aims to serve as a guide to secure indication and operation technique. The differences of lateral UKA in comparison with medial UKA will be presented and discussed. Moreover, the most recent technical developments will be presented. Navigation, patient-matched cutting blocks, patient-matched implants, and modern robotics were all designed to make the outcome of this procedure more predictable. Their application in practice will be presented and their potential to facilitate this procedure and to add to a secure outcome will be discussed in detail."

Methods The clinical data, preoperative preparation, surgical procedure, and postoperative outcomes of a patient with proximal humerus fracture who underwent 3D image-guided robot-assisted RSA on May 18, 2023, at Beijing Jishuitan Hospital were summarized. Results The patient underwent 3D image-guided robot-assisted RSA successfully. The surgery lasted for 2 ​h and blood loss was about 200 ​ml. No significant adverse events were observed during the procedure. Immediate postoperative joint range of motion was as follows: forward flexion 150°, abduction 90°, neutral rotation 50° externally and 60° internally, with no dislocation. The drainage tube was removed on the second postoperative day, and an X-ray examination confirmed the proper positioning of the prosthesis. Conclusion In conclusion, we are the first to report the successful use of 3D image-guided robot-assisted RSA, demonstrating the feasibility of this technique. However, further upgrades and enhancements to the orthopedic robotic system are necessary to provide more assistance to surgeons."
pub.1008733716,A Navigation System for Computer Assisted Unicompartmental Arthroplasty,"This work presents an overview of a prototype navigation system for computer assisted unicompartmental arthroplasty. The navigation system allows the surgeon to use a minimally invasive surgical technique, solving the problems due to a restricted knee exposure with an augmented reality environment. The key feature of the system is an interactive graphical interface in which a 3D model of the patient’s joint and two 2D projections (frontal and lateral) are shown together with the model of a sensorized custom surgical cutting guide. The position of the sensorized instruments are tracked in real-time by an optoelectronic localizer and reproduced in the virtual scene. The 3D model of the joint is reconstructed from a preoperative CT/MRI data set and matched to the actual anatomy by means of an ICP-based non-fiducial registration algorithm. The prototype system has been positively evaluated by a selected group of skilled orthopaedic surgeons."
pub.1158435451,Preoperative planning and its role in anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty,"As the utilization of total shoulder arthroplasty continues to grow, surgeons are facing increasingly complex reconstructive challenges both in the primary and revision settings. Proper implant positioning, particularly of the glenoid, is paramount to achieving a good result and avoiding devastating complications and early failure. Historically, surgeons have been able to use plain radiographs and 2-dimensional computed tomography (CT) for preoperative planning. Recently, preoperative planning software based on 3-dimensional CT (3D CT) has revolutionized the surgeons’ ability to visualize glenoid deformity and bone stock, plan corrective procedures for abnormal version, and visualize component position. Commercially available preoperative templating software based on 3D CT has been shown to be more accurate and reliable than 2D CT in calculating glenoid version and inclination, and accurately predicts implant size. Patient-specific instrumentation can be developed from the 3D reconstruction, allowing surgeons to accurately execute the preoperative plan and implant the prosthesis to match a patient’s unique anatomy. Robotic-assisted surgery, intraoperative navigation, and augmented reality technology show promise in providing real-time intraoperative feedback in order to maximize surgical accuracy and efficiency while ultimately improving patient-reported outcomes."
pub.1181830577,Accuracy of a New Augmented Reality Assisted Technique for Total Knee Arthroplasty: An In Vivo Study,"Background Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains the standard of care for treating end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. Approximately 15%-20% of the patients are dissatisfied following surgery. To improve accuracy and outcomes of TKA, various assistive technologies have been introduced. For this study, an augmented reality (AR) system was explored and tested. Methods The Knee + system (Pixee Medical, Besancon, France) was used to guide TKA. It uses a combination of quick response-code labeled instruments and AR glasses to guide tibial and femoral cuts. The primary research goal was to evaluate its accuracy by direct comparing the planned angular values for lateral distal femoral angle, medial proximal tibial angle, hip-knee-ankle axis, and tibial slope to the intraoperative obtained values and the measured angles on postoperative full leg radiographs. The secondary research goal was to assess its feasibility. Results This retrospective study evaluated 124 patients, with a follow-up of at least 1 year. The average absolute difference between planned and measured postop values were 1.39° for lateral distal femoral angle, 1.03° for medial proximal tibial angle, 2.16° for tibial slope, and 1.51° for hip-knee-ankle axis. Within the follow-up period, 8 complications were observed. The average surgical time was 83 minutes.

It has shown to be a safe, cheap and time-efficient assistive technology for patients undergoing medial pivot TKA."
pub.1086896288,3366 Toolpath Generator for Multi-axis Medical Machine Tool to Optimize Cutting Tool Posture and Position before Skin Incision,"A robotic system has been developed for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). In MIS TKA, it is imperative to achieve high accuracy of bone cutting and short skin incision. However, MIS TKA has a challenging issue as to the tool insertion into the small incision area. Moreover, an inappropriate incision causes inability of bone cutting or interference between tool and skin. Therefore, tool path generation method was developed based on the optimized incision placement. The experiments with model and swine legs showed that we could successfully implement the operation within 80 mm incision in clinical use."

This approach should allow the use of these data in other application fields, such as musculoskeletal modelling, simulations for radiation therapy, and databases for use in minimally invasive, navigated and robotic surgery."

The preoperative planning methods continue to change. In addition to 2D imaging, 3D planning is increasingly coming into focus. This builds on the principles of 2D planning, but provides much more information including the patellofemoral anatomy. The application of patient-specific instruments (PSI) or robotics similar to total knee arthroplasty are new possibilities resulting from 3D planning."
pub.1015764386,Clininical Experiences with the Surgetics System in TKA,"Navigation has developed to an inherent part of orthopaedic surgery. Navigation technology seems to void the same fate compared with robotics as demonstrated in numerous successful practical experiences and scientific reports [4,5,7,9]. In addition, navigation does not try to replace surgeons skills, but enhances intraoperative accuracy by delivering geometric data, thus keeping surgical control in the hand of the surgeon. Navigation tools differ considerably from conventional instruments such as capture blades and resection blocks because of its opto- and magnetic-electronics. However, one should keep in mind that classical tool still represent mechanical navigational instruments."
pub.1159768239,Accuracy of robotic arm-assisted versus computed tomography-based navigation for cup orientation and positioning in total hip arthroplasty using the direct anterior approach in supine position,"<h2>Background</h2> <p>A robotic arm-assisted and a computed tomography (CT)-based navigation system have been reported to improve the accuracy of component positioning in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Although some previous studies have compared robotic arm-assisted THA (rTHA) with CT-based navigated THA (nTHA), most studies evaluated the outcomes in the lateral position. No study has compared rTHA to nTHA concerning accuracy of cup placement and acetabular fractures using the direct anterior approach (DAA) in supine position. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of cup placement and the presence of intraoperative acetabular fractures between rTHA and nTHA using DAA in supine position.</p><h2>Methods</h2> <p>We retrospectively investigated 209 hips of 188 patients who underwent rTHA or nTHA using DAA in supine position (rTHA using the Mako system: 85 hips of 79 patients; nTHA: 124 hips of 109 patients). After propensity score matching for age and sex, each group consisted of 73 hips. Postoperative cup orientation and positions measured using a three-dimensional templating software were compared to preoperative planning with CT measurements. Additionally, we investigated the prevalence of occult acetabular fracture.</p><h2>Results</h2> <p>The mean absolute error of cup orientation was significant smaller in the rTHA group than in nTHA (inclination: 1.4&deg; &plusmn; 1.2&deg; vs 2.7&deg; &plusmn; 2.2&deg;, respectively; p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.0001, anteversion: 1.5&deg; &plusmn; 1.3&deg; vs 2.2&deg; &plusmn; 1.7&deg;, respectively; p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.007). The cases within an absolute error of 5 degrees in both RI and RA were significantly higher in the rTHA (97.3%) than in nTHA group (82.2%) (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.003). The absolute error of the cup position was not significantly different between the two groups. The prevalence of occult acetabular fracture did not differ significantly between the two groups (rTHA: n&thinsp;=&thinsp;0 [0%] vs. nTHA: n&thinsp;=&thinsp;1 [1.4%]).</p><h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Cup placement using DAA in the supine position in rTHA was more accurate with fewer outliers compared to nTHA. Therefore, rTHA performed via DAA in a supine position would be useful for accurate cup placement.</p>"

The femur and the tibia must be shaped to fit an artificial joint for successful knee arthroplasty. The recent trend towards MIS (Minimally Invasive Surgery) to decrease the length of the required incision has increased surgical difficulty, since the open access area is small. In this paper, registration and cutting error were analyzed with a robotic surgery system being developed first as an example, and a method of active compensation of robot deformation by gravity and cutting force was proposed and tried based on the error map with the expectation that the precision will increase."
pub.1092990900,A Novel Phenomenological Ligament Modeling Approach Utilizing Robotic Calibration,"While total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a successful procedure to mitigate joint pain, there remain improvement opportunities with respect to restoring natural joint feeling and function [1]. It has been shown that prosthesis geometry and the retention of ligaments can have an influence on patient perception of how normal a TKA feels [2]. Numerical knee modeling offers the possibility to improve outcomes of feel and function by comparing the predicted behavior of TKAs using various designs and surgical variables with the behavior of intact knees. The TKA development process also benefits as these analyses and resulting optimizations can be performed in an early design stage.Copyright © 2012 by ASME"

The aim of this article is to assess the navigation and robotics and to discuss the current results.MethodsComprehensive literature search in the PubMed database and the Google Scholar search service.ResultsComputer-assisted surgery leads to a more precise alignment of both the mechanical leg axis and the positioning of prosthetic components. Nevertheless, the clinical results for knee function and the results of patient reported outcome measures (PROM) are controversial. They show no significant differences to conventional techniques and the same applies for the survival rates. High acquisition and maintenance costs limit the dissemination of these systems.ConclusionAt present, imaging-assisted navigation provides the surgeon with valuable support for more precise and safe work with respect to specific surgical steps. Nevertheless, long-term studies on knee function, PROMs and survival rate of the prosthesis are urgently needed, especially in robotics, even if the short-term results show trends similar to those for navigation. Robotic systems certainly need further development to meet the requirements of users and patients (costs, size, programming)."
pub.1095020948,A Haptic Surface Scanning and Machining Parallel Manipulator for Registration-Free Bone Resurfacing during Arthroplasty,"As orthopaedic implants become more sophisticated and complex, shaping the bone surface to match the implant becomes increasingly important. Accurate bone machining contributes to success of the implant and can potentially increase the implant's endurance and lifetime. Bone-mounted robots can eliminate intra-operative tracking errors during bone machining. However, registration errors still exist when aligning the pre-operative plan with the patient's anatomy because the plan is based on pre-operative images. Thus, a robotic system that is capable of executing both surface acquisition and bone machining in a single procedure and within the same coordinate system is preferable to the current state of the art. In this study we used a mini bone attached robotic system (MBARS) with a haptic interface, to examine the accuracy of force-controlled surface acquisition of a femur model. The average distance error between acquired points and the surface model was less than 1 mm, which was further reduced by 5% with a compensation method which included curvature estimation of the reconstructed surface. An initial evaluation of in-situ bone machining based on these force-controlled scans yielded promising results."
pub.1092989347,Use of Spine Robot Employing Real Time Force Control to Simulate a Pure Moment Protocol for the Subaxial Cervical Spine: An In Vitro Biomechancial Study,"A standard biomechanical testing protocol for evaluation of the sub-axial cervical spine is the application of pure bending moments to the free end of the spine (with opposing end fixed) and measurement of its motion response. The pure moment protocol is often used to compare spinal fusion instrumentation and has also been used to evaluate non-fusion instrumentation (e.g. disc arthroplasty devices) [1,2]. A variety of different testing systems have been employed to implement pure moment application. In cases where the loading is applied quasi-statically using a series of weights and pulleys the spine may relax between intermittent loading phases and/or unintended loading may be applied causing experimental artifact. Our objective was to use an existing programmable robotic testing platform (Spine Robot) to develop a novel real time force control strategy to simulate pure moment loading under precisely controlled continuous movement conditions. This would serve to advance robotic testing capabilities with an end goal to simulate different protocols in the same platform, and to potentially minimize fixturing and quasi-static artifacts.Copyright © 2011 by ASME"

Moreover, there are few studies on Asians with different anatomical characteristics. This study aimed to determine the learning curve for r-TKA and compare implant positions between r-TKA and c-TKA according to the learning curve in Asian patients.</p>
Methods <p>This prospective study included 50 consecutive c-TKAs (C group), followed by 50 consecutive r-TKAs using the MAKO robotic system (Stryker, USA). Cumulative summation analyses were performed to assess the learning curve for operative time in r-TKAs. Accordingly, the r-TKA cases were divided into initial cases (I group) and proficiency cases (P group). Femoral and tibial component positions in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes and lower limb alignment were compared among all groups.</p>
Results <p>r-TKA was associated with a learning curve for operative time in 18 cases. Operative time was significantly shorter in the C and P groups than in the I group, with no significant difference between the C and P groups. The I and P groups demonstrated fewer outliers regarding lower limb alignment, femoral component coronal position, axial position, and tibial component sagittal position than the C group, with no significant difference between C and P groups.</p>
Conclusion <p>Operative time was not significantly different between r-TKA and c-TKA after the learning curve. Surgeons could expect more accurate and reproducible lower limb alignment and implant position with r-TKA in Asian patients regardless of the learning curve.</p>"
pub.1151318271,Ortopedia moderna: o uso da robótica nas artroplastia total de joelho,"Introduction: The advance in the development of implant technologies that are more resistant and more modern, adapting the human anatomy, reducing pain and the readaptation process, in addition to the great improvement of surgical techniques and techniques of sterilization and packaging of surgical materials, made arthroplasty knee (TKA) the most performed group of surgeries in the orthopedic environment. The advancement of techniques in the application of knee trampling has made the technique of frequent and increasing use in the last decade, conditioning its success to several factors: the design of the components, the quality of the available materials, the manufacturing technique, application adequate to each patient, as well as the development of the surgical technique. Methodology: This is a narrative review of the literature. Results: A great instrument is the navigation of total knee arthroplasty, which is an instrument that facilitates the operative performance, also having the ability to assist the surgeon in making intraoperative decisions, enabling the simulation of situations before performing them. It has great use in the teaching field, as it makes it possible to immediately see the effect of each action performed during the operation, and it is possible that the navigator eliminates the need for the surgeon's qualification or reduces the value of his experience, as the navigator does not point out paths or make decisions. by the surgeon, providing only assistance in obtaining and measuring the planned results for each action. This activity enhances the surgeon's knowledge and experiences as it provides great parameters with high precision and real-time objectives in the operation. Conclusion: The use of robotics in orthopedic surgery should be seen as an instrument available to the Surgeon, demonstrating their knowledge and never as an autonomous independent system that can compensate for an eventual deficiency of experience or knowledge. Important studies reveal that using robotics, surgery revision rates have decreased, increasing patient satisfaction with the surgery."
pub.1181292675,Patient-Reported Outcomes in Robotic-Assisted vs Manual Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) was introduced to provide surgeons with virtual preoperative planning and intraoperative information to achieve the desired surgical goals in an effort to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures following primary TKA using RA-TKA vs manual instrumentation. Methods This was a retrospective cohort review study comparing 393 primary RA-TKAs vs 312 manual TKAs at a minimum 2-year follow-up. The same cementless implant design was utilized in all cases at a single institution. There were no significant differences in age or gender between groups. Outcome measures included range-of-motion, Knee Society (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Forgotten Joint Score-12, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, and overall patient satisfaction scores along with complications and survivorship. Results Compared to manual TKA, the RA-TKA group had significant higher postoperative KSS Function and Knee scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement scores (P < .001). A total percentage of 95.0% of RA-TKA vs 87.4% of manual TKAs were very satisfied or satisfied (P = .001). Survivorship with all-cause failure as the endpoint at 3 years was 96.9% in the RA-TKA group compared to 95.8% in the manual group (P = .54). Conclusions RA-TKA demonstrated significant improvement over manual jig-based instruments in KSS Function, KSS Knee, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, and patient satisfaction scores following primary TKA with no differences in complications and revision incidence. RA-TKA provided a virtual 3-dimensional preoperative plan along with intraoperative information for adjustments to approximate the patients' native joint line and achieve a well-balanced soft-tissue sleeve about the knee for primary TKA."
pub.1155311844,EARLIER GAINS IN ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION FOLLOWING ROBOTIC-ASSISTED TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL INSTRUMENTATION,"We sought to evaluate the early post-operative active range-of-motion (AROM) between robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (raTKA) and conventional TKA (cTKA). A secondary data analysis on a global prospective cohort study was performed. A propensity score method was used to select a matched control of cTKA from the same database using 1:1 ratio, based on age, sex, BMI, and comorbidity index. This resulted in 216 raTKA and cTKA matched cases. Multivariable longitudinal regression was used to evaluate difference in ROM over time and values are reported as least squares means (95% confidence interval). The longitudinal model tested the treatment effect (raTKA vs cTKA), time effect, and their interaction with control on covariance of patients ‘s age, sex, BMI, comorbidity and pre-operative flexion. Logistic regression was used to analyze the active flexion level at one month (cut by 90°) and three months (cut by 110°).
                  At one-month postoperative the raTKA cases had more AROM for flexion by an average of 5.54 degrees (p<0.001). There was no difference at three months (p=0.228). The raTKA group had a greater improvement from pre-operative values at both one-month, with an average 7.07° (3.6°, 10.5°, p<0.001) more improvement, and at three-months with an average improvement of 4° more (1.61°, 7.24°, p=0.0115). AROM for extension was lower overall in the raTKA group by an average of 0.44° (p=0.029). The raTKA patients had higher odds of achieving ≥90° of flexion at one-month (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.16, 3.99).
                  raTKA resulted in greater AROM flexion gains in the early postoperative period than cTKA. Additional research is needed to understand if these earlier gains in AROM are associated with improved patient satisfaction and continued improvements with time."

pub.1181271156,"A Handheld, Portable Image-Based System May Outperform Computer Navigation or Robotic Platforms in Providing Accurate Acetabular Component Positioning","Background Malposition of the acetabular component during total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a leading cause of complications and need for revision. Robotic-assisted THA purports to improve accuracy of component positioning with many reports demonstrating over 92% of components within 10° of inclination and anteversion compared to intraoperative system output. This study aimed to evaluate the intraoperative accuracy output of acetabular cup position values using a handheld miniaturized portable navigation system (Naviswiss, AG) compared to postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods A total of 108 direct anterior approach THA surgeries using the intraoperative navigation device were performed over a 6-month period. Intraoperative device output for measured acetabular component inclination and anteversion were recorded and compared with values derived from postoperative CT scans. Results Postoperative CT analysis of acetabular component positioning demonstrated 97.22% and 94.44% were within 5° of intraoperative inclination and anteversion, respectively, compared to intraoperative values from the navigation unit. No CT demonstrated an absolute inclination or anteversion measurement difference more than 8° from the intraoperative navigation unit value. Overall, 92.59% of components were within 5° and 100% were within 8° for both inclination and anteversion compared to postoperative CT measurements. Conclusions This handheld portable navigation system yielded highly accurate intraoperative component positioning values confirmed by postoperative CT scans during direct anterior THA, possibly superior to reported robotic-assisted THA values. These smaller, portable, and more accessible intraoperative units may provide surgeons improved accuracy and availability in a number of surgical settings for use in THA."

pub.1027787811,History of and Current Systems in Robotic Surgery,"Robots are machines programmed by computers that are capable of producing predesignated movements autonomously. Amid the mid-twentieth century, this technology was designed to aid people in performing physically demanding, intricate, or even dangerous tasks. They increased safety and work efficiency in cases such as manufacturing-type labor, transportation to hostile environments, and also now in medicine. Robots are classified into three categories of essential functions and methods of interaction with the operating surgeon: supervisory, telesurgical, and shared-control systems. The first known surgical robot was the Arthrobot, which was developed to improve accuracy of orientation when preparing a femur for total hip arthroplasty. In modern medicine, multifunctional telemanipulators, such as the da Vinci™ Surgical System, have proliferated in institutions worldwide and are used to perform various surgical procedures. This chapter provides an insight to the history and evolution of robots from simple equipments that provide stability or act as a camera holder to highly sophisticated, interactive, and multifunctional machines capable of performing complex or nearly microscopic tasks, including cauterization and maneuvering of tissues through small incisions into the body, which would otherwise be difficult with human hands."

pub.1168318380,Newer Coronal Alignment Philosophies in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Brief Review,"Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) surgeries have been one of the most successful surgeries over the past half a decade. However a substantial proportion of patients undergoing TKA have the feeling of their replaced knee being an ‘unnatural one’. Also the conventional TKA requires the surgeon to maintain a coronal plane Hip Knee Angle (HKA) of 180 deg with the joint line being parallel to the horizontal and this requires a significant soft tissue release. Recently there are many different pre arthritic knee phenotypes been described with varying joint line obliquities and HKA angles. It is this difference of coronal HKA axis and joint line obliquity in the non replaced and the replaced knee that is believed to be the cause of dissatisfaction after TKA. Many coronal plane alignment philosophies have been reported to bridge this gap as mentioned earlier which replicate the pre arthritic knee anatomy with minimal soft tissue release. The only concern of the different philosophies is the long term implant survival when fixed in a non mechanically aligned position. However robotics have added a significant safety with calibrated execution to prevent outliers and improve implant survivorship. This is a brief review of the different coronal plane alignment philosophies in TKA. Keywords: Coronal, alignment, dissatisfaction, HKA, joint line obliquity"

Our lab started studying TKA kinematics in 1998. First, we developed an in vitro robotic experimental setup to test knee kinematics after TKA surgery under various simulated physiological loading conditions. Second, we developed a dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) to analyze the in vivo knee kinematics after TKA surgery during functional activities. Using these in vitro and in vivo approaches, we have extensively investigated the kinematics of typical posterior cruciate retaining (CR) and posterior substituting (PS) TKAs. Analyses included six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) tibiofemoral joint kinematics, tibiofemoral articular contact locations, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) function in CR TKAs and cam-post contact in PS TKAs. In addition we have studied the biomechanical factors that may affect flexion capabilities of the knee by comparing the biomechanics of conventional, high-flexion TKA designs with normal knees and knees with osteoarthritis (OA). In this review, we will briefly describe the in vitro and in vivo testing systems developed at our lab for TKA kinematics analyses followed by a summary of our research results on various TKA components."
pub.1040164621,Patient-specific instrumentation and custom total knee implants in total knee arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a successful operation improving quality of life for patients. As demand for TKA increases, surgeons and healthcare systems search for a cost-effective method that provides improved patient outcomes. Computer navigation and robotic systems were introduced to refine mechanical alignment, but broad acceptance has been limited due to the cost of implementation and increased operating room time. Patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) was similarly designed to restore kinematic alignment. Several orthopaedic implant manufacturers offer such instruments. Preoperative imaging is required and submitted to the manufacturer. A computer simulation of the knee anatomy is generated, and bone resections are planned using their proprietary software. Femoral or tibial cutting blocks are then fabricated. Approximate time from surgeon approval of the computer-simulated plan to delivery of custom instruments is 3-6 wk. Proposed benefits of these technologies include cost savings from improved efficiency in the operating room, improved implant alignment, and patient outcome. Disadvantages include increased cost from preoperative 3D imaging and fabrication of instruments, increased workload for surgeon and staff, and the learning curve. Current literature on the use of PSI technologies in TKA reveals no agreement on the value of PSI technologies. Additional study of these technologies is recommended before broad acceptance and universal use is achieved."
pub.1164494650,Preoperative Planning and Plan Execution in Shoulder Arthroplasty,"Preoperative planning of shoulder arthroplasty has become mainstream practice for a majority of surgeons and is now offered by most implant companies. 3D imaging studies have proven most accurate for measuring glenoid version and inclination compared to 2D studies as they allow for correction of the plane of image capture relative to the patient’s anatomy. As yet, there is no consensus on the optimal method to measure version and inclination, and the surgeon must be aware of how each software platform determines these values relative to the system being used. While preoperative planning allows a more quantitative determination of optimal implant configuration and orientation relative to the pathoanatomy, the use of free-hand instrumentation can lead to substantial deviation from planned implant placement. Patient-specific instrumentation and surgical navigation have both proven to improve surgical precision. The latter currently requires the use of trackers to register the surgical plan to the operative anatomy though future developments may include trackerless applications. Technology such as mixed reality and robotics is under development to augment the surgeon’s ability to precisely execute the surgical plan and is likely to see increased adoption in the shoulder as it has in other orthopedic applications."

The HAL-SJ group underwent exercise using the HAL-SJ for 10 days postoperatively, in addition to CPT; the CPT group underwent only CPT. Pain intensity and active and passive knee extension angles were evaluated preoperatively and on postoperative days 1&ndash;10 and weeks 2 and 4. Performance tests and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were evaluated preoperatively and at postoperative weeks 2 and 4. Statistical analysis showed that the HAL-SJ group significantly reduced pain intensity and improved active and passive knee extension angles compared with the CPT group. The HAL-SJ group showed immediate improvement in knee extension angle through day 5. There were no significant differences in results between the performance tests and KOOS. Knee extension exercises with the HAL-SJ improved knee pain and the angle of extension in the acute phase after TKA.</p>"

A total of 113 knees (100 patients) were reviewed and divided into the control group (55 knees) and the RA-TKA group (58 knees). We assessed postoperative pain intensity using a visual analogue scale at rest (rVAS) and during movement (mVAS), evaluated lower extremity functional recovery through quadriceps muscle strength and knee range of motion (ROM), preoperatively and on PODs 3, 7, 10, and 14. We also assessed the rescue analgesia intake and postoperative implant coronal alignment. The mean rVAS and mVAS scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. Muscle strength recovery was significantly faster in the RA-TKA group than in the control group on every PODs. ROM recovery was better in the RA-TKA group than in the control group on POD 10. The amount of postoperative analgesia was significantly lower in the RA-TKA group than in the control group. Attainment of a β angle <2° significantly better in RA-TKA. This study demonstrated better functional recovery in RA-TKA, particularly for muscle strength and ROM. RA-TKA reduced rescue drug intake and provided better implant positioning."

Therefore, the purpose of this work is to introduce a novel approach for testing TKRs with respect to stability of the artificial knee joint based on a mechatronic hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test system. The mechanical test setup is composed of an industrial robot with a compliant support for the endoprosthesis to be tested. It interacts with a biomechanical multibody model consisting of all relevant body parts of the lower extremity incorporating ligament structures of the knee joint. According to the movement angles and reaction forces/torque provided by the multibody model, the robot rotates and loads the femoral component with respect to the tibial component. The resulting position and loading of the femoral component are measured and fed back into the model, thus closing the control loop for HiL simulations. The functional principle of the HiL simulation is proven by simulating a passive flexion movement of a bicondylar, posterior cruciate ligament retaining TKR using the described biomechanical multibody model."
pub.1020181004,Computer-Assisted Operational Techniques from the Perspective of a System and Implant Manufacturer,"No other technology in the field of orthopaedics and traumatology can match the success of computer-assisted operational procedures over the last ten years. This has been achieved thanks to advances in industrial measurement techniques and robot technology. The obvious potential of these technologies for increasing safety and accuracy in surgery has yielded a range of products for the active and passive support of orthopaedic and traumatology surgery. For example, the implant manufacturer Precision Implants AG/PI Systems, the development and production centre of the companies PLUS Endoprothetik and Intraplant, exploited its existing know-how and developed the PiGalileo navigation and robot system using industrial measurement technology. A small robot, the PiGalileo CAS, was the first product developed. It was a two-axis system for knee endoprostheses controlled by a laptop computer and was based on the large robots used in industry, with adaptation for a sterile environment. The cost of this equipment, without navigational support, was about the same as the equipment and instruments used to carry out conventional knee prosthesis and allowed the technology to be accessible to a large area of application (◘Fig. 78–1)."
pub.1017901224,Accuracy of Computer-Assisted Surgery,"Computer-assisted surgery was introduced to improve the performance of surgical interventions with electronic instruments and software. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in combination with development in robotic-assisted surgery, surgical navigation was primarily exploited and introduced, essentially for improving the accuracy of implant positioning [4]. The main advancement pursued is an ‘augmented reality’ in the operating theatre, made up of a number of digital cameras and trackers attached to the bones and to the standard instrumentation. Information such as optimal resection planes and targeted limb alignment is displayed to the surgeon during the operation before performing bone preparation, also according to a surgeon’s specific preference (posterior slope, femur flexion, bone resections, varus/valgus, joint line, etc.). This tracking is usually obtained by means of a stereophotogrammetric system made of digital cameras and emitting or reflective markers. Another series of navigation systems for TKA are based on electromagnetic tracking devices, not the topic of this present chapter, for which specific information can be found elsewhere [34, 74]. In general, the surgical navigation systems are meant to enhance the final positioning of the implant (accuracy), as well as the visibility in inaccessible areas (security), and the prediction of the effects of the surgical actions (control)."
pub.1142342108,The future of joint surgery: the application of digital orthopaedic technology in joint surgery,"Digital orthopedic technologies are increasingly being applied to the clinical practice of joint surgery. These technologies include artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, 3D printing, computer navigation, robotic-assisted joint replacement surgery, and other digital orthopedic technologies. Digital orthopedic technologies continue to empower joint surgeons, simplify complex operations, achieve precision in simple operations, and to make precise operations more individualized. Thus, they are becoming important development directions for joint surgery in the future. With the help of advances in computer-aided design and additive manufacturing technology, customized joint prostheses and bone tissue repair materials provide great convenience for reconstruction of complex bone defects during revision surgery. Various types of computer-assisted navigation technologies and robot-assisted surgery technologies can help doctors improve the accuracy of osteotomy and prosthesis implantation significantly. However, to fundamentally improve patients' satisfaction after joint replacements, we need to use digital orthopedics technologies to explore the ideal target value of arthroplasty. Further, we use personalized preoperative planning with objective and accurate assessment technology of soft tissue balance, precise intraoperative operations, and the use of customized prostheses to achieve individualized and precise joint arthroplasty. Various digital orthopedic technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages. Joint surgeons should have an in-depth understanding of these technologies and make full and reasonable use of these technologies to benefit the majority of patients."
pub.1023254593,A minimally invasive 3-D data registration protocol for computer and robot assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"In Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) the distal femoral and proximal tibial compartments are resected and replaced with two prosthetic components. Inaccurate surgical planning and/or execution can easily lead to failure. Moreover, prosthesis misalignments of a few degrees/millimetres can seriously affect the post-surgical functionality of the operated limb. Hence the usefulness of a computer and robot assisted approach. Aim of this paper is to illustrate the registration phase of an integrated CAS protocol for TKA. Registration is a critical step, linking the planning and execution phases, in which the geometric relationships between the patient's anatomy, the models used for planning and the robotic or sensorised tools employed intrasurgically are estimated. Several registration techniques have been proposed, often needing implantation of artificial fiducial markers. The registration protocol described in this paper, based on the ICP algorithm, does not need any marker implant, thus reducing surgical invasiveness. Special care was taken in trying to adapt the protocol to the relevant application. Laboratory trials were carried out on a synthetic phantom and an animal specimen trying to reproduce realistic environmental conditions. Results showed that many requirements have to be fulfilled in order to get an adequate standard of accuracy. The protocol proved promising, though, as final inaccuracies below 1° and 1mm were obtained."
pub.1122138914,The Impact of Workflow on Cutting Time for Partial Knee Arthroplasty,"To date, there are no studies aimed at characterizing the active cutting time for a robotic-assisted PKA procedure and the impact of workflow. This study quantified the active cutting time for three medial PKA workflows using the same robotic-assisted system.
                  Three surgeons each prepared six cadaveric knees for PKA with robotic-assisted technology using one of three workflows: A) burr-only, using a legacy cutting system and burr design; B) burr-only, using a new cutting system and burr design; or C) planar, using a new cutting system, burr design and saw. For a burr-only workflow, the femur and tibia were prepared with a burr. For a planar workflow, the femur and tibia were prepared with a burr and saw. The total mean trigger time to complete all femoral or tibial bony resections was measured and statistically compared between workflows using ANOVA and Tukey Pairwise Comparison.
                  There was statistically significant less time required to prepare the femur and tibia in B and C, compared to A (p≤0.05). Less time was required in C than B, but this was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Workflow A took an average of 429±104 seconds (range, 314 to 529 seconds), B took an average of 302±40 seconds (range, 244 to 363 seconds), and C took an average of 236±50 seconds (range, 196 to 332 seconds).
                  The new burr design, when used with both burr-only and planar workflows, has the potential to be more efficient (30 and 45% faster, respectively) compared to the legacy burr using the burr-only workflow, for a medial PKA. Bone resection time should be investigated in a clinical setting."
pub.1165273980,Clinical evaluation and accuracy of mechanical axis alignment in robotic total knee arthroplasty,"The first experience in robotic total knee arthroplasty (RoTKA) has been obtained resulting in the questions about clinical efficiency and accuracy of lower limb alignment.  Objective To clarify clinical evaluation and accuracy of alignment of the mechanical axis of the lower limb in RoTKA.   Materials and methods Twenty-nine patients with osteoarthritis of the knee of Kellgren-Lawrence stage 3-4 underwent RoTKA. The knee joint was assessed with VAS, WOMAC, FJS-12; the range of motion was measured. The changes in the axis of the lower limb were evaluated on the full limb length radiographs.   Results Pain before the surgery according to VAS was 5.8 ± 1.5 points, on the first day after the surgery it was 8.5 ± 1.4, on day 3 – 5.9 ± 1.2, on day 12 – 2.9 ± 1.1. The range of motion on the first day after the surgery was 99.5° ± 1.4°, three months later – 115.1° ± 1.1°, six months later – 125.6 ± 1.5°, one year later– 127.5 ± 1.6°. The WOMAC score before the surgery was 32.7 ± 3.3, after the surgery 25.1 ± 2.1, three months later 7.3 ± 1.3, six months later 2.8 ± 0.2, and after one year – 1.3 ± 0.5. The FJS-12 score 3 months after the surgery was 68.2 ± 4.1, after 6 months 80.3 ± 2.9, after one year 94.0 ± 2.1. The analysis of postoperative full length roentgenograms in 72 % of cases (n = 21) did not reveal any deviation of the mechanical axis from the planned one and in 28 % of cases (n = 8) the deviation of the mechanical axis was up to 1° from the planned one.   Discussion Neither technical difficulties nor complications inherent to RoTKA were found. According to the results of VAS, WOMAC and FJS‑12 questionnaires, and the assessment of the range of motion, a positive dynamics was observed. According to the results of tele-roentgenograms, there was alignment of the limb axis and the accuracy of the position of the endoprosthesis components.   Conclusion The study of this technology has demonstrated safety, accuracy of alignment of the mechanical axis, validity of indications and contraindications, and stable early clinical results. "
pub.1181781440,Measurement of Periarticular Subcutaneous Fat on CT Images and Adverse Outcomes Following Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Background Obesity is associated with a higher rate of wound complications following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With readily available computer tomography (CT) images from robotic-assisted TKA, we analyzed measurement of fat content on preoperative CT images as a possible predictor of wound complications following primary TKA. Methods Patients who underwent robotic-assisted TKA at one institution in 2018 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Two independent reviewers measured three SCF areas at different axial CT cuts and normalized them by dividing the area of the distal femur. These areas were distributed into 4 groups. Any wound complication that required clinical or surgical intervention was reviewed and analyzed. For further comparison, prepatellar SCF thickness ratio measured on CT scan and BMI were grouped and analyzed similarly for wound complications. We also analyzed any association of SCF measurement with secondary outcomes such as operative time, length of stay, readmission, and reoperation. Results One hundred fifty patients with diagnosis of osteoarthritis, mean age of 64 years and BMI of 34.3 kg/m2 were included in this study. Ninety-one patients (61%) were female. Normalized SCF measurements at 2 cm above the patella, mid-patella, and tibial tubercle had excellent intraclass correlation coefficient at 0.987, 0.989, and 0.989, respectively. When SCF at 2 cm above patella was analyzed, Group 1 (smallest amount of SCF) had a significantly higher wound complication rate compared with Groups 2 and 3 combined (18.9 vs 5.3%, p=0.036). Group 4 (largest amount of SCF) also had a significantly higher wound complication rate compared with Groups 2 and 3 combined (18.9 vs 5.3%, p=0.036). Conclusions Accurate and consistent measurement of periarticular fat around the knee based on axial CT images demonstrated that moderate amount of fat is associated with better clinical outcomes following primary TKA. Our study did not find any clinical significance of gender difference in fat distribution. Therefore, more studies should be undertaken to evaluate for any clinical association of gender-specific fat distribution and to confirm our finding that a certain amount of fatty tissue is necessary for improved outcomes following TKA."
pub.1146303168,Robot-assisted Knee Arthroplasty: Randomized Clinical Trial,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis of the knee joint leads to a decrease in the volume of movements, a violation of the sliding of articular surfaces, and a change in the axis of the limb under load, which affects the biomechanics of walking.


AIM: This study aims to compare the results of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and manual techniques, their influence on the biomechanical and podometric parameters of the patient’s walk.


METHODS: A prospective randomized study of 68 patients was carried out in the period from 2020 to 2021. Our follow-up period was 1 year. All patients were performed arthroplasty of one knee joint. The main Group “A” included 33 patients TKA with the use of an active robotic setting “TSolution-One” (“THINK Surgical, Inc.” [Fremont, California, USA]); the comparison Group “B” consisted of 35 patients with manual technic of TKA. We studied pain syndrome on the visual analog scale, functional state on the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), the volume of ROM movements, and the deviation of the mechanical axis by teleroentgenography of the lower limb. Objective analysis of limb function was performed on the «Alter-G» and the «C-mill».


RESULTS: Post-operative pain syndrome on the 1st day after surgery in Group A is stronger by 7.9%, but by the 5th day after surgery in Group A, the pain syndrome is lower by 14.3%. ROM in Group A is better by 16% by 3 months after surgery, after 1 year by 10%. The positioning accuracy of the implant in Group A is 30% better. There are no statistically significant differences in the OKS and WOMAC scales between the groups. The results of restoring normal step in Group A are 13.5% better than in Group B.

CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted TKA gives more accurate alignment of the mechanical axis, which improves the biomechanics of walking."
pub.1169249894,Advances in Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a safe and effective surgical treatment option for isolated end-stage unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis.The advantages of medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty over TKA in isolated medial OA include a faster recovery, lower cost and fewer major complications. The most significant disadvantage of medial UKA is the three times higher revision rates compared to TKA.The primary indication for medial UKA is isolated bone-on-bone anteromedial osteoarthritis of the knee with a functionally intact anterior cruciate ligament and intact medial collateral ligament. There is no posterior wear on the tibia plateau and the intra-articular deformity is fully correctable. The cartilage in the weight-bearing area of the lateral compartment is biomechanically intact.Numerous operative-related factors have been proven to affect clinical outcomes in UKA patients. There is clear evidence that UKA volume (caseload) and usage rates determine the survival and revision rates of UKA. A usage rate of 20% or greater yielded a significantly lower rate of failure.The size and placement of the components are vital to the clinical outcomes and rate of failure, this is particularly evident of the tibial component. Oversizing and tibial overhang of >3 mm, excessive varus angulation of >5°, increased posterior tibial slope and changes in the joint line should be avoided. A post-operative varus angle of 1–4° should be achieved.Aseptic loosening and progression of OA are the most common causes of failure in medial UKA.The expansion of traditional indications, increasing surgeons’ usage, use of validated technology adjuncts such as robotic-assistance, and improvements in implant design all contribute to UKA’s good to excellent results, better outcomes compared to TKA, and to lowering UKA’s rate of failure. After being initially overlooked, UKA is seeing a resurgence and future research has an abundance of exciting directions to pursue."
pub.1017319934,An interface for the data exchange between CAS and CAD/CAM systems,"In Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS), there is an increasing need for the data exchange between the planning system and external Computer Aided Design (CAD)/Computer Aided Manufacture (CAM) process to simulate the intraoperative execution or to verify and optimize the implant design. An interface for such data exchange was therefore implemented and integrated in the CAS system developed in our group. We also propose a simple, robust and fast algorithm for the voxelization of surface models with triangle meshes. The tools have been used successfully for the integration of standard geometry implant data for total knee arthroplasty. A surgical simulation and planning module for the robot assisted craniectomy will also use this interface to simulate intraoperative robotic milling and support the iterative design of the individual implant."
pub.1143400324,Potential New Treatments for Knee OA: A Prospective Review of Registered Trials,"We aimed to evaluate potential new treatments for knee osteoarthritis (OA). The National Institute of Health ClinicalTrials.gov database was searched for “Osteoarthritis, Knee”. We found 565 ongoing interventional studies with a total planned enrollment of 111,276 subjects. Ongoing studies for knee OA represent a very small fraction of the registered clinical trials, but they are over a quarter of all knee trials and over two thirds of all OA studies. The most researched topic was arthroplasty, with aspects such as implant design changes, cementless fixation, robotic guidance, pain management, and fast track recovery. Intraarticular injections focused on cell therapies with mesenchymal stem cells sourced from adipose tissue, bone marrow, or umbilical cord. We could see the introduction of the first disease modifying drugs with an impact on knee OA, as well as new procedures such as geniculate artery embolization and geniculate nerve ablation."
pub.1140220678,Stem Cell Therapy in Orthopaedics,"Total hip arthroplasty is one of the most successful orthopaedic operations performed, and the longevity of the implants depends on accurate component placement. Accurate component alignment is associated with reduced mechanical wear, dislocation and revision surgery. Hip arthritis is a major cause of disability worldwide. Over the past 30 years, total hip replacement surgery has demonstrated significant clinical and commercial success. Most implants have shown good long-term results with a high level of patient satisfaction. Orthopaedic procedures dealing with a nondeformable tissue such as bone are suitable for computerised guidance based on pre-operatively and intra-operatively obtained images. Computer-assisted surgery can take a number of forms ranging from active and semi-active robotic systems, which rely at least in part on the robot performing part of the procedure, to the more passive navigation systems which do not perform any part of the procedure."
pub.1170321297,An observational study on the functional outcomes of 100 robotic total knee replacements performed by an Indian surgeon: Early experiences,"Abstract  Background: We aim to share our preliminary encounter with robotic knee replacements in Indian patients, focusing on the initial 100 cases. This report will delve into our observations regarding the learning curve and provide insights from a short-term follow-up at 6 months.   Materials and Methods: Following institutional ethical clearance, we conducted an observational study involving 100 robotic-assisted total knee replacement cases performed from March 2022 to November 2022. These patients underwent a 6-month follow-up to evaluate functional outcomes. Our primary objective was to investigate the learning curve associated with robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA), specifically emphasizing operative time. Furthermore, we examined preoperative and postoperative alignment parameters as part of our analysis.   Results:  In our investigation, participants had a mean age of 64.68 years, with a female-to-male ratio of 43:22 and an average body mass index of 30.71 ± 4.88. Intraoperative blood loss was recorded at an average of 91.81 ± 21.63 mL. The mean surgical duration for the initial 25 cases was 102.5 ± 11.08 min, which improved to 65.65 ± 13.07 min for the subsequent 75 cases. The average hospital stay length was 2.88 ± 0.88 days. Notably, there was a significant enhancement in the Knee Society Score (KSS), with a preoperative mean of 38.90 ± 12.72 improving to a postoperative mean of 84.89 ± 4.10 ( P = 0.001), as well as in the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), which saw a rise from 16.62 ± 16.42 preoperatively to 45.58 ± 4.97 postoperatively ( P = 0.001). The accuracy of preoperative determination for femoral component sizes was 100%, while for tibial component sizing, it was 97%.    Conclusion: The key finding from this observational study suggests that around 25 procedures are required to reach a learning plateau. During this process, an average decrease of 36.1 min in surgical time was observed from the initial to proficient stages. Notably, no learning curve was observed for lower limb alignment and implant placement, and no significant complication rates were documented. "
pub.1051377793,Computer assisted navigation in orthopaedics and trauma surgery,"Computer assisted navigation was initially introduced into neurosurgical practice, and then orthopaedic spinal surgery, in the 1990's. It has gained momentum in recent years, finding applications in multiple branches of orthopaedic surgery including hip and knee arthroplasty, sports injuries, trauma, spinal surgery and bone tumour surgery. The technology provides the surgeon with real-time information regarding the position of surgical instruments and implants in relation to the skeleton and has the potential to improve surgical accuracy and outcome.Computer assisted navigation systems can be active, employing robotic surgeons, or passive where the surgeon remains in total control but computer software aids in the procedure.Computer assisted navigation has the potential to help surgeons perform procedures more accurately, with a view to improving outcome.

pub.1157023776,Current and Future Trends in Orthopedics,"History has shown that most of the techniques and equipment that surgeons are trained on during residency look much different than those used at the end of his/her career. These changes range from the sizes of incisions made to the types of imaging obtained. The pathologies observed in orthopedics remain constant, but the ways in which they are managed are subject to change. Therefore, it is imperative that surgeons remain as malleable as possible as they move forward in their career. In this chapter, we will discuss current trends in orthopedics and what the future may have in store moving forward."
pub.1169618767,Deep Learning based acoustic measurement approach for robotic applications on orthopedics,"In Total Knee Replacement Arthroplasty (TKA), surgical robotics can provide
image-guided navigation to fit implants with high precision. Its tracking
approach highly relies on inserting bone pins into the bones tracked by the
optical tracking system. This is normally done by invasive, radiative manners
(implantable markers and CT scans), which introduce unnecessary trauma and
prolong the preparation time for patients. To tackle this issue,
ultrasound-based bone tracking could offer an alternative. In this study, we
proposed a novel deep learning structure to improve the accuracy of bone
tracking by an A-mode ultrasound (US). We first obtained a set of ultrasound
dataset from the cadaver experiment, where the ground truth locations of bones
were calculated using bone pins. These data were used to train the proposed
CasAtt-UNet to predict bone location automatically and robustly. The ground
truth bone locations and those locations of US were recorded simultaneously.
Therefore, we could label bone peaks in the raw US signals. As a result, our
method achieved sub millimeter precision across all eight bone areas with the
only exception of one channel in the ankle. This method enables the robust
measurement of lower extremity bone positions from 1D raw ultrasound signals.

pub.1012920573,New Approach to the Open Loop Control for Surgical Robots Navigation,"Robotic and computer-assisted technology are increasingly being developed for use in surgery to aid surgeons in providing more precision and accuracy, especially during procedures requiring fine movements. Moreover, reproducibility is another important aspect to be considered to achieve better results. This paper presents a navigation system developed to assist orthopaedic surgery with application in open loop control of the robots used for femur drilling procedures. Although it may have other applications, the system was thought to be used in Hip Resurfacing (HR) prosthesis surgery to implant the initial guide tool. The navigation system does not require any marker implanted in the patient, unlike current systems. The location of the bone in the operating room is obtained through the information from ultrasound (US) images and Computer Tomography (CT) images, obtained respectively in the intra-operative and pre-operative scenarios. During the surgery the bone position and orientation is obtained through a registration process between the US and CT, using an optical measurement system (Polaris) to measure the 3D position of passive markers attached to the US probe and to the drill. The system description, image processing, calibration procedures and results with real experiments are presented and described to illustrate the system in operation."

A key benefit of such systems is the ability to generate a composite view of medical-informatics and the real environment, streamlining the pathway for delivering patient-specific data. Consequently, AR was integrated within an orthopaedic setting by designing a system that captured and replicated the user- interface of a commercially available surgical robot onto a commercial head mounted see through display. Thus, a clinician could simultaneously view the operating-site and real- time informatics when carrying out an assisted patellofemoral-arthroplasty (PFA). The system was tested with 10 surgeons to examine its usability and impact on procedure- completion times when conducting simulated PFA on sawbone models. A statistically insignificant mean increase in procedure completion-time (+23.7s, p=0.240) was found, and the results of a post-operative qualitative-evaluation indicated a strongly positive consensus on the system, with a large majority of subjects agreeing the system provided value to the procedure without incurring noticeable physical discomfort. Overall, this study provides an encouraging insight into the high levels of engagement AR has with a clinical audience as well as its ability to enhance future generations of medical robotics."

pub.1145899916,277 Implementation of the ROSA Robot in a DGH,"Abstract  Introduction The ROSA (Robotic Surgical Assistant) is designed to assist orthopaedic surgeons performing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It is postulated that the real-time data provided by the ROSA robot aids the surgeon by providing objective values to bone resections and soft tissue balance, enabling better implant selection and positioning. This is thought to improve patient outcomes through reduced post-operative pain, reduced hospital stays and reduced revision rate. To date, the ROSA robot has solely been implemented in tertiary centres in the UK. This study investigates the implementation of the ROSA robot in a district general hospital (DGH) in a geographically isolated region of the UK.   Method The ROSA robot was installed in St. Michael’s Hospital, Cornwall in July 2021. Prior to its clinical deployment, six surgeons undertook saw bone training. Following this, six ROSA-assisted TKAs were performed in six weeks between July and August 2021. Logistical challenges to implementation included difficulty in ROSA component delivery given geographical isolation, consultant training time dedicated to ROSA operation in the context of a busy DGH trauma rota and increased operative time during the learning curve.   Conclusions Despite the challenges faced, we have demonstrated that ROSA can be implemented in a rural, geographically distanced DGH. Given the use of robotic assistance in other surgical specialties, this is an exciting prospect for elective knee surgery in the future. "
pub.1093383122,Impedance Force Control for Lateral Milling of Bone in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Robotic knee surgery performs bone cutting without relying on mechanical jigs during bone preparation of TKA (Total Knee Arthroplasty). The inaccuracy induced by loose jig fixation and slot width tolerance can, subsequently, be avoided. Mill is usually used as the bone cutter in most of the current knee surgical robots, in which all bones are milled out. This might not be desired. In some cases, the cut bone may be used by the surgeon for adjustment of soft tissue balance and/or varus/valgus for some patients. Therefore the existent bone cutting method may not be adequate. Different scenarios of bone cutting in order to preserve the cut-off bones to be in pieces should be developed. In the proposed cutting process, the side edge instead of the bottom edge of the mill is used to move and cut the bone along the designated boundary of the cutting plane. Thus cut-off bone is in the form of pieces rather than blurs or chips. However, this cutting process will give rise to large and non-uniform cut forces on the cutter. As a result, the cutter is under large bending and the cutting trajectory may be deviated or, even worse, the cutter may be broken. To overcome the problem, the paper proposed an adaptive impedance force control strategy to maintain the stability and accuracy of bone cutting process."
pub.1008024835,Measurement of Pelvic Tilting Angle During Total Hip Arthroplasty Using a Computer Navigation System,"The purpose of this study was to measure pelvic orientation during total hip arthroplasty (THA) in a lateral decubitus position using a computer navigation system with an optical localizer (OPTOTRAK). THA was performed in 17 hips. Much attention was paid to set the patients in neutral axial rotation with the anatomical plane of the pelvis perpendicular to the operating table. After shape-based registration, pelvic orientation was tracked with light emitting diode markers fixed to the pelvis. Measurements were based on the anatomical plane. Mean movement of the pelvis from the supine position to the dislocated lateral decubitus position was 8 degrees posterior (26 posterior to 6 anterior), 3 degrees abducted (6 adduction to 20 abduction), and 4 degrees internally rotated (24 internal to 5 external). This study showed that the pelvis was not always placed in neutral axial rotation, despite the surgical plan. It was further tilted posteriorly and rotated internally when the socket was inserted. This tilt can lead to decreased socket anteversion with conventional alignment guide systems, while unknown pelvic orientation in general can cause socket malposition with such systems. Therefore, intraoperative three-dimensional measurements of pelvic orientation seems to be useful to avoid socket malposition."

The adoption of KA is increasing. Four meta-analyses, three randomized trials, and a national multicenter study showed that patients treated with KA total knee arthroplasty (TKA) reported significantly better pain relief, function, and flexion and a more normal feeling knee than patients treated with mechanically aligned TKA [1–8]. Two randomized trials that limited the severity of the preoperative knee deformities showed similar clinical outcomes [9, 10]. KA co-aligns the axes of the femoral and tibial components with the three axes of the native knee without restrictions on the level of preoperative deformities [11]. The surgical goal of restoring the native alignments of the limb, Q-angle, and joint lines unique to each patient depends on accurately setting the components coincident to the native joint lines, which co-aligns the axes. The surgical goal of restoring the laxities, tibial compartment forces, knee adduction moment, and gait to those of the native knee without ligament release balances the TKA and promotes long-term implant survival [12–19]. A description of the calipered technique of KA with manual instruments, the sequence for measuring bone positions and resection thicknesses, the intraoperative recording of these measurements on the verification worksheet (Fig. 24.1), and the use of decision trees for balancing the TKA with the medial pivot CS and CR inserts are shown (Figs. 24.2 and 24.3). Calipered measurements of the thicknesses of the femoral and tibial bone resections restore the native joint lines with high reproducibility when they are adjusted within ±0.5 mm of the femoral and tibial components after compensating for cartilage and bone wear and the 1 mm kerf from the saw cut [20–22]. Because calipered measurements are a basic surgical skill, inexpensive, and highly reliable, they should be a required verification check when performing KA with manual instruments, patient-specific guides, navigation, and robotics. Examples of treatment of patients with severe varus and valgus deformities and flexion contractures treated with kinematically aligned TKA without ligament release are shown. Finally, the reasons for the low risk of tibial component failure, low risk of patellofemoral instability, and high implant survival at 10 years after KA TKA are explained [11, 23, 24]."
pub.1129576595,Short-term clinical outcomes of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty in osteonecrosis of the femoral head patients,"Objective  To explore the radiology and short-term clinical outcomes of MAKO robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA).   Methods  The present study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 23 patients (32 hips) who diagnosed as osteonecrosis of the femoral head and underwent MAKO THA from August 1st to December 31st, 2018 as MAKO THA group. A total of 23 patients (32 hips) with the same diagnosis underwent manual THA at the same time as conventional THA group. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of gender, affected side, age, height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), stage of the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO), preoperative Harris hip score, WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index and limb length discrepancy. The patients in both groups were operated by the same doctors. The MAKO THA group underwent the acetabular preparation and the acetabular shell impaction with the assistance of the robotic arm. The leg length and offset were adjusted under the feedback of the MAKO system. Other intraoperative procedures and postoperative interventions of MAKO THA group were similar as conventional THA group. The operation duration, incidence of complications, the radiograph parameters (version, leg length discrepancy and offset), consistency of acetabular prosthesis position in MAKO operation plan, position in postoperative X-ray, the consistency of acetabular prosthesis inclination, version in MAKO operation plan, angles in postoperative CT and functional scores (Harris hip score, WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index and forgotten joint score) at 6 months and 12 months after operation were compared between the two groups.   Results  The operation duration of the MAKO THA group was longer than that of the conventional THA group (101.2±19.9 min, 65.5±5.6 min, t =7.659, P <0.001). In terms of radiograph parameters, the different of version (22.63°±5.58°, 15.98°±7.13°, t =4.156, P <0.001) and limb length discrepancy (0.35±0.30 cm, 0.87±0.43 cm, t =4.775, P <0.001) and offset (0.27±0.19 cm, 0.49±0.16 cm, t =4.155, P <0.001) between the two groups were statistically significant. The MAKO operative plan and postoperative radiographs were measured. The difference of inclination/version were 1.18°±2.52°/2.06°±2.79° ( r =0.846, P <0.001; r =0.810, P <0.001), respectively. The horizontal/vertical directions of the joint rotation center were 2.25±1.08 mm and 2.20±1.28 mm ( r =0.975, P <0.001; r =0.974, P <0.001), respectively. In terms of functional results at 6 months and 12 months after operation, Harris hip score in MAKO THA group and in conventional THA group was 90.2±5.40/89.9±5.23 ( t =0.188, P =0.851) and 93.9±2.31/94.0±2.61 ( t =0.254, P =0.801), respectively. The WOMAC index was 27.3±10.36/29.1±12.03 ( t =0.623, P =0.535) and 16.4±8.39/15.2±8.35 ( t =0.597, P =0.552).

pub.1123898452,Preliminary clinical results of robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Objective  To investigate the accuracy of robotic-assisted UKA and its safety and short term functional outcomes.   Methods  The clinical data of 20 patients who received robotic-assisted UKA in Shanghai 6th People's Hospital and Chinese PLA General Hospital from September 2016 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed, with 10 patients in each hospital. All patients had a preoperative diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Five patients received simultaneous bilateral UKA. Of all the 20 patients, there were 3 male patients and 17 female patients, with an average age of 65 years old (range from 51 to 79 years old) and an average BMI of (26.9±3.4) kg/m 2 . All the procedures were performed with MAKO RIO robotic-assisted surgical system and RESTORIS MCK unicompartmental knee prosthesis (STRYKER MAKO Surgical, USA). Each patient's operation time, blood loss and post-operative pain scores were recorded. Pre-operative and post-operative knee society scores were recorded; lower limb alignment and the position of the tibial component in coronal plane were measured.   Results  For patients who received unilateral procedure, the mean operating time of tourniquet was (27±10) minutes. The average total blood loss on post-op day 2 was (476±290) mL, and no transfusion was needed for any patient. The mean visual analogue scale pain score at 8, 16 and 24 hours after surgery was 3.2±1.2, 1.8±0.8 and 1.1±0.3, respectively. All 20 patients (25 knees) were followed-up at a minimal time of 8 weeks (average 14.1 weeks, range from 8 to 20 weeks). On latest follow-up visit, the mean Knee Society Score was improved from a pre-operative value of 57±13 to 90±6, the mean function score was improved from a preoperative value of 48±18 to 79±12, both changes were statistically significant ( t =14.941 and 10.014 respectively, all P values<0.01). The position of the tibial component relative to the mechanical axis of the tibial in coronal plane was at a mean varus of 1.7°±1.2°(range, 0°-3.9°), the mean deviation from the target position (1°of varus) was 1.1°±0.9°, none of these cases had a deviation of more than 3°. The mean deviation from the target position of cases from the 2 centers was 1.2°±1.1° and 1.0°±0.6°, respectively. There was no statistic significant difference between the 2 centers ( t =0.421, P >0.05). No severe complications, such as surgical site infection, deep venous thrombosis or vascular and nerve injury, were observed during the follow-up period.   Conclusions  Robotic-assisted UKA can provide us with excellent precision and safety through a minimally invasive approach. Further long-term controlled study is required to identify the long term clinical outcomes and the role of robotic technique on the improvement of post-operative knee function warrant."
pub.1141240300,Chapter 17 Reducing the Risk and Methods of Managing Stiffness After Calipered Kinematically Aligned Total Knee Arthroplasty,"This chapter contains a discussion and video links to assist the surgeon in reducing the risk of stiffness and in managing stiffness after calipered kinematically aligned (KA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The treatment of over 5300 primary TKAs from 2006 to 2020 with the anatomic target of restoring the patient’s prearthritic femoral and tibial joint lines regardless of knee deformity, without ligament release with posterior cruciate ligament–retaining implants (CRs), provides the background. The first section reports the 10-year incidence of treatment of stiffness with manipulation under anesthesia (MUA), which declined in 2018 with the initiation of intraoperative verification checks and self-administered flexion/extension stretching exercises after hospital discharge. The second and third sections review the results of in vitro and in vivo studies that show that the biomechanical targets for balancing a calipered KA TKA are the restoration of the native medial and lateral tibial compartment forces and prearthritic ligament lengths that determine knee laxities. The fourth section describes seven intraoperative verification checks that restore the native medial and lateral tibial compartment forces and most laxities. The final section uses instructional case studies to discuss the options for managing motion loss from stiffness, with self-administered flexion/extension stretching exercises and MUA. The educational objective is to encourage surgeons to use a caliper and verification checks when performing KA with manual, patient-specific, navigational, and robotic instrumentation, to reduce the risks of stiffness and motion loss."
pub.1008675882,Computer-Guided Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Computed-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS) has been recently defined as the ability to use sophisticated computer algorithms to allow the surgeon to determine three-dimensional (3D) placement of total hip implants in situ.1 A rapid ongoing evolution of technical advances has allowed the ability to move from cumbersome systems requiring a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient’s hip joint to more elegant systems that use image-free registration or the simple use of fluoroscopy at the time of surgery. In total hip replacement, several reports have cited the accuracy with which implants can be placed using computer-aided robotic devices or surgical navigation.From a historical perspective, ROBODOC was the first modern attempt to use computers to place implants in bones; in this example, a cementless metal femoral stem in the proximal femoral canal. The goal was to improve the precision of implant placement, and to eliminate errors from a variety of sources including inaccurate plain radiographic templating, morphological anatomical variation, and problems related to the insertion of the implants. The ROBODOC system was conceived in 1986 by Bargar and Paul, and developed over the next several years with grants from IBM. That team developed proprietary software for the CT imaging to obtain an accuracy of one pixel for the raw data, which then allowed them to create CT 3D reconstructions for choosing the implant sizes and planning the robotic surgical intervention. Originally, the fiducial markers for the robotic system were placed during a separate operative procedure and the marker was used to specifically orient the robotic tool into the inner canal of the proximal femur. This changed with the ability to register the unique anatomy of the patient intraoperatively. With improvements in software, the system could be referenced by using a digitizing probe for the key areas of the proximal femur, and small incisions were used about the midshaft of the femur for distal referencing. Currently, referencing may be done using a highly sophisticated combination of local touch point referencing and image overlay. The ROBODOC system is amenable to very small incisions that are limited in length only by the size of the implants.2,3"
pub.1157645087,Alignment techniques in total knee arthroplasty,"Purpose Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) reduces knee pain to improve knee function for painful knee osteoarthritis and provides excellent long-term survivorship. However, approximately 20% of patients remain dissatisfied. To improve patient satisfaction, several modifications of knee alignment have recently been introduced. The aim of this paper is to review various alignment techniques. Methods Principles, surgical techniques, and clinical results of various alignment techniques for TKA were searched in the PubMed database. Results Mechanical alignment aims to cut perpendicular to the mechanical axes of the femur and tibia in the coronal plane. The threshold of the deviation from the mechanical axis for long-term survivorship is still unknown. Anatomical alignment aims at neutral alignment but 2–3 varus joint line relative to the mechanical axis. Although catastrophic polyethylene wear was reported in the 1990s, excellent mid-term clinical results were recently reported using surgical robots. Kinematic alignment aims to restore the pre-arthritic native limb alignment and avoid soft tissue release. To avoid excessive alignment deviation, some modification such as inverse kinematic, restricted kinematic, and modified kinematic alignments are also introduced. Equal or better clinical scores have been reported in short term. Functional alignment TKA aims to restore pre-arthritic alignment and achieve balanced soft tissue tension by adjusting bone resections using robotic-assisted technology. Conclusion Wide range of clinical results exist for new alignment techniques in the short term. The safe range of alignment for long-term survivorship remains unknown. Further high-quality studies should be performed to warrant the widespread use of new alignment techniques."
pub.1148119185,Alignement Cinématique inversé pour les Prothèses Totales de Genou,"Patient specific alignment might improve clinical outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Different alignment concepts are described, each providing specific features with theoretical benefits or possible disadvantages. Inverse kinematic alignment (iKA) is a new patient specific alignment concept with excellent reported clinical outcome and patient satisfaction at short-term follow-up. iKA is a tibia-first, gap balancing technique restoring the native tibial joint line obliquity (JLO). In each patient, within boundaries, equal medial and lateral tibial resections are performed, compensating for cartilage and bone loss. We describe the surgical technique of iKA using a robotic assisted system (Mako, Stryker, Kalamazoo, USA). A case series of 100 consecutive iKA cases is assessed and the bony resections and resection angles are reported. Both in the coronal plane and axial plane, iKA might offer advantages over existing alignment strategies, possibly providing optimal clinical outcome and durable long-term survival, regardless of the alignment is varus, neutral or valgus."
pub.1160640203,Analysis of factors affecting the change in relative patellar height after robotic-assisted primary total knee arthroplasty,"Objective  To analyze the factors affecting the relative height change of the patella after primary robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (R-TKA).   Methods  The data of 97 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee treated with R-TKA admitted from June 2021 to March 2022 were retrospectively analyzed, including 15 males and 82 females, aged 70.0±5.4 years (range, 58-80 years). The bone resection parameters of the robotic system were recorded intraoperatively, including the bone resection amount of the medial and lateral distal femur, medial and lateral posterior femoral condyle and medial and lateral tibial plateau. The Blackburne-Peel index (BPI) and Caton-Deschamps index (CDI) were used to measure the preoperative and postoperative relative patellar height on lateral radiographs, as well as the posterior tibial slope (PTS) and the change in patellar ligament length before and after surgery. The relationship between the change in relative patellar height and the variables of interest was analyzed using partial correlation and multiple linear regression.   Results  The mean postoperative CDI was lower than preoperatively (0.79±0.15 vs. 0.91±0.13, t =9.69, P <0.001), and the percentage of patients with postoperative CDI<0.6 was higher than preoperatively (9.3% vs. 0; χ 2 =12.92, P <0.001); the differences in mean postoperative BPI and percentage of patients with postoperative BPI<0.45 were not statistically significant compared to preoperatively (0.69±0.13 vs. 0.71±0.17, t =1.35, P =0.182; 11.3% vs. 17.5%, χ 2 =1.50, P =0.220). The mean patellar ligament length on the first postoperative day was 2.29 mm shorter than preoperatively, there was a statistically significant difference ( t =5.90, P <0.001). Partial correlation analysis showed that the amount of patellar ligament length change was positively correlated with the amount of BPI and CDI change ( r =0.84, P <0.001; r =0.70, P <0.001), and the amount of PTS change and the mean distal femoral bone resection were negatively correlated with the amount of BPI ( r = -0.41, P <0.001; r =-0.32, P =0.002) and CDI ( r =-0.23, P =0.029; r =-0.25, P =0.017) change. In contrast, the amount of posterior femoral condyle bone resection and tibial plateau bone resection did not correlate with the change of BPI and CDI. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the amount of patellar ligament length change, PTS change and the distal femoral bone resection were factors influencing the change of BPI ( β =0.03, P <0.001; β =-0.01, P <0.001; β =-0.02, P =0.021) and CDI ( β =0.02, P <0.001; β =-0.01, P =0.001; β =-0.02, P =0.008).   Conclusion  Amount of patellar ligament length change, PTS change and the distal femoral bone resection are factors affecting the BPI. In order to obtain a better relative patellar height in the primary R-TKA, attention should be paid to the adjustment of the distal femoral bone resection and PTS, while taking the necessary measures to reduce the postoperative patellar ligament "
pub.1124682907,Design and Analysis of Customized Hip Implant Using Finite Element Method,"In total hip replacement, the damaged bone and the cartilage are removed and replaced with the prosthetic implant. Though various innovations have come with implant sterilization, designing, fixation and robotic surgery, the long-term issue is to find an optimum patient-specific hip implant which suits the patient’s requirement. The aim and objective of the proposed study was to design a highly accurate patient-specific hip implant by standardizing the existing design and to prove that customized design is better than the conventional design. The geometric measurements of hip were performed in hip CT image using MIMICS 20.0 software. The implant design was carried out using Solid-works. The designed implant is meshed and analysed using FEA. From the comparative study of the FEA analysis, it was proved that customized implant was best fit for the patients than the conventional implant."
pub.1141302049,Acoustic-Based Spatio-Temporal Learning for Press-Fit Evaluation of Femoral Stem Implants,"In this work, we propose a method utilizing tool-integrated vibroacoustic measurements and a spatio-temporal learning-based framework for the detection of the insertion endpoint during femoral stem implantation in cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). In current practice, the optimal insertion endpoint is intraoperatively identified based on surgical experience and dependent on a subjective decision. Leveraging spectogram features and time-variant sequences of acoustic hammer blow events, our proposed solution can give real-time feedback to the surgeon during the insertion procedure and prevent adverse events in clinical practice. To validate our method on real data, we built a realistic experimental human cadaveric setup and acquired acoustic signals of hammer blows during broaching the femoral stem cavity with a novel inserter tool which was enhanced by contact microphones. The optimal insertion endpoint was determined by a standardized preoperative plan following clinical guidelines and executed by a board-certified surgeon. We train and evaluate a Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (LRCN) on sequences of spectrograms to detect a reached target press fit corresponding to a seated implant. The proposed method achieves an overall per-class recall of 93.82±5.11%$$93.82\pm 5.11\%$$ for detecting an ongoing insertion and 70.88±11.83%$$70.88\pm 11.83\%$$ for identifying a reached target press fit for five independent test specimens. The obtained results open the path for the development of automated systems for intra-operative decision support, error prevention and robotic applications in hip surgery."
pub.1174916604,VIRTUAL IMPINGEMENT TESTS IN 113 PATIENTS UNDERGOING TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY,"Hip precautions following total hip arthroplasty (THA) limits flexion, adduction and internal rotation, yet these precautions cause unnecessary psychological stress. This study aims to assess bony and implant impingement using virtual models from actual patient's bony morphology and spinopelvic parameters to deduce whether hip precautions are necessary with precise implant positioning in the Asian population. Individualized sitting and standing sacral slope data of robotic THAs performed at two tertiary referral centers in Hong Kong was inputted into the simulation system based on patients’ pre-operative sitting and standing lumbar spine X-rays. Three-dimensional dynamic models were reconstructed using the Stryker Mako THA 4.0 software to assess bony and implant impingement both anteriorly and posteriorly, with default cup placement at 40° inclination and 20° anteversion. Femoral anteversion followed individual patient's native version. A 36mm hip ball was chosen for all cups equal or above 48mm and 32mm for those below. Anterior impingement was assessed by hip flexion and posterior impingement was assessed by hip extension. 113 patients were included. At neutral rotation and adduction, no patients had anterior implant impingement at hip flexion of 100°. 1.7% had impingement at 110°, 3.5% had impingement at 120°, 9.7% had impingement at 130°. With 20° of internal rotation and adduction, 0.8% had anterior implant impingement at hip flexion of 90°, 7.1% had impingement at 100° and 18.5% had impingement at 110°. With the hip externally rotated by 20°, 0.8% of patients had posterior implant impingement, and 8.8% bony impingement at 0° extension. With enabling technology allowing accurate component positioning, hip precautions without limiting forward flexion in neutral position is safe given precise implant positioning and adequate osteophyte removal. Patients should only be cautioned about combined internal rotation, adduction with flexion."
pub.1122653395,TL 18049 - Influence of tibial component position on altered kinematics following total ankle arthroplasty during simulated gait,"Introduction: Correct positioning of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) implants has been associated with superior clinical outcomes. However, the correlation between implant position and ankle motion is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of tibial component position on ankle kinematics during simulated gait. Methods: The stance phase of gait was simulated pre and post-TAA with 8 mid-tibia cadaveric specimens using a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic platform. Ankle kinematics were measured based on reflective markers. A fixed-bearing total ankle system (Salto Talaris, Integra LifeSciences) was used. Using reconstructed CT data, the 3D tibial component position relative to a standard ankle joint reference was characterized (Fig 1A). The effect of the tibial component position on absolute differences in ankle kinematics (pre/post TAA) was assessed using linear regression with a level of significance set to p = 0.05. Results: Differences in ankle joint kinematics were only identified in the transverse plane, where internal talar rotation was significantly increased following TAA compared with the native condition (Fig 1B). The medial position of TAA tibial components was positively associated with increased internal talar rotation (Fig 1C; β = 1.861 degrees/mm, R2 = 0.72, p = 0.008). Conclusion: This study suggests that a medial-lateral position of the tibial implant affects ankle kinematics. During operative procedures, the tibial component is usually positioned to preserve the bone stock of the medial and lateral malleolus. However, little attention is given to the position of the implant in relation to the center of the tibial axis. This finding could have clinical implications for techniques."
pub.1152870334,10 New Technology and Surgical Technique in TKA,"Successful knee arthroplasty, in both the short and the long term, is a function of restoration of normal joint stability and muscle demand through correct positioning and alignment of the prosthetic components. Though surgical techniques may vary, there is general consensus that the technical results of conventional surgical techniques using manual instruments are highly variable. This has led to the increasing adoption of computer-based technologies within the operative setting. The case for computer assistance in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been strengthened by the striking effect of patient age on the durability of the procedure. This supports the adoption of computer assistance in younger and more active patients in whom the need for correct positioning, alignment, and stability appears even more critical. Over the past three decades, the adoption of computer-assisted surgery has allowed increased precision and reproducibility in the evaluation of patient anatomy and the placement of prosthetic replacements. This was first seen in the development of surgical navigation as a method for avoiding malalignment of TKA, thereby eliminating the outliers experienced with manual alignment methods. This was followed by the emergence of technologies assisting surgeons in achieving idealized component placement through the combination of surgical navigation with robotic systems to position cutting tools and predict joint laxity. These alternative approaches enable the surgeon to measure joint laxity directly through the deployment of electronic measurement tools or sensor-based “smart” tibial trials. Even though early results suggest major gains in patient outcomes using these approaches, long-term evidence is still needed from multicenter prospective clinical trials."
pub.1165852589,Patient outcomes of conventional versus robot assisted total hip arthroplasty," Background: Robotic assisted (RA) total hip arthroplasty (THA) may provide improved precision and accuracy; however, contention remains on whether RA THA provides better patient outcomes than conventional THA. This study compares short-term clinical outcomes, complication rates, and operative times between these two groups.   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts for demographic data, comorbidities, operating time, revisions, and complications of patients who underwent RA and conventional THA. Patient-reported outcomes were collected via OBERD database at the following timepoints: preoperatively, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year postoperatively. Descriptive statistics and mixed multivariate regression analyses were used to analyze data.   Results:  Two hundred ten patients were included (n=149 conventional, n=61 RA). Patients with RA THAs were younger than those with conventional THAs (59 years, IQR: 53-66 and 64 years, IQR: 58-71; P =.002). The operative time was longer for the RA compared to the conventional group (106 minutes, IQR: 92-120 and 92 minutes, IQR: 82-109, respectively, P =< .001). There was no statistically significant difference in SF-12 mental scores, SF-12 physical scores, or OHS between RA and conventional THA at different timepoints. Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in complication and revision rates between the two groups.    Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that there were no statistically significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between the RA versus conventional THA groups. Furthermore, our findings suggest a lack of significant differences in complication or revision rates. Surgeons performing robot-assisted surgeries for hip replacements can reasonably expect patient outcomes that are, at a minimum, as successful as the conventional counterparts. "
pub.1146187558,Robot-assisted (RA) versus conventional total knee replacement: a 2-year clinical comparison," Background: Robotic-assisted (RA) technology is becoming increasingly popular in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to its improved alignment, accuracy, and precision compared with the conventional TKA. Despite reported benefits, disagreements exist regarding patient-reported outcomes and complication rates comparing RA TKA and conventional TKA. Thus, the purpose of the study is to report differences in patient outcomes and complication rates between patients who underwent RA versus conventional TKA.   Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 239 primary knee arthroplasty cases (n=137 robot-assisted and n=102 conventional TKA) performed by a single fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon from January 1, 2016 to February 26, 2019. The electronic medical record and patient outcomes database were reviewed for demographic characteristics (age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities), patient-reported outcomes (Short Form Health Survey and Oxford Knee Score), 90-day complications, and revision rates.   Results:  There was no statistically significant difference in patient-reported outcomes between conventional versus RA groups at two time points: preoperative and 2-year. Differences remained insignificant after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities. There was no statistically significant difference between the conventional and RA groups in revision rates (0.7% and 1%, respectively; P =1.00) or complication rates (1.5% and 3.9%, respectively; P =0.406).    Conclusions: There were no differences in 90-day complications, revisions, and patient-reported outcome scores between RA TKA and conventional TKA groups at short-term follow-up. Surgeons can expect similar clinical outcomes without an increase in complications while taking advantage of increased accuracy in alignment and component placement. Further long-term study of RA TKA outcomes is warranted.   Level of Evidence: Level III. "
pub.1122138870,"Accuracy, Inter- and Intra-Observer Reliability of a CT Alignment Measurement Protocol for Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty","Component position and overall limb alignment following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) have been shown to influence device survivorships and clinical outcomes. However, these parameters are often assessed through 2D radiographs after surgery, which can be prone to inaccuracy. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new method for 3D CT based overall limb alignment and component position measurements. The technique utilizes a new mathematical model to calculate prosthesis alignment from the coordinates of anatomical landmarks used in RATKA. The hypothesis is that the proposed technique demonstrated good accuracy, as well as low intra and inter-observer variability.
                  Two groups of patients (n=120 per group) underwent RATKA and conventional TKA at 4 imaging locations between October 2016 and August 2018, where they were recruited and consented for this prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study. CTs were collected 6 weeks post-operatively and analyzed using RATKA landmarks and the proposed technique. Measurements of 30 randomly selected cases were compared to the surgeons’ operative plan and component target positions for accuracy analysis. Two surgeons performed the same measurements separately for inter-observer variability analysis. One of the two surgeons repeated the measurements 30 days later to assess intra-observer variability.
                  Average measurement error of overall limb alignment, femoral and tibial component positions were less than 1 degree. Bland Altman plots analysis showed great reproducibility between observers. Correlation analysis showed low variability within observer, with slopes between 0.8 to 1.0 and R-squared > 0.8.
                  The proposed method demonstrated great accuracy to plan and low intra and inter-observer variability. This can be a great tool for RATKA studies where component accuracy is assessed using post-operative CTs."

Of course, the basic principles remain largely the same but the theories, techniques, instruments and applications have changed radically. We present a short history of shoulder arthroscopy, detailing some of the key developments and move on to modern day theatre setup with tips on topics such as fluid management, localized haemorrhage control and avoidance of hypoxic ischaemic brain injury in the beach-chair position. Key arthroscopic skills are discussed with an overview of the latest techniques.We then go on to discuss the future of shoulder arthroscopy and the relevance of new technologies that were previously unthinkable, such as stem-cell technology, platelet-rich plasma, arthroscopic arthroplasty and the use of robotics. Shoulder arthroscopy is becoming ever more endoscopic, with procedures such as the arthroscopic Latarjet, all-arthroscopic tendon transfers and brachial plexus releases becoming more commonly performed.The convergence of biological and biomechanical developments in the future will produce radical changes in our approach to shoulder pathology and the techniques that we employ today."
pub.1166118719,RISK OF REVISION FOLLOWING TOTAL HIP AND KNEE ARTHROPLASTY PERFORMED USING COMPUTER-ASSISTED TECHNOLOGIES VERSUS CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUE: AN ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL JOINT REGISTRY DATA,"Abstract  Introduction Component mal-positioning in total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) can increase the risk of revision for various reasons. Compared to conventional surgery, relatively improved accuracy of implant positioning can be achieved using computer assisted technologies including navigation, patient-specific jigs, and robotic systems. However, it is not known whether application of these technologies has improved prosthesis survival in the real-world. This study aimed to compare risk of revision for all-causes following primary THR and TKR, and revision for dislocation following primary THR performed using computer assisted technologies compared to conventional technique.   Methods We performed an observational study using National Joint Registry data. All adult patients undergoing primary THR and TKR for osteoarthritis between 01/04/2003 to 31/12/2020 were eligible. Patients who received metal-on-metal bearing THR were excluded. We generated propensity score weights, using Sturmer weight trimming, based on: age, gender, ASA grade, side, operation funding, year of surgery, approach, and fixation. Specific additional variables included position and bearing for THR and patellar resurfacing for TKR. For THR, effective sample sizes and duration of follow up for conventional versus computer-guided and robotic-assisted analyses were 9,379 and 10,600 procedures, and approximately 18 and 4 years, respectively. For TKR, effective sample sizes and durations of follow up for conventional versus computer-guided, patient-specific jigs, and robotic-assisted groups were 92,579 procedures over 18 years, 11,665 procedures over 8 years, and 644 procedures over 3 years, respectively. Outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and expressed using hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).   Results For THR, analysis comparing computer-guided versus conventional technique demonstrated HR of 0.771 (95%CI 0.573–1.036) p=0.085, and 0.594 (95%CI 0.297–1.190) p=0.142, for revision for all-causes and dislocation, respectively. When comparing robotic-assisted versus conventional technique, HR for revision for all-causes was 0.480 (95%CI 0.067 –3.452) p=0.466. For TKR, compared to conventional surgery, HR for all-cause revision for procedures performed using computer guidance and patient-specific jigs were 0.967 (95% CI 0.888–1.052) p=0.430, and 0.937 (95% CI 0.708–1.241) p=0.65, respectively. HR for analysis comparing robotic-assisted versus conventional technique was 2.0940 (0.2423, 18.0995) p = 0.50.   Conclusions This is the largest study investigating this topic utilising propensity score analysis methods. We did not find a statistically significant difference in revision for all-causes and dislocation although these analyses are underpowered to detect smaller differences in effect size between groups. Additional comparison for revision for dislocation between robotic-assisted versus conventionally performed THR was"
pub.1122138915,Does the use of Robotic Technology Improve Surgeon Ergonomic Safety during TKA?,"Surgeon physical stress in the operating room is a known potential cause of musculoskeletal overuse injuries, specifically in surgeons who perform total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Injuries have been attributed to ergonomically challenging postures. This study compared surgeon lower back and shoulder posture between manual TKA (MTKA) and robotic assisted TKA (RATKA).
                  Two surgeons performed a total six MTKA and six RATKA on a set of cadaveric knees. Movement and EMG sensors were secured to each surgeon to monitor lower back and shoulder movements, as well as muscle activities. Data was analyzed and activities were assessed as low, medium, or high risk, providing a score between 0-lowest and 16-highest. Risk data was compared between MTKA and RATKA for three separate surgical tasks: 1-bone cut preparation & cutting (MTKA = placement of cutting jigs, bone cutting, RATKA = array placement, bone registration, bone cutting), 2-knee balancing and 3-trialing.
                  Overall, there were more high-risk shoulder than lower back activities in MTKA and RATKA. More high-risk movement and EMG stimulation were measured in the dominant shoulder than the non-dominant. When lower back and shoulder data were combined, highest risk task was bone cut preparation & cutting (MTKA: 13 vs. 6 vs. 6 and RATKA: 11 vs. 8 vs. 6), with a higher risk for MTKA than RATKA.
                  Poor posture can be a potential cause for surgeon work-related injuries. This study evaluated which tasks presented highest risk to surgeon ergonomic safety while performing TKA, and found lower overall ergonomics risk for performing RATKA vs. MTKA. Although this study provides data indicating reduced ergonomic risk with RATKA, additional studies in the operating room need to be performed."
pub.1167646152,Investigation of perioperative total blood loss of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty,"Objective  To investigate the perioperative total blood loss of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   Methods  A total of 60 patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent initial unilateral TKA in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from February to June 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. According to whether they received robot-assisted surgery, they were divided into robot-assisted group and traditional surgery group. In the robot-assisted group, there were 32 patients, including 6 males and 26 females, aged 70.22±5.88 years (range, 57 to 79 years). Left side 14 cases, right side 18 cases; grade of Kellgren-Lawrence: 1 case of grade Ⅱ, 14 cases of grade Ⅲ, 17 cases of grade Ⅳ. In the traditional surgery group, there were 28 patients, including 5 males and 23 females, aged 68.61±6.79 years (range, 57 to 87 years). Left side 16 cases, right side 12 cases; grade of Kellgren-Lawrence: 2 cases of grade Ⅱ, 12 cases of grade Ⅲ, 14 cases of grade Ⅳ. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the two groups ( P> 0.05). Postoperative hemoglobin, hematocrit, and their decreased values were recorded in the two groups, and perioperative range of motion (ROM) of knee and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) scores were compared between the two groups.   Results  All patients successfully completed the surgery and were followed up, with a follow-up time of 9.93±0.83 months (range, 8-11 months) in the robotic-assisted group and 9.59±0.97 months (range, 8-11 months) in the traditional surgery group. The application time of tourniquet in the robot-assisted group was 96.19±10.21 min, which was higher than that in the traditional surgery group (62.68±16.54 min), and the difference was statistically significant ( t =9.57, P <0.001). The total perioperative blood loss in the robot-assisted group was 534.59(411.85, 859.26) ml, which was higher than 411.32(313.42, 613.52) ml in the traditional surgery group, and the difference was statistically significant ( Z =-2.37, P =0.018). There were no significant differences in hemoglobin or hematocrit between the two groups at day 1 and 3 after surgery ( P >0.05). The hemoglobin decrease value in the robotic-assisted group was 19.63±9.73 g/L, which was greater than 14.71±5.84 g/L in the traditional surgery group, and the difference was statistically significant ( t =2.40, P =0.020). The decrease value of hematocrit in the robot-assisted group was 5.77%±3.14%, which was greater than 4.09%±1.57% in the traditional operation group ( t =2.56, P =0.013). At the last follow-up, knee ROM of the two groups were 123.03°±5.91° and 125.82°±6.59°, respectively, which were higher than the preoperative values of 95.69°±11.64° and 90.29°±23.08°. Postoperative HSS scores were 89.50±4.19 points and 90.70±4.34 points, which were higher than 62.58±10.52 points and 61.09±12.66 points before operation, the differences were statistically significant ( P <0.05), and there was no significant difference between groups ("
pub.1146193562,A Prospective Randomised Controlled Trial of Mechanical Axis with Soft Tissue Release Balancing vs Functional Alignment with Bony Resection Balancing in Total Knee Replacement – A Study Using Stryker Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Technology,"<p><strong>Background</strong>: Improving the functional outcome following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) by using different alignment techniques remains controversial. The surgical techniques and technologies used so far to obtain these alignments have all suffered from inaccuracies. The use of robotic technology to plan and execute the bony resection provides increased accuracy for these various alignment techniques and may determine which will deliver superior function. Functional alignment (FA) is a newer surgical technique that aims to position the prosthesis with respect to each patients’ specific bony anatomy whilst minimising disruption to the soft tissue envelope. This trial aims to compare the patient and surgical outcomes of FA to the current gold standard surgical technique, Mechanical alignment (MA), under randomised and blinded conditions. </p><p><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be prospectively recruited. Following informed consent 240 patients will be randomised to either a MA surgical technique (the control group) or a FA surgical technique (the intervention group) at a ratio of 4:1 using a random number generator. All patients will undergo computer tomography (CT) based Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgery to execute planned implant positioning and alignment with high levels of accuracy. The primary outcome is the forgotten joint score (FJS) at 2-years post-operation. Secondary outcome measures include patient reported outcome measures of post-operative rehabilitation, pain, function, and satisfaction, as well as limb alignment, implant revisions and adverse events. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol population analysis will also be conducted. Standardisation of the surgical system and care pathways will minimise variation and assist in both patient and physiotherapist blinding. Ethical approval was obtained from the Northern B Health and Disability Ethics Committee (20/NTB/10). </p><p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Currently MA remains the gold standard in knee replacement due to proven outcomes and excellent long-term survivorship. There are many alternative alignment techniques in the literature, all with the goal of improving patient outcomes. This study is unique in that it leverages an advanced analytics tool to assist the surgeon in achieving balance. Both alignment techniques will be executed with high precision using the CT-based Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgery system which will minimise surgical variation. This trial design will help determine if FA delivers superior outcomes for patients. </p><p><strong>Trial registration</strong>: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN12620000009910.

pub.1103191835,Pelvic and Femoral Coordinates and Implant Alignment Representations in THA,"For three-dimensional study of total hip arthroplasty, including preoperative planning and biomechanical studies, it is important to indicate the systems used to define the cup and stem alignment and the pelvic and femoral coordinate systems that are used. Cup alignment may be represented radiographically, operatively, or anatomically. Stem alignment is based on the representation of stem anteversion. The pelvis may be defined using the anatomical coordinate system, the functional coordinate system, or the coordinate system recommended by the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB). The anatomical coordinate system uses the anterior pelvic plane as the reference plane, which consists of the bilateral anterosuperior iliac spines and the midpoint of the bilateral pubic tubercles. The functional coordinate system incorporates the pelvic sagittal inclination, or pelvic tilt, in the supine position. The ISB pelvic coordinate system uses the plane consisting of the bilateral anterosuperior iliac spines and the midpoint of the bilateral posterosuperior iliac spines. The two major femoral coordinate systems are the femoral retrocondylar coordinate system and the ISB femoral coordinate system. The femoral retrocondylar coordinate system uses the retrocondylar plane as a reference plane, which consists of the posterior edge of the great trochanter and the bilateral posterior condyles. The ISB femoral coordinate system uses the plane consisting of the femoral head center and the bilateral femoral epicondyles as a reference plane. We must recognize that these differences in the representation of cup and stem alignment and the reference bone coordinate system significantly influence the clinical outcome of total hip arthroplasty whether using three-dimensional planning, navigation, or robotics. Such misunderstanding could result in an incorrect clinical interpretation of biomechanical analysis results."
pub.1141240288,"Chapter 05 Calipered Kinematic Alignment Total Knee Arthroplasty Performed With Specific Manual Instrumentation, Verification Checks, and a Decision Tree","This chapter contains discussion and video links that assist the surgeon in performing calipered kinematically aligned (KA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with specific manual instruments, a verification worksheet, and a decision tree. The treatment of 4726 primary TKAs performed from 2009 through 2019 with KA to restore the patient’s prearthritic joint lines regardless of knee deformity and without ligament release by the senior author provides the background. During this time, 4316 had retention, and 410 had an excision or an unintended transection or tibial detachment of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). This experience evolved into a highly reproducible surgical technique that works best with the retention of the PCL. The first section discusses tips for exposing the knee. The second section describes the use of caliper measurements and verification checks that set the femoral component coincident to the patient’s prearthritic or native distal and posterior femoral joint lines with minimal flexion. The third section describes the use of caliper measurements and verification checks that set the tibial component coincident to the prearthritic tibial joint line. The fourth introduces a decision tree that, when followed, restores the native tibial compartment forces, laxities (except anterior laxity), and tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics, thereby balancing the calipered KA TKA. The fifth section discusses the management of the severe fixed valgus deformity and the knee with flexion laxity from injury to the PCL. The educational objective is to encourage those surgeons that use manual, patient-specific, navigation, and robotic instrumentation to retain the PCL, not release the collateral ligaments, measure bone resections with a caliper, perform verification checks, and follow a decision tree to align and balance the calipered KA TKA reproducibly."
pub.1100988264,Long-term follow up of Navigation TKA using multi directional mobile bearing design,"Total knee arthroplasty using navigation system is known to be more effective than conventional methods in achieving more accurate bone resection and neutral alignment.1 Mobile bearing is also known to reduce wear and automatically correct rotational malalignment of the tibia but the long-term follow-up results of more than 10 years are extremely rare.2, 3 The purpose of this study is to investigate the results of clinical and radiologic long-term follow-up and complications of total knee arthroplasty using navigation and multi-directional mobile bearing.
                  From 2003 to 2006, a total of 111 navigation TKAs using multi-directional mobile bearing design were carried out and reviewed retrospectively. TKAs were performed by two experienced surgeons at one institute. Of the 111 patients, 102 were women and 9 were men. The mean duration of follow-up was 11.4 ± 1.0 years (range, 10.1 to 14.08 years). Clinical outcomes were evaluated in terms of Knee Society Score, Hospital for Special Surgery score, Western Ontario and McMaster University (WOMAC) score, range of motion and complications. Long-term radiological outcomes and survival rates were evaluated at least 10 years.
                  Average preoperative HSS score was 66.5 ± 9.8 and KSS pain and function score were 25.0 ± 11.8 and 44.5 ± 12.3, respectively. Scores improved to 94.1 ± 8.2, 46.6 ± 11.6 and 88.2 ± 14.6 at the last follow up, respectively. Mean preoperative WOMAC scores of 75.8 ± 16.5 improved to 13.8 ± 16.0 at last follow-up. Five knees required re-operation, two for liner breakage, one for liner wear, one for distal femoral fracture and one for infection. The estimated 10-year prosthesis survival rates for any reason and for prosthesis-related problems were 95.5% and 97.4% , respectively.
                  TKAs using each techniques resulted in similar good clinical outcomes and postoperative leg alignments. Robotic and navigation TKA appeared to reduce the number of postoperative leg alignment outliers and revision rate compared to conventional TKA."
pub.1135264776,Combining sensor and robotic technologies to achieve a well balanced total knee arthroplasty while avoiding any soft tissue releases,"Achieving a balanced total knee throughout the entire range of motion leads to improved patient reported outcomes and satisfaction. Sensor-assisted technology  allows the surgeon to quantitatively assess and address imbalance through either soft tissue releases or bone recuts. However, balancing through soft tissue releases leads to unpredictable gap increments and  frequent early over-releases.
                  METHODS: During a consecutive and prospective series of 29 robotic total knee surgeries, intra-operative load sensors were used following the initial bone resections to quantitatively assess the knee’s state of balance through the range of motion with trial components in place. Load measurements were taken at 10 and 90 degrees of knee flexion. Based on previous literature, a balanced knee is defined as having a mediolateral load difference below 15 pounds (lbf) through the range of motion, with an absolute load magnitude per compartment above 5lbf and not exceeding 45lbf. The initial load numbers were recorded as well as the number and type of subsequent corrections needed to achieve quantitative balance.
                  RESULTS Of the 29 robotics cases, only 12 (41%) were well-balanced after the initial bone cuts (mechanical alignment by measured resection). Another two cases were too loose and required an increase in the polyethylene thickness size of two millimeters to achieve a well-balanced knee without further bone resection. In 14 cases, a bone recut was required to balance the knee. More specifically, four cases required a recut of the femur, ten cases required a recut of the tibia. Eventually, one case was left unbalanced in flexion with a mediolateral load differential of 20 lbf. It should be noted explicitly that no soft tissue releases were done for any of the 29 cases.  At the end, all 29 knees were considered well balanced in extension and all but six (79%) at 90° of flexion. For these six cases with balance issue at 90° of flexion, absolute load magnitude in both compartments was below 45 lbf and above 5lbf, though the mediolateral load differential was between 15lbf and 30lbf.
                  DISCUSSION Based on a preliminary series, this work demonstrates the opportunity of combining multiple technologies to achieve a quantitatively balanced knee through the range of motion without any soft tissue release."
pub.1018958263,The Utility of Robotics in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"In the last decade, instrumentation for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has improved the accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability of the procedure. In recent years, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) TKA introduced instrumentation that was reduced in size to fit within the smaller operative field. As the operative field becomes reduced in size, the impact and influence of technology becomes proportionately larger.1 The introduction of computer navigation with MIS is an attempt to improve the surgeon’s visibility in a reduced operative field. The intended goal is to improve the position of the resection guides and ultimately the position of the final components, in essence, providing improved visualization in the limited field. This new technology is an enhancement tool or enabler in MIS TKA because, after registration of the anatomic landmarks, the instruments are dynamically tracked with real-time feedback on the angle and depth of the femoral and tibial resection. Currently, there are two types of computer-navigated systems for TKA: imaged-guided and imageless systems. Image-guided systems rely on data from preoperative radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scans that are registered into the computer system. Imageless navigation systems eliminate the need for preoperative imaging and rely on the registration of intraoperative landmarks, and then compare the registered data with a library of anatomic specimens recorded within the computer databank. The next distinctive feature is the mode of instrument tracking, which can be either by optical line of sight with a series of arrays that are detected by an infrared camera, or an electromagnetic (EM) system that utilizes trackers that are attached to the bone and an EM field generator. Each computer navigation system has their proponents. Either way, advocates of computer-navigated surgery have reported in clinical studies that navigation has shown an improvement in the accuracy of component position within 3° of the desired position over conventional instrumentation.2,3 The computer relies on the registration of anatomic landmarks and interprets this data to create a three-dimensional (3D) virtual model of the knee. Refinements in the process of collecting the landmark data will create a more accurate virtual model and guidance system. The ideal system should be simple to use, accurate, and reliable without interfering with the operative field and should serve as an enabler in the limited operative field, reliably reporting the knee alignment and intraoperative kinematics.4"

Meanwhile, minimally invasive surgery (MIS-TKA) has been attempted recently, but there are some issues to realize the acceptable machining precision. To achieve the accurate MIS-TKA, the authors have developed the robot-assisted MIS-TKA system. One of the difficulties to achieve robot-assisted MIS-TKA is the decision of incision location. It is difficult to determine the optimal incision location for the robotic system and that cause the incision many times and longer the surgical time. In this study a system is proposed to present the optimal incision location before the actual incision and the efficiency is evaluated. The experiments with pig leg and model bone showed that the incision length could be less than 80 mm and the experiments were completed with 45 minutes from leg fixation to bone cutting."
pub.1163029916,Chapter 6 Failure of total hip arthroplasty (THA): State of the art,"This chapter deals with rehabilitation robotics, particularly hip prosthesis. It includes a state of the art on hip joint prostheses and their failure. The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint that connects the femoral head to the pelvic socket of the joint. Because these structures are closely interlocked, the hip is naturally stable. The hip joint is subject to trauma and primary or secondary osteoarthritis (vascular necrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, posttraumatic and congenital deformities, etc.), which leads to the replacement of the failing joint with an artificial joint, defined as a total hip replacement (THR). A THR mainly consists of a femoral head and a stem, an acetabular cup, and, in some cases, a reinforcement element. The average life span of a THR is 15–20 years. However, despite the careful selection of the prosthesis and the prescribed postoperative rehabilitation steps, problems of failure of this joint are encountered. These failures include joint wear, loosening, implant fractures, and dislocation. The objective of this chapter is to present the state of the art on THA failures based on clinical experiences at orthopedic centers."
pub.1163077648,Evaluation of radiologic predisposing factors for greater trochanteric pain syndrome,"Objectives: Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is one of the causes of lateral hip pain. We aimed to determine the significance of certain anatomical parameters related to GTPS in imaging tests. Methods: Data of patients who were treated with glucocorticoid injection for trochanteric bursitis in our clinic between July 2019 and July 2022 for GTPS were analyzed. The control group was constituted of patients without GTPS but with hip and spinal problems who had pelvic computerized tomography (CT) images and undergone robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty. Standard anteroposterior pelvic radiograms, pelvic CTs, or magnetic resonance images were evaluated for anatomical parameters. Results: Among anatomical parameters, acetabular anteversion, length of trochanter major, and abductor index were significantly different between the patients with and without GTPS. Although mean age was different between the GTPS and control patient groups, age was not found to be correlated with any anatomical parameter. Abductor lever arm length ( p = 0.001) and abductor index ( p = 0.009) were found to be correlated. Conclusions: The length of trochanter major and abductor index were shown to be predisposing anatomical parameters for GTPS."
pub.1181837896,Does Robotic Surgical Assistant (ROSA) Functionally Aligned TKA Lead to Higher Satisfaction Than Conventional Mechanically Aligned TKA: A Propensity-Matched Pair Analysis,"Objectives Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the established treatment for severe knee osteoarthritis, with robotic-assisted TKA (rTKA) proposed to enhance surgical precision and potentially improve outcomes. This study investigates whether functionally-aligned rTKA using the ROSA Knee System results in superior functional outcomes and patient satisfaction compared to conventional mechanically aligned TKA (mTKA). Methods We conducted a retrospective, propensity-score matched cohort study including 154 patients (46 rTKA, 108 mTKA) who underwent primary TKA by a single surgeon from October 2020 to October 2023. Functionally-aligned (FA) rTKA was performed using the ROSA Knee System. Patients were assessed using the Short-Form 36 (SF36), Knee Society Knee Score (KSKS), Knee Society Function Score (KSFS), and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. Immediate postoperative outcomes such as pain at rest and movement, ambulation distance, and range of motion were measured. Statistical analysis evaluated results at a 95% confidence interval, with significance at P <0.05. Results No significant differences were observed in immediate postoperative pain at rest (P = 0.988), pain during movement (P = 0.634), ambulation distance (P = 0.243), and range of motion (P = 0.752) between the groups. At 6 months, there were no significant differences between rTKA and mTKA in achieving the minimal clinically important difference for SF36 (P = 0.996), KSKS (P = 0.150), KSFS (P = 0.091), and OKS (P = 0.949). No significant differences were noted for satisfaction levels (P = 0.315) and fulfilled expectations (P = 0.557) between both groups. Conclusions At 6 months postoperatively, FA rTKA demonstrated equivalent outcomes and satisfaction levels compared to mTKA. Future research should focus on examining longer-term follow-up outcomes, quantifying gap balance in MA mTKA to allow direct comparison with rTKA and studying alternative personalised alignment rTKA strategies to enhance patient outcomes."
pub.1122138895,Does the Use of a CT Based 3D Plan Improve Joint Balancing in Total Knee Arthroplasty? A Multi-Center Study,"Studies have shown that dissatisfaction following TKA may stem from poor component placement and iatrogenic factors related to variability in surgical execution. A CT-based robotic assisted system allows surgeons to dynamically balance the joint prior to bone resection.  This study aimed to determine if this system could improve TKA planning, reduce soft tissue releases, minimize bone resection, and accurately predict component size.
                  Six hundred and sixty-six cases undergoing primary robotic assisted TKA we enrolled in a prospective, multicenter study. Seven surgeons participated from seven US centers. Patient demographics and intraoperative surgical details were collected. Initial and final 3-dimensional alignment, component position, bone resection depths, use of soft tissue releases, knee balancing gaps, and component size were collected intraoperatively. Descriptive statistics were applied to determine the changes in these parameters between initial and final values.
                  In this study, 513 varus knees, 86 valgus knees, and 26 neutral knees were captured and stratified for analysis. Native deformity ranged from 12 degrees of valgus to 19 degrees of varus. 85% of all patients in this study did not require a soft tissue release. Complex deformities who required a soft tissue release were corrected on average to 3.36 degrees while cases without releases were corrected to 1.1 degree on average. All surgeons achieved their planned sizes on the tibia and femur more than 97.5% of the time within one size, and 100% of the time within two sizes. Flexion and extension gaps during knee balancing were within 2mm (mean 1mm) for all knees.
                  New tools may allow for enhanced execution and predictable balance for TKA, which may improve patient outcomes. In this study, preoperative planning via CT scan allowed surgeons to assess bony deformities and subtly adjust component position to reduce soft tissue trauma. Patient follow up is needed to determine clinical outcomes."
pub.1174916620,"MATCHING THE OTHER SIDE: RADIOLOGICAL VARIABILITY IN STAGED, BILATERAL TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY","The purpose of this study was to assess the variability in implant position between sides in patients who underwent staged, bilateral THA and whether variation from one side to the other affected patient-reported outcomes. A retrospective review was conducted on 207 patients who underwent staged, bilateral THA by the same surgeon from 2017–2022. Leg length, acetabular height, cup version, and coronal and sagittal stem angles were assessed radiographically and compared to the contralateral THA. Surgical approach and technology utilization were further assessed for their impact on variability. Linear regression was used to model the relationship between side-to-side variability and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS). Between sides, mean radiographic leg length varied by 4.6mm (0.0–21.2), acetabular height varied by 3.3mm (0.0–13.7), anteversion varied by 8.2° (0.0 to 28.7), coronal stem alignment varied by 1.1° (0.0 to 6.9), and sagittal angulation varied by 2.3° (0.0 to 10.5). The anterior approach resulted in more variability in stem angle position in both the coronal (1.3° vs. 1.0°, p=0.036) and sagittal planes (2.8° vs. 2.0° p=0.012) compared to the posterior approach. The posterior approach generally led to more anteversion than the anterior approach. Use of robotics or navigation for acetabular positioning did not increase side-to-side variability in cup-related position or leg length. Despite considerable side-to-side variability, Hip dysfunction and osteoarthritis outcome scores (HOOS JR) were not affected by higher levels of position inconsistency. Staged, bilateral THA results in considerable variability in component position between sides. The anterior approach leads to more side-to-side variability in sagittal stem angle and cup anteversion than the posterior approach. Navigation and robotics do not improve the consistency of component position in bilateral THA. Variation in implant position was not associated with differences in PROMs, suggesting that despite variability, patients can tolerate these differences between sides."
pub.1064093924,Effect of Subtalar Arthrodesis on Gait Kinematics in the Setting of Total Ankle Arthroplasty," Category: Ankle Arthritis   Introduction/Purpose: Patients undergoing total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) often have symptomatic adjacent joint arthritis and deformity. Adjunctive procedures are frequently indicated in this setting in an attempt to ensure a stable and plantigrade ankle and hindfoot postoperatively. Although subtalar arthrodesis can effectively address a degenerative hindfoot, it may also place abnormal stress on the TAA, leading to premature failure. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of subtalar arthrodesis on TAA and adjacent joint kinematics using cadaveric gait simulation. We hypothesized that differences in ankle and talonavicular joint kinematics would be observed between TAA specimens with and without subtalar arthrodesis.   Methods: Three mid-tibia cadaveric specimens (all female, average age at death: 48) with neutral foot alignment and no history of lower extremity trauma or surgery were tested in a robotic gait simulator. Each tibia was secured to a static mounting fixture about a six-degree of freedom robotic platform (Figure 1A). During simulations, a force plate was moved relative to the stationary specimen through an inverse tibial kinematic path based on standardized in vivo data. Salto Talaris total ankle prostheses were implanted (Tornier, Inc., Bloomington, MN) by a foot and ankle fellowship trained orthopaedic surgeon. Gait simulation was then performed. Each specimen then underwent in situ subtalar arthrodesis via fluoroscopically guided screw placement and subsequent gait analysis. The kinematics of TAA and TAA with subtalar arthrodesis during simulated walking were then compared using two-tailed, paired Student’s t-tests with an alpha value set at p = 0.05.   Results: Analyses revealed that kinematics differed between specimens with TAA and those with TAA and subtalar arthrodesis (Figure 1B). During mid-stance, less ankle plantarflexion was observed in specimens with TAA and subtalar arthrodesis, as compared to those with isolated TAA. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). With regard to axial motion in the ankle, significantly less external rotation was observed in early and mid-stance in specimens with TAA + subtalar arthrodesis (p < 0.05). Talonavicular kinematics also differed between cohorts (Figure 1B). In early and late stance, significantly decreased inversion was observed in specimens with subtalar arthrodesis (p < 0.05). And in early stance, talonavicular joint adduction was significantly diminished in the TAA + subtalar arthrodesis specimens, as compared to those with isolated TAA (p < 0.05).   Conclusion: Via cadaveric gait simulation, our study describes the kinematic effects of subtalar arthrodesis on TAA. When TAA is performed in the setting of subtalar arthrodesis, both ankle sagittal and axial plane motion are altered, as are coronal and axial plane motion in the talonavicular joint. Because current clinical literature remains inconclusive on this relati"

pub.1170323750,Computer-based pre- and intra-operative planning modalities for Total Knee Arthroplasty: A comprehensive review," Introduction Since the introduction of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) into modern medicine, many types of digital pre- and intra-operative planning methods have been introduced. Due to the abundance of planning modalities for TKA, physicians are posed with the challenge of which type to implement into their daily practice. In the current fast-paced and research-driven medical environment it is important to understand the differences between the computer-based pre- and intra-operative planning modalities for TKA.   Materials and methods The following databases were searched: MedLine, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. All articles were independently reviewed by the two reviewers (DS, ID). The following data were extracted, if available: study ID, country of conduction, type of planning modality or modalities, and the use and explanation of historical and currently employed pre- and intra-operative planning modalities for TKA.   Results 39 studies were included into the systematic review. Computer assisted surgery (CAS) represents a surgical concept where computer technology is used for surgical planning. CAS for TKA was introduced in the late 1980s. Subsequently, three different types of CAS were developed to plan TKA. The first type of CAS, computer integrated instruments, also known as CAS navigation, provides a real-time view of anatomy and marked surgical instruments intra-operatively. For the second type of CAS, rapid prototyping, or 3D printing, was derived from CAS technology in which the development of patient specific instrumentation (PSI) for TKA followed. Furthermore, CAS aided the evolution of the third type of CAS for TKA: robotics.   Conclusion With a high demand for TKA surgery, the challenge to achieve more accurate alignment, improved prosthesis survival, and improved patient satisfaction rates is a very topical one. Planning modalities for TKA were developed to address this demand. This comprehensive systematic review showed that the monumental development of digital planning modalities for TKA has led to a vast amount of well-researched options that surgeons can choose from and use in daily practice.

The distinction between low grade typical carcinoid from atypical carcinoid depends on mitotic count and presence of punctate necrosis.Case presentationThe patient is a 60year old female with past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, gastrointestinal reflux disease and cervical myelopathy. An incidental right upper lobe nodule was discovered during hospitalization for post-total knee arthroplasty sepsis. Follow-up CT and PET scans demonstrated size stability with mild hypermetabolic activity. The tumor was excised by a robotic thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. A lobulated, tan-yellow, well demarcated firm mass, measuring 1.2×1×1cm was grossly identified. Microscopically, the well circumscribed mass demonstrated near complete infarct-like central necrosis with a peripheral viable cellular rim consisting of nests of tumor cells that stained positively with TTF-1, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, and CD56; and was negative for calcitonin and monoclonal CEA. The mitotic figure count was negligible and met the WHO criteria for typical carcinoid. The proliferative index (Ki-67) was slightly high at 9.29%.DiscussionThe unusual central necrosis seen in the tumor and the relatively high proliferative index created a pathological diagnostic dilemma discussed in this report."

Les 20 % de mauvais résultats pourraient être expliqués par la technique d’alignement utilisée pour la mise en place des implants, pouvant influencer la cinématique fémoro-patellaire. L’objectif de notre étude était de montrer que l’utilisation de l’alignement cinématique inversé permettait d’obtenir des scores cliniques et radiologiques rotuliens satisfaisants dans les PTG robotisées. Hypothèse La technique d’alignement cinématique inversé couplée à la chirurgie robotisée permettait de restituer la cinématique native de la rotule. Matériels et méthodes Il s’agissait d’une étude prospective incluant 100 PTG bénéficiant d’une PTG de première intention réalisée avec le système de chirurgie robotisée Stryker MAKO, en utilisant la technique d’alignement cinématique inversé. Les patients ayant bénéficié d’un resurfaçage de la rotule étaient exclus. Les scores cliniques et radiologiques ont été consignés en préopératoire et à 1 an postopératoire.

pub.1032953939,Computer-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery (CAOS): Pros and Cons,"Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS) has recently evolved as an important technical application that has offered substantial improvements over conventional instrumented methods. The possibility of using computers in total joint replacement surgery is not a recent discovery, as Bargar and Paul introduced the first successful robotic application for total hips in 1987.1 Their system was a development effort with IBM, which had identified a considerable research program to apply robotics to medicine. Perhaps the most significant discovery at the time was to refine digital software algorithms to the level of “pixel accuracy” (20–30 μm). This was required for the machining of custom total hip femoral implants that were implanted at that time. The next years of evolution occurred in Europe, where computer algorithms were advanced to allow intraoperative registration, removing the need for preoperative fiducial placement. DiGioia and Jaramaz developed the first computed tomography (CT) system that could be applied for navigation of the acetabular component.2 Actually, this approach was a step backward because the complex robot was not needed. Imageless total knee applications were an even simpler method because preoperative images were no longer needed.From a purely scientific point of view, the proof of these systems for increasing surgical precision and presumed benefit has been straightforward. The literature that I will outline clearly indicates the benefit of computer-assisted techniques over conventional instrumentation. Even in imageless total hip applications with lesser accuracy, computer-assisted surgery (CAS) provides a statistical improvement over conventional techniques from most studies. In this chapter, I offer a broad overview of the current state of the art. As with minimally invasive surgery (MIS), there are a group of early advocates who may offer a more enthusiastic viewpoint. As demonstrated, I will describe my current experience and research, which would question some of the claims regarding electromagnetic applications and imageless total hip applications, for example. However, this technology is a moving target, and improvements are being developed as we speak."
pub.1122138827,The Learning Curve and Alignment Assessment of an Image-Free Handheld Robot in TKA: The First Patient Series in Europe,"BACKGROUND: The typical goal of TKA is to obtain a neutral mechanical axis of the leg. The NAVIO® Surgical System (Smith & Nephew, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) is aimed at reducing technical errors and outliers. The aim of this study is to assess the surgeons’ learning curve and limb alignment in TKA.
                  METHODS:
                  The first sixty-nine patients who underwent TKA with the NAVIO system by two experienced surgeons were included in this study. Pre- and postoperative mechanical limb alignment and balancing was measured by the NAVIO system. Registration time,  planning time and cutting time was monitored preoperatively by the NAVIO™ system. All data was analyzed retrospectively.
                  RESULTS:
                  The mean preoperative mechanical limb alignment was 3.18° varus (SD 4.28°, range 15.08° varus to 4.30° of valgus). The mean intraoperative planned angle was 0.59° varus (SD 0.97°, range 2.50° varus to 0.99° valgus). The mean postoperative alignment was 1.17° varus (SD 1.78°, range 4.52° varus to 4.33° valgus.  The mean extra surgical time (EST) for registration and planning decreased from 23.4min (SD 3.7min) to 13.2min (SD 2.0) throughout the learning curve with a range of 10min05sec to 28min19sec.CONCLUSION: The NAVIO robotic system is a valuable tool in assisting total knee arthroplasty. It allows the surgeon to accurately determine optimal implant position for each patient and minimize statistical outliers in alignment."
pub.1167628934,Clinical efficacy of robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"Objective  To explore the impact of robot assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) on the accuracy of prosthesis placement and its clinical efficacy.   Methods  A total of 432 patients (549 hips) who underwent robot-assisted primary THA for various diseases of the hip in the Department of Orthopaedics of the Fourth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital from August 2018 to October 2022 was retrospectively analyzed. There were 174 male and 258 female with an average age of 54.2±12.7 years old and body mass index (BMI) of 23.2±4.3 kg/m 2 . There were 301 left hips and 248 right hips. All patients were operated under general anesthesia using the standard posterior lateral surgical approach to THA. The Harris hip score (HHS), forgotten joint score (FJS), the Western Ontario and McMaster University (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index and patient satisfaction were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes. The anterior inclination, abduction angle, lower extremity discrepancy and the position of the center of rotation (COR) of the hip joint were radiographically accessed preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively. The composition ratio of the acetabular cup in the safe zone was also calculated.   Results  Five hundred and forty-nine consecutive hips (432 patients) underwent robotic-assisted THA with a mean follow-up of 23.6±16.2 months. The mean operative time was 86.2±35.4 min, and the mean blood loss was 236.7±94.5 ml. At the last follow-up, the mean HHS score for this group was 91.4±15.4, the WOMAC score was 8.4±6.5, the FJS score was 77.4±23.4, and the satisfaction score was 9.1±2.7 points. The mean postoperative measurement of acetabular cup anteversion was 21.2°±4.8° and abduction was 40.8°±4.3°. About 93.7% (511 patients) had an acetabular cup within the safety zone of ±10° of the target angle, and 84.6% (464 patients) had an acetabular cup within the safety zone of ±5° of the target angle. A total of 4 complications occurred. Acute periprosthesis infection happened in a case of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and was cured by DAIR (debridement, antibiotics, irrigation, retention of prosthesis). One case of thigh pain of unknown reason was treated with a revision operation, during which no loosening or malposition of the prosthesis was found. After replacing the femoral head component no pain was complained by the patient. One case of hematoma and nerve compression was considered to be caused by blood vessels injury when a titanium cable was used to fix the distal femoral fracture during the surgery. The nerve injury returned to normal within 1 month. One case of dislocation happened immediately after surgery and was revised by replacing a different head. The patient was fully recovered. In addition to software and mechanical failures of the robot itself, complex hip joint diseases would be a risk factor for the termination of robot assisted surgery due to the occurrence of adverse events related to robots in 16 hips.

Data was collected over a four-year comprehensive therapy process involving treatment periods, during which the patient was under the care of an interdisciplinary team and participated in an individualized rehabilitation program, consisting of 3-4 hours of physical therapy daily for 5-6 days per week. The material included results from functional tests, muscle tone assessments, and balance evaluations. Numerical data from robotic gait therapy devices were also considered. With the consent of the patient and his family, the therapy process was documented via video recordings and photographs, which were then used for a retrospective visual analysis of recorded material at various stages of rehabilitation. For this purpose, the ShapeCare.Fizjo device was used, along with Blaze Pose software, based on a moving person’s skeletal detection model. The results indicated that comprehensive therapy using innovative tools such as C-eye, ReoGo, ReoAmbulator, and LeviActive system improved the patient’s balance and motor skills, as well as facilitated the gait re-education process. The use of modern technologies in neurorehabilitation not only optimizes therapeutic outcomes but also reduces the risk of musculoskeletal strain for the therapist during their professional work."
pub.1170025344,Genu Recurvatum in Total Knee Arthorplasty: A Review,"Abstract Genu recurvatum is a rare knee deformity that can be linked with osteoarthritis. The main causes of this deformity include neuromuscular disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, inverted tibial slope, or conditions associated with coronal deformities such as genu valgum. In cases of end-stage knee osteoarthritis, total knee arthroplasty is the indicated management to reduce pain and improve functionality and quality of life. Genu recurvatum is associated with an imbalance in the flexion and extension gaps, which is why it is necessary to have important considerations in the preoperative evaluation, implant selection, and surgical technique. We conducted a review in electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS from 1990 to June 28, 2023. Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-four literature sources were included to address our inquiries. Results are presented in a narrative format, focusing on the design and study population for each specific research question. Genu recurvatum is a rare knee deformity which needs special considerations. Accurate assessment of the deformity magnitude and quadriceps weakness is crucial during the preoperative evaluation. The choice of implant should be tailored to the individual patient’s characteristics. Surgical technique plays a critical role in achieving soft tissue and gap balance. Literature highlights an increased incidence of complications associated with this deformity, particularly in cases of poliomyelitis. Navigation and robotics offer promising alternatives to enhance surgical precision and appear to show a lower recurrence rate."
pub.1168804569,Digitale Trainingskonzepte in der Knieendoprothetik,"BackgroundIn recent years, there has been a substantial shift from conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery with mechanical alignment towards a digital, patient-specific technique. These changes have led to specific challenges including surgeon training. In this paper, modern training concepts in general and experiences with simulator training, in particular, are presented.Material and methodsIn the last 3 years, more than 20 training courses with more than 300 surgeons have been performed using a knee simulator. This simulator allows training of all modern alignment philosophies on 200 patient datasets. Fully automatic evaluation and a comparison function are based on specific algorithms. Results of some courses have been evaluated and presented.ResultsIndependent of surgical experience of the trainees, an improvement on decision quality and efficiency could be measured for all groups. Trainees reported that this simulator training has positively supported their transition towards digital surgery and modern alignment philosophies.DiscussionDigital surgical techniques and patient-specific alignment philosophies can be successfully trained with the help of this knee simulator. This leads to an improvement of quality, efficiency, and surgeon satisfaction. Based on these results, digital education tools seem to be a promising option allowing a successful transition from conventional mechanical TKA surgery to digital, patient-specific techniques. Thus, simulator training can be seen as a useful addition to classical surgical training."
pub.1025307805,Erste Ergebnisse der roboterassistierten Kniegelenkendoprothetik mit dem ROBODOC®-System,"A surgical robot (ROBODOC) is now available for use in total knee replacement surgery. The outcome of conventional total knee replacement has always depended heavily on the individual surgeon’s skill and routine. The robotic system permits three-dimensional preoperative planning leading to selection of the correct axis and rotation and also the correct implant size. The intraoperative cutting is executed entirely by the surgical robot according to the preoperative planning. The accurate cut surfaces mean that the cement-free technique can be used for implantation of both the tibial and the femoral components in the majority of cases. The patients are permitted full weight-bearing immediately after the operation. Correct alignment and rotation are known to be essential for durability of the implants in total knee replacement. Our preliminary results show that this goal can be achieved using the system; the outcome is highly consistent. The system still has some disadvantages insofar as the soft tissue management, including ligament balancing, cannot be planned preoperatively, the leg has to be fixated in a rigid position and pins (markers) are still necessary. These disadvantages will be overcome in the near future when a special navigation system (ROBONAV) is integrated into the ROBODOC system."

One of the first teams who worked on CAS UKA were Davies B. & Cobb J. et al. at the Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, where they designed the Acrobot® system. The premise of implementing this technology was to consistently perform accurate partial knee replacements using this first image-based controlled robotic system.UKR remains a challenging surgical procedure and mid-/long-term results are highly dependent on correct implant position and alignment. UKR is a perfect indication for CAS as small intra-operative mistakes may rapidly compromise patient functional outcomes, implant survival and require early revision.At the beginning of this century, orthopaedic companies working with CAS developed navigation system solutions for UKR. The purpose of this chapter is to review the use of navigation in UKR which offered the promise of reducing implant malalignment and malposition and consequently improving functional outcomes and long-term component survival.We reviewed the principles and surgical details of commercially available navigation systems, and then looked at the results of navigated UKA and discussed the pros and cons of this technology as well as its place in the computer-assisted surgical toolbox. Finally, we concluded with what we can deduce from the current literature."

Despite enhanced recovery protocols (ERP) and procedure specific pain therapy up to 80% of patients experience significant uncontrolled pain. Aim of this quality control pain audit was assessing pain intensity in institutional developed multimodal perioperative care pathways. Analyses of efficacy locoregional analgesia, management and protocol adherence. Determine possible improvements of guidelines and procedures Prospective data were collected on 118 patients undergoing six types of surgery. Pain scores were evaluated on postoperative care unit (PACU) and first five days following surgery. Primary outcome was worst recorded pain score. Secondary outcomes included median pain on ward, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, time to first mobilization. Following procedures were included: minimal invasive cardiac surgery, video assisted thoracic surgery, esophageal resection, total knee arthroplasty, laparoscopic colorectal surgery and robotic prostatectomy. Numeric Rating Scale higher then three was observed in 89% of study population. At PACU esophageal resection showed worst pain scores despite neuraxial analgesia (Median: 7, IQR 5-8). Total knee arthoplasty resulted in worst pain scores on ward following surgery (median: 7, IQR 5-8). Disappointingly only 25% of patients received pain medication following institutional ERP guidelines. Current ERP-guideline are similar to ERAS guidelines found in literature.

pub.1095447384,Cooperative Force Control of a Knee Surgical Robot for Lateral Milling of Bone,"Robotic knee surgery performs bone resection without relying on mechanical jigs during bone preparation of TKA (Total Knee Arthroplasty). The inaccuracy induced by loose jig fixation and slot width tolerance can, subsequently, be avoided. Mill is usually used as the bone cutter in most of the current knee surgical robots, in which all bones are milled out. This might not be desired. In some cases, the cut bone may be used by the surgeon for bone grafting for some patients. Therefore the existent bone resection method may not be adequate. Different scenarios of bone resection in order to preserve the cut-off bones to be in pieces should be developed. In the proposed cutting process, the side edge instead of the bottom edge of the mill is used to move and cut the bone along the designated boundary of the cutting plane. Thus cut-off bone is in the form of pieces rather than blurs or chips. However, this cutting process will give rise to large and non-uniform cut forces on the cutter. As a result, the cutter is under large bending and the cutting trajectory may be deviated or, even worse, the cutter may be broken. To overcome the problem, the paper proposed an cooperative impedance force control strategy between the robot and the surgeon to maintain the safety, stability and accuracy of bone resection process."

When the rotator cuff is intact, the goal is to restore the bony anatomy by repositioning the center of rotation of the humerus in its original position and avoiding any displacement of the gleno-humeral joint offset. Non constrained anatomical prostheses are those which reply best to these requirements. Humeral head resurfacing prostheses also permit to place the humeral rotation center in its original position, but they do not allow the resurfacing of the glenoid. Fracture prostheses are low profile implants which allow the correct positioning of tuberosities and the addition of a bone graft. Reverse prostheses, by medializing the center of rotation and lowering the humerus, render possible for the deltoid alone to provide the active elevation of the arm despite rotator cuff deficiency. While the non cemented glenoid of reverse prostheses stays well fixed due to compression forces, glenoid resurfacing implants, whether cemented or not, are exposed to shearing forces which are detrimental to its fixation. Current works are directed towards the improvement of the fixation of anatomical glenoid implants and towards the search of new friction surfaces. The development of universal implants (anatomical and reverse), as well as the improvement of implant positioning by way of robotics and navigation are the current big projects and the source of progress in a near future."
pub.1156160296,EARLY OUTCOMES AFTER ADOPTION OF THE DIRECT ANTERIOR APPROACH FOR TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY,"Our unit historically performed total hip replacement (THR) through either posterior or anterolateral approaches. In November 2020 a group of 5 consultants transitioned to utilising the Direct Anterior Approach (DAA). Appropriate training was undertaken and cases were performed as dual consultant procedures with intraoperative radiography or robotic assistance.
                  Outcomes were collated prospectively. These included basic demographics, intraoperative details, complication rates and Oxford Hip Scores.
                  A total of 48 patients underwent DAA THR over 1 year. Mean age was 67 and ASA 2. Over this time period 140 posterior approach and 137 anterolateral approach THR's were performed with available data. Propensity score matching was performed on a 1:1 basis using BMI, Age, Sex and ASA as covariates to generate a matched cohort group of conventional approach THR (n=37)
                  Length of stay was significantly reduced at 1.95 days (p<0.001) with DAA compared to Anterolateral and Posterior approach. There was no significant difference with length of surgery, blood loss, Infection, dislocation and periprosthetic fracture rate. There was no significant difference in Oxford Hip Score between any approach at 3 months or 1 year.
                  The transition to this approach has not made a negative impact despite its associated steep learning curve, and has improved efficiency in elective surgery. From our experience we would suggest those changing to this approach receive appropriate training in a high-volume centre, and perform cases as dual consultant procedures."
pub.1052623181,Biomechanics in Orthopedics,"A major part of orthopedics is the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases caused by structural disorders and mechanical breakdown of living tissue. Therefore, biomechanical consideration of static structures and dynamic mechanisms is compulsory for both diagnosis and treatment of orthopedic diseases. Previous biomechanical studies have enabled great advances in orthopedic implant technology, such as artificial joint replacement and instrumentation for spinal fusion. Consequently the importance of biomechanics is increasing more and more in daily clinical practice and development. In addition, biomaterial research into mechanical properties and tissue reactions of implant materials is certainly an important area of related study. This book is comprised of 22 papers presented at the International Seminar on Biomechanics in Orthopedics and the 17th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society for Orthopedic Biomechanics, held in Nagoya in 1990. The volume contains full descriptions of both conventional and updated knowledge of the spine, ligaments, artificial joint replacement in the hip and knee, fracture treatment, and gait analysis, as well as biomaterials. I earnestly hope that this book will be of benefit to readers in daily clinical work and research. To close, I would like to thank profoundly the two coeditors, Prof. S.M. Perren and Mr. T. Hattori, and also a quiet supporter Mrs. J. Buchanan in Davos, for their cooperation in producing this book."
pub.1052451175,Computer-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery,"Orthopedic surgeons treat musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis, scoliosis, and trauma, which collectively affect hundreds of millions of people and are the leading cause of pain and disability. In this chapter, the main technical developments related to computer-assisted surgery (CAS) in several key areas of orthopedic surgery are reviewed: hip and knee replacements, spine surgery, and fracture repair. We also assess the evaluations of these systems performed to date, with a particular focus on the value proposition that CAS needs to deliver in order for it to become widely accepted. This means it must demonstrate better performance, less operating room time, and reduced costs. We describe several systems for both hip and knee replacement that are based on computed tomographic (CT) images, intraoperative fluoroscopy, or image-free kinematic techniques, and in each domain consider both manual and robotic systems. Future work in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery will include efforts to develop newer technologies such as 3D ultrasound and ever less invasive procedures, but it must also concentrate on improving operative workflow, to transfer the benefits of improved accuracy to nonspecialist orthopedic surgeons working in community hospitals, where the case volumes are lower than in specialized centers. Linkages between improved accuracy during surgery and improved functional outcomes for the patients must be demonstrated for these technologies to be widely accepted."
pub.1153584541,An audit on the accuracy of freehand acetabular cup positioning in total hip arthroplasty with the direct lateral approach at a tertiary institution over seven years,"BACKGROUND: The direct lateral approach for total hip replacement has been traditionally reserved and described for neck of femur fractures. Advantages of this approach include technically easy access to the acetabulum and femur and low incidence of hip dislocation. Imperfect positioning of the acetabular component leads to increased risk for dislocations, accelerated wear, reduced range of motion and increased revision rate. Freehand technique has been the gold standard for many decades, but newer technologies like computer navigation and robotic-assisted surgery have shown to improve the accuracy of cup placement. This study reports on the accuracy of freehand cup positioning via the direct lateral approach with mention of the dislocation rate METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 253 patients who had total hip replacements done via the direct lateral approach. The patients' files were evaluated for patient parameters, demographic details, aetiology of hip pathology, confirmation of approach used, comorbidities and history of previous relevant surgery. The postoperative radiographs were analysed for acetabular component position inclination and anteversion. Dislocation rates were calculated as a secondary objective RESULTS: The radiographic analysis was performed using the Liaw method based on trigonometry of the eclipse generated. This showed a mean cup inclination of 42.3° (95% CI: 41.3-43.3°) and anteversion of 12.7° (95% CI: 12.0-13.7°). A total of 57% of the acetabular cups were within the safe zones described by Lewinnek. Of them, 78% were in the 30-50° range for inclination and 73% in the 5-25° range for anteversion. There were ten dislocations within one year from the index procedure: a dislocation rate of 4.0% (95% CI: 2.8-8.5% CONCLUSION: The freehand technique using the direct lateral approach for acetabular cup placement produces a poor overall accuracy of only 57%. Although our study only commented on ten dislocations, the rate (4%) is significantly worse compared to the 0.43% reported in literature for the direct lateral approach. The radiographic results for inclination and anteversion are comparable to other freehand techniques, regardless of the approach used, but significantly worse than results achieved with navigation and robotics Level of evidence: Level 4"
pub.1146533502,A Direct Referencing Method of the Tibial Plateau for the Posterior Tibial Slope in Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty,"<h2>Purpose</h2> <p>There is no consensus on intraoperative references for the posterior tibial slope (PTS) in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). An arthroscopic hook probe placed on the medial second quarter of the medial tibial plateau (MTP) in an anteroposterior direction may be used as a direct anatomical reference for the PTS. The purpose of this study is to investigate availability and accuracy of this method.</p><h2>Methods</h2> <p>Marginal osteophyte formation and subchondral depression of the MTP, and angles between the bony MTP and the cartilage MTP were retrospectively evaluated using preoperative sagittal MRI of 73 knees undergoing medial UKA. In another 36 knees, intraoperative lateral knee radiographs with the probe placed on the MTP were prospectively taken in addition to the preoperative MRI. Then, angles between the bony MTP and the probe axis and angles between the preoperative bony MTP and the postoperative implant MTP were measured.</p><h2>Results</h2> <p>Among 73 knees, one knee with Grade 4 osteoarthritis had a posterior osteophyte higher than the most prominent point of the cartilage MTP. No subchondral depression affected the direct reference of the MTP. Mean angle between the bony MTP and the cartilage MTP was &minus;&thinsp;0.8&deg;&plusmn;0.7&deg; (-2.6&deg;-1.0&deg;, n&thinsp;=&thinsp;72), excluding the one knee with &ldquo;high&rdquo; osteophyte. Mean angle between the bony MTP and the probe axis on the intraoperative radiograph was &minus;&thinsp;0.6&deg;&plusmn;0.4&deg; (-1.7-0.0, n&thinsp;=&thinsp;36). Mean angle between the pre- and the postoperative MTP was &minus;&thinsp;0.5&deg;&plusmn;1.5&deg; (-2.9&deg;-1.8&deg;). Root mean square (RMS) error of these two PTS angles was 1.6&deg; with this method.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Cartilage remnants, osteophyte formation and subchondral bone depression does not affect the direct referencing method in almost all knees for which medial UKA is indicated. When the posterior &ldquo;high&rdquo; osteophyte of the MTP is noted on preoperative radiograph, preoperative MRI or CT scan is recommended to confirm no &ldquo;high&rdquo; osteophyte on the medial second quarter. Accuracy of this method seems equal to that of the robotic-assisted surgery (the RMS error in previous reports, 1.6&deg;-1.9&deg;).</p>"
pub.1137845090,A Prospective Randomised Control Trial Comparing Functional with Mechanical Axis Alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty: study protocol for an investigator initiated trial,"<p><strong>Background</strong>: A drive to improve functional outcomes for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has led to alternative alignment being used. Functional alignment (FA) uses intraoperative soft tissue tension to determine the optimal position of the prosthesis within the patients soft tissue envelope. Angular limits for bone resections are followed to prevent long term prosthesis failure. This study will use the aid of robotic assistance to plan and implement the final prosthesis position. This method has yet to be compared to the traditional mechanically aligned (MA) knee in a randomised trial. </p><p><strong>Methods</strong>: A blinded randomised control trial with 100 patients will be undertaken via Perth Hip and Knee clinic. Fifty patients will undergo a MA TKA and fifty will undergo a FA TKA. Both alignment techniques will be balanced via computer assisted navigation to assess prosthetic gaps, being achieved via the initial bony resection and further soft tissue releases as required to achieve satisfactory balance. The primary outcome will be the forgotten joint score (FJS) two years after surgery, with secondary outcomes being other patient reported outcome measures, clinical functional assessment, radiographic position and complications. Other data that will be collected will be patient demography (Sex, Age, level of activity) and medical information (grade of knee injury, any other relevant medical information). The linear statistical model will be fitted to the response (FJS), including all the other variables as covariates. </p><p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Many surgeons are utilising alternative alignment techniques with a goal of achieving better functional outcomes for their patients. Currently MA TKA remains the gold standard with good outcomes and excellent longevity. There is no published RCTs comparing FA to MA yet and only two registered studies are planned or currently in progress. This study utilizes a FA technique which differs from the two studies. This study will help determine if FA TKA has superior functional results for patients.</p><p><strong>Trial registration</strong>:  This trial has been registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry  (ANZCTR) http://www.anzctr.org.au: U1111-1257-2291, registered 25<sup>th</sup> Jan 2021.

pub.1107095760,Influence of Tibial Component Position on Altered Kinematics Following Total Ankle Arthroplasty During Simulated Gait," Category: Ankle Arthritis   Introduction/Purpose: Correct positioning of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) implants has been associated with superior clinical outcomes. Furthermore, biomechanical studies have demonstrated that poor alignment of the components may lead to early component wear, compromising the longevity of the prosthesis. Malpositioning of TAA implants affects ligament engagement patterns and joint contact mechanics, possibly leading to altered joint kinematics. However, the correlation between implant position and ankle joint motion is still unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of tibial component position on ankle kinematics following TAA during simulated gait.   Methods: Eight mid-tibia cadaveric specimens were utilized in this IRB approved study. The stance phase of gait was simulated both pre- and post-TAA in each specimen using a six-degree of freedom robotic platform. Ground reaction forces and tibial kinematic from in vivo data were replicated while physiologic tendon force profiles were applied to each extrinsic ankle tendons by linear actuators instrumented. Ankle kinematics was measured from reflective markers attached to bones via surgical pins. TAAs were completed using a common fixed-bearing total ankle system following the manufacturer recommended protocol (Salto Talaris, Integra LifeSciences). Using reconstructed CT data, 3D tibial component position relative to a standard ankle joint reference was characterized (Figure 1A). The effect of tibial component position on absolute differences in ankle kinematics (pre – post TAA) was assessed using linear regression with a level of significance set to p = 0.05.   Results: Differences in ankle joint kinematics were only identified in the transverse plane, where internal talar rotation was significantly increased following TAA compared to the native condition (Figure 1B). The medial position of TAA tibial components was found to be positively associated with increased internal talar rotation (Figure 1C; β = 1.861 degrees/mm, R2 = 0.72, p = 0.008). No other measurements of tibial component position (anterior-posterior/inferior-superior position, sagittal/frontal/transverse plane angle) were found to be significantly associated with altered ankle kinematics following TAA (All β < 0.1 and p > 0.05).   Conclusion: This study suggests that medial positioning of the tibial implant affects ankle kinematics. During operative procedures the tibial component is usually positioned in order to preserve bone stock of the medial and lateral malleolus. However, little attention is given to the position of the implant in relation to the center of the tibial axis. This finding could have clinical implications for techniques implemented during surgical procedures and for the development of new instrumentation systems. "
pub.1163100188,TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY IN PATIENTS WITH SKELETAL DYSPLASIA,"Abstract  Introduction Total knee replacement (TKR) in patients with skeletal dysplasia is technically challenging surgery due to deformity, joint contracture, and associated co-morbidities. The aim of this study is to follow up patients with skeletal dysplasia following a TKR.   Methodology We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients with skeletal dysplasia who underwent 31 TKRs at our institution between 2006 and 2022. Clinical notes, operative records and radiographic data were reviewed.   Results Achondroplasia was the most common skeletal dysplasia (8), followed by Chondrodysplasia punctata (7) and Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (5). There were fourteen men and eight women with mean age of 51 years (28 to 73). The average height of patients was 1.4 metres (1.16–1.75) and the mean weight was 64.8 Kg (34.3–100). The mean follow up duration was 68.32 months (1–161). Three patients died during follow up. Custom implants were required in twelve patients (38.71%). Custom jigs were utilised in six patients and two patients underwent robotic assisted surgery. Hinged TKR was used in seventeen patients (54.84%), posterior stabilised TKR in nine patients (29.03%), and cruciate retaining TKR in five patients (16.13%). One patient underwent a patella resurfacing for persistent anterior knee pain and another had an intra-operative medial tibial plateau fracture which was managed with fixation. No revisions occurred during the follow up period.   Conclusion Despite the technical challenges and complexity of TKR within this unique patient group, we demonstrate good implant survivorship during the study period. Cross sectional imaging is recommended preoperatively for precise planning and templating. "
pub.1141240286,Chapter 3 It Is Time to Consider a Philosophical Change From Mechanical to Kinematic Alignment,"This chapter discusses the research that is driving the change in philosophy from mechanical alignment (MA) to kinematic alignment (KA) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The first section discusses the association between MA and patient dissatisfaction after TKA, and how improving satisfaction requires a change in alignment philosophy to one that does not require ligament release. The second section describes the recent discovery of three axes in the knee that determine kinematics and how resurfacing the knee is the only method for coaligning the three axes of the femoral and tibial components to those of the patient’s prearthritic knee. KA can be performed with manual, patient-specific, navigational, and robotic instrumentation; however, intraoperative caliper measurements of bone resections are required to verify that the components are set coincident to the prearthritic joint lines. The third section shows that MA TKA does not restore knee kinematics, because the targets of alignment do not coalign the axes of the components to those of the patient’s prearthritic knee. The fourth section uses evidentiary research to show that calipered KA TKA optimizes implant survival, medial compartment loading, and patellofemoral kinematics when compared with MA TKA. The educational objective is to encourage surgeons to examine their experience with MA TKA and learn about the three kinematic axes that determine knee function. For those interested in improving clinical outcomes, consider performing calipered KA and intraoperatively verifying that the femoral component resurfaces the patient’s prearthritic femur, with their preferred method of instrumentation."
pub.1134257467,An Extramedullary Spacing Block Technique to Restore Native Coronal Limb Alignment in TKA," Background: Historically, the femoral and tibial preparation for a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are executed in isolation and then soft tissue releases are used to obtain a balanced knee. We present the clinical outcomes associated with a novel surgical method that links the tibial and femoral resections, avoids soft tissue releases, is performed extramedullary, and does not require special scans, robotics, or rapid prototype blocks.   Materials and Methods:  We measured hip, knee, ankle alignment radiographs preoperatively and postoperatively on 433 consecutive TKAs performed between November 2016 and August 2019. A new surgical technique called the l inked a nd t ensioned e xtramedullary r esections (LATER technique) for both extension and flexion gap balancing was utilized without any soft tissue releases.    Results: One hundred thirty-four knees were found to have severe malalignment preoperatively (≥10 degrees of varus or valgus deformities). The average angular correction was 12 degrees toward neutral alignment. Of the entire cohort, 89.2% of patients reported being completely or mostly satisfied. Patients reported “a lot of improvement” or “back to normal” (92.3%).   Conclusions: The LATER technique improves coronal alignment following a complex primary TKA. Contemporary TKA can be balanced without ligament releases. The avoidance of intramedullary violation and soft tissue releases decreased intraoperative blood loss and trauma. This technique also avoids the complexities of navigation, the complications associated with fat embolism, and the manufacturing of rapid prototype blocks. The LATER technique of coronally tensioned alignment is simple to use and has excellent patient-reported satisfaction and improvement scores. "
pub.1160629128,Comparison of short-term clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction between robotic-assisted and conventional total hip arthroplasty,"Objective  To compare short-term clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction between robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) and conventional THA.   Methods  Patient data of unilateral primary THA with the same prosthesis by the same operator due to osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and other diseases in Peking University Third Hospital from September 2019 to February 2022 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into robot-assisted THA group and conventional THA group according to surgical methods. The preoperative general data, operation time, intraoperative complications and other intraoperative data were collected. Anteroposterior X-ray of pelvis and cross-table X-ray of hip were taken. Main outcome measures consisted of total blood loss, blood transfusion rate, hospitalization stay, postoperative complications, and the inclination and anteversion angle of the acetabular cup, while the dislocation rate outside the Lewinnek and Callanan safe zone was also analyzed. Other outcomes measures included visual analogue scale, Harris score, quality of life score (QOL) and satisfaction score.   Results  There was no significant difference in gender, age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), operation side, preoperative blood volume and Harris score between the two groups ( P >0.05); Loosening of positioning screws occurred in 2 patients due to osteoporosis in robot-assisted THA group, so conventional THA was performed. Therefore, 84 cases in robot-assisted THA group and 87 cases in conventional THA group were enrolled in this study at last. There was no significant difference in follow-up time between conventional THA group and robot-assisted THA group (19.7±6.8 months vs. 18.6±5.4 months, t =1.16, P =0.249); The operation time of robot-assisted THA group was longer than that of conventional THA group (106.99±31.91 min vs. 73.79±29.48 min, t =7.07, P <0.001), but there was no significant difference in hospitalization stay between conventional THA group and robot-assisted THA group (6.40±2.40 d vs. 6.49±1.95 d, t =0.26, P =0.796). There was also no significant difference in total blood loss and blood transfusion rate between the two groups ( P >0.05). There was no significant difference in inclination angle (38.79°±6.93° vs. 39.41°±3.01°, t =0.58, P =0.449) and anteversion angle (14.81°±6.49° vs. 13.33°±4.32°, t =3.06, P =0.082) between conventional THA group and robot-assisted THA group, while the percentage in Lewinnek safe zone (96.4% vs. 73.6%, χ 2 =15.60, P <0.001) and Callanan safe zone (92.9% vs. 65.5%, χ 2 =17.61, P <0.001) was significantly higher in conventional THA than that of robot-assisted THA. There were no significant differences in postoperative VAS, Harris score and QOL score between the two groups ( P >0.05), but the excellent and good rate of Harris score of conventional THA group was lower than that of robot-assisted THA group (83.91% vs. 95.24%, χ 2 =5.83, P =0.016); The overall satisfaction of p"
pub.1148410041,The Science Behind Computer-Assisted Surgery of the Knee,"Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) is becoming at least an important part of the orthopaedic forum discussion and at most an indispensable component of the surgical toolbox. The recent “robot war” between majors in orthopaedics shows the direction orthopaedics in general and knee arthroplasty in particular is heading towards. The most recently published long-term results confirmed the merits of using technology to accurately and reproducibly performed Total Knee Replacement (TKR). Over the years, evidence has piled up to demonstrate the benefit of this “measuring tool” with which surgeons can take appropriate decisions to the best of their knowledge.At the beginning of the century, CAS made its way in the orthopaedic theatres, sometimes with misfortune linked to enthusiastic start-ups focused more on their business models than designing a “just right” product. This justifiably turned off surgeons who might have been interested by the concept but were scared by the technology and its unreliable features.Twenty-five years later, technology has improved considerably and many systems have considered the crucial required ergonomic aspect of CAS systems. We like technology if it works, and surgeons are not different from the rest of the population on this matter. It seems fundamental today to understand what is behind the technology not only to demystify it but also to use it wisely.The purpose of the chapter is to shed light on the technology so the surgeon can understand exactly what the “non-mysterious numbers” displayed on their monitor screens during computer- or robotic-assisted surgery are."
pub.1122138855,Improved Patient Satisfaction Following TKA Using Intraoperative Computer Technology to Obtain Accurate Gap Balancing,"Aims:
                  Approximately 20% of patients are dissatisfied with their total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  Purpose of this study was to determine if patient satisfaction could be improved following TKA using computer technology to obtain the target alignment and precisely balanced gaps.
                  Patients & Methods:
                  75 consecutive patients undergoing primary robotic-arm assisted TKA (RA-TKA) with real-time intraoperative alignment and gap balancing information were compared with a prospective cohort of 75 consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA with manual jig-based instruments during the same time period.  There were no differences between groups with age, gender, BMI, and ASA scores.   TKA’s were performed by a single surgeon using same implant design, anesthesia and surgical protocols.  Patient satisfaction survey using Knee Society (KSS) and Likert scoring system was obtained at 1-year follow-up.
                  Results:
                  Likert scoring system demonstrated 95% of patients in the computer technology group were either very satisfied or satisfied versus 75% in the manual instruments TKA group (p=0.005) at 1-year follow-up. Second question of the KSS which deals with pain at rest was significantly better in RA-TKA group (p=0.04).  Fifth question which deals with recreational activities was also significantly improved in the RA-TKA group, p=0.02.  RA-TKA group had a better average overall satisfaction score of 7.1 versus 6.4 in the manual instrument group, p=0.03.
                  Conclusion:
                  Using intraoperative computer technology to achieve the target alignment with flexion/extension gap balancing to within 1mm, a significant improvement in patient satisfaction was demonstrated compared to TKA using conventional manual jig-based instruments."
pub.1163100217,NOVEL ROBOTIC TECHNIQUE TO INVESTIGATE TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY STABILITY,"Abstract  Introduction Mid-flexion instability may cause poor outcomes following TKA. Surgical technique, patient-specific factors, and implant design could all contribute to it, with modelling and fluoroscopy data suggesting the latter may be the root cause. However, current implants all pass the preclinical stability testing standards, making it difficult to understand the effects of implant design on instability. We hypothesized that a more physiological test, analysing functional stability across the range of knee flexion-extension, could delineate the effects of design, independent of surgical technique and patient-specific factors.   Methods Using a SIMvitro-controlled six-degree-of-freedom robot, a dynamic stability test was developed, including continuous flexion and reporting data in a trans-epicondylar axis system. 3 femoral geometries were tested: gradually reducing radius, multi-radius and single-radius, with their respective tibial inserts. 710N of compression force (body weight) was applied to the implants as they were flexed from 0–140° with three levels of anterior/posterior (AP) tibial force applied (−90N,0N,90N).   Results While in static tests, the implants performed similarly, functional stability testing revealed different paths of motion and AP laxities throughout the flexion cycle. Some designs exhibited mid-flexion instability, while others did not: the multi-radius design allowed increased AP laxity as it transitioned to each arc of reduced femoral component radius; the single-radius design had low tibial bearing conformity, allowing 16mm difference in the paths of mid-flexion versus extension motion.   Conclusions Preclinical lab testing reveals functional differences between different design philosophies. Implant design impacts kinematics and mid-flexion stability, even before factoring in surgical technique and patient-specific factors. "
pub.1061784302,Robot-assisted femoral stem implantation using an intramedulla gauge,"This paper presents a gauge-based registration method, a femur-mountable robot for hip arthroplasty named ARTHROBOT, and the surgery procedure using this system. In the gauge-based registration, a reamer-shaped gauge is inserted into the femoral medulla for relative positional information of the femur to the robot. A mounting frame and a minirobot are then mounted on the patient's femur for accurate machining. This gauge-based registration method drastically reduces the processes in preoperative planning by eliminating the need of computer tomography scanning or other image processing methods, compared to other robotic systems that are used for hip surgery. Also, this surgical system reduces damage to the femur because only the metaphyseal region of the femoral canal needs to be machined, while leaving the diaphyseal hard bone untouched. Experiments were performed on 18 composite bones and 12 pig bones. In the composite bone group, orientation (anterversion, varus/valgus and flexion/extension) errors were made at 0.13/spl deg//spl plusmn/0.77/spl deg/, 0.14/spl deg//spl plusmn/0.38/spl deg/, and -0.27/spl deg//spl plusmn/0.33/spl deg/, and the maximum position error was at 1.00 mm. In the pig bone group, orientation errors were made at -0.03/spl deg//spl plusmn/0.65/spl deg/, 0.31/spl plusmn/0.27/spl deg/, and -0.36/spl deg//spl plusmn/0.36/spl deg/, and the maximum position error was at 1.12 mm. Also, 93% of the gaps between the bone and the implant surface were under 0.25 mm. The developed system shows sufficient machining accuracy and precision for clinical application."
pub.1064093907,Ankle and Hindfoot Kinematics After Total Ankle Arthroplasty in Cadaveric Gait Simulation," Category: Ankle Arthritis.   Introduction/Purpose: Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is an effective treatment option for end-stage ankle arthritis. However, with reports on long-term survivorship of current implant designs still anticipated in the literature, current research has focused on assessing prosthetic function and predicting potential failure mechanisms. Cadaveric gait simulation is a valuable tool for investigating the effects of surgical techniques on foot and ankle biomechanics. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of TAA on ankle and hindfoot kinematics using cadaveric gait simulation. We hypothesized that joint motion would be altered by the change in the articular constraint associated with joint replacement.   Methods: Three mid-tibia cadaveric specimens were secured to a static mounting fixture about a six-degree of freedom robotic platform. A force plate was moved relative to the stationary specimen through an inverse tibial kinematic path calculated from in vivo data. Target tendon force profiles were applied to the nine extrinsic ankle tendons by linear actuators instrumented with load cells. (Figure 1A). Ankle and hindfoot kinematics were measured from reflective markers attached to bones via surgical pins. TAA was performed using the Salto Talaris prosthesis (Bloomington, MN). After replacing the ankle joint, foot and ankle kinematics were directly measured using the same kinematic inputs and muscle force as the intact condition. To assess the effect of TAA on joint kinematics, pre- and post-TAA motions were directly compared throughout the stance phase, and differences were assessed using two-tailed, paired Student’s t-tests with an alpha value set at p = 0.05.   Results: Analyses revealed that ankle joint transverse plane motion was affected by TAA, with significantly greater talar internal rotation during the middle portion of stance after joint replacement (Figure 1B). In contrast, no differences were present in ankle joint sagittal and coronal plane motion between the intact and TAA condition. Dorsiflexion was greater in the subtalar joint after TAA during early stance. Similarly, there was greater dorsiflexion in the talonavicular joint during mid-stance in the TAA condition compared to the intact condition. There were no differences observed in the coronal or axial plane in either the subtalar or talonavicular joint after TAA.   Conclusion: This study revealed that the talus underwent greater internal rotation during the weight acceptance portion of gait after TAA. The ankle joint however behaved similarly with respect to sagittal and coronal plane motion throughout stance after TAA. Compensatory motion however was noted in the subtalar and talonavicular joints, with greater dorsiflexion present in both joints during stance after TAA. This abstract represents an early subset of an ongoing study; smaller yet clinically important differences may still be present, and may be detected as more specimens are"
pub.1163421359,29. Projected savings associated with lowering the risk of total hip arthroplasty revision due to dislocation among patients with spinopelvic pathology,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT In the United States (US), demand for lumbar spinal surgery is increasing due to an aging population – with spinopelvic fixation becoming more common. Spinopelvic pathology (SPP) is present in approximately 16% of patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (pTHA) and is associated with an increased risk of THA revision (rTHA) due to dislocation (estimated at 8% in patients with SPP). Adult spinal deformity surgeons should be aware of the increased risk of total hip dislocation with corrective spinal deformity surgery. Potential strategies exist to help minimize this risk, such as dual-mobility implants, anterior surgical approach, and technology-assistance (for example, digital 2D/3D presurgical planning, computer navigation, and robotic assistance). We hypothesized that reducing the risk of rTHA due to dislocation in patients with SPP results in substantial cumulative savings to the US payer. To our knowledge, the financial burden of rTHA due to dislocation among patients with SPP has not yet been established. PURPOSE To estimate (1) the target population size; (2) economic burden; and (3) 10-year projected savings to the payer of lowering the risk of rTHA due to dislocation in patients with SPP. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Budget impact analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE Approximately 600,000 hospital inpatient pTHAs performed in the US during 2021. OUTCOME MEASURES (1) Revisions averted and (2) projected savings – over a 10-year period by reducing the risk of rTHA due to dislocation among patients with SPP. METHODS A budget impact analysis was undertaken using published literature; American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons American Joint Replacement Registry 2021 Annual Report; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services MEDPAR 2019 file; and National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2019. Expenditures were inflation-adjusted to 2021 US dollars using the Medical Care component of the Consumer Price Index. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS The target population size in calendar year 2021 was estimated at 5040 (range, 4830-6309) for Medicare (fee-for-service plus Medicare Advantage) and 8003 (range, 7669-10,018) for all-payer. The annual rTHA episode of care (through 90 days) expenditures for Medicare and all-payer were $185 million and $314 million, respectively. Using a 4.14% compound annual growth rate from NIS, the estimated number of applicable rTHA procedures that will be performed from 2022 to 2031 was 63,419 Medicare and 100,697 all-payer. With each 10% reduction in the relative risk of rTHA due to dislocation, Medicare and all-payer could save $233 million and $395 million, respectively, over a 10-year period. CONCLUSIONS For patients with SPP, a modest reduction in the risk of rTHA due to dislocation could achieve substantial cumulative savings to payers while improving healthcare quality. In the adult spinal deformity population, strategies to lower rTHA due to dislocation are warranted. FDA Device/Drug Status Th"
pub.1160640371,Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty research on safety and effectiveness,"Objective  To investigate the safety and effectiveness of robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   Methods  From August 2021 to March 2022, the data of 69 patients who received robot-assisted TKA for inflammatory disease of knee in 6 hospitals were collected, including 24 males and 45 females, aged 52±6 years (range, 46-72 years), including 53 cases of knee osteoarthritis,10 cases of rheumatoid arthritis, and 6 cases of traumatic arthritis. Imaging data examination of patients was completed according to the multicenter specification. Preoperatively, the patient's CT data were extracted before surgery and a personalized prosthesis positioning plan was designed by the robotic system to determine the prosthesis size, lower limb force lines, and femoral and tibial osteotomy volumes; intraoperatively, the osteotomy template was robotically controlled to complete the osteotomy according to the prosthesis positioning plan, and the intraoperative osteotomy volumes were measured to verify the accuracy of the robot-assisted TKA osteotomy with the preoperative planning. Postoperatively, the lateral angle of the distal femur, the medial angle of the proximal tibia and the hip-knee-ankle angle were measured in the coronal plane according to radiographs; the postoperative outcome was evaluated 3 months after operation, using the American Knee Society score (KSS), including the KSS knee score and functional score.   Results  The operative time was 97.3±2.3 min (range, 80-110 min) and the amount of bleeding was 320.0±6.2 ml (range, 300-350 ml) in 69 patients. Three months after operation, the mean range of motion of knee joint was increased from 82.2°±1.1° before surgery to 119.7°±0.8° after surgery ( t =27.65, P <0.001), and the line of force of lower limb was improved from 160.9°±0.5° before surgery to 178.0°±0.2° after surgery ( t =32.03, P <0.001). KSS-knee score increased from 54.8±0.7 points before operation to 85.0±0.5 points after operation, and KSS-functional score increased from 56.5±0.7 points before operation to 85.9±0.4 points after operation, the difference was statistically significant ( t =35.45, 36.58, P <0.001). The proportion of patients with intraoperative femoral and tibial osteotomies within 2 mm osteotomy error compared with preoperative planning was 97% for the lateral tibial plateau, 100% for the medial tibial plateau, 100% for the lateral distal femur, 99% for the medial distal femur, 93% for the lateral posterior femoral condyle, and 100% for the medial posterior femoral condyle; The proportion of patients with postoperative anteroposterior X-ray measurement angle error within 3° was: 100.0% for the distal lateral femoral angle, 100.0% for the proximal medial tibial angle, and 100% for the hip-knee-ankle angle. No complications occurred in all patients except for one case in which fat liquefaction occurred in the postoperative wound.   Conclusion  Robot-assisted TKA is a safe and effective surgical method for the treatment of in"
pub.1162768038,ACCURACY OF STEM ANTEVERSION IN ROBOTIC TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY: A COMPARISON OF CEMENTED AND CEMENTLESS STEMS,"The purposes of this study were to report the accuracy of stem anteversion for Exeter cemented stems with the Mako hip enhanced mode and to compare it to Accolade cementless stems. We reviewed the data of 25 hips in 20 patients who underwent THA through the posterior approach with Exeter stems and 25 hips in 19 patients with Accolade stems were matched for age, gender, height, weight, disease, and approaches. There was no difference in the target stem anteversion (20°–30°) between the groups. Two weeks after surgery, CT images were taken to measure stem anteversion. The difference in stem anteversion between the plan and the postoperative CT measurements was 1.2° ± 3.8° (SD) on average with cemented stems and 4.2° ± 4.2° with cementless stems, respectively (P <0.05). The difference in stem anteversion between the intraoperative measurements and the postoperative CT measurements was 0.75° ± 1.8° with Exeter stems and 2.2° ± 2.3° with Accolade stems, respectively (P <0.05). This study demonstrated a high precision of anteversion for Exeter cemented stems with the Mako enhanced mode and its clinical accuracy was better with the cemented stems than that with the cementless stems. Although intraoperative stem anteversion measurements with the Mako system were more accurate with the cemented stems than that with the cementless stem, the difference was about 1° and the accuracy of intra-operative anteversion measurements was quite high even with the cementless stems. The smaller difference in stem anteversion between the plan and postoperative measurements with the cemented stems suggested that stem anteversion control was easier with cemented stems under the Mako enhanced mode than that with cementless stems. Intraoperative stem anteversion measurement with Mako total hip enhanced mode was accurate and it was useful in controlling cemented stem anteversion to the target angle."
pub.1142342705,Leg length discrepancy after total hip arthroplasty: a comparison between robotic-assisted and coventional implantation,"Objective  To compare the difference of LLD (leg length discrepancy) between robot-assisted and conventional methods of total hip arthroplasty (THA).   Methods  Data of 38 patients who had THA performed by robot-assisted or conventional methods from January 2019 to May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 38 cases (54 hips) in robot-assisted THA group (robot group) with 18 males and 20 females (age 53.5±13.6 years, BMI 26.2±3.4 kg/m 2 ), and there were 21 cases (32 hips) with osteonecrosis of the femoral head, 17 cases (22 hips) with Crown typeⅠandⅡdevelopmental dysplasia of the hip. There were 38 cases (54 hips) in conventional THA group (conventional group), with 19 males and 19 females, (age 52.3±14.7 years old, BMI 25.7±2.9 kg/m 2 ), and there were 19 cases (30 hips) with developmental dysplasia of the hip, and 19 cases (24 hips) with osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The operative time, postoperative LLD, Harris score, forgotten joint score-12 (FJS-12) and the difference between preoperative and postoperative LLD between the two groups were compared, and the correlation between surgical methods and the change of hip length was also evaluated.   Results  The operation time of the robot group was 73.3±14.1 min and which was 59.3±12.6 min in conventional THA group ( t =2.732, P =0.003). In the robot group, the postoperative LLD was 2.3±3.4 mm, which was less than that of the conventional group 6.7±5.4 mm ( t =3.521, P < 0.001). When the absolute value of LLD was larger than 5 mm as an abnormal value, it was 2.6% (1/38) in the robot group and 47.3% (18/38) in the conventional group. The difference of hip length (HL) in planning and post-operation in the robot group was 2.8±2.2 mm, which was smaller than that in the conventional THA group 7.9±5.3 mm ( t =2.357, P < 0.001). In addition, there was a correlation between the change of hip length results and the postoperative measurement of hip length in the robot group ( r =0.983, P < 0.001). At the last follow-up, Harris score and FJS-12 were recorded in the robot group and coventional group. The scores were 83.1±5.3 and 32.5±4.9 respectively in the robot group, 82.9±7.2 and 31.9±6.7 in the conventional group, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups ( t =0.221, 0.356; P =0.819, 0.731). Postoperative bleeding occurred in 1 case in the robot group with postoperative suture healed well. The fracture of the posterior wall of the acetabulum was found in the conventional group and the patient avoids weight bearing 4 weeks after operation. The postoperative recovery was good and no other related complications were found.   Conclusion  Robot-assisted THA can accurately restore the length of both legs and reduce LLD compared with conventional THA. The real-time monitoring of LLD during robot operation can give the operator an accurate reference."

The main discrepancy in kinematics between two designs is that the mechanism of rollback motion during knee flexion is different. In this study, by using image-based robotic assisted system (mako), femoral-tibial contact points of these two types of prostheses during 0&deg;to 140&deg;flexion were recorded to compared with the natural kinematic characteristics of knee joints before TKA, so as to explore which type of prosthesis is close to the natural rollback.</p><h2>Method</h2> <p>Twelve patients (15 knees) with MAKO-assisted TKA in our center were included. ①After the registration was completed, the knee joint of the patients was flexed at 0&deg;to 140&deg;(10&deg;increasing, A total of 16 angles, including 45&deg;), the contact point of femur and tibia at each angle was recorded by Mako software; ②After the anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) removed and the posterior cruciate ligament(PCL) retained, the CR model was placed, and the contact point of the femur and tibia at each knee flexion angle was recorded again from 0&deg;to 140 &deg;;③The PCL was removed, and the PS prosthesis was implanted finally.

pub.1062149549,Shaping Patient Specific Surgical Guides for Arthroplasty to Obtain High Docking Robustness,"Patient specific surgical guides (PSSGs) are used in joint replacement surgery to simplify the surgical process and to increase the accuracy in alignment of implant components with respect to the bone. Each PSSG is fabricated patient specifically and fits only in the planned position on the joint surface by the matching shape. During surgery, the surgeon holds the PSSG in the planned position and the incorporated guidance is used in making the essential cuts to fit the implant components. The shape of the PSSG determines its docking robustness (i.e., the range of forces that the surgeon may apply without losing the planned position). Minimal contact between the PSSG and the joint surface is desired, as this decreases the likelihood of interposition with undetected tissues. No analytical method is known from literature where the PSSG shape can be optimized to have high docking robustness and minimal bone-guide contact. Our objective is to develop and validate such an analytical method. The methods of motion restraint, moment labeling and wrench space—applied in robotic grasping and workpart fixturing—are employed in the creation of this new method. The theoretic approach is utilized in an example by optimizing the PSSG shape for one joint surface step-by-step. The PSSGs that arise from these optimization steps are validated with physical experiments. The following design tools for the analytical method are introduced. The optimal location for bone-guide contact and the application surface where the surgeon may push can be found graphically, respectively, by the use of the wrench space map and the application angle map. A quantitative analysis can be conducted using the complementary wrench space metrics and the robustness metric R. Utilization of the analytical method with an example joint surface shows that the PSSG's shape can be optimized. Experimental validation shows that the standard deviation of the error between the measured and calculated angular limits in the docking force is only 0.7 deg. The analytical method provides valid results and thus can be used for the design of PSSGs."
pub.1173277914,Adverse events of robot and computer navigation assisted joint arthroplsty surgery,"Robot and computer navigation assisted joint replacement surgery have the advantages of high operational repeatability, good stability, and high accuracy. In the past decade, its application in clinical practice has become increasingly widespread. However, there may be some special adverse events during robot and computer navigation assisted joint arthroplasty surgery. If there are problems with robots, navigation equipment, or process links, it can cause robot assisted surgery to be forced to abortion and switch to manual surgery. There are reports that the incidence of abortion of robotic surgery due to such reasons is as high as 22%. There may be skin and soft tissue infections around the fixed pin of the tracker, as well as fractures through tracking pin site. Most symptoms of soft tissue infections around the pin track are mild and can be cured through local dressing changes and other treatments. Fractures through tracking pin site have a significant impact on patients, but the incidence is low, mostly reported as individual cases. As of now, a total of 29 cases have been reported in the literature, of which 17 cases (59%) occurred in the femoral shaft, 3 cases (10%) in the femoral epiphyseal end, 7 cases (24%) in the tibial shaft, and 2 cases (7%) in the tibial epiphyseal end. 10 cases (34%) were non displaced or occult fractures, which were cured through conservative treatment. The remaining 19 cases (66%) were displaced fractures, of which 4 cases (14%) were treated with open reduction and internal fixation, 14 cases (48%) were treated with intramedullary nails, and 1 case (3%) underwent total keen revision surgery. Neurovascular damage caused by fixed pin is relatively rare. Research has found that the incidence of such special complications is very low, and most of them are relatively easy to manage. But surgeons should remain vigilant and standardize surgical operations, such as installing fixed pin with care and caution, to avoid the occurrence of such special complications as much as possible."

Methods  From September 2020 to January 2021, the data of patients who received surgical robot assisted TKA in 5 clinical centers in China (Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Southwest Hospital affiliated to Third Military Medical University, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, and Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine was the group leader) were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. There were 24 males and 82 females with an average age of 67.6±7.3 years, (range 45-80 years); Average body mass index 26.42±4.31 kg/m 2 , all the operation were performed by ""Skywalker"" surgical robot system according to preoperative design based on CT. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospitalization days and postoperative complications were recorded, and the imaging indexes including hip-knee-ankle (HKA), lateral distal angle of femur (LDFA) and medial proximal angle of tibia (MPTA) measured before and after the operation, implant model indexes (preoperative planning implant model and postoperative implant model) and short-term clinical efficacy indexes [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index] pain score, stiffness score, joint function score, total score and SF-12 score before and 3 months after the operation) were compared.   Results  The average follow-up period was 109.60±9.80 d, (range 95-143 d). The average operation time of 106 patients was 105.30±23.22 min; The average intraoperative blood loss was 141.70±58.33 ml; The average length of hospitalization was 5.82±2.80 d. One patient had ischemic stroke after operation, and one patient had abnormal liver function after operation. According to the judgment of the investigator, all of them were not related to the operation. The actual angle error is the difference between the preoperative planning angle and the postoperative measurement angle. The absolute error of 99.1% (105/106) of the HKA angle was within 3°, 90.8% (69/76) of LDFA, 98.7% (75/76) of the MPTA. In 45 patients in one center where data were available, the actual implant models used in all patients were consistent with the preoperative planning size, and there were only differences in version selection such as Asian condyle. WOMAC pain score, joint function score, total score was improved from 7.34±2.85, 25.10±9.85, 34.75±13.02 to 3.34±2.66, 14.68±9.64, 18.66±13.49 before and after operation, respectively, which were statistically significant ( P <0.001) and SF-12 physiological score and psychological score were improved fo"

As análises dimensionais foram feitas em um equipamento tridimensional robótico de medição por coordenadas. Avaliou-se a menor espessura do polietileno e suas medidas externas (diâmetro do espaço para a cabeça femoral e diâmetro máximo do acetábulo).ResultadosA espessura mínima do polietileno foi garantida em todos os componentes testados. A espessura dos acetábulos cimentados variou de 19,185mm a 25,358mm, enquanto a espessura dos acetábulos não cimentados variou de 12,451mm a 19,232mm A espessura foi em média 27,96% menor nos acetábulos não cimentados. Em relação à cavidade acetabular do polietileno que recebe a cabeça femoral, todos os diâmetros internos apresentaram pelo menos 28mm. Em relação ao diâmetro externo máximo do polietileno, apenas um acetábulo cimentado atingiu os 50mm de diâmetro.ConclusõesObservaram-se grandes diferenças nas medidas entre as marcas e os modelos analisados. Os acetábulos não cimentados têm uma espessura menor. Os diâmetros dos acetábulos não cimentados também foram menores do que os cimentados, à custa de sua necessidade de inserção no metal-back.AbstractObjectiveThis paper performs a dimensional analysis of different total hip arthroplasty polyethylenes, cemented and non-cemented, brazilian made and imported.MethodsIt was considered acetabular components with 50mm for the 28mm femoral heads. Dimensional analysis were performed on a 3d coordinate Carl-Zeiss robotic device. Polyethylene thickness and its external measurements (maximum diameter and diameter for the femoral head) were measured.ResultsThe minimum thickness of the polyethylene was guaranteed on all tested components. The thickness of cemented acetabular varied from 19.185mm to 25.358mm, while the thickness of the non-cemented acetabular varied from 12.451mm to 19.232mm. The thickness was 27.96% lower in non-cemented acetabular components. With respect to the polyethylene acetabular cavity that receives the femoral head, all internal diameters exhibit at least 28mm. In relation to the maximum outer diameter of the polyethylene, only one cemented acetabular component reached 50mm in diameter.ConclusionsThere are large differences in measurements between brands and models analyzed. Cementless acetabular components have the smaller thickness. The diameters of non-cemented acetabular were also lower than those cemented at the expense of their need to insert into the metal-back."
pub.1091852635,The Function Axis of Rotation of the Ankle Joint during Simulated Gait," Category: Ankle, Ankle Arthritis, Hindfoot   Introduction/Purpose: Implant component positioning is considered as an important factor in function and longevity in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). However, accurate and repeatable positioning remains a limitation with current techniques and instrumentation. In addition, further investigation is needed to objectively define the optimum component positioning. Cadaveric gait simulation is a valuable tool for investigating foot and ankle joint mechanics during functional tasks such as the stance phase of gait. The objective of this study was to investigate the functional axis of rotation of the native ankle joint during simulated gait.   Methods: The stance phase of healthy gait was simulated with six mid-tibia cadaveric specimens using a previously validated device and methodology. A robotic platform reproduced tibial-ground kinematics by moving a force plate relative to the stationary specimen while physiologic loads were applied to the extrinsic tendons to actuate the foot. (Figure 1A). Ankle kinematics were measured from reflective markers attached to the tibia and talus via surgical pins. The helical axes of rotation of the talus with respect to the tibia was calculated during three portions of stance: initial plantarflexion during earlier-stance after heal strike, dorsiflexion during mid-stance, and final plantarflexion during late-stance. The position and orientation of these kinematic-defined axes of rotation were compared to the transmalleolar axis and reduced to its anteroposterior position and transverse plane angle (Figure 1B).   Results: Analyses revealed that ankle joint functional axis of rotation varied from the anatomic reference throughout stance. The kinematic center of rotation was located 16.4 ± 5.8 mm, 16.5 ± 6.6 mm, and 15.6 ± 6.5 mm anterior to the transmalleolar axis during early-, mid- and late-portions of stance, respectively.   Conclusion: This study revealed that the position of the flexion-extension axis varies greatly between specimens during simulated gait. While previous reports have suggested that the transmalleolar axis is an acceptable approximation for the ankle joint center, these findings suggest that further research in warranted to better describe the complex tibiotalar kinematics. This work may provide future insight to guide implant design and advance techniques, to better place articular constraints of a total ankle in the native center of rotation of the joint. "
pub.1107095768,Ankle and Hindfoot Kinematics of a Next Generation Total Ankle Replacement During Simulated Gait," Category: Ankle Arthritis   Introduction/Purpose: Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) has developed as a viable treatment option for end-stage ankle arthritis. The primary benefit proposed with TAA is that allows for maintained motion of the ankle and hindfoot joint compared to the alternative option of an ankle arthrodesis. Consequently, recent TAA systems have focused on designs that advance kinematic function. Cadaveric gait simulation is a valuable tool for investigating the direct effects of surgical procedures and devices on foot and ankle biomechanics. The objective of this study was to assess whether a next generation TAA system permits normal ankle and hindfoot kinematics using cadaveric gait simulation.   Methods: Ten mid-tibia cadaveric specimens were secured to a static mounting fixture relative a six-degree of freedom robotic platform to simulate gait in native-intact and TAA conditions. A force plate was moved relative to the stationary specimen through an inverse tibial kinematic path calculated from in vivo data while extrinsic tendons were actuated using physiologic loads (Figure 1A). Ankle and hindfoot kinematics were measured from reflective markers attached to bones via surgical pins. TAA was performed using a next generation, fixed bearing total ankle system by a fellowship trained foot and ankle surgeon using manufacturer described protocol (Cadence Total Ankle, Integra LifeSciences). Ankle and hindfoot joint kinematics were directly measured using the same kinematic inputs and muscle force as the intact condition. Non-parametric, bias-corrected bootstrapping was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals to compare motion between intact and total ankle replacement conditions.   Results: Analyses revealed that no significant difference in average ankle or hindfoot joint kinematics were found between intact and TAA conditions (Figure 1B). This result was consistent in each the ankle, subtalar, and talonavicular joints, and in each plane of motion.   Conclusion: This study found that normal kinematics were permitted on average by a next generation, fixed bearing TAA. This finding may indicate that improved functional outcomes following could be expected. However, increased variability and some characteristic differences in the paths of motion throughout stance were observed qualitatively. This report represents an initial analysis of preliminary data, future work will include further analyses and investigation on the influence of factors such as component position and alignment on outcomes. That said, the findings of this study are encouraging and may represent improved kinematic performance in new TAA designs. "
pub.1154305408,Robotic biomechanical evaluation of six different reverse shoulder implants,"Background The reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is a popular surgical treatment for a degenerative shoulder with a nonfunctional rotator cuff. Currently, more than 36 different brands with small different features are available. This creates choice stress among many surgeons, who no longer know which parameters and surgical factors are important to optimize the placement of the implant. Purpose The first purpose of this pilot study was to compare the passive range of motion (ROM) of 6 different implant designs implanted following the manufacturer’s guidelines. The second goal was to identify the impingements after implantation which determines the maximal ROM. The last goal of the study was to link the different parameters of an implant with the ROM. Methods Six implant systems were implanted on identical sawbones. The procedure was repeated 3 times on a different sawbone to objectify the surgical repeatability of the procedures. A Stäubli TX-90 robot was used to perform and control the humerus' kinematic movement. An optical tracking system was used to perform the system's calibrations, track the humerus and scapula in space, and compute the center of rotation. Results There was a wide ROM in the scapular plane (44.8°-105.5°) while the minimal elevation (adduction) varied between −4.8° and 35.6°. The rotational movements were limited by contact of the superior humeral polyethylene inlay and the inferior scapular neck. The adduction in the coronal and scapular plane was limited by inferior scapular impingement, whereas the maximal abduction was limited either by bony contact between the humerus and acromion or by contact between the humeral polyethylene inlay and the superior glenoid cavity. A bigger radius of the glenosphere resulted in a larger passive humeroscapular ROM (P < .001). A larger Neck-Shaft-Angle results in a better abduction (P < .001) but compromised adduction (P < .001). The localization of the center of rotation has a significant impact on the ROM. The medialized designs have larger abduction and rotational angles (P < .001). Conclusion There is a wide variation in the measured glenohumeral ROM between the 6 frequently implanted prostheses. The most important factor to optimize the impingement-free ROM in all types of prostheses is the creation of the prosthetic overhang of the glenosphere to the bone. Too much lateralization of the center of the glenosphere with or without lateralization of the humeral stem can create a subacromial and/or subcoracoidal impingement."
pub.1173279364,The application progress of artificial intelligence technology in the diagnosis and treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a developmental disease with abnormal position and morphology of the acetabulum and femoral head. DDH ranges from mild dysplasia to complete dislocation, including simple acetabular dysplasia, subluxation, and total dislocation. DDH is one of the most common hip diseases in children, and its onset begins in infancy. The anatomical structure of the hip joint is complex, and there are some practical problems in the large -scale clinical diagnosis and screening work, such as heavy workload, high misdiagnosis rate and missed diagnosis rate, and a long learning period of surgery. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology science used to research and develop theories, methods, technologies and application systems that can simulate human intelligence. The main goal is to enable machines to complete complex tasks that require human intelligence. At present, artificial intelligence is mainly used in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH. Artificial intelligence combined with X-ray or ultrasound is used to diagnose and screen DDH, which avoids subjectivity to a certain extent and improves the accuracy of diagnosis and screening. In the preoperative planning of periacetabular osteotomy and total hip arthroplasty, it can more accurately track the position of the bone block and design the size of the prosthesis, which makes the surgical planning more accurate to a certain extent. Artificial intelligence technologies such as 3D navigation system, surgical robot and robotic arm are helpful to improve the accuracy and safety of surgery. Artificial intelligence has the characteristics of simplicity, speed, high repeatability and deep learning ability, which to a certain extent saves manpower, material resources and time costs for DDH diagnosis and treatment, facilitates medical workers to share DDH diagnosis and treatment experience and reduces the burden of patients, families, society and the country. The application of artificial intelligence in DDH diagnosis and treatment is becoming more and more extensive, but at present, artificial intelligence in DDH screening is still in its preliminary stage. There are few reports on artificial intelligence technology in DDH hip preservation treatment and other surgical methods, and there is insufficient research on artificial intelligence in DDH conservative treatment, postoperative complications and prognosis prediction. It is worth exploring new ideas by researchers. At present, the application of artificial intelligence in DDH still has certain limitations, including problems such as difficult to control the quality of image data, difficult to develop and promote technology, and lack of laws and regulations. Based on the literature database and relevant data sharing network, this paper reviews the application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH at home and abroad in recent years, summarizes the current application status of artificial "

Coverage of the weight-bearing area of the heel in chronic wounds remains a difficult problem for plastic surgeons. Although certain defects can be covered by different local flaps, radiodermatitis is a contraindication for these flaps. Thin free flaps are usually the only correct solution for this particular problem. However, additional to specific microvascular problems, heel coverage by grafted fascial or muscle flaps is complicated by specific events that will have an impact on the final result of the reconstruction. These include the shearing phenomenon, ulceration, hypertrophic scar, and hyperkeratosis. Based on anatomic concepts and confirmed by a small number of cases, the fasciocutaneous temporal free flap seems to be an excellent alternative for small heel reconstructions. Between 1996 and 2001, the authors performed six heel reconstructions with fasciocutaneous temporalis free flaps in the weight-bearing area. All patients presented with chronic ulcers, previously treated by radiation therapy. The mean patient age was 40 years (range: 27 to 52 years), and those with vascular diseases were not included. The size of defects varied between 15 and 30 cm2 (mean: 20 cm2); all defects were closed primarily. All microsurgical arterial anastomoses were performed end-to-side on the posterior tibial artery. The mean follow-up was 32 months (range: 15 months to 7 years) and during follow-up, the volume and appearance of the flap, sensibility, scars, and hyperkeratosis were noted. The shearing phenomenon and gait were studied both subjectively and objectively. There was no partial or total flap loss. One revision of the venous microsuture was performed, and one debulking after 20 months. No ulcers developed, and there were normal scars with one transient hyperkeratosis. There was no shearing phenomenon demonstrated, and an almost normal gait pattern. The presence of hair caused no functional disability, but it was always removed for aesthetic reasons. Although muscle flaps remain the workhorse for heel coverage in osteomyelitis and acute large surface defects, the fasciocutaneous temporalis free flap appears to have several advantages in specific conditions such as small, chronic, irradiated wounds. Venoneuroadipofascial and Venoadipofascial Flaps for Skin Coverage of the Leg and Ankle. Kanaya, Taira, Asato, Futenma; Okinawa. The venoneuroadipofascial (V-NAF) flap and venoadipofascial (VAF) flap, first presented by Nakajima, are flaps that receive arterial blood supply from accompanying arteries of the cutaneous vein and/or cutaneous nerve. These flaps permit skin flap coverage of the extremities. The authors reported the surgical results of V-NAF and VAF flaps used to cover leg and ankle defects. Since 1996, the authors have performed 11 V-NAF and one VAF flap in 12 patients. The mean patient age of 9 men and 3 women was 4"

Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Australia. Over the last 25 years, there has been an anatomic renaissance that has had a major impact on reconstructive plastic surgery and tissue transfer. The introduction of the free flap, the revival of the musculocutaneous flap, and the development of the fasciocutaneous flap, have all required a reappraisal of the blood supply of the various body tissues in a search for suitable donor sites for transplantation. In 1987, we introduced the concept of the angiosome, after analyzing a series of total body lead oxide injection and dissection studies. Based on the results, the body was mapped anatomically into three-dimensional vascular territories. Each territory spanned between skin and bone, supplied by a named segmental or distributing artery, with adjacent angiosomes linked together in each tissue layer by either true anastomotic arteries without change in caliber or, more commonly, by reduced caliber ``choke'' vessels. In 1990, a similar anatomic study of the venous network of the body revealed composite venous territories that matched their arterial counterparts. The adjacent venous territories were found to be linked usually by avalvular ``oscillating'' veins, which allowed bi-directional flow between territories. Thus, each angiosome could be subdivided anatomically into matching arterial (arteriosome) and venous (venosome) territories. Subsequently, our anatomic studies were expanded to evaluate the neurovascular relationships in the skin and the underlying muscles, and our findings were published in 1994. This allowed us to develop new donor sites for sensate skin flaps, and to provide refined functioning muscle transfers. Other studies have focused on Doppler flowmetry to plan the base and axis of the flap and a re-evaluation of the delay phenomenon to enhance flap survival. Illustrative procedures were demonstrated. Aesthetic Nasal Reconstruction with Free Microvascular Subunits. Robert L. Walton and Gary C. Burget. Section of Plastic Surgery, University of Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. In cases of subtotal and total nasal loss, traditional methods for reconstruction have fallen short in achieving ideal function and aesthetics. A common link to these shortcomings has been the inadequacy of nasal lining. The introduction of microsurgical techniques for nasal reconstruction initially offered great promise by delivering to the operative site ample volumes of unsullied, well-vascularized tissue for reconstruction. However, these expectations were short-lived, because the tradition of sculpting large, bulky flaps could not be applied to the small dimensions and reconstructive demands imposed by the thin, delicate, three-dimensional nasal lining. Over the past four years, we have had the unique opportunity of collaborating on a number of total and sub-total nasal r"

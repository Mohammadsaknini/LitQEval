pub.1171923533,Biofuel production for circular bioeconomy: Present scenario and future scope,"In recent years, biofuel production has attracted considerable attention, especially given the increasing worldwide demand for energy and emissions of greenhouse gases that threaten this planet. In this case, one possible solution is to convert biomass into green and sustainable biofuel, which can enhance the bioeconomy and contribute to sustainable economic development goals. Due to being in large quantities and containing high organic content, various biomass sources such as food waste, textile waste, microalgal waste, agricultural waste and sewage sludge have gained significant attention for biofuel production. Also, biofuel production technologies, including thermochemical processing, anaerobic digestion, fermentation and bioelectrochemical systems, have been extensively reported, which can achieve waste valorization through producing biofuels and re-utilizing wastes. Nevertheless, the commercial feasibility of biofuel production is still being determined, and it is unclear whether biofuel can compete equally with other existing fuels in the market. The concept of a circular economy in biofuel production can promote the environmentally friendly and sustainable valorization of biomass waste. This review comprehensively discusses the state-of-the-art production of biofuel from various biomass sources and the bioeconomy perspectives associated with it. Biofuel production is evaluated within the framework of the bioeconomy. Further perspectives on possible integration approaches to maximizing waste utilization for biofuel production are discussed, and what this could mean for the circular economy. More research related to pretreatment and machine learning of biofuel production should be conducted to optimize the biofuel production process, increase the biofuel yield and make the biofuel prices competitive."
pub.1158632646,Advanced approaches for resource recovery from wastewater and activated sludge: A review,"Due to resource scarcity, current industrial systems are switching from waste treatment, such as wastewater treatment and biomass, to resource recovery (RR). Biofuels, manure, pesticides, organic acids, and other bioproducts with a great market value can be produced from wastewater and activated sludge (AS). This will not only help in the transition from a linear economy to a circular economy, but also contribute to sustainable development. However, the cost of recovering resources from wastewater and AS to produce value-added products is quite high as compared to conventional treatment methods. In addition, most antioxidant technologies remain at the laboratory scale that have not yet reached the level at industrial scale. In order to promote the innovation of resource recovery technology, the various methods of treating wastewater and AS to produce biofuels, nutrients and energy are reviewed, including biochemistry, thermochemistry and chemical stabilization. The limitations of wastewater and AS treatment methods are prospected from biochemical characteristics, economic and environmental factors. The biofuels derived from third generation feedstocks, such as wastewater are more sustainable. Microalgal biomass are being used to produce biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen, biogas, biooils, bioplastics, biofertilizers, biochar and biopesticides. New technologies and policies can promote a circular economy based on biological materials."

pub.1171077836,A Holistic Approach to Circular Bioeconomy Through the Sustainable Utilization of Microalgal Biomass for Biofuel and Other Value-Added Products,"Emissions from transportation and industry primarily cause global warming, leading to floods, glacier melt, and rising seas. Widespread greenhouse gas emissions and resulting global warming pose significant risks to the environment, economy, and society. The need for alternative fuels drives the development of third-generation feedstocks: microalgae, seaweed, and cyanobacteria. These microalgae offer traits like rapid growth, high lipid content, non-competition with human food, and growth on non-arable land using brackish or waste water, making them promising for biofuel. These unique phototrophic organisms use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce biofuels, biochemicals, and more. This review delves into the realm of microalgal biofuels, exploring contemporary methodologies employed for lipid extraction, significant value-added products, and the challenges inherent in their commercial-scale production. While the cost of microalgae bioproducts remains high, utilizing wastewater nutrients for cultivation could substantially cut production costs. Furthermore, this review summarizes the significance of biocircular economy approaches, which encompass the utilization of microalgal biomass as a feed supplement and biofertilizer, and biosorption of heavy metals and dyes. Besides, the discussion extends to the in-depth analysis and future prospects on the commercial potential of biofuel within the context of sustainable development.

pub.1166323358,Life cycle assessment of novel thermochemical – biochemical biomass-to-liquid pathways for sustainable aviation and maritime fuel production,"This paper aims to carry out an integrated Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental performance of a novel thermochemical-biochemical biomass-to-liquid pathway for sustainable aviation and maritime biofuel production. Five scenarios are defined, consideringdifferent types of biomass feedstock and biorefinery locations, in different geographically dispersed European countries. The results indicate that the replacement of conventional aviation and maritime fuels with sustainable biofuels could reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHG) by 60-86%, based on feedstock type. When the renewable share in the electricity mix reaches 100% (in 2050), the GHG emissions will experience a great decrease (26% - 68%), compared to 2022 levels. The non-renewable energy consumption will also decrease (by 56% - 83%), with results strongly affected by the electricity mix of the European country considered. This study demonstrates that the deployment of biomass-to-jet/marine fuel pathways could favor the industrial adoption of circular economy strategies for transport biofuels production."
pub.1153393106,Plastid Transformation: New Challenges in the Circular Economy Era,"In a circular economy era the transition towards renewable and sustainable materials is very urgent. The development of bio-based solutions, that can ensure technological circularity in many priority areas (e.g., agriculture, biotechnology, ecology, green industry, etc.), is very strategic. The agricultural and fishing industry wastes represent important feedstocks that require the development of sustainable and environmentally-friendly industrial processes to produce and recover biofuels, chemicals and bioactive molecules.

pub.1150356085,The rural consumer adoption of sustainable energy: a PLS-SEM-ANN approach of conceptual model development and cross-country validation of Pakistan and Malaysia,"Abstract
Sustainable and alternative energy sources of biofuel and solar power panel have been revolutionizing the lives and economy of many countries. However, these changes mainly occur in the urban areas and the rural population section has long been ignored by policy makers and government in the provision of energy. It is only recently that solar and biofuel are finally making in road to provide cheap and clean energy sources to rural population. As a result, literatures on consumer behavior of rural population towards sustainable energy sources are still very scarce. The present research aims to fulfill this gap by developing a conceptual model to investigate the adoption of solar power and biofuel energy resources in the cross-cultural setting of Malaysia and Pakistan. The data was collected from the rural areas of Pakistan and Malaysia. The two-stage data analysis method of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) have been applied to satisfy both linear and non-linear regression assumptions, respectively. The results show that consumer in rural areas of Pakistan are willing and possess intention to adopt both biofuel and solar power for commercial and domestic use. Additionally, the results confirm that branding, economic, and altruistic factors are important in yielding intention to use towards biofuel and solar power panel in Pakistan which are validated by the results obtained in Malaysia. Other factors such as climate change awareness, retailer services quality, and ease of use are also important. The results offer wide-ranging theoretical and managerial implications."

pub.1153626318,Integrating Carbohydrate and C1 Utilization for Chemicals Production,"In the face of increasing mobility and energy demand, as well as the mitigation of climate change, the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels will be one of the most important tasks facing humankind in the coming years. In order to initiate the transition from a petroleum-based economy to a new, greener future, biofuels and synthetic fuels have great potential as they can be adapted to already common processes. Thereby, especially synthetic fuels from CO<sub>2</sub> and renewable energies are seen as the next big step for a sustainable and ecological life. In our study, we directly address the sustainable production of the most common biofuel, ethanol, and the highly interesting next-generation biofuel, isobutanol, from methanol and xylose, which are directly derivable from CO<sub>2</sub> and lignocellulosic waste streams, respectively, such integrating synthetic fuel and biofuel production. After enzyme and reaction optimization, we succeeded in producing either 3 g L<sup>-1</sup> ethanol or 2 g L<sup>-1</sup> isobutanol from 7.5 g L<sup>-1</sup> xylose and 1.6 g L<sup>-1</sup> methanol. In our cell-free enzyme system, C1-compounds are efficiently combined and fixed by the key enzyme transketolase and converted to the intermediate pyruvate. This opens the way for a hybrid production of biofuels, platform chemicals and fine chemicals from CO<sub>2</sub> and lignocellulosic waste streams as alternative to conventional routes depending solely either on CO<sub>2</sub> or sugars."
pub.1155031283,The role of biofuels for sustainable MicrogridsF: A path towards carbon neutrality and the green economy,"Today, with the progress of technology, the world is facing an increasing growth in power consumption. Since the fuel of most power plants is supplied from fossil fuels, it has caused an increase in global fossil fuel consumption and environmental degradation. ّFurthermore, the volatility of fossil fuel prices and unstable energy security have prompted international organizations and governments to apply policies to restrict fossil fuel use and examine alternatives to fossil fuels. Since biofuels come from renewable sources and are clean fuels, they can be an appropriate alternative to fossil fuels and play a more expansive role in supplying energy for transportation industries, power plants, and heat production systems. Although there is some research about the drawbacks of using fossil fuels and the commendation of using biofuels in various industries such as transportation, the literature lacks a comprehensive study on the evaluation and analysis of the potential of using biofuels instead of conventional fuels in power generation systems. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of utilizing biofuels instead of fossil fuels in microgrids to achieve carbon neutrality objectives. Furthermore, this paper reviews previous research studies that have operated biofuels in three categories: solid, liquid, and gas, to generate electricity and analyzes the potential of different biofuels to produce heat and electricity for microgrid power systems. In addition to outlining the present knowledge gaps in this area, this study explores the prospects and threats associated with expanding the use of biofuels in the power production industry and the development of sustainable microgrids. This study indicated that if the technical and economic problems of employing biofuels are overcome, these clean fuels have a great potential to obtain the maximum share of the global power generation market and move toward Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) goals."
pub.1144708101,Exploring the potential of vermicompost as a sustainable strategy in circular economy: improving plants’ bioactive properties and boosting agricultural yield and quality,"Consumption of natural resources and waste generation continues to rise as the human population increases. Ever since the industrial revolution, consumers have been adopting a linear economy model based on the ‘take-make-dispose’ approach. Raw materials are extracted to be converted into products and finally discarded as wastes. Consequently, this practice is unsustainable because it causes a massive increase in waste production. The root problems of the linear system can be addressed by transitioning to a circular economy. Circular economy is an economic model in which wastes from one product are recycled and used as resources for other processes. This literature review discovers the potential of vermicompost as a sustainable strategy in circular economy and highlights the benefits of vermicompost in ensuring food security, particularly in improving agricultural yield and quality, as well as boosting crop’s nutritional quality. Vermicompost has the potential to be used in a variety of ways in the circular economy, including for agricultural sustainability, managing waste, pollutant remediation, biogas production and animal feed production. The recycling of organic wastes to produce vermicompost can benefit both the consumers and environment, thus paving the way towards a more sustainable agriculture for the future."

This work critically evaluates the immediate and remote potential effects of the RIU on Ukraine's biofuel capacity and potentials, energy strategies and policies, direct impacts of the war on Ukraine and Russia and other countries' biofuels policies were evaluated. Ukraine is found to be a very important big player on global biofuels energy security and policies. It was observed that there are more significant impacts of the war on Ukraine biofuel industry than that of Russia due to very low priority on the development of Liquid biofuels (LBs) in Russia. Recommendations based on the concepts of national energy security and independence were elucidated. Post invasion-strategies such as development of framework for management of post-war waste, ensuring strict adherence to EU biofuels sustainable directives, and implementation of Bioplus-project for Ukraine government were underpinned. This article provides useful information, guidelines and directives that would enable Ukraine government and other countries facing energy insecurity and political crises to restore energy independence and national economy."
pub.1164911519,Insights into the recent advances of agro-industrial waste valorization for sustainable biogas production,"Recent years have seen a transition to a sustainable circular economy model that uses agro-industrial waste biomass waste to produce energy while reducing trash and greenhouse gas emissions. Biogas production from lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is an alternative option in the hunt for clean and renewable fuels.

pub.1174542216,Biofuel from wastewater-grown microalgae: A biorefinery approach using hydrothermal liquefaction and catalyst upgrading,"Third-generation biofuels from microalgae are becoming necessary for sustainable energy. In this context, this study explores the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass grown in wastewater, consisting of 30% Chlorella vulgaris, 69% Tetradesmus obliquus, and 1% cyanobacteria Limnothrix planctonica, and the subsequent upgrading of the produced bio-oil. The novelty of the work lies in integrating microalgae cultivation in wastewater with HTL in a biorefinery approach, enhanced using a catalyst to upgrade the bio-oil. Different temperatures (300, 325, and 350 °C) and reaction times (15, 30, and 45 min) were tested. The bio-oil upgrading occurred with a Cobalt-Molybdenum (CoMo) catalyst for 1 h at 375 °C. Post-HTL, although the hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio decreased from 1.70 to 1.38-1.60, the oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio also decreased from 0.39 to 0.079-0.104, and the higher heating value increased from 20.6 to 36.4-38.3 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup>. Palmitic acid was the main component in all bio-oil samples. The highest bio-oil yield was at 300 °C for 30 min (23.4%). Upgrading increased long-chain hydrocarbons like heptadecane (5%), indicating biofuel potential, though nitrogenous compounds such as hexadecanenitrile suggest a need for further hydrodenitrogenation. Aqueous phase, solid residues, and gas from HTL can be used for applications such as biomass cultivation, bio-hydrogen, valuable chemicals, and materials like carbon composites and cement additives, promoting a circular economy. The study underscores the potential of microalgae-derived bio-oil as sustainable biofuel, although further refinement is needed to meet current fuel standards."
pub.1155527112,Bioplastic production in terms of life cycle assessment: A state-of-the-art review,"The current transition to sustainability and the circular economy can be viewed as a socio-technical response to environmental impacts and the need to enhance the overall performance of the linear production and consumption paradigm. The concept of biowaste refineries as a feasible alternative to petroleum refineries has gained popularity. Biowaste has become an important raw material source for developing bioproducts and biofuels. Therefore, effective environmental biowaste management systems for the production of bioproducts and biofuels are crucial and can be employed as pillars of a circular economy. Bioplastics, typically plastics manufactured from bio-based polymers, stand to contribute to more sustainable commercial plastic life cycles as part of a circular economy in which virgin polymers are made from renewable or recycled raw materials.

pub.1173612893,Harnessing acetogenic bacteria for one-carbon valorization toward sustainable chemical production,"The pressing climate change issues have intensified the need for a rapid transition towards a bio-based circular carbon economy. Harnessing acetogenic bacteria as biocatalysts to convert C1 compounds such as CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, formate, or methanol into value-added multicarbon chemicals is a promising solution for both carbon capture and utilization, enabling sustainable and green chemical production. Recent advances in the metabolic engineering of acetogens have expanded the range of commodity chemicals and biofuels produced from C1 compounds. However, producing energy-demanding high-value chemicals on an industrial scale from C1 substrates remains challenging because of the inherent energetic limitations of acetogenic bacteria. Therefore, overcoming this hurdle is necessary to scale up the acetogenic C1 conversion process and realize a circular carbon economy. This review overviews the acetogenic bacteria and their potential as sustainable and green chemical production platforms. Recent efforts to address these challenges have focused on enhancing the ATP and redox availability of acetogens to improve their energetics and conversion performances. Furthermore, promising technologies that leverage low-cost, sustainable energy sources such as electricity and light are discussed to improve the sustainability of the overall process. Finally, we review emerging technologies that accelerate the development of high-performance acetogenic bacteria suitable for industrial-scale production and address the economic sustainability of acetogenic C1 conversion.

pub.1168816090,Catalytic flash pyrolysis of Scenedesmus sp. post-extraction residue using low-cost HZSM-5 catalyst with the perspective to produce renewable aromatic hydrocarbons,"Recovering renewable chemicals from de-fatted microalgal residue derived from lipid extraction within the algal-derived biofuel sector is crucial, given the rising significance of microalgal-derived biodiesel as a potential substitute for petroleum-based liquid fuels. As a circular economy strategy, effective valorization of de-fatted biomass significantly improves the energetic and economic facets of establishing a sustainable algal-derived biofuel industry. In this scenario, this study investigates flash catalytic pyrolysis as a sustainable pathway for valorizing Scenedesmus sp. post-extraction residue (SPR), potentially yielding a bio-oil enriched with upgraded characteristics, especially renewable aromatic hydrocarbons. In the scope of this study, volatile products from catalytic and non-catalytic flash pyrolysis were characterized using a micro-furnace type temperature programmable pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection (Py–GC/MS). Flash pyrolysis of SPR resulted in volatile products with elevated oxygen and nitrogen compounds with concentrations of 46.4% and 26.4%, respectively. In contrast, flash pyrolysis of lyophilized microalgal biomass resulted in lower concentrations of these compounds, with 40.9% oxygen and 17.3% nitrogen. Upgrading volatile pyrolysis products from SPR led to volatile products comprised of only hydrocarbons, while completely removing oxygen and nitrogen-containing compounds. This was achieved by utilizing a low-cost HZSM-5 catalyst within a catalytic bed at 500 °C. Catalytic experiments also indicate the potential conversion of SPR into a bio-oil rich in monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, primarily BETX, with toluene comprising over one-third of its composition, thus presenting a sustainable pathway for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil derived from SPR. Another significant finding was that 97.8% of the hydrocarbon fraction fell within the gasoline range (C5–C12), and 35.5% fell within the jet fuel range (C8–C16). Thus, flash catalytic pyrolysis of SPR exhibits significant promise for application in drop-in biofuel production, including green gasoline and bio-jet fuel, aligning with the principles of the circular economy, green chemistry, and bio-refinery.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1149472648,Integrated role of algae in the closed-loop circular economy of anaerobic digestion,"Following the surging demand for sustainable biofuels, biogas production via anaerobic digestion (AD) presented itself as a solution for energy security, waste management, and greenhouse gas mitigation. Algal-based biorefinery platform serves an important role in the AD-based closed-loop circular economy. Other than using whole biomass of micro- and macroalgae as feedstock for biogas production, the integration of AD with other bio- or thermochemical conversion techniques can achieve complete valorization of biomass residue after processing or valuable compounds extraction. On the other hand, anaerobic digestate, the byproduct of AD processes can be used for microalgal cultivation for lipid and pigments accumulation, closing the loop of resource flow.

pub.1170515653,Lignosulfonate‐Based Carbon‐Supported Pellets Catalyst to Enhance Sustainable Biofuel Production from Waste Cooking Oil,"In this study, a cost-effective and stable heterogeneous acidic carbocatalyst (CZnLS950) derived from Na-lignosulfonate (LS), a side product of the paper industry, was employed to produce hydrocarbon fuels through the pyrolysis of waste cooking oil (WCO) and crude natural-oil extracted from sunflower seeds, aligning with the principles of the circular economy. To enhance its practicality in industrial settings, the catalyst was synthesized in pellet form, enabling easy separation from the biofuel produced during the reaction. CZnLS950 exhibited remarkable catalytic efficiency in the pyrolysis of WCO, resulting in a 71 wt. % liquid biofuel yield under mild conditions. This performance is attributed to the unique synthesis procedure of acidic carbocatalyst, which utilizes LS and nano ZnO (20 nm) to create a hierarchical pore structure with acidic properties (1.1 mmol of NH<sub>3</sub> g<sup>-1</sup>). Stability and reusability of the carbocatalyst were evaluated, and the results showed excellent stability with small catalytic deactivation (~5 wt. %) after the fourth use. Attempts at distinct catalytic mechanisms for WCO and sunflower seeds crude natural-oil pyrolysis were provided to understand the processes involved in obtaining the two different biofuels produced. Overall, this study sets the stage for exploring Lignosulfonate-based materials to achieve renewable biofuel from recycling streams."
pub.1169825246,"Multifaced application of AFEX-pretreated biomass in producing second-generation biofuels, ruminant animal feed, and value-added bioproducts","Lignocellulosic biomass holds a crucial position in the prospective bio-based economy, serving as a sustainable and renewable source for a variety of bio-based products. These products play a vital role in displacing fossil fuels and contributing to environmental well-being. However, the inherent recalcitrance of biomass poses a significant obstacle to the efficient access of sugar polymers. Consequently, the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars remains a prominent challenge in biorefinery processes to produce biofuels and biochemicals. In addressing these challenges, extensive efforts have been dedicated to mitigating biomass recalcitrance through diverse pretreatment methods. One noteworthy process is Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX) pretreatment, characterized by its dry-to-dry nature and minimal water usage. The volatile ammonia, acting as a catalyst in the process, is recyclable. AFEX contributes to cleaning biomass ester linkages and facilitating the opening of cell wall structures, enhancing enzyme accessibility and leading to a fivefold increase in sugar conversion compared to untreated biomass. Over the last decade, AFEX has demonstrated substantial success in augmenting the efficiency of biomass conversion processes. This success has unlocked the potential for sustainable and economically viable biorefineries. This paper offers a comprehensive review of studies focusing on the utilization of AFEX-pretreated biomass in the production of second-generation biofuels, ruminant feed, and additional value-added bioproducts like enzymes, lipids, proteins, and mushrooms. It delves into the details of the AFEX pretreatment process at both laboratory and pilot scales, elucidates the mechanism of action, and underscores the role of AFEX in the biorefinery for developing biofuels and bioproducts, and nutritious ruminant animal feed production. While highlighting the strides made, the paper also addresses current challenges in the commercialization of AFEX pretreatment within biorefineries. Furthermore, it outlines critical considerations that must be addressed to overcome these challenges, ensuring the continued progress and widespread adoption of AFEX in advancing sustainable and economically viable bio-based industries."

Nevertheless, large-scale downstream processing requires an understanding of biomass rheology that needs to be addressed further. This study aimed to characterize microalgal concentrates rheologically in different culture media. The presence of bacteria was quantified by photorespirometry and plate counting techniques. The culture medium was found to significantly influence viscosity, with primary wastewater exhibiting the highest viscosity and seawater plus pig slurry the lowest. The concentration of heterotrophic bacteria was directly related to the viscosity. Extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) in supernatant exhibited an inverse viscosity trend compared to biomass concentrates, with pig slurry cultures having higher concentrations.

pub.1052289654,"Forests, food, and fuel in the tropics: the uneven social and ecological consequences of the emerging political economy of biofuels","The global political economy of biofuels emerging since 2007 appears set to intensify inequalities among the countries and rural peoples of the global South. Looking through a global political economy lens, this paper analyses the consequences of proliferating biofuel alliances among multinational corporations, governments, and domestic producers. Since many major biofuel feedstocks - such as sugar, oil palm, and soy - are already entrenched in industrial agricultural and forestry production systems, the authors extrapolate from patterns of production for these crops to bolster their argument that state capacities, the timing of market entry, existing institutions, and historical state-society land tenure relations will particularly affect the potential consequences of further biofuel development. Although the impacts of biofuels vary by region and feedstock, and although some agrarian communities in some countries of the global South are poised to benefit, the analysis suggests that already-vulnerable people and communities will bear a disproportionate share of the costs of biofuel development, particularly for biofuels from crops already embedded in industrial production systems. A core reason, this paper argues, is that the emerging biofuel alliances are reinforcing processes and structures that increase pressures on the ecological integrity of tropical forests and further wrest control of resources from subsistence farmers, indigenous peoples, and people with insecure land rights. Even the development of so-called 'sustainable' biofuels looks set to displace livelihoods and reinforce and extend previous waves of hardship for such marginalised peoples."

Recently, industries based on biomass, especially the bioenergy sector, are getting increasing attention due to their environmental acceptability. However, their practical application is still limited due to the growing cost of raw materials such as algal biomass, harvesting and processing limitations. Potential use of algal biomass includes nutrients recovery, heavy metals removal, COD, BOD, coliforms, and other disease-causing pathogens reduction and production of bioenergy and valuable products. However, the production of algal biomass using the variable composition of different wastewater streams as a source of growing medium and the application of treated water for subsequent use in agriculture for irrigation has remained a challenging task.

pub.1153908424,Advanced thermodynamics analysis for sustainable residential sector: a case study of Turkish residential sector,"Abstract
Energy sustainability plays a crucial role in the development of any country. With the booming economy of Turkey, it is necessary to ensure energy sustainability in every sector. The residential sector plays a vital role in energy consumption in Turkey and improving sustainability in this sector can foster Turkey’s development. This study introduced first-time sustainability indicators of Turkey’s residential sector to determine the energy and exergy analyses through a thermodynamics-derived approach based on the data from 2000 to 2017. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for energy source variation. Possible distribution uncertainties show that natural gas (0.78–0.76), biofuels, and waste (0.39–0.43) are dominant parameters for energy and exergy. Improvement of biofuels and waste, renewable-based energy sources can be a feasible solution for fossil fuel replacement. In Turkey’s residential sector, energy efficiency varies from 27.51 to 35.65%, while exergy efficiency ranges from 25.85 to 34.06%. The sustainability index for Turkey ranges from 1.34 to 1.51. In Turkey, around 65.93 to 74.14% of fossil fuel has been depleted in the last 18 years, which leads to lesser exergetic sustainability. Inefficient cooking, heating appliances, and lighting devices lead to higher exergy loss. Therefore, this study demonstrates the exergy analysis and prediction of the upcoming consequences of this analysis. In the future, Turkey can use higher efficient devices, especially in heating, lighting, and mechanical energy-related appliances, and electricity can be used to attain higher exergetic efficiency. Performed analysis and uncertainties of parameters will assist policymakers in selecting suitable alternative strategies in Turkey’s residential sector for sustainable decision-making."

Significantly, the sustainable biorefinery of lignocellulosic waste, as an alternative fuel source, is a prognosticating approach to tackle many agricultural/forestry residues and offers a circular economy as well as environmental benefits. But, the heterogeneity of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the major bottlenecks in lignocellulosic biorefinery. Thus the characterization of lignocellulosic biomass is essential to understanding the feedstock's nature, composition and suitability for biofuel production. The present study taps evergreen spiny non-edible pods of Prosopis juliflora (Pj) as an energy feedstock. Proximate, ultimate and biochemical characterization of Pj pods were conducted, and thermal behaviour and calorific values were determined. Cellulose and hemicellulose were isolated and characterized by reliable methods. The overall characterization has revealed the Pj pods as a potential feedstock for bioenergy. The collected Pj pods contain (% w/w) moisture 7.89 ± 0.002, volatile matter 87.67 ± 0.002, ash 0.21 ± 0.002, fixed carbon 4.23 ± 0.002 with a calorific value of 17.62 kg/MJ. The CHNS content was (w/w %) carbon 41.77, nitrogen 3.58, sulfur 26.3 and hydrogen 6.55.

Numerous medical resources are used to inhibit the infectious transmission of the virus, resulting in massive medical waste. This study proposes a sustainable and environment-friendly method to convert hazardous medical waste into valuable fuel products through pyrolysis. Medical protective clothing (MPC), a typical medical waste from COVID-19, was utilized for co-pyrolysis with oil palm wastes (OPWs). The utilization of MPC improved the bio-oil properties in OPWs pyrolysis. The addition of catalysts further ameliorated the bio-oil quality. HZSM-5 was more effective in producing hydrocarbons in bio-oil, and the relevant reaction pathway was proposed. Meanwhile, a project was simulated to co-produce bio-oil and electricity from the co-pyrolysis of OPWs and MPC from application perspectives. The techno-economic analysis indicated that the project was economically feasible, and the payback period was 6.30-8.75 years. Moreover, it was also environmentally benign as its global warming potential varied from -211.13 to -90.76 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/t. Therefore, converting MPC and OPWs into biofuel and electricity through co-pyrolysis is a green, economic, and sustainable method that can decrease waste, produce valuable fuel products, and achieve remarkable economic and environmental benefits."
pub.1047762170,Biofuels and the conundrum of sustainability,"Sustainable energy is the problem of the 21st century. If biofuels want to be part of the solution they must accept a degree of scrutiny unprecedented in the development of a new industry. That is because sustainability deals explicitly with the role of biofuels in ensuring the well-being of our planet, our economy, and our society both today and in the future. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been the standard framework for assessing sustainability of biofuels. These assessments show that corn ethanol has a marginally lower fossil energy and greenhouse gas footprint compared to petroleum fuel. Sugarcane ethanol and some forms of biodiesel offer substantially lower footprints. New biofuels may offer low footprints. The science of LCA is being stretched to its limits as policy makers consider direct and indirect effects of biofuels on global land and water resources, global ecosystems, air quality, public health, and social justice."

The dependence on fossil fuels further exacerbates society's bleak environmental conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to explore alternative solutions to preserve our nation's water resources properly and promote the production of biofuels. Research into the utilization of <i>E. crassipes</i> to remove heavy metals and generate biofuels is extensive. The combination of these two lines of inquiry presents an excellent opportunity to achieve sustainable development goals. This study aims to develop a sustainable wastewater treatment system and generate biohydrogen from dry, pulverized <i>E. crassipes</i> biomass. A treatment system was implemented to treat 1 L of industrial waste. The interconnected compartment system was built by utilizing recycled PET bottles to generate biohydrogen by reusing the feedstock for the treatment process. The production of biological hydrogen through dark fermentation, using biomass containing heavy metals as a biohydrogen source, was studied. Cr (VI) and Pb (II) levels had a low impact on hydrogen production. The uncontaminated biomass of <i>E. crassipes</i> displayed a significantly higher hydrogen yield (81.7 mL H<sub>2</sub>/g glucose). The presence of Cr (IV) in <i>E. crassipes</i> leads to a decrease in biohydrogen yield by 14%, and the presence of Pb (II) in <i>E. crassipes</i> leads to a decrease in biohydrogen yield of 26%. This work proposes a strategy that utilizes green technologies to recover and utilize contaminated water.

This study investigates biogas efficiency enhancement through anaerobic digestion coupled with solar thermal (ST) pretreatment and digestate application in Napier grass cultivation (STAD-G). ST pretreatment at 40-60 °C for 20 h markedly increases methane yield, validated by pilot-scale trials that exhibited a 3.9-fold surge in methane production, attributed to improved acidification. Untreated manure's structure, however, impedes acidification, slowing methanogenesis as shown by lower volatile fatty acid concentration in effluents. In addition, utilizing digestate as soil conditioner notably improves grass yield (19.3 ± 0.8 ton dry/ha/year) and protein content, akin to urea fertilizer. Furthermore, the STAD-G system incurs higher upfront costs, it yields superior biogas efficiency and enhanced long-term financial returns.

This work reviews the distinct properties of FWD and the existing treatment technologies. FWD shows great prospects as a nutrient source for microalgal cultivation and biofuel production. Emerging technologies such as thermal conversion (e.g., pyrolysis and hydrothermal treatment) of FWD into value-added products such as functionalised biochar/hydrochar with diverse applications would be attractive and warrant further research investigation. Integrated AD with subsequent valorisation facilities is highly encouraged to achieve complete utilisation of resources and reduce carbon emissions."
pub.1166985405,Bacillus genus industrial applications and innovation: First steps towards a circular bioeconomy,"In recent decades, environmental concerns have directed several policies, investments, and production processes. The search for sustainable and eco-friendly strategies is constantly increasing to reduce petrochemical product utilization, fossil fuel pollution, waste generation, and other major ecological impacts. The concepts of circular economy, bioeconomy, and biorefinery are increasingly being applied to solve or reduce those problems, directing us towards a greener future. Within the biotechnology field, the Bacillus genus of bacteria presents extremely versatile microorganisms capable of producing a great variety of products with little to no dependency on petrochemicals. They are able to grow in different agro-industrial wastes and extreme conditions, resulting in healthy and environmentally friendly products, such as foods, feeds, probiotics, plant growth promoters, biocides, enzymes, and bioactive compounds. The objective of this review was to compile the variety of products that can be produced with Bacillus cells, using the concepts of biorefinery and circular economy as the scope to search for greener alternatives to each production method and providing market and bioeconomy ideas of global production. Although the genus is extensively used in industry, little information is available on its large-scale production, and there is little current data regarding bioeconomy and circular economy parameters for the bacteria. Therefore, as this work gathers several products' economic, production, and environmentally friendly use information, it can be addressed as one of the first steps towards those sustainable strategies. Additionally, an extensive patent search was conducted, focusing on products that contain or are produced by the Bacillus genus, providing an indication of global technology development and direction of the bacteria products. The Bacillus global market represented at least $18 billion in 2020, taking into account only the products addressed in this article, and at least 650 patent documents submitted per year since 2017, indicating this market's extreme importance. The data we provide in this article can be used as a base for further studies in bioeconomy and circular economy and show the genus is a promising candidate for a greener and more sustainable future."
pub.1008874306,Tailoring lignin biosynthesis for efficient and sustainable biofuel production,"Increased global interest in a bio-based economy has reinvigorated the research on the cell wall structure and composition in plants. In particular, the study of plant lignification has become a central focus, with respect to its intractability and negative impact on the utilization of the cell wall biomass for producing biofuels and bio-based chemicals. Striking progress has been achieved in the last few years both on our fundamental understanding of lignin biosynthesis, deposition and assembly, and on the interplay of lignin synthesis with the plant growth and development. With the knowledge gleaned from basic studies, researchers are now able to invent and develop elegant biotechnological strategies to sophisticatedly manipulate the quantity and structure of lignin and thus to create economically viable bioenergy feedstocks. These concerted efforts open an avenue for the commercial production of cost-competitive biofuel to meet our energy needs. "
pub.1114525476,Economic feasibility and long-term sustainability criteria on the path to enable a transition from fossil fuels to biofuels,"Currently the production of liquid biofuels relies on plant biomass, which in turn depends on the photosynthetic conversion of light and CO<sub>2</sub> into chemical energy. As a consequence, the process is renewable on a far shorter time-scale than its fossil counterpart, thus rendering a potential to reduce the environmental impact of the transportation sector. However, the global economy is not intensively pursuing this route, as current generation biofuel production does not meet two key criteria: (1) economic feasibility and (2) long-term sustainability. Herein, we argue that microalgal systems are valuable alternatives to consider, although it is currently technologically immature and therefore not possible to reach criterion 1, nor evaluate criterion 2. In this review we discuss the major limiting factors for this technology and highlight how further research efforts could be deployed to concretize an industrial reality."
pub.1165655712,Harvesting marine plastic pollutants-derived renewable energy: A comprehensive review on applied energy and sustainable approach,"The inevitable use of plastics in the existing standard of life makes its way to ecosystems, predominantly into the marine ecosystem. Recent research on energy recycling from marine discarded plastics through biological, chemical, and thermal processes is summarized, which degrade plastic debris and transform it into energy-efficient products. In a system-oriented approach, different boundaries like carbon efficiency, global warming potential, cumulative energy demand, and cost of the product have been evaluated. Even these technologies may successfully reduce the yearly volume of marine plastics by up to 89% while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30%. Conversely, recycling a ton of marine discarded plastics may save 915 cubic feet of landfill space, 6500 kWh of energy, and barrels of oil. Energy may be recovered up to 79% from waste plastics using various techniques. Up to 84% liquid fuel had been generated, with a maximum calorific power of 45 MJ/kg. It has been shown that in Asian countries, the power generation capacity of throw-away facemask wastes regularly varies from 2256 kWh/day to 18.52 million kWh/day. Hence, the conversion of marine plastics into biofuel, syngas, biochar, hydrocarbons, electricity, and value-added functional materials by various biotechnological and chemical processes like biodegradation, pyrolysis, gasification, methanolysis, and hydrolysis should be improvised as a source of alternative energy in the immediate future. Our review signifies the potential benefits of energy harvesting technologies from marine plastics pollutants to overcome the growing challenge of energy demands and provide a long-term solution to underdeveloped and developing countries as a sustainable source of energy. Endorsing current strategies to harvest energy from marine plastic wastes that enhance power generation technologies will help in building a more sustainable and greener environment that imparts a healthy and circular economy while shielding natural resources."

As a result, research on turbines and internal combustion engines for electricity generation is increasingly focusing on using vaporized ethanol as a fuel substitute. However, the high cost of analyzing the chemical composition of these fuels often leads to an oversight of their impact on combustion characteristics, such as flame behavior, emission profiles, and temperature distribution.This study employs a statistical approach to assess the combustion and emission characteristics of biofuels, aiming to find suitable alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. By integrating considerations of oil price fluctuations and the digital economy's impact, the research proposes a cost-effective method for evaluating the chemical makeup of vaporized fuels and their effects on post-combustion pollution.Experimental data reveal that alternative fuels can offer stable ignition performance and lower pollution levels, contingent on their specific properties. Fuels with high aromatic content and viscosity tend to produce significant CO emissions, while reducing these characteristics may increase CO2 production. The study also highlights the challenge of simultaneously reducing both CO and NOx emissions. Additionally, the findings show that petroleum gasoline, due to its lower volatility, has favorable fire safety properties and generates fewer pollutants.In the context of economic pressures from rising oil prices and inflation, this research underscores the importance of exploring biofuels as viable, sustainable alternatives for the future energy landscape."

pub.1163426940,Can bioenergy act as an entrepreneurial opportunity for the sustainable economic development of an emerging economy? A socio-technical approach,"Challenges in adopting renewable energy have become significant roadblocks to the country’s sustainable progress. There is a shortage of studies examining how adopting biogas energy plants affects entrepreneurship in Pakistan’s off-grid areas. This study aims to address this gap in the literature by investigating bioenergy as an entrepreneurial opportunity for the sustainable economic development of an emerging economy. Primary data comprising 305 respondents was used in Punjab Province by employing an inclusive questionnaire survey. The partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique validates the model and analyzes the designated hypotheses. Empirical outcomes reveal that enhanced social and entrepreneurial prosperity adopting biogas plants, sustainable economic development of entrepreneurial businesses adopting biogas plants, and adoption in entrepreneurship improve the standard of living positively and significantly associated with intention to enhance entrepreneurship performance through biogas energy adoption. On the contrary, the production-cost reduction of adopting biogas plants in entrepreneurial businesses had no significant effect on intention to improve entrepreneurship performance through biogas energy adoption. Meanwhile, the intention to enhance entrepreneurship performance through biogas energy adoption positively mediates the relationship among enhanced social and entrepreneurial prosperity adopting biogas plants, sustainable economic development of entrepreneurial businesses adopting biogas plants, biogas plant adoption in entrepreneurship improves the standard of living, and economic development of entrepreneurial activities adopting biogas technology. Correspondingly, social media and word of mouth significantly moderate the relationships between the intention to enhance entrepreneurship performance through biogas energy adoption and the economic development of entrepreneurial activities adopting biogas energy. The results of this study show how crucial it is to change societal norms surrounding entrepreneurship, raise entrepreneurs’ awareness of these issues, reform regulatory systems, and emphasize the benefits of entrepreneurial activities offered by biogas energy plants that grow entrepreneurs’ standard of living. Finally, the study’s limitations and recommendations for additional studies are highlighted."
pub.1163123868,Green investing in China's air cargo industry: Opportunities and challenges for sustainable transportation,"Aviation cargo remains vital in the economic activities to transported goods from one place to another. The developed and developing countries mainly consider the transaction routes for air transportation for safe and quickest mode. Chinese economy is attracting the global World through its exports. The country's air cargo system is mainly reliant on gasoline and petroleum-based fuels, which harms the country's green transportation agenda. The high use of fuel combustions in the aviation sector needed greenfield investment that helps to use green energy as an alternative sustainable fuel. Further, sustainable aviation insurance and financial coverage are needed to mitigate the adverse negative externalities from air cargo operations. Based on the crucial facts, the study used air cargo operations, transportation fuel combustions, private investment in the transportation and insurance coverage in the pollution damage function for the China economy using data from 1975 to 2020. The research employed a non-linear ARDL Bounds testing strategy to break down the sequence of variables into dynamic positive and negative multipliers. Positive shocks in air freight, insurance services, and greenfield investment have been shown to reduce carbon emissions immediately and over the long term. In the short term, carbon damages are exacerbated by the negative shocks resulting from the use of transportation fuel and the availability of insurance. Moreover, both the positive and negative shocks associated with transportation fuel combustions and air transportation freights contribute to a rise in carbon damage. The variance decomposition analysis validated the asymmetric correlations between the aforementioned variables in the intertemporal environment. Based on the findings, negative shocks from total fuel combustions are expected to impose the greatest carbon damages over the next decade, followed by insurance services and air freight operations. The study concludes that air cargo operations need to be sustainable transacting routes fueled by biofuel energy sources, greenfield investment, and sustainable aviation insurance coverage to achieve the 'green is clean' transportation agenda."

This attribute also makes this technology a viable partner in pursuing a circular economic model. However, the poor biogas output of typical substrates like sewage sludge and animal manure and the hefty installation costs limit its viability. This review paper with literature analysis provides a good grasp of the anaerobic co-digesting process with diverse food digestion methods. In this survey, we have analyzed the Anaerobic Digestion of water waste, food waste, and animal manure and the anaerobic co-digestion of animal waste with water waste and food waste with water waste. This analysis demonstrates that anaerobic co-digestion produces more methane biogas than anaerobic digestion. Also, it has been shown that by adjusting the ratio of food and animal waste to water waste, we can produce more methane. In the future, we would like to supplement anaerobic co-digestion by altering the proportion of different wastes that are mixed with water waste in order to increase methane production."

This work examines the combined effect of two factors: final pyrolysis temperature (°C) and MSS moisture content (%) on pyrogenic product yields and characteristics. A centered composite experimental design (CCD) is established for pyrolysis process optimization by adopting the response surface methodology (RSM). The statistical results indicate that the optimal conditions considering all studied factors and responses are 550 °C as final pyrolysis temperature and 15% as MSS moisture content. In these optimal conditions, biofuels yield is around 48 wt%, whereas biochar yield is about 52 wt%. The pyrolysis products characterizations reveal that (i) pyrolytic oil has a complex molecular composition rich with n-alkanes, n-alkenes, carboxylic acids, and aromatic compounds; (ii) bio-oil presents a high-energy content (high heating value HHV around 30.6 MJ/kg); (iii) syngas mixture has a good calorific value (HHV up to 8 MJ/kg), which could be used as renewable energy vector or for pyrolysis reactor heating; and (iv) biochar residue has good aliphatic and oxygenated group contents favoring its application as biofertilizer. These findings suggest that MSS conversion into biofuels and biochar is an appropriate approach for MSS treatment. MSS-to-energy could be proposed as an element for circular economy concept due to its effectiveness in producing high value-added and sustainable products and reducing environmental problems linked to MSS disposal."

Therefore, an ecofriendly and sustainable solution should be established for a circular economy where infinite resources, such as agro-industrial wastes, are fully utilized as substrates in the production of target value-added chemicals. Hereby, recent advances in metabolic engineering strategies and techniques used in the development of microbial cell factories for enhanced production of three-carbon platform chemicals such as lactic acid, propionic acid, and 3-hydroxypropionic acid are discussed. Further developments and future perspectives in the production of these organic acids from agro-industrial wastes from the dairy, sugar, and biodiesel industries are also highlighted to demonstrate the importance of waste-based biorefineries for organic acid production."
pub.1144859942,A review of advances in valorization and post-treatment of anaerobic digestion liquid fraction effluent,"Traditionally, digestate is considered a waste, which is used as fertiliser in the agriculture industry. Recent studies focus on increasing the profitability of digestate by extracting reusable nutrients to promote biogas plants cost-effectiveness, sustainable management and circular economy. This review focuses on the post-treatment and valorization of liquor which is produced by solid-liquid fractioning of digestate. Nutrient recovery and removal from liquor are possible through mechanical, physicochemical and biological procedures. The processes discussed involve complex procedures that differ in economic value, feasibility, legislative restrictions and performance. The parameters that should be considered to employ these techniques are influenced by liquor characteristics, topography, climate conditions and available resources. These are key parameters to keep in mind during designing and manufacturing a biogas plant. In the following chapters, a discussion on available liquor treatment methods takes place. The present study examines the critical aspects of the available liquor treatment methods."
pub.1182063333,Valorizing Waste Streams to Enhance Sustainability and Economics in Microbial Oil Production,"Driven by demand for more sustainable products, research and capital investment has been committed to developing microbially produced oils. While researchers have shown oleaginous yeasts and other microbes can produce low-carbon footprint oils by leveraging waste streams as energy sources, previous analyses have not fully explored the quantity of available waste streams and in turn economy-of-scale enabled on capital and operating expenses. This paper makes parallels to 2G ethanol facilities, enabling a data-driven understanding of large-scale production economics. Production costs are broken down for a variety of scenarios. The analysis finds that reaching price parity with large-scale commodity oils (e.g., palm oil, high-oleic cooking oils, biofuels feedstock oils, lauric acid) is not possible today and unlikely even under aggressive future assumptions about strain productivity. Instead, commercial production must be targeted at end markets where sustainability-conscious consumers are willing to pay the price premiums identified in this paper."

pub.1153123857,Regio- and stereoselective biocatalytic hydration of fatty acids from waste cooking oils en route to hydroxy fatty acids and bio-based polyesters,"The development of biorefinery approaches is of great relevance for the sustainable production of valuable compounds. In accordance with circular economy principles, waste cooking oils (WCOs) are renewable resources and biorefinery feedstocks, which contribute to a reduced impact on the environment. Frequently, this waste is wrongly disposed of into municipal sewage systems, thereby creating problems for the environment and increasing treatment costs in wastewater treatment plants. In this study, regenerated WCOs, which were intended for the production of biofuels, were transformed through a chemo-enzymatic approach to produce hydroxy fatty acids, which were further used in polycondensation reaction for polyester production. Escherichia coli whole cell biocatalyst containing the recombinantly produced Elizabethkingia meningoseptica Oleate hydratase (Em_OhyA) was used for the biocatalytic hydration of crude WCOs-derived unsaturated free fatty acids for the production of hydroxy fatty acids. Further hydrogenation reaction and methylation of the crude mixture allowed the production of (R)- 10-hydroxystearic acid methyl ester that was further purified with a high purity (> 90%), at gram scale. The purified (R)- 10-hydroxystearic acid methyl ester was polymerized through a polycondensation reaction to produce the corresponding polyester. This work highlights the potential of waste products to obtain bio-based hydroxy fatty acids and polyesters through a biorefinery approach."

Our activity drives the steady increase in global temperature observed in recent decades. The realization of the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, together with declining petroleum reserves, has ensured that the quest for sustainable and environmentally benign sources of energy for our industrial economies and consumer societies has become urgent in recent years. Consequently, there is renewed interest in the production and use of fuels from plants. The 'first-generation' biofuels made from starch and sugar appear unsustainable because of the potential stress that their production places on food commodities. Second-generation biofuels, produced from cheap and abundant plant biomass, are seen as the most attractive solution to this problem, but a number of technical hurdles must be overcome before their potential is realized. This review will focus on the underpinning research necessary to enable the cost-effective production of liquid fuels from plant biomass, with a particular focus on aspects related to plant cell walls and their bioconversion."
pub.1146051262,"Towards a sustainable waste-to-energy pathway to pequi biomass residues: Biochar, syngas, and biodiesel analysis","The waste-to-energy (WTE) valorization pathway of Caryocar brasiliense (pequi) seeds was investigated via pyrolysis, gasification, and transesterification to understand its potential as biochar, syngas, and biodiesel. First, the pyrolysis (300-700 °C) was conducted in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere for pequi seeds (PS) and pequi seeds without its extractives (PSWE), characterizing its biochar properties. The PSWE was then gasified at 1000 °C under O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub> atmospheres to evaluate the characteristics of the producer gas. The PS extractives were then transesterified and characterized for biodiesel production. Finally, a multiple-criteria decision analysis assessed the PS products' potential within the thermochemical routes. The results evidenced better biochar (up to 22.29% HHV enhancement, higher mass and energy yield, up to 75.9 and 85.5% reduction of O/C and H/C, respectively, and enriched N content) via PSWE pyrolysis than PS considering biofuel application and optimistic perceptions for soil amendment. This indicates that the preceding extraction of vegetal fat from PS strengthens the WTE by including further processing of extracted oil. The produced syngas under O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub> gasification atmosphere showed better applicability as a biofuel (16.37 MJ·kg<sup>-1</sup> lower heating value, 107.33% cold gas efficiency, and 113.55% carbon conversion efficiency) with up to 24% higher success rate. The transesterification of the extractives revealed its potential (98% conversion rate) for use as feedstock for in situ power generation, or blended for biodiesel production. The results provide insights into the circular economy in agro-extractivist communities that may support Brazil's small and medium agro-food industries with their energy demands."
pub.1171645353,Utilization of plant-derived wastes as the potential biohydrogen source: a sustainable strategy for waste management,"The sustainable economy has shown a renewed interest in acquiring access to the resources required to promote innovative practices that favor recycling and the reuse of existing, unconsidered things over newly produced ones. The production of biohydrogen through dark anaerobic fermentation of organic wastes is one of the intriguing possibilities for replacing fossil-based fuels through the circular economy. At present, plant-derived waste from the agro-based industry is the main global concern. When these wastes are improperly disposed of in landfills, they become the habitat for several pathogens. Additionally, it contaminates surface water as a result of runoff, and the leachate that is created from the waste enters groundwater and degrades its quality. However, cellulose and hemicellulose-rich plant wastes from agriculture fields and agro-based industries have been employed as the most efficient feedstock since carbohydrates are the primary substrate for the synthesis of biohydrogen. To produce biohydrogen from plant-derived wastes on a large scale, it is necessary to explore comprehensive knowledge of lab-scale parameters and pretreatment strategies. This paper summarizes the problems associated with the improper management of plant-derived wastes and discusses the recent developments in dark fermentation and substrate pretreatment techniques with the goal of gaining significant insight into the biohydrogen production process. It also highlights the utilization of anaerobic digestate, which is left over after biohydrogen gas as feedstock for the development of value-added products such as volatile fatty acids (VFA), biochar, and biofertilizer."

Biomass is highly significant in a circular economy in terms of material products and the provision of energy. To establish a circular bioeconomy, the practical implications of biomass use need to be appreciated by stakeholders throughout the value chain, from product design to waste management. This review addresses sustainable biomass production and its function as a feedstock from a European perspective. Anaerobic digestion of food waste is used as a case study to represent appropriate waste treatments. Crucial challenges are (1) Uncoupling the petrochemical industry and biomass production with renewable fertilisers; (2) Providing plentiful biomass for bio-based products by prioritising other renewable sources of energy; (3) Waste arising from food and agriculture must be minimised and returned to the economy; (4) Enhancing stakeholder cooperation across value chains."

The circular economy can contribute to the UN SDGs and micro-organisms are central to circular nutrient cycles. The circular economy as described by the Ellen MacArthur foundation has two halves, i.e. technical and biological. On the technical side, non-biological resources enter manufacturing paths where resource efficiency, renewable energy and design extend the life of materials so that they are more easily reused and recycled. Biological resources exist on the other half of the circular economy. These are used to manufacture products such as bioplastics and paper. The conservation of nature's stocks, resource efficiency and recycling of materials are key facets of the biological half of the circular economy. Microbes play a critical role in both the biological and technical parts of the circular economy. Microbes are key to a functioning circular economy, where natural resources, including biological wastes, are converted by microbes into products of value and use for society, e.g. biogas, bioethanol, bioplastics, building block chemicals and compost for healthy soils. In more recent times, microbes have also been seen as part of the tool kit in the technical side of the circular economy, where microbial enzymes can degrade plastics and microbes can convert those monomers to value-added products."

Consequently, the concept of carbon neutrality has become a vital policy approach for countries to achieve sustainable development. The present study extends the debates on carbon neutrality by examining the extent to which prominent factors such as natural resource dependence, eco-innovation, and green energy (biofuel and renewable energy) facilitate or hinder strides toward achieving carbon neutral environment in G7 economies. The study considers the additional roles of carbon tax, environmental policy stringency, and financial development in longitudinal data ranging from 1997 to 2019. The verification of the stated hypotheses hinges on a battery of estimators comprising cross-sectional ARDL, common correlated effects mean group, augmented mean group, and panel quantile regression. The empirical findings show that green energy, carbon tax, and environmental policy support the drive towards carbon neutrality by reducing the stock of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. On the other hand, natural resource dependence and financial development hinder the carbon neutrality agenda by escalating the surge in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Robustness analyses are conducted from the angle of an additional outcome variable and estimation technique of which the results corroborate the empirical regularity of the main findings. Policy implications are derived from the empirical findings."

There is no doubt about the necessity to produce renewable bioenergy and bio-sourced chemicals to replace fossil-derived compounds. Under this scenario, strong efforts have been devoted to efficiently use organic waste as feedstock for biohydrogen production via dark fermentation. However, the technoeconomic viability of this process needs to be enhanced by the valorization of the residual streams generated. The use of dark fermentation effluents as low-cost carbon source for microalgae cultivation arises as an innovative approach for bioproducts generation (e.g., biodiesel, bioactive compounds, pigments) that maximizes the carbon recovery. In a biorefinery context, after value-added product extraction, the spent microalgae biomass can be further valorised as feedstock for biohydrogen production. This integrated process would play a key role in the transition towards a circular economy. This review covers recent advances in microalgal cultivation on dark fermentation effluents (DFE).

Pyrolysis is a chemical recycling technique useful for unrecyclable plastic wastes that produce gas, liquid (oil), and solid (char) products. Although the pyrolysis technique has been extensively studied and there are several installations applying it on the industrial scale, no commercial applications for the solid product have been found yet. In this scenario, the use of plastic-based char for the biogas upgrading may be a sustainable way to transform the solid product of pyrolysis into a particularly beneficial material. This paper reviews the preparation and main parameters of the processes affecting the final textural properties of the plastic-based activated carbons. Moreover, the application of those materials for the CO<sub>2</sub> capture in the processes of biogas upgrading is largely discussed."

pub.1146069831,A perspective on the combination of alkali pre-treatment with bioaugmentation to improve biogas production from lignocellulose biomass,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a bioprocess technology that integrates into circular economy systems, which produce renewable energy and biofertilizer whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, improvements in biogas production efficiency are needed in dealing with lignocellulosic biomass. The state-of-the-art of AD technology is discussed, with emphasis on feedstock digestibility and operational difficulty. Solutions to these challenges including for pre-treatment and bioaugmentation are reviewed. This article proposes an innovative integrated system combining alkali pre-treatment, temperature-phased AD and bioaugmentation techniques. The integrated system as modelled has a targeted potential to achieve a biodegradability index of 90% while increasing methane production by 47% compared to conventional AD. The methane productivity may also be improved by a target reduction in retention time from 30 to 20 days. This, if realized has the potential to lower energy production cost and the levelized cost of abatement to facilitate an increased resource of sustainable commercially viable biomethane."

fossil resource depletion have triggered ambitious national/regional policies to develop biofuel and bioenergy roles within the overall energy portfolio to achieve decarbonising the global economy and increase energy security. With the 10 % binding target for the transport sector, the Renewable Energy Directive confirms the EU’s commitment to renewable transport fuels especially advanced biofuels. Imola is an elite poplar clone crossed from Populus deltoides Bartr. and Populus nigra L. by Research Units for Intensive Wood Production, Agriculture Research Council in Italy. This study examines its suitability for plantation cultivation under short or very short rotation coppice regimes as a potential lignocellulosic feedstock for the production of ethanol as a transport biofuel. A life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was used to model the cradle-to-gate environmental profile of Imola-derived biofuel benchmarked against conventional fossil gasoline. Specific attention was given to analysing the agroecosystem fluxes of carbon and nitrogen occurring in the cultivation of the Imola biomass in the biofuel life cycle using a process-oriented biogeochemistry model (DeNitrification-DeComposition) specifically modified for application to 2G perennial bioenergy crops and carbon and nitrogen cycling.ResultsOur results demonstrate that carbon and nitrogen cycling in perennial crop–soil ecosystems such as this example can be expected to have significant effects on the overall environmental profiles of 2G biofuels. In particular, soil carbon accumulation in perennial biomass plantations is likely to be a significant component in the overall greenhouse gas balance of future biofuel and other biorefinery products and warrants ongoing research and data collection for LCA models. We conclude that bioethanol produced from Imola represents a promising alternative transport fuel offering some savings ranging from 35 to 100 % over petrol in global warming potential, ozone depletion and photochemical oxidation impact categories.ConclusionsVia comparative analyses for Imola-derived bioethanol across potential supply chains, we highlight priority issues for potential improvement in 2G biofuel profiling. Advanced clones of poplar such as Imola for 2G biofuel production in Italy as modelled here show potential to deliver an environmentally sustainable lignocellulosic biorefinery industry and accelerate advanced biofuel penetration in the transport sector."

pub.1147834039,Fine-tuned regulation of photosynthetic performance via γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) supply coupled with high initial cell density culture for economic starch production in microalgae,"Microalgal starch is considered as renewable and sustainable feedstock for biofuels and biorefinery. High cell density culture is favourable for photoautotrophic starch production in microalgae in the aspects of productivity and economy, but it often encounters low starch content or extra stress exposure that limits the production. This study aimed to economically enhance photosynthetic starch production from CO2 fixation in a green microalga Tetraselmis subcordiformis by regulating photosynthetic stress status with a signalling molecule γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) combined with the application of high initial cell density culture. By increasing initial cell density (ICD) from the normal of 1.1 g L−1 (NICD) to as high as 2.8 g L−1 (HICD), the starch content, yield, and theoretical productivity were improved by 7%, 63%, and 42%, respectively. The addition of GABA under HICD resulted in 14%, 19%, and 26% of further enhancement in starch content, yield, and theoretical productivity, respectively. GABA exhibited distinct regulatory mechanisms on photosynthesis and stress status under HICD relative to NICD. GABA augmented excessive light energy absorption and electron transfer through photosystem II that reinforced the photoinhibition under NICD, while alleviated the stress reversely under HICD, both of which facilitated starch production by enabling a suitable stress status while simultaneously maintaining a sufficient photosynthetic activity. The increase of ICD and/or GABA supply particularly boosted amylopectin accumulation, leading to the changes in starch composition and was more favourable for fermentation-based biofuels production. Preliminary techno-economic analysis showed that the highest net extra benefit of 9.64 $ m−3 culture could be obtained under HICD with 2.5 mM GABA supply where high starch content (62%DW) and yield (2.5 g L−1) were achieved. The combined HICD-GABA regulation was a promising strategy for economic starch production from CO2 by microalgae for sustainable biomanufacturing.Graphical Abstract"

pub.1175691804,LCA analysis for assessing environmenstal sustainability of new biobased chemicals by valorising citrus waste,"The global shift towards using biomass for biofuels and chemicals is accelerating due to increasing environmental concerns and geopolitical strategies. This study investigates a biorefinery model using citrus-processing-waste, specifically citrus pulp, to produce high-value products for various industries, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, and food packaging. In Italy, particularly Sicily region, citrus processing generates significant amounts of waste, often improperly disposed of, contributing to environmental problems. Researchers have demonstrated that citrus waste can yield commercially valuable compounds. This study specifically focuses on orange peel waste (OPW), which constitutes about half of the fruit's weight, aiming to extract pectin and limonene through a combined process. The extraction process was carried out on a laboratory scale, and its sustainability was evaluated using a life cycle assessment (LCA) with SimaPro 8.1 software and the Impact 2002 + method. The functional unit adopted for this study is 300 g of OPW, obtained after the pre-treatment phase, from which 0.14 g of limonene and 8.22 g of pectin were extracted. The LCA results revealed that pectin extraction has a significantly higher environmental impact compared to limonene extraction, primarily due to the use of ethanol as a solvent, followed by electricity consumption. To mitigate this impact, the LCA assessed alternative, more sustainable solvents, resulting in a 73.4% reduction in the environmental footprint of the pectin extraction process. These findings underscore the critical role of LCA, even at the laboratory scale, in identifying environmental hotspots and providing insights for improving and optimizing processes for potential industrial-scale applications."
pub.1144368202,Prospects of utilizing seawater as a reaction medium for pretreatment and saccharification of rice straw,"The transition towards a bio-based economy has led to an unprecedented surge in fresh water consumption that renders biofuel a high water footprint product. The depleting fresh water resources have exacerbated the situation which necessitates the exploration of non-potable water for biorefinery purposes. In the current study, seawater is used as a plausible alternative reaction medium for pretreatment and saccharification of rice straw. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was employed to model, predict and validate cellulose release and reducing sugar yield from rice straw subjected to microwave-NaOH pretreatment. The optimized pretreatment conditions were determined to be 8.54% substrate loading, 1.94% NaOH and 4.09 min which resulted in the maximum cellulose release of 65.43% and reducing sugar yield of 0.554 g/g. Several physico-chemical studies of the raw and pretreated biomass were carried out using bomb calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) to examine the efficacy of pretreatment. Evidences of an apparent delignification was substantiated by the increase in surface area from 7.719 to 44.188 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>and pore volume from 0.039 to 0.071 mlg<sup>-1</sup> which was consistent with the decrease in energy density and distorted surface morphology of the pretreated biomass. Further, the FTIR revealed a reduced peak in the absorption spectral bands at 1636 cm<sup>-1</sup> which confirmed the pretreatment mediated degradation of lignin and hemicellulose. This finding provides evidence on the prospects of utilizing abundantly available seawater resource as a reaction medium for sustainable biofuel production."

pub.1084503331,Sustainability Evaluation,"The long-term substitution of fossil resources can only be achieved through a bio-based economy, with biorefineries and bio-based products playing a major role. However, it is important to assess the implications of the transition to a bio-based economy. Life cycle-based sustainability assessment is probably the most suitable approach to quantify impacts and to identify trade-offs at multiple levels. The extended utilisation of biomass can cause land use change and affect food security of the most vulnerable people throughout the world. Although this is mainly a political issue and governments should be responsible, the responsibility is shifted to companies producing biofuels and other bio-based products. Organic wastes and lignocellulosic biomass are considered to be the preferred feedstock for the production of bio-based products. However, it is unlikely that a bio-based economy can rely only on organic wastes and lignocellulosic biomass.It is crucial to identify potential problems related to socio-economic and environmental issues. Currently there are many approaches to the sustainability of bio-based products, both quantitative and qualitative. However, results of different calculation methods are not necessarily comparable and can cause confusion among decision-makers, stakeholders and the public.Hence, a harmonised, globally agreed approach would be the best solution to secure sustainable biomass/biofuels/bio-based chemicals production and trade, and to avoid indirect effects (e.g. indirect land use change). However, there is still a long way to go.Generally, the selection of suitable indicators that serve the purpose of sustainability assessment is very context-specific. Therefore, it is recommended to use a flexible and modular approach that can be adapted to various purposes. A conceptual model for the selection of sustainability indicators is provided that facilitates identifying suitable sustainability indicators based on relevance and significance in a given context."

In the last several decades, interest in second-generation bioethanol production from non-food lignocellulosic biomass in the form of organic residues rapidly increased because of its abundance, renewability, and low cost. Bioethanol production fits into the strategy of a circular economy and zero waste plans, and using ethanol as an alternative fuel gives the world economy a chance to become independent of the petrochemical industry, providing energy security and environmental safety. However, the conversion of biomass into ethanol is a challenging and multi-stage process because of the variation in the biochemical composition of biomass and the recalcitrance of lignin, the aromatic component of lignocellulose. Therefore, the commercial production of cellulosic ethanol has not yet become well-received commercially, being hampered by high research and production costs, and substantial effort is needed to make it more widespread and profitable. This review summarises the state of the art in bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, highlights the most challenging steps of the process, including pretreatment stages required to fragment biomass components and further enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation, presents the most recent technological advances to overcome the challenges and high costs, and discusses future perspectives of second-generation biorefineries."

Energy generation from renewable energy sources is considered an alternative to achieving carbon neutrality. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a sustainable technology that has been endorsed as a low-carbon technology complimenting both waste management and renewable energy sectors. The AD technology recovers the volatile matter from waste biomass as much as possible to produce biogas, thus reducing carbon emission as compared to open dumping or burning. However, there is a need of compilation of information on how each subsystem in AD contributes to the overall carbon neutrality of the entire system and chances of achieving a circular economy along with it.

Carbon emission mapping of the potential entities involved in AD were identified and perspective to life cycle assessment and future research direction has been pointed out. Climate change impact and acidification potential are the two entities that can influence the overall environmental sustainability of an AD system. It was recognized that each stage of AD system starting from substrate supply chain, biogas production, upgradation, utilization, and digestate application had a remarkable effect on the overall carbon emission potential based on its design, operation, and maintenance. Selection of suitable substrates and co-digesting them together for improved biogas production rate with high methane content and proper digestate post-processing and storage can vastly reduce the carbon emission potential of the AD technology. Further, a case scenario of India was assessed considering the utilization of major surplus biomass available through AD. Re-routing the three major substrates such as agricultural crop residues, animal wastes and organic fraction of municipal solid wastes through AD can reduce at least 3.5-3.8 kg CO<sub>2-eq</sub> per capita of annual carbon emission load in India. Furthermore, the pathways in which the policy and legislations over establishment of AD technology and how to explore linkages between achieving circular economy and low carbon economy for Indian scenario has been highlighted."
pub.1169771195,Addressing raw material variability: In-line FTIR sugar composition analysis of lignocellulosic process streams,"For a sustainable economy, biorefineries that use second-generation feedstocks to produce biochemicals and biofuels are essential. However, the exact composition of renewable feedstocks depends on the natural raw materials used and is therefore highly variable. In this contribution, a process analytical technique (PAT) strategy for determining the sugar composition of lignocellulosic process streams in real-time to enable better control of bioprocesses is presented. An in-line mid-IR probe was used to acquire spectra of ultra-filtered spent sulfite liquor (UF-SSL). Independent partial least squares models were developed for the most abundant sugars in the UF-SSL. Up to 5 sugars were quantified simultaneously to determine the sugar concentration and composition of the UF-SSL. The lowest root mean square errors of the predicted values obtained per analyte were 1.02 g/L arabinose, 1.25 g/L galactose, 0.50 g/L glucose, 1.60 g/L mannose, and 0.85 g/L xylose. Equipped with this novel PAT tool, new bioprocessing strategies can be developed for UF-SSL."

Bio-based fuels and chemicals through the biorefinery approach has gained significant interest as an alternative platform for the petroleum-derived processes as these biobased processes are noticed to have positive environmental and societal impacts. Decades of research was involved in understanding the diversity of microorganisms in different habitats that could synthesize various secondary metabolites that have functional potential as fuels, chemicals, nutraceuticals, food ingredients, and many more. Later, due to the substrate-related process economics, the diverse low-value, high-carbon feedstocks like lignocellulosic biomass, industrial byproducts, and waste streams were investigated to have greater potential. Among them, municipal solid wastes can be used as the source of substrates for the production of commercially viable gaseous and liquid fuels, as well as short-chain fattyacids and carboxylic acids. In this work, technologies and processes demanding the production of value-added products were explained in detail to understand and inculcate the value of municipal solid wastes and the economy, and it can provide to the biorefinery aspect."

pub.1085408255,Towards a sustainable biobased industry – Highlighting the impact of extremophiles,"The transition of the oil-based economy towards a sustainable economy completely relying on biomass as renewable feedstock requires the concerted action of academia, industry, politics and civil society. An interdisciplinary approach of various fields such as microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, genetics, chemical engineering and agriculture in addition to cross-sectional technologies such as economy, logistics and digitalization is necessary to meet the future global challenges. The genomic era has contributed significantly to the exploitation of naturés biodiversity also from extreme habitats. By applying modern technologies it is now feasible to deliver robust enzymes (extremozymes) and robust microbial systems that are active at temperatures up to 120°C, at pH 0 and 12 and at 1000bar. In the post-genomic era, different sophisticated ""omics"" analyses will allow the identification of countless novel enzymes regardless of the lack of cultivability of most microorganisms. Furthermore, elaborate protein-engineering methods are clearing the way towards tailor-made robust biocatalysts. Applying environmentally friendly and efficient biological processes, terrestrial and marine biomass can be converted to high value products e.g. chemicals, building blocks, biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, food, feed and biofuels. Thus, further application of extremophiles has the potential to improve sustainability of existing biotechnological processes towards a greener biobased industry."
pub.1113835400,Sustainable bioconversion of food waste into high-value products by immobilized enzymes to meet bio-economy challenges and opportunities – A review,"Over the past few years, food waste has intensified much attention from the local public, national and international organizations as well as a wider household territory due to increasing environmental, social and economic concerns, climate change and scarcity of fossil fuel resources. On one aspect, food-processing waste represents a substantial ecological burden. On the other hand, these waste streams are rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, thus hold significant potential for biotransformation into an array of high-value compounds. Indeed, the high sugar, protein, and fat content render food waste streams as attractive feedstocks for enzymatic valorization given the plentiful volumes generated annually. Enzymes as industrial biocatalysts offer unique advantages over traditional chemical processes with regard to eco-sustainability, and process efficiency. Herein, an effort has been made to delineate immobilized enzyme-driven valorization of food waste streams into marketable products such as biofuels, bioactive compounds, biodegradable plastics, prebiotics, sweeteners, rare sugars, surfactants, etc. Current challenges and prospects are also highlighted with respect to the development of industrially adaptable biocatalytic systems to achieve the ultimate objectives of sustainable manufacturing combined with minimum waste generation. Applications-based strategies to enzyme immobilization are imperative to design cost-efficient and sustainable industrially applicable biocatalysts. With a deeper apprehension of support material influences, and analyzing the extreme environment, enzymes might have significant potential in improving the overall sustainability of food processing."

The U.S. bioeconomy emerged in the early 2000s as a result of the societal pursuit of energy independence and security, greenhouse gas emission mitigation and sustainable development. Founded on biotechnologies and stimulated by federal policies, the U.S. bioeconomy has been growing rapidly over the past decade. Intensive research and development endeavors have been carried out to explore advanced technologies for efficient biomass production, conversion, and valorization, through which numerous biotechnological innovations have been achieved to realize the commercial, cost-effective production of diverse transportation biofuels and high-value domestic bioproducts from various biomass feedstocks. The bioenergy products currently commercialized in the U.S. include bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, bioheat and biopower; the commercialized bioproducts extend to biopolymers, biochemicals, biopharmaceuticals and bioadhesives. In 2017, more than 65.4 billion liters of biofuels and 2500 certified bioproducts were produced, creating 4 million job opportunities and sharing 2.5% of the U.S. economy. Commercial production of cellulosic ethanol, renewable diesel, green jet fuel and other advanced biofuels remains at the demonstration stage and needs further improvement in cost-competitiveness.

pub.1036118272,Solar Energy to Biofuels,"In a solar economy, sustainably available biomass holds the potential to be an excellent nonfossil source of high energy density transportation fuel. However, if sustainably available biomass cannot supply the liquid fuel need for the entire transport sector, alternatives must be sought. This article reviews biomass to liquid fuel conversion processes that treat biomass primarily as a carbon source and boost liquid fuel production substantially by using supplementary energy that is recovered from solar energy at much higher efficiencies than the biomass itself. The need to develop technologies for an energy-efficient future sustainable transport sector infrastructure that will use different forms of energy, such as electricity, H(2), and heat, in a synergistic interaction with each other is emphasized. An enabling template for such a future transport infrastructure is presented. An advantage of the use of such a template is that it reduces the land area needed to propel an entire transport sector. Also, some solutions for the transition period that synergistically combine biomass with fossil fuels are briefly discussed."

The impact of outdoor pollutant emissions on residents' health, behavior, physical activity, and sleeping behavior is much less explored. Producing biofuels from organic waste has the potential to unite budget-friendliness and long-term sustainability. Primary biofuels are produced specifically to mitigate environmental problems, and secondary biofuels are produced specifically to mitigate other environmental problems. The high level of pollutants ina certain area can severely restrict human activities and ultimately influence their whole life. The study aims to empirically evaluate the influence of nanomaterials pollutants emissions influencing outdoor recreation in China because its economy is based on fast-paced industrialization and urbanization. Various datasets were collected, including domestic and international tourists from the annual statistics for 2011-2020 from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Ten years of annual METAR data of visibility (VR), temperature (T), relative humidity (Demirhan), and wind speed (WS) from 30 metrological stations at international airports. Annual average AOD (Aerosol's Optical Depth), O<sub>3</sub> (Ozone), CO (Carbon Monoxide), SO<sub>4</sub> (Sulphate), and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (Particulate Matter) satellite imageries from 2011 to 2020 were obtained from NASA's official portal. The overall picture of satellite observations of pollutants over China describes that the highest level of AOD was observed in regions with greater population concentration than in other areas.

pub.1174519666,"Investigation and prediction on emissions and performance of CI engine employing binary and ternary blends with Karanja oil, used cooking oil, and Dunaliella salina oil","Massive consumption of fossil fuels and alarming environmental degradation are motivating researchers to learn about alternative fuels. Straight vegetable oils are an alternative to fossil fuels to meet the standards. Microalgae is also a viable carbon–neutral alternative to depleting conventional fuel sources, a solution to the industrial requirement of organic consumables and an option for a green and sustainable economy for biofuels. In the present study, lipid was extracted from Karanja seeds and Dunaliella salina biomass. These were used to prepare different binary and ternary fuel blends with conventional reference diesel fuel with different proportions along with used cooking oil with their concentrations ranging from 10 to 20% (v/v). The influence of these blends on performance and emissions characteristics in CI engines has delved at varying engine loads from 0 to 100%. The binary blend with Dunaliella salina oil has increased the performance characteristics while decreasing all the major emission parameters compared to reference diesel fuel and shows a significant improvement among binary blends. Ternary blends with Dunaliella salina oil, on the other hand, have improved performance while lowering emission parameters when compared to reference diesel fuel and demonstrate a substantial improvement across ternary blends. For predicting the performance and emission characteristics of binary and ternary blends, an artificial neural network-based model was developed. The optimum blends, OB6 (90% RDF, 10% DO) and OB8 (80% RDF, 10% DO, 10% UCO), improved BSFC by 10.71%, BTE by 14.23%, and reduced BSEC by 12.45% at full load. Emissions were generally reduced, with CO2 decreasing by up to 39.39%. The simulation results demonstrated that the created 4–7-7 model was capable of accurately predicting the performance and emission characteristics of various alternative fuel blends and indicating a stronger correlation between the predicted and observed values, having a high correlation coefficient of 0.9974. Binary and ternary blends with straight vegetable oils improved CI engine performance and pollutants compared to reference diesel fuel, indicating they have the potential to replace conventional fuels for sustainable development."

Industrial production of the fifth-generation biofuel methane by microorganisms has the potential to become a crucial biotechnological milestone of the post fossil fuel era. Therefore, reproducible cultivation and scale-up of methanogenic archaea (methanogens) is essential for enabling biomass generation for fundamental studies and for defining peak performance conditions for bioprocess development. This study provides a comprehensive revision of established and optimization of novel methods for the cultivation of the model organism <i>Methanococcus maripaludis</i> S0001.

Concerted efforts are underway to develop sustainable practices for the disposal of residues from the processing of such crops as coffee, sugarcane, or corn. Coffee is crucial to the economies of many countries because its cultivation, processing, trading, and marketing provide employment for millions of people. In coffee-producing countries, improved technology for treatment of the significant amounts of coffee waste is critical to prevent ecological damage. This mini-review discusses a multi-stage biorefinery concept with the potential to convert waste produced at crop processing operations, such as coffee pulping stations, to valuable biofuels and bioproducts using biochemical and thermochemical conversion technologies. The initial bioconversion stage uses a mutant Kluyveromyces marxianus yeast strain to produce bioethanol from sugars. The resulting sugar-depleted solids (mostly protein) can be used in a second stage by the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce bio-based ammonia for fertilizer and are further degraded by Y. lipolytica proteases to peptides and free amino acids for animal feed. The lignocellulosic fraction can be ground and treated to release sugars for fermentation in a third stage by a recombinant cellulosic Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can also be engineered to express valuable peptide products. The residual protein and lignin solids can be jet cooked and passed to a fourth-stage fermenter where Rhodotorula glutinis converts methane into isoprenoid intermediates. The residues can be combined and transferred into pyrocracking and hydroformylation reactions to convert ammonia, protein, isoprenes, lignins, and oils into renewable gas. Any remaining waste can be thermoconverted to biochar as a humus soil enhancer. The integration of multiple technologies for treatment of coffee waste has the potential to contribute to economic and environmental sustainability."

Microalgae possess the flexibility to produce a variety of high-value products of industrial interests. From pigments such as phycobilins or lutein to phycotoxins and several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), microalgae have the potential to become the primary producers for the pharmaceutical, food, and agronomical industries. Also, microalgae require minimal resources to grow due to their autotrophic nature or by consuming waste matter, while allowing for the extraction of several valuable side products such as hydrogen gas and biodiesel in a single process, following a biorefinery agenda. From a Mexican microalgae biodiversity perspective, more than 70 different local species have been characterized and isolated, whereas, only a minimal amount has been explored to produce commercially valuable products, thus ignoring their potential as a locally available resource. In this paper, we discuss the microalgae diversity present in Mexico with their current applications and potential, while expanding on their future applications in bioengineering along with other industrial sectors. In conclusion, the use of available microalgae to produce biochemically revenuable products currently represents an untapped potential that could lead to the solution of several problems through green technologies. As such, if the social, industrial and research communities collaborate to strive towards a greener economy by preserving the existing biodiversity and optimizing the use of the currently available resources, the enrichment of our society and the solution to several environmental problems could be attained."
pub.1103179805,Community response to a sustainable restoration plan for a superfund site,"Large-scale copper (Cu) mining activities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula produced millions of metric tons of mining wastes also known as stamp sands. The stamp sands containing high concentrations of Cu were disposed of into several lakes connected to the Lake Superior. Eventually, as aquatic organisms in these lakes started to exhibit toxicity symptoms, the stamp sands were dredged and discarded on the lake shores. Consequently, these areas turned into degraded, marginal lands and were collectively classified as a Torch Lake Superfund site by the US EPA. Due to the lack of vegetative cover, the Cu-rich stamp sands eroded into the lakes, affecting the aquatic life. To alleviate this issue, a sustainable restoration plan (SRP) was developed and tested in a greenhouse environment prior to field implementation. Cold-tolerant oilseed crops, camelina (Camelina sativa) and field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), were grown on compost-fertilized stamp sands, which reduced soil erosion by acting as a vegetative cap. Oilseed plants produced normal yield, demonstrating their potential utilization as biofuel feedstock. Prior to implementing the SRP in field-scale in the Torch Lake Superfund site, a public opinion survey of the local community was conducted to understand the views of residents. Door-to-door survey was performed in July–August 2015, which yielded a response rate of 68.1%. Results showed that residents were generally concerned with stamp sand erosion into the Torch Lake and were overwhelmingly supportive of the SRP, which would not only provide environmental benefits but could boost the local economy via biofuel production. To gauge the general environmental awareness of the respondents, the survey included questions on climate change. Most of the respondents acknowledged that climate change is real and anthropogenically mediated. Having college education and a relatively high annual household income showed a positive and significant correlation with climate change awareness."

Therefore, the sustainable TS management through advanced valorization technologies becomes vital to align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and mitigate the adverse environmental, health, and social impacts. Moreover, TS, as biomass, can be considered a renewable energy source for bioenergy generation, which could be a viable solution for meeting contemporary environmental standards and expediting transition towards a circular economy. However, TS valorization is sensitive and critical due to the potential risk of transforming Cr(III) to Cr(VI) during the valorization process. Therefore, there is an urgency to consider efficient and holistic TS valorization technologies in the design, implementation, and operations phases to avoid any environmental and health hazards. In pursuit of this goal, this systematic literature review (SLR) comprehensively and critically analyzes the existing TS valorization processes to develop sustainable energy recovery solutions from TS. This SLR contributes uniquely to the existing literature in different ways. Firstly, it provides a critical evaluation of the current TS valorization technologies identifying the available waste-to-energy recovery options. Secondly, the review encompasses extensive research from three reputed databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, without temporal restrictions to offer a comprehensive understanding of current TS management practices and available valorization techniques. Moreover, the review categorized 124 published papers into distinct groups, revealing promising avenues for future research in this field. The findings indicated that most of the work concentrating on Chrome (Cr) recovery, pyrolysis, anaerobic co-digestion, and solidification while gasification and biodiesel or biofuel production from TS remained largely unexplored. Additionally, vital aspects such as process optimization, life cycle assessment of different valorization techniques, environmental, economy, energy, emergy, and exergy (5E) analysis, life cycle energy balance, and techno-economic analysis including exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental are completely absent in the literature. Future studies need to concentrate on process optimization, exergy and energy analysis, and techno-economic assessment including exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analysis to understand the feasibility and environmental benefits of various TS valorization technologies and to develop industry-scale valorization plants for TS management in an economically and ecologically sustainable manner. Moreover, the review will serve as a comprehensive guide for scholars, authorities, and stakeholders to advance research in this field and formulate polic"
pub.1003273266,Biobutanol from cheese whey,"At present, due to environmental and economic concerns, it is urgent to evolve efficient, clean and secure systems for the production of advanced biofuels from sustainable cheap sources. Biobutanol has proved better characteristics than the more widely used bioethanol, however the main disadvantage of biobutanol is that it is produced in low yield and titer by ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) fermentation, this process being not competitive from the economic point of view. In this review we summarize the natural metabolic pathways for biobutanol production by Clostridia and yeasts, together with the metabolic engineering efforts performed up to date with the aim of either enhancing the yield of the natural producer Clostridia or transferring the butanol production ability to other hosts with better attributes for industrial use and facilities for genetic manipulation. Molasses and starch-based feedstocks are main sources for biobutanol production at industrial scale hitherto. We also review herewith (and for the first time up to our knowledge) the research performed for the use of whey, the subproduct of cheese making, as another sustainable source for biobutanol production. This represents a promising alternative that still needs further research. The use of an abundant waste material like cheese whey, that would otherwise be considered an environmental pollutant, for biobutanol production, makes economy of the process more profitable."

To that end, microwave technology has been perceived as a promising solution to process and manage oil palm waste due to its unique and efficient heating mechanism. This review presents an in-depth analysis focusing on microwave-assisted torrefaction, gasification, pyrolysis and advanced pyrolysis of various oil palm wastes. In particular, the products from these thermochemical conversion processes are energy-dense biochar (that could be used as solid fuel, adsorbents for contaminants removal and bio-fertilizer), phenolic-rich bio-oil, and H<sub>2</sub>-rich syngas. However, several challenges, including (1) the lack of detailed study on life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis, (2) limited insights on the specific foreknowledge of microwave interaction with the oil palm wastes for continuous operation, and (3) effects of tunable parameters and catalyst's behavior/influence on the products' selectivity and overall process's efficiency, remain to be addressed in the context of large-scale biomass valorization via microwave technology."

These molecules are well known for their antioxidant and antiradical capacity, besides other specific biological activities, generically involved in the prevention of chronic and degenerative diseases. The project involved the development of methods for the selective extraction of these minor components, using as suitable extraction technique solid phase extraction. All the extracted and purified fractions were evaluated by NMR spectroscopic analyses and UV-Vis spectrophotometric techniques and characterized by quali-quantitative HPLC analyses. TPC (total phenolic content) and TFC (total flavonoid content) were also determined. DPPH and ABTS radical were used to evaluate radical quenching abilities. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), amylase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase were selected as enzymes in the enzyme inhibitory assays. The obtained results showed the presence of a complex group of interesting molecules with strong potential in market applications according to circular economy principles."

The use of cellulolytic enzymes for the production of nanocellulose enables the coproduction of sugars for biofuels production in a format that is largely compatible with the process design employed by modern lignocellulosic (second generation) biorefineries. However, yields of enzymatically produced nanocellulose are typically much lower than those achieved by mineral acid production methods. In this study, we compare the capacity for coproduction of nanocellulose and fermentable sugars using two vastly different cellulase systems: the classical ""free enzyme"" system of the saprophytic fungus, Trichoderma reesei (T. reesei) and the complexed, multifunctional enzymes produced by the hot springs resident, Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (C. bescii). We demonstrate by comparative digestions that the C. bescii system outperforms the fungal enzyme system in terms of total cellulose conversion, sugar production, and nanocellulose production. In addition, we show by multimodal imaging and dynamic light scattering that the nanocellulose produced by the C. bescii cellulase system is substantially more uniform than that produced by the T. reesei system. These disparities in the yields and characteristics of the nanocellulose produced by these disparate systems can be attributed to the dramatic differences in the mechanisms of action of the dominant enzymes in each system."

Owing to the relatively fast growth rate, genetic malleability, and carbon neutral production process, cyanobacteria has been recognized as a specialized microorganism with a significant biotechnological perspective. Metabolically engineering cyanobacterial strains have shown great potential for the photosynthetic production of an array of valuable native or non-native chemicals and metabolites with profound agricultural and pharmaceutical significance using CO<sub>2</sub> as a building block. In recent years, substantial improvements in developing and introducing novel and efficient genetic tools such as genome-scale modeling, high throughput omics analyses, synthetic/system biology tools, metabolic flux analysis and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease (CRISPR/cas) systems have been made for engineering cyanobacterial strains. Use of these tools and technologies has led to a greater understanding of the host metabolism, as well as endogenous and heterologous carbon regulation mechanisms which consequently results in the expansion of maximum productive ability and biochemical diversity. This review summarizes recent advances in engineering cyanobacteria to produce biofuel and industrially relevant fine chemicals of high interest. Moreover, the development and applications of cutting-edge toolboxes such as the CRISPR-cas9 system, synthetic biology, high-throughput ""omics"", and metabolic flux analysis to engineer cyanobacteria for large-scale cultivation are also discussed."

In this review, the status of methane production performance from WWTPs was firstly investigated. Subsequently, based on the identification and classification of methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB), the key enzymes and metabolic pathway of MOB were presented in depth. Then the production, extraction and purification process of high value-added chemicals, including methanol, ectoine, biofuel, bioplastic, methane protein and extracellular polysaccharides, were introduced in detail, which was conducive to understand the bioconversion process of methane. Finally, the use of methane in wastewater treatment process, including nitrogen removal, emerging contaminants removal as well as resource recovery was extensively explored. These findings could provide guidance in the development of sustainable economy and environment, and facilitate biological methane conversion by using MOB in further attempts."
pub.1170769357,Transforming pollution into solutions: A bibliometric analysis and sustainable strategies for reducing indoor microplastics while converting to value-added products,"Microplastics (MPs), as emerging indoor contaminants, have garnered attention due to their ubiquity and unresolved implications for human health. These tiny particles have permeated indoor air and water, leading to inevitable human exposure. Preliminary evidence suggests MP exposure could be linked to respiratory, gastrointestinal, and potentially other health issues, yet the full scope of their effects remains unclear. To map the overall landscape of this research field, a bibliometric analysis based on research articles retrieved from the Web of Science database was conducted. The study synthesizes the current state of knowledge and spotlights the innovative mitigation strategies proposed to curb indoor MP pollution. These strategies involve minimizing the MP emission from source, advancements in filtration technology, aimed at reducing the MP exposure. Furthermore, this research sheds light on cutting-edge methods for converting MP waste into value-added products. These innovative approaches not only promise to alleviate environmental burdens but also contribute to a more sustainable and circular economy by transforming waste into resources such as biofuels, construction materials, and batteries. Despite these strides, this study acknowledges the ongoing challenges, including the need for more efficient removal technologies and a deeper understanding of MPs' health impacts. Looking forward, the study underscores the necessity for further research to fill these knowledge gaps, particularly in the areas of long-term health outcomes and the development of standardized, reliable methodologies for MP detection and quantification in indoor settings. This comprehensive approach paves the way for future exploration and the development of robust solutions to the complex issue of microplastic pollution."
pub.1149734379,Sustainability assessment of waste cooking oil-based biodiesel plant in developing economy based on F-DEMATEL and F-ISM approaches,"Developing clean and renewable energy resources for long-term usage is a crucial concern in developing countries. In this regard, biodiesel technology is drawing a lot of public interest throughout the world. The issues associated with the sustainability of a biodiesel plant are intimately connected with restricted natural resources, political influences, energy independence, economic prosperity and global stability. Therefore, this paper aspires to identify the most influential factors that affect the sustainability of a biodiesel plant and describe interactions among them. The study focuses on identifying 36 factors based on an extensive literature review, questionnaire, experts' opinion and website in the context of developing economies. These factors include social, environmental and economic aspects. A framework based on fuzzy-interpretive structural modelling (F-ISM) and fuzzy-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) is applied to investigate the identified factors. The F-ISM approach allows a better understanding of the contextual interactions between the factors and classify them based on their driving and dependent powers. The fuzzy-DEMATEL technique facilitates in identifying the influential and influenced factors and categorizes them into cause-and-effect groups. The findings of the study suggest that 'Legal and regulatory compliances', 'Political constraints', 'International relations', 'Health and education' and 'Public safety and security' are the five most influential factors that are needed to be addressed for the sustainability of biodiesel plant. The paper also presents a few strategies, which can be applied as a guiding step by the decision-makers to formulate policies for the effective implementation of sustainable growth of the biodiesel plant."
pub.1031599516,Biological reformation of ethanol to hydrogen by Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009,"A future hydrogen economy requires the sustainable production of renewable hydrogen. One method to produce hydrogen from stored renewable energy could be through reformation of bioethanol. However, chemically catalyzed reformation processes, although well studied, still present a number of significant technical challenges. Here, bioreformation of ethanol to hydrogen by photofermentation with the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris is described. Cultures were shown to tolerate up to 2% ethanol. An RSM (response surface methodology) was carried out in which three key factors, light intensity, and ethanol and glutamate concentrations were varied. The results showed that nearly 2mol of H2 could be obtained from one mole of ethanol, 33% of that theoretically possible."
pub.1015757833,"Resource Recovery from Wastewater by Biological Technologies: Opportunities, Challenges, and Prospects","Limits in resource availability are driving a change in current societal production systems, changing the focus from residues treatment, such as wastewater treatment, toward resource recovery. Biotechnological processes offer an economic and versatile way to concentrate and transform resources from waste/wastewater into valuable products, which is a prerequisite for the technological development of a cradle-to-cradle bio-based economy. This review identifies emerging technologies that enable resource recovery across the wastewater treatment cycle. As such, bioenergy in the form of biohydrogen (by photo and dark fermentation processes) and biogas (during anaerobic digestion processes) have been classic targets, whereby, direct transformation of lipidic biomass into biodiesel also gained attention. This concept is similar to previous biofuel concepts, but more sustainable, as third generation biofuels and other resources can be produced from waste biomass. The production of high value biopolymers (e.g., for bioplastics manufacturing) from organic acids, hydrogen, and methane is another option for carbon recovery. The recovery of carbon and nutrients can be achieved by organic fertilizer production, or single cell protein generation (depending on the source) which may be utilized as feed, feed additives, next generation fertilizers, or even as probiotics. Additionlly, chemical oxidation-reduction and bioelectrochemical systems can recover inorganics or synthesize organic products beyond the natural microbial metabolism. Anticipating the next generation of wastewater treatment plants driven by biological recovery technologies, this review is focused on the generation and re-synthesis of energetic resources and key resources to be recycled as raw materials in a cradle-to-cradle economy concept."

The proposed cultivation strategy termed SAR'CENA ('Synergistic Algal Refinery for Circular Economy using Nutrient Analogues), involves integrated cultivation of microalga, Scenedesmus obliquus and marine macroalga, Ulva lactuca in litter to harness biorefinery products. From various litters tested, poultry litter manure (PLM) was most amenable for growth. The microalga yielded 410 ± 6.2 g·DW· m<sup>-2</sup>· d<sup>-1</sup> of biomass with total nitrogen (TN) concentration of 70 mg·L<sup>-1</sup> in the media, while the macroalgae yielded 334 ± 9.9 g DW m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> of biomass with TN concentration of 17.5 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>. The nutrient uptake efficiency was observed to be &gt;60% with uncompromised biomass composition. Thus, SAR'CENA is projected as an ideal farming solution incorporating efficient waste management and feedstock generation thereby establishing a circular economy towards clean energy."
pub.1139736129,Integrated microalgal biorefinery for the production and application of biostimulants in circular bioeconomy,"Adverse detrimental impacts of environmental pollution over the health regimen of people has driven a shift in lifestyle towards cleaner and natural resources, especially in the aspects of food production and consumption. Microalgae are considered a rich source of high value metabolites to be utilized as plant growth biostimulants. These organisms however, are underrated compared to other microbial counterparts, due to inappropriate knowledge on the technical, enviro-economical constrains leading to low market credibility. Thus, to avert these issues, the present review comprehensively discusses the biostimulatory potential of microalgae interactively combined with circular bio-economy perspectives. The biochemical content and intracellular action mechanism of microalgal biostimulants were described. Furthermore, detailed country-wise market trends along with the description of the existing regulatory policies are included. Enviro-techno-economic challenges are discussed, and the consensus need for shift to biorefinery and circular bio-economy concept are emphasized to achieve sustainable impacts during the commercialization of microalgal biostimulants."
pub.1053163557,Multi‐scale modeling for sustainable chemical production,"With recent advances in metabolic engineering, it is now technically possible to produce a wide portfolio of existing petrochemical products from biomass feedstock. In recent years, a number of modeling approaches have been developed to support the engineering and decision-making processes associated with the development and implementation of a sustainable biochemical industry. The temporal and spatial scales of modeling approaches for sustainable chemical production vary greatly, ranging from metabolic models that aid the design of fermentative microbial strains to material and monetary flow models that explore the ecological impacts of all economic activities. Research efforts that attempt to connect the models at different scales have been limited. Here, we review a number of existing modeling approaches and their applications at the scales of metabolism, bioreactor, overall process, chemical industry, economy, and ecosystem. In addition, we propose a multi-scale approach for integrating the existing models into a cohesive framework. The major benefit of this proposed framework is that the design and decision-making at each scale can be informed, guided, and constrained by simulations and predictions at every other scale. In addition, the development of this multi-scale framework would promote cohesive collaborations across multiple traditionally disconnected modeling disciplines to achieve sustainable chemical production.

pub.1155156882,"Opportunities and Challenges for Lignin Valorization in Food Packaging, Antimicrobial, and Agricultural Applications","The exploration of renewable resources is essential to help transition toward a more sustainable materials economy. The valorization of lignin can be a key component of this transition. Lignin is an aromatic polymer that constitutes approximately one-third of the total lignocellulosic biomass and is isolated in huge quantities as a waste material of biofuel and paper production. About 98% of the 100 million tons of lignin produced each year is simply burned as low-value fuel, so this renewable polymer is widely available at very low cost. Lignin has valuable properties that make it a promising material for numerous applications, but it is far from being fully exploited. The aim of this Perspective is to highlight opportunities and challenges for the use of lignin-based materials in food packaging, antimicrobial, and agricultural applications. In the first part, the ongoing research and the possible future developments for the use of lignin as an additive to improve mechanical, gas and UV barrier, and antioxidant properties of food packaging items will be treated. Second, the application of lignin as an antimicrobial agent will be discussed to elaborate on the activity of lignin against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Finally, the use of lignin in agriculture will be presented by focusing on the application of lignin as fertilizer."
pub.1144404169,Challenges of pathogen inactivation in animal manure through anaerobic digestion: a short review,"Animal manure is the main source of bioenergy production by anaerobic digestion (AD). However, the pathogenic bacteria in manure may pose a high risk to human health by contaminating the environment if not effectively inactivated during AD. Worldwide, more than 20,000 biogas plants are running for the treatment of animal manure. AD has been playing the important role in establishing a circular economy in the agricultural sector and may contribute to the United Nations sustainable development goal (UN SDG). Nevertheless, whether AD is a reliable approach for pathogens inactivation has been challenged. A comprehensive understanding of the coping mechanisms of pathogens with adverse conditions and the challenges of establishing the AD process to inactivate effectively pathogens are yet to be analyzed. In this review, the diversity and resistance of pathogens in animal manure are summarized. The efficiencies and the difficulties of their inactivations in AD are also analyzed. In particular, three forms of pathogens i.e. sporing-forming pathogens, viable but non-culturable (VBNC) pathogens, and persistent pathogens are discussed. The factors influencing the pathogens' inactivation and AD efficiencies are analyzed. The trade-off between energy production and pathogens inactivation in an AD system was consequently pointed out. This review concluded that the development of anaerobic processes should meet the goals of high efficient bioenergy production and deep hygienization."
pub.1103786720,Understanding the tolerance of the industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae against a major class of toxic aldehyde compounds,"Development of the next-generation biocatalyst is vital for fermentation-based industrial applications and a sustainable bio-based economy. Overcoming the major class of toxic compounds associated with lignocellulose-to-biofuels conversion is one of the significant challenges for new strain development. A significant number of investigations have been made to understand mechanisms of the tolerance for industrial yeast. It is humbling to learn how complicated the cell’s response to the toxic chemicals is and how little we have known about yeast tolerance in the universe of the living cell. This study updates our current knowledge on the tolerance of industrial yeast against aldehyde inhibitory compounds at cellular, molecular and the genomic levels. It is comprehensive yet specific based on reproducible evidence and cross confirmed findings from different investigations using varied experimental approaches. This research approaches a rational foundation toward a more comprehensive understanding on the yeast tolerance. Discussions and perspectives are also proposed for continued exploring the puzzle of the yeast tolerance to aid the next-generation biocatalyst development."
pub.1152121519,Synthetic methylotrophic yeasts for the sustainable fuel and chemical production,"Global energy-related emissions, in particular carbon dioxide, are rapidly increasing. Without immediate and strong reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5 °C and thus mitigating climate change is beyond reach. In addition to the expansion of renewable energies and the increase in energy efficiency, the so-called Carbon Capture and Utilization technologies represent an innovative approach for closing the carbon cycle and establishing a circular economy. One option is to combine CO2 capture with microbial C1 fermentation. C1-molecules, such as methanol or formate are considered as attractive alternative feedstock for biotechnological processes due to their sustainable production using only CO2, water and renewable energy. Native methylotrophic microorganisms can utilize these feedstock for the production of value-added compounds. Currently, constraints exist regarding the understanding of methylotrophic metabolism and the available genetic engineering tools are limited. For this reason, the development of synthetic methylotrophic cell factories based on the integration of natural or artificial methanol assimilation pathways in biotechnologically relevant microorganisms is receiving special attention. Yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica are capable of producing important products from sugar-based feedstock and the switch to produce these in the future from methanol is important in order to realize a CO2-based economy that is independent from land use. Here, we review historical biotechnological applications, the metabolism and the characteristics of methylotrophic yeasts. Various studies demonstrated the production of a broad set of promising products from fine chemicals to bulk chemicals by applying methylotrophic yeasts. Regarding synthetic methylotrophy, the deep understanding of the methylotrophic metabolism serves as the basis for microbial strain engineering and paves the way towards a CO2-based circular bioeconomy. We highlight design aspects of synthetic methylotrophy and discuss the resulting chances and challenges using non-conventional yeasts as host organisms. We conclude that the road towards synthetic methylotrophic yeasts can only be achieved through a combination of methods (e.g., metabolic engineering and adaptive laboratory evolution). Furthermore, we presume that the installation of metabolic regeneration cycles such as supporting carbon re-entry towards the pentose phosphate pathway from C1-metabolism is a pivotal target for synthetic methylotrophy."
pub.1131074661,The production of fuels and chemicals in the new world: critical analysis of the choice between crude oil and biomass vis-à-vis sustainability and the environment,"Energy and the environment are intimately related and hotly debated issues. Today’s crude oil-based economy for the manufacture of fuels, chemicals and materials will not have a sustainable future. The over-use of oil products has done a great damage to the environment. Faced with the twin challenges of sustaining socioeconomic development and shrinking the environmental footprint of chemicals and fuel manufacturing, a major emphasis is on either converting biomass into low-value, high-volume biofuels or refining it into a wide spectrum of products. Using carbon for fuel is a flawed approach and unlikely to achieve any nation’s socioeconomic or environmental targets. Biomass is chemically and geographically incompatible with the existing refining and pipeline infrastructure, and biorefining and biofuels production in their current forms will not achieve economies of scale in most nations. Synergistic use of crude oil, biomass, and shale gas to produce fuels, value-added chemicals, and commodity chemicals, respectively, can continue for some time. However, carbon should not be used as a source of fuel or energy but be valorized to other products. In controlling CO2 emissions, hydrogen will play a critical role. Hydrogen is best suited for converting waste biomass and carbon dioxide emanated from different sources, whether it be fossil fuel-derived carbon or biomass-derived carbon, into fuels and chemicals as well as it will also lead, on its own as energy source, to the carbon negative scenario in conjunction with other renewable non-carbon sources. This new paradigm for production of fuels and chemicals not only offers the greatest monetization potential for biomass and shale gas, but it could also scale down output and improve the atom and energy economies of oil refineries. We have also highlighted the technology gaps with the intention to drive R&D in these directions. We believe  this article will generate a considerable debate in energy sector and lead to better energy and material policy across the world.Graphic abstract"

The primary concerns of sustainable alcohol production for meeting the growing energy demand owing to the selection of viable feedstock and this might enhance the opportunities for developing numerous advanced techniques. In this review, the valorization of alcohol production from several production routes has been exposed by covering the traditional routes to the present state of the art technologies. Even though the fossil fuel conversion could be dominant method for methanol production, many recent innovations like photo electrochemical synthesis and electrolysis methods might play vital role in production of renewable methanol in future. There have been several production routes for production of ethanol and among which the fermentation of lignocellulose biomass would be the ultimate choice for large scale shoot up. The greenhouse gas recovery in the form of alcohols through electrochemistry technique and hydrogenation method are the important methods for commercialization of alcohols in future. It is also observed that algae based renewable bio-alcohols is highly influenced by carbohydrate content and sustainable approaches in algae conversion to bio-alcohols would bring greater demand in future market. There is a lack of innovation in higher alcohols production in single process and this could be bounded by combining dehydrogenation and decarboxylation techniques. Finally, this review enlists the opportunities and challenges of existing alcohols production and recommended the possible routes for making significant enhancement in production."
pub.1010138489,Biorefinery: Toward an industrial metabolism,"Fossil fuel reserves are running out, global warming is becoming a reality, waste recycling is becoming ever more costly and problematic, and unrelenting population growth will require more and more energy and consumer products. There is now an alternative to the 100% oil economy; it is a renewable resource based on agroresources by using the whole plant. Production and development of these new products are based on biorefinery concept. Each constituent of the plant can be extracted and functionalized in order to produce non-food and food fractions, intermediate agro-industrial products and synthons. Three major industrial domains can be concerned: molecules, materials and energy. Molecules can be used as solvent surfactants or chemical intermediates in substitution of petrol derivatives. Fibers can be valorized in materials like composites. Sugars and oils are currently used to produce biofuels like bioethanol or biodiesel, but second-generation biofuels will use lignocellulosic biomass as raw material. Lipids can be used to produce a large diversity of products like solvent, lubricants, pastes or surfactants. Industrial biorefinery will be linked to the creation of new processes based on the twelve principles of green chemistry (clean processes, atom economy, renewable feedstocks...). Biotechnology, especially white biotechnology, will take a major part into these new processes with biotransformations (enzymology, micro-organisms...) and fermentation. The substitution of oil products by biobased products will develop a new bioeconomy and new industrial processes respecting the sustainable development concept. Industrial biorefinery can be developed on the principle that any residues of one can then be exploited as raw material by others in an industrial metabolism."
pub.1033911859,Suitability of Miscanthus species for managing inorganic and organic contaminated land and restoring ecosystem services. A review,"The mitigation of potential health hazards and land scarcity due to land use change can be addressed by restoring functional and ecosystem services of contaminated land. Physico-chemical remediation options are criticized as being costly and not providing environment-friendly solutions. The use of plants and associated microorganisms could be a sustainable, cost-effective option to reduce pollutant exposure. Phytomanagement aims at using valuable non-food crops to alleviate environmental and health risks induced by pollutants, and at restoring ecosystem services. Suitable plant species must be tolerant to contaminants, reduce their transfer into the food chain, and efficiently produce marketable biomass. Based on Miscanthus' capacity to sequestrate inorganic contaminants into the root system and to induce dissipation of persistent organic contaminants in soil, these plant species are favorable for phytostabilization and phytodegradation. Among Miscanthus species, the noninvasive hybrid Miscanthus × giganteus, with a high lignocellulosic content, is a promising biomass crop for the bio-economy, notably the biorefinery and bioenergy industries. Planting this species on contaminated and marginal land is a promising option to avoid changes in arable land use to mitigate the food vs. biofuel controversy. Key issues in promoting sustainable management of Miscanthus sp. on contaminated land are: (a) crop suitability, integration, and sustainability in a region with a potential local market; (b) site suitability in relation to the species' requirements and potential, (c) biotic interactions in the landscape diversity; and (d) increase in shoot yields in line with various stressors (e.g., pollutants, drought, cold temperatures), and with minimal inputs.

Existing biofuel production systems have widened P inequalities and contributed to a linear P economy, impairing water quality and accelerating dependence on P fertilizers manufactured from finite nonrenewable phosphate rock reserves. Here, we explore how the emerging bioeconomy in novel, value-added, bio-based products offers opportunities to rethink our stewardship of P. Development of integrated value chains of new bio-based products offers opportunities for codevelopment of ""P refineries"" to recover P fertilizer products from organic wastes. Advances in material sciences are exploiting unique semiconductor and opto-electrical properties of new ""two-dimensional"" (2D) P allotropes (2D black phosphorus and blue phosphorus). These novel P materials offer the tantalizing prospect of step-change innovations in renewable energy production and storage, in biomedical applications, and in biomimetic processes, including artificial photosynthesis. They also offer a possible antidote to the P paradox that our agricultural production systems have engineered us into, as well as the potential to expand the future role of P in securing sustainability across both agroecological and technological domains of the bioeconomy. However, a myriad of social, technological, and commercialization hurdles remains to be crossed before such an advanced circular P bioeconomy can be realized. The emerging bioeconomy is just one piece of a much larger puzzle of how to achieve more sustainable and circular horizons in our future use of P."
pub.1047418029,Fueling Industrial Biotechnology Growth with Bioethanol,"Industrial biotechnology is the conversion of biomass via biocatalysis, microbial fermentation, or
    cell culture to produce chemicals, materials, and/or energy. Industrial biotechnology processes aim to
    be cost-competitive, environmentally favorable, and self-sustaining compared to their petrochemical equivalents.
    Common to all processes for the production of energy, commodity, added value, or fine chemicals is that
    raw materials comprise the most significant cost fraction, particularly as operating efficiencies increase
    through practice and improving technologies. Today, crude petroleum represents the dominant raw material
    for the energy and chemical sectors worldwide. Within the last 5 years petroleum prices, stability,
    and supply have increased, decreased, and been threatened, respectively, driving a renewed interest
    across academic, government, and corporate centers to utilize biomass as an alternative raw material. Specifically,
    bio-based ethanol as an alternative biofuel has emerged as the single largest biotechnology commodity, with
    close to 46 billion L produced worldwide in 2005. Bioethanol is a leading example of how
    systems biology tools have significantly enhanced metabolic engineering, inverse metabolic engineering,
    and protein and enzyme engineering strategies. This enhancement stems from method development for measurement,
    analysis, and data integration of functional genomics, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome,
    and fluxome. This review will show that future industrial biotechnology process development will benefit
    tremendously from the precedent set by bioethanol – that enabling technologies (e.g., systems biology
    tools) coupled with favorable economic and socio-political driving forces do yield profitable, sustainable,
    and environmentally responsible processes. Biofuel will continue to be the keystone of any industrial biotechnology-based

The markets concerned are, in addition to the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals sectors, which use bioactive compounds, the sector of biopolymeric materials and of energy for the production of biohydrogen and biomethane. Generally, bioactive components should be investigated through an integrated and multidisciplinary study approach based on emerging analytical techniques; in this context, attention is addressed towards green and sustainable procedures; an update of extraction techniques, innovative technologies, and chemometrics are described. Nowadays, processes so far tested on a pilot scale for grape waste are developed to enhance the extraction yields.

pub.1174682803,Effect of mowing versus abandonment of mesic grasslands in Central Europe on biomass use for biogas production: Implications for semi-natural ecosystem conservation,"The economic management of lignocellulosic biomass from semi-natural grasslands is now a challenge across Europe. The abandonment of mowing these grasslands leads to the gradual degradation of these ecosystems. This study investigates how chemical and biological factors affect the suitability of biomass from abandoned grasslands for biogas production. We sampled 30 mown and 30 abandoned grassland sites in the Sudetes Mountains (Poland and Czechia). The cover contribution of short herbs was found to be significantly higher in mown grasslands (p &lt; 0.001), while that of tall herbs was more prevalent in abandoned grasslands (p &lt; 0.01). The specific biogas yield (SBY, NL kg<sup>-1</sup> volatile solids) is negatively affected by an increased percentage of herbs in the biomass of mown and abandoned grasslands. This is due to the inhibitory effect of herbs on biodegradation, the increase in lignin content and the decrease in cellulose. This study highlights the importance of individual plant species in assessing grassland biomass for area biogas yield (ABY, m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>) and provides new insights into a field that has not yet been extensively investigated. In mown grasslands, ABY was most positively correlated with grass species (Arrhenatherum elatius, Trisetum flavescens and Festuca pratensis). In abandoned grasslands, the ABY was most correlated with herbaceous species (Galium aparine, Urtica dioica and Chaerophyllum aromaticum) and grasses (A. elatius and Elymus repens). Mown grasslands had significantly higher species richness (p &lt; 0.001) compared to abandoned grasslands, but the number of species sampled did not correlate with SBY and ABY.

pub.1099617368,"The role of constructed wetlands in a new circular economy, resource oriented, and ecosystem services paradigm","Wastewater management is included in one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 6 is dedicated to water and sanitation and sets out to ""ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all"". SDG 6 expands the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focus on drinking water and basic sanitation to now cover the entire water cycle, including the management of water, wastewater and ecosystem resources. A UN report in 2017 states that likely over 80% of the wastewater worldwide is still discharged without adequate treatment. In several countries the wastewater management is nowadays a norm, but still there are open discussions about the kind of approach to be adopted, i.e. centralisation vs. decentralisation. The choice of the adopted technologies is strictly linked to environmental performances and economical aspects; one of the possible causes for the still enormous amount of untreated wastewater discharged into the environment can be the low ""willingness to pay"" for this kind of service and therefore a great focus should be given to all the technologies that are able to lower the treatment costs still maintaining reliable and robust performances in the long term. When considering wastewater as a carrier of valuable primary chemicals that can be easily converted to marketable products (fertilisers, bio-plastics, soil conditioners, biofuels, etc.), and as well as a relevant source of ""new water"" to be used for specific purposes, wastewater and runoff management can be highlighted as one of the most exciting challenges and occasions for a sustainable development in the near future. The paper aims to clarify the future role of CWs in circular economy, resource-oriented, and ecosystem services approaches, which want to respond to sanitation worldwide and the future research needs. We give an overview on how the conventional wastewater treatment scheme (what we call ""waste paradigm"") should move towards more sustainable water and biogeochemical cycles following the new resource-oriented, circular economy and ecosystem service views. On this basis, we review the potential application of CWs within this new, and needed, paradigm. Finally, a meta-analysis shows that the scientific community involved in CWs should put more effort in making CWs more suitable for these new tasks."
pub.1172046606,Towards the valorisation of glycerol by designing the surface chemistry of carbon xerogels by doping and oxygen functionalization,"Research on innovative approaches to the valorisation of glycerol as a subproduct of biodiesel production has acquired an increasing demand in the development of a circular economy around energy generation, especially, in the line of improvement of the heterogeneous metallic catalysts used. In this regard, carbon xerogels have gained importance due to their stability and modifiability, while transition metals such as copper stand out as a cost-effective alternative, resulting in a technology where surface engineering plays a crucial role in achieving competitive catalytic activity. Building upon this, current research evaluates doped xerogels (Si, N, or GO) as supports of Cu and catalysts by themselves for glycerol oxidation. Benefits from the incorporation of oxygenated functional groups (OFG) were also evaluated. Results showed a consistently higher selectivity towards lactic acid (LA) across all catalysts and competitive catalytic conversion. In this performance, dopants played a crucial role in surface acid-base characteristics, while oxygenated functional groups (OFG) influenced copper adsorption, dispersion, and reducibility. Notably, the Cu/CXN-f catalyst demonstrated the highest LA yield by combining the effect of N as a doping species, with the presence of OFG and the formation of appropriated metallic Cu domains. This research underscores the potential of carbon xerogels in the tailored catalyst design, contributing to sustainable chemical production through their customizable textural and chemical properties."
pub.1163421885,Microalgae-assisted green bioremediation of food-processing wastewater: A sustainable approach toward a circular economy concept,"Wastewater disposal is a major environmental issue that pollutes water, causing eutrophication, habitat destruction, and economic impact. In Mexico, food-processing effluents pose a huge environmental threat due to their excessive nutrient content and their large volume discharged every year. Some of the most harmful residues are tequila vinasses, nejayote, and cheese whey. Each liter of tequila generates 13-15 L of vinasses, each kilogram of cheese produces approximately 9 kg of cheese whey, and each kilogram of nixtamalized maize results in the production of 2.5-3.3 L of nejayote. A promising strategy to reduce the contamination derived from wastewater is through microalgae-based wastewater treatment. Microalgae have a high adaptability to hostile environments and they can feed on the nutrients in the effluents to grow. Moreover, to increase the viability, profitability, and value of wastewater treatments, a microalgae biorefinery could be proposed. This review will focus on the circular bioeconomy scheme focused on the simultaneous food-processing wastewater treatment and its use to grow microalgae biomass to produce added-value compounds. This strategy allows for the revalorization of wastewater, decreases contamination of water sources, and produces valuable compounds that promote human health such as phycobiliproteins, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids, exopolysaccharides, mycosporine-like amino acids, and as a source of clean energy: biodiesel, biogas, and bioethanol."
pub.1172204017,Bridging sustainability and industry through resourceful utilization of pea pods- A focus on diverse industrial applications,"The focus on sustainable utilization of agricultural waste is currently a leading area of scientific research, driving significant advancements in technology and circular economy models. The fundamental capacity of bio-based products, bioprocessing techniques, and the crucial involvement of microbial treatments are opening opportunities for efficient solutions in various industries. One of the most popular green vegetables, peas are members of the Fabaceae family and have a pod-like structure. Every year, a significant amount of pea pods is discarded as waste products of peas that have negative impacts on our environment. In this comprehensive review, we explore innovative methods for utilizing pea pods to minimize their environmental footprint and optimize their viability across multiple industries. A large portion of the pea processing industry's output consists of pea pods. Variety of proteins, with major classes being globulin and albumin (13%), dietary fiber (43-58%), and minerals are abundant in these pods. Because of their diverse physiochemical properties, they find applications in many diverse fields. The porous pea pods comprised cellulose (61.35%) and lignin (22.12%), which could make them superior adsorbents. The components of these byproducts possess valuable attributes that make them applicable across treatment of wastewater, production of biofuels, synthesis of biocolors, development of nutraceuticals, functional foods, and enzymes for the textile industry, modification of oil, and inhibition of steel corrosion."
pub.1169963821,"Hydrogenolysis of Glycerol over NiCeZr Catalyst Modified with Mg, Cu, and Sn at the Surface Level","Biomass valorization is an essential strategy for converting organic resources into valuable energy and chemicals, contributing to the circular economy, and reducing carbon footprints. Glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production, can be used as a feedstock for a variety of high-value products and can contribute to reducing the carbon footprint. This study examines the impact of surface-level modifications of Mg, Cu, and Sn on Ni-Ce-Zr catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol, with in situ generated hydrogen. The aim of this approach is to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the biomass valorization process. However, the surface modification resulted in a decrease in the global conversion of glycerol due to the reduced availability of metal sites. The study found that valuable products, such as H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> in the gas phase, and 1,2-PG in the liquid phase, were obtained. The majority of the liquid fraction was observed, particularly for Cu- and Sn-doped catalysts, which was attributed to their increased acidity. The primary selectivity was towards the cleavage of the C-O bond. Post-reaction characterizations revealed that the primary causes of deactivation was leaching, which was reduced by the inclusion of Cu and Sn. These findings demonstrate the potential of Cu- and Sn-modified Ni-Ce-Zr catalysts to provide a sustainable pathway for converting glycerol into value-added chemicals."
pub.1157648042,Dark fermentative hydrogen production: Potential of food waste as future energy needs,"Globally, food waste (FW) is found to be one of the major constituents creating several hurdles in waste management. On the other hand, the energy crisis is increasing and the limited fossil fuel resources available are not sufficient for energy needed for emerging population. In this context, biohydrogen production approach through valorization of FW is emerging as one of the sustainable and eco-friendly options. The present review explores FW sources, characteristics, and dark fermentative production of hydrogen along with its efficiency. FW are highly biodegradable and rich in carbohydrates which can be efficiently utilized by anaerobic bacteria. Based on the composition of FW, several pretreatment methods can be adapted to improve the bioavailability of the organics. By-products of dark fermentation are organic acids that can be integrated with several secondary bioprocesses. The versatility of secondary products is ranging from energy generation to biochemicals production. Integrated approaches facilitate in enhanced energy harvesting along with extended wastewater treatment. The review also discusses various parameters like pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time and nutrient supplementation to enhance the process efficiency of biohydrogen production. The application of solid-state fermentation (SSF) in dark fermentation improves the process efficiency. Dark fermentation as the key process for valorization and additional energy generating process can make FW the most suitable substrate for circular economy and waste based biorefinery."

In this new paradigm, acetic acid (AA) is deemed as an interesting product for the chemical industry. Herein we present a fresh overview of the current manufacturing approaches, compared to potential low-carbon alternatives. The use of biogas as primary feedstock to produce acetic acid is an auspicious alternative, representing a step-ahead on carbon-neutral industrial processes. Within the spirit of a circular economy, we propose and analyse a new BIO-strategy with two noteworthy pathways to potentially lower the environmental impact. The generation of syngas via dry reforming (DRM) combined with CO<sub>2</sub> utilisation offers a way to produce acetic acid in a two-step approach (BIO-Indirect route), replacing the conventional, petroleum-derived steam reforming process. The most recent advances on catalyst design and technology are discussed. On the other hand, the BIO-Direct route offers a ground-breaking, atom-efficient way to directly generate acetic acid from biogas. Nevertheless, due to thermodynamic restrictions, the use of plasma technology is needed to directly produce acetic acid. This very promising approach is still in an early stage. Particularly, progress in catalyst design is mandatory to enable low-carbon routes for acetic acid production."
pub.1151665048,Screening of microalgae species and evaluation of algal-lipid stimulation strategies for biodiesel production,"Microalgae is considered an alternative source for biodiesel production producing renewable, sustainable and carbon-neutral energy. Microalgae property changes among species, which determines the efficiency of biodiesel production. Besides the lipid content evaluation, multi-principles (including high lipid productivity, high biomass yield, pollution resistance and desired fatty acid, etc.) for superior oil-producing species screening was proposed in this review and three microalgae species (Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus obliquus and Mychonastes afer) with high bio-lipid producing prospect were screened out based on big data digging and analysis. The multilateral strategies for algal-lipid stimulating were also compared, among which, nutrient restriction, temperature control, heterotrophy and chemicals addition showed high potential in enhancing lipid accumulation; while electromagnetic field showed little effect. Interestingly, it was found that the lipid accumulation was more sensitive to nitrogen (N)-limitation other than phosphorus (P). Nutrient restriction, salinity stress etc. enhanced lipid accumulation by creating a stressed environment. Hence, optimum conditions (e.g. N:15-35 mg/L and P:4-16 mg/L) should be set to balance the lipid accumulation and biomass growth, and further guarantee the algal-lipid productivity. Otherwise, two-step cultivation could be applied during all the stressed stimulation. Different from lab study, effectiveness, operability and economy should be all considered for stimulation strategy selection. Nutrient restriction, temperature control and heterotrophy were highly feasible after the multidimensional evaluation."
pub.1130238480,Bioeconomy development factors in the European Union and Poland,"Bioeconomy is not an autonomous sector of the economy, but rather a complex mechanism involving agriculture, industry, biotechnology, service sectors and consumers. To measure the size of the bioeconomy in European Union (EU) countries, it is necessary to create appropriate indicators that allow it to be monitored with reference to its current state, growth rate and sector description. In many countries, including Poland, there is no complete information or data collection system to monitor bioeconomy development directly, e.g. in the Polish Central Statistical Office. In response to these needs, several groups of indicators related to the circular economy, sustainable development and Europe 2020 were created by the European Commission (EC) in the Eurostat database. These indicators can help monitoring of bioeconomy development in EU countries. The present study discusses factors for bioeconomy development through an analysis of their social, economic and environmental aspects, as well as showing the value of the selected indicators in the EU and Poland. In addition, a separate section is dedicated to public perception of bioeconomy and to legislation regarding genetically modified organisms (GMOs). To date, many research studies have been reported on the public acceptance of bioeconomy issues in the EU, including renewable resources, biofuels, GMOs, bio-based products, food security and climate change. The awareness and perception of society on the bioeconomy, bio-based products and processes, and the sustainable use of resources can contribute to environmental sustainability, but intensified efforts are required to increase public acceptance."
pub.1141991957,Simulation and optimization of organosolv based lignocellulosic biomass refinery: A review,"Organosolv pretreatment can be considered as the core of the lignocellulosic biomass fractionation within the biorefinery concept. Organosolv facilitates the separation of the major fractions (cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin), and their use as renewable feedstocks to produce bioenergy, biofuels, and added-value biomass derived chemicals. The efficient separation of these fractions affects the economic feasibility of the biorefinery complex. This review focuses on the simulation of the organosolv pretreatment and the optimization of (i) feedstock delignification, (ii) sugars production (mainly from hemicelluloses), (iii) enzymatic digestibility of the cellulose fraction and (iv) quality of lignin. Simulation is used for the technoeconomic optimization of the biorefinery complex. Simulation and optimization implement a holistic approach considering the efficient technological, economic, and environmental performance of the biorefinery operational units. Consequently, an optimized organosolv stage is the first step for a sustainable, economically viable biorefinery complex in the concept of industrial ecology and zero waste circular economy."
pub.1127340573,Recent advances in catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste for the production of petroleum-like hydrocarbons,"The global economy is threatened by the depletion of fossil resources and fluctuations in fossil fuel prices, and thus it is necessary to exploit sustainable energy sources. Carbon-neutral fuels including bio-oil obtained from biomass pyrolysis can act as alternatives to fossil fuels. Co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and plastic is efficient to upgrade the quality of bio-oil because plastic facilitates deoxygenation. However, catalysts are required to produce bio-oil that is suitable for potential use as transportation fuel. This review presents an overview of recent advances in catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic from the perspective of chemistry, catalyst, and feedstock pretreatment. Additionally, this review introduces not only recent research results of acid catalysts for catalytic co-pyrolysis, but also recent approaches that utilize base catalysts. Future research directions are suggested for commercially feasible co-pyrolysis process."
pub.1035096087,Reviving the carbohydrate economy via multi-product lignocellulose biorefineries,"Before the industrial revolution, the global economy was largely based on living carbon from plants. Now the economy is mainly dependent on fossil fuels (dead carbon). Biomass is the only sustainable bioresource that can provide sufficient transportation fuels and renewable materials at the same time. Cellulosic ethanol production from less costly and most abundant lignocellulose is confronted with three main obstacles: (1) high processing costs (dollars /gallon of ethanol), (2) huge capital investment (dollars approximately 4-10/gallon of annual ethanol production capacity), and (3) a narrow margin between feedstock and product prices. Both lignocellulose fractionation technology and effective co-utilization of acetic acid, lignin and hemicellulose will be vital to the realization of profitable lignocellulose biorefineries, since co-product revenues would increase the margin up to 6.2-fold, where all purified lignocellulose co-components have higher selling prices (> approximately 1.0/kg) than ethanol ( approximately 0.5/kg of ethanol). Isolation of large amounts of lignocellulose components through lignocellulose fractionation would stimulate R&D in lignin and hemicellulose applications, as well as promote new markets for lignin- and hemicellulose-derivative products. Lignocellulose resource would be sufficient to replace significant fractionations (e.g., 30%) of transportation fuels through liquid biofuels, internal combustion engines in the short term, and would provide 100% transportation fuels by sugar-hydrogen-fuel cell systems in the long term."

In case the input feedstock can be waste nutrients, the label of such productions becomes even greener. Nutrients circularity is nowadays an important circular economy practice. This mini-review focuses on the valorisation of food waste as precious biomass to grow new food and feed. In particular, three functional edibles are discussed in the present paper: mushrooms, microalgae and insects. These foods are part of people diets since ages in certain areas of the world and the original aspect of their cultivation and breeding found on waste nutrients recovery is here reviewed. Proofs of such food waste biorefinery viability are already given by several researches featuring the main traits of a suitable growing medium: optimal pool of nutrients and optimal pH. However, lot of work still needs to be done in order to assess the optimal growth and cultivation conditions and the health security of the harvested/bred edibles. A SWOT factors analysis was performed."

With the increased attention of circular economy in the past half-decade with the emphasis of holistically addressing economic, environmental, and social aspects of the industrial-sector, biorefinery acts as a strategic mechanism for the realization of a circular bioeconomy. This study presents a comprehensive review of different biorefinery models used for various biomass feedstocks such as lignocelluloses, algae, and numerous waste-types. The review focuses on how biorefinery is instrumental in the transition of various biomass-based industries in a circular bioeconomy. The results reveal that the social-economic aspect of the industrial sector has a major influence on the full adoption of biorefineries in circular bioeconomy. Biomass wastes have played a major role in the implementation of biorefinery in circular bioeconomy. The current challenges are also presented along with future perspectives."

The effects of increasing inclusion levels of microalgal meal on growth performance, body composition, nutrient utilization, gut morphology, and innate immunity were evaluated after 93 days. A reference alga-free diet was the control (CTRL) diet, and the three experimental diets contained 5 (MA5), 10 (MA10), and 15% (MA15) of the microalgal meal. The microalga-rich diets were supplemented with DL-methionine to assure sea bass dietary requirement. Overall, nutrient apparent digestibilities (ADCs) of the diets were not altered by the microalgal inclusion, but energy ADC was highest in fish fed the CTRL diet (90% vs 88%). At the end of the trial, fish growth performance was similar among dietary treatments (DGI of 1.0), but fish fed MA10 had a significantly higher feed conversion ratio than those fed CTRL and MA5. Final whole body composition and nutrient gain of fish fed the different diets were similar. No significant differences were detected in gut morphology among treatments. Innate immune parameters (lysozyme, alternative complement pathway—ACH50, and peroxidase) were examined, and ACH50 of the fish fed MA15 was significantly lower than those fed MA10, suggesting a dose-dependent stimulation of the innate immune response. The present results indicate that defatted microalgal meal can replace fishmeal in European sea bass diets—at inclusion levels of up to 15%—contributing to a circular economy approach."
pub.1136004890,Estimating induced land use change emissions for sustainable aviation biofuel pathways,"Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are expected to play an essential role in achieving the aviation industries' goal of carbon-neutral growth. However, producing biomass-based SAFs may induce changes in global land use and the associated carbon stock. The induced land use change (ILUC) emissions, as a part of the full life-cycle emissions for SAF pathways, will affect whether and to what extent SAFs reduce emissions compared with petroleum-based jet fuels. Here, we estimate the ILUC emission intensity for seventeen SAF pathways considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), covering five ASTM-certified technologies, nine biomass-based feedstocks, and four geographical regions. We introduce the SAF pathways into a well-established computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, GTAP-BIO, and its coupled emission accounting model, AEZ-EF, to study economy-wide implications of SAF production and estimate ILUC emissions intensity for each pathway. The estimated SAF ILUC emission intensities, using a 25-year amortization period, range from -58.5 g CO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>-1</sup> for the USA miscanthus alcohol (isobutanol)-to-jet (ATJ) pathway to 34.6 g CO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>-1</sup> for the Malaysia &amp; Indonesia palm oil Hydrotreated Esters of Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. Notably, the vegetable oil pathways tend to have higher ILUC emission intensities due to their linkage to palm expansion and peatland oxidation in Southeast Asia. The cellulosic pathways studied provide negative ILUC emissions, mainly driven by the high carbon sequestrations in crop biomass and soil. Using the core life-cycle emissions established by ICAO, we show that fifteen of the assessed pathways have a lower full life-cycle emission intensity than petroleum-based jet fuels (89 g CO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>-1</sup>), offering promising options to reduce aviation emissions."
pub.1046394651,Direct conversion of plant biomass to ethanol by engineered Caldicellulosiruptor bescii,"Ethanol is the most widely used renewable transportation biofuel in the United States, with the production of 13.3 billion gallons in 2012 [John UM (2013) Contribution of the Ethanol Industry to the Economy of the United States]. Despite considerable effort to produce fuels from lignocellulosic biomass, chemical pretreatment and the addition of saccharolytic enzymes before microbial bioconversion remain economic barriers to industrial deployment [Lynd LR, et al. (2008) Nat Biotechnol 26(2):169-172]. We began with the thermophilic, anaerobic, cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, which efficiently uses unpretreated biomass, and engineered it to produce ethanol. Here we report the direct conversion of switchgrass, a nonfood, renewable feedstock, to ethanol without conventional pretreatment of the biomass. This process was accomplished by deletion of lactate dehydrogenase and heterologous expression of a Clostridium thermocellum bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. Whereas wild-type C. bescii lacks the ability to make ethanol, 70% of the fermentation products in the engineered strain were ethanol [12.8 mM ethanol directly from 2% (wt/vol) switchgrass, a real-world substrate] with decreased production of acetate by 38% compared with wild-type. Direct conversion of biomass to ethanol represents a new paradigm for consolidated bioprocessing, offering the potential for carbon neutral, cost-effective, sustainable fuel production. "
pub.1147188824,Ecological circular agriculture: A case study evaluating biogas slurry applied to rice in two soils,"In the context of carbon peak, neutrality, and circular agricultural economy, the use of renewable resources from agricultural processing for plant cultivation still needs to be explored to clarify material flow and its ecological effects. Paddy-upland rotation is an effective agricultural strategy to improve soil quality. This study evaluated the effects of biogas slurry application against those of chemical fertilisers in these two typical Chinese cropping soils. The application of biogas slurry increased total carbon content in paddy soil by 73.4%, and that in upland soil by 65.8%. Conversely, application of chemical fertiliser reduced total carbon in both soil types. There were significant positive correlations between total carbon and Zn, Cu, and Pb in rice husks grown in paddy soil (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95, 0.996, 0.95; p &lt; 0.05). The content of amylose in biogas slurry treatment of paddy soil increased by 35.9%, while that in upland soil decreased by 19.2%. After biogas slurry was applied, the contents of fulvic acid- and humic acid-like substances in paddy soil average increased by 40.9% and 45.6%, while the contents of protein-like components were enhanced by 46.8% in upland soil. This result was consistent with predictions of microbial community function. Microorganisms in paddy soil generally preferred carbon fixation, while those in upland soil preferred hydrocarbon degradation and chemoheterotrophy. Understanding the changes in soil carbon stock and microbial function after biogas slurry application will contribute to sustainable agricultural development and food security."
pub.1174872313,A novel experimental approach for the catalytic conversion of lignocellulosic Bambusa bambos to bioethanol,"<i>Bambusa bambos (B.B) biomass</i> is cellulose rich lignocellulosic material, containing 47.49% cellulose, 17.49% hemicellulose, 23.56% lignin was used as a potential substrate for bioethanol production. The research paper investigates the use of <i>B.B</i> biomass as a substrate for bio-ethanol production through a two-phase catalytic conversion process. Four water-regulated regimes were identified to optimize the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel precursors. The catalytic hydrolysis of <i>B.B</i> using CuCl<sub>2</sub> was conducted for 10 hours at 110˚C, in aprotic ionic liquid (1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) medium. The concentrations of glucose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) were measured while varying the amount of water addition. Water played a crucial role in the conversion of cellulose to glucose and 5-HMF by influencing product yields through the interplay of transport properties like heat conduction and viscosity. The highest glucose yield was achieved at 60.82% when operating at a water inclusion rate of 115.72 µL water/h for a duration of 6 hours at 110˚C. On the other hand, the maximum HMF yield was observed as 5.84% at water inclusion rate of 77.15 µL water/h for 5 hours at 110˚C. Yeast mediated glucose fermentation resulted in a bioethanol concentration of 5.5 mg/mL utilizing 15 mg/mL of catalytically produced glucose at a temperature of 30°C. After catalytic hydrolysis, the ionic liquid was also efficiently recycled for a sustainable economy."
pub.1152952255,Effect of Benzyl Alcohol on Biomethanation from Lignite,"Currently, biomethane obtained from coal resources, such as lignite and peat, serves as a sustainable biofuel urgently needed by the energy economy. To improve biomethane yield from lignite, the effects of different concentrations of benzyl alcohol, a degraded product of humic acid, on a biomethanation fermentation system were analyzed. The total biomethane yield, daily biomethane yield, coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>, VFA (volatile fatty acids) concentration, alkalinity, and pH were used to determine the optimal benzyl alcohol concentration. The biomethanation fermentation system with 2000 mg/L benzyl alcohol produced up to 4.03 mL/g of biomethane, which was 1.15 times that produced from the control group. The coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>, VFA, alkalinity, and pH of the system after adding 2000 mg/L benzyl alcohol were more preferable after adding other concentrations during the lignite biomethanation process. In summary, 2000 mg/L benzyl alcohol had a significantly positive effect on the lignite biomethanation fermentation system. When benzyl alcohol is added to the fermentation system, it accelerates the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which in turn produces more biomethane. Additionally, the self-supply of lignite microbial transformation nutrients from the perspective of chemical composition was explored as a novel approach in solving the common problem of low biomethane yield from a single lignite raw material. This also laid a foundation for subsequent steps through the adjustment of pretreatment conditions to ensure that the lignite pretreatment liquid contained increased benzyl alcohol, and a greater yield of biomethane can be produced after activated sludge addition."
pub.1152894562,Advancement on mixed microalgal-bacterial cultivation systems for nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries from wastewater to promote sustainable bioeconomy,"Biological wastewater treatment is a promising and environmentally friendly method that utilises living microorganisms to remediate water and enable recovery or conversion of contaminants into valuable products. For many decades, microalgae and cyanobacteria, photosynthetic living microorganisms, have been explored extensively for wastewater bioremediation. They can be used for recovering valuable nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous from secondary effluents and capable of transforming those nutrients into marketable products such as biofuels, biofertilisers, nutraceutical, and pigments for promoting a Bio-Circular Green economy. In recent years, there has been a shift towards mixing compatible microalgae with bacteria, which is inspired by their natural symbiotic relationships to increase nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries. With this enhanced bioremediation, recovery of polluted wastes can be intensified and higher biomass quality (with high nutrient density) can be achieved. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art of mixed microalgal-bacterial cultivating systems. A comprehensive comparison of existing studies that used Chlorella species as microalgae in various mixed microalgal-bacterial cultivating systems (suspension, biofilm, and immobilisation) for nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries from wastewater is conducted. Key technical challenges such as balancing microalgae and bacteria species, pH regulation, light distribution, biomass harvesting, and biomass conversion are also discussed. From the data comparisons among different cultivation systems, it has been suggested that immobilisation appears to require less amount of operational light compared to the suspended and biofilm-based systems for similar nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies."
pub.1176036796,Increasing Fertilization Efficiency of Biomass Ash by the Synergistically Acting Digestate and Extract from Water Plants Sequestering CO2 in Sorghum Crops,"The utilization of biomass ash in sustainable agriculture and increasing its fertilizing efficiency by biological agents, potentially sequestering CO<sub>2</sub>, have become important issues for the global economy. The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of ash from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> L. Moench) and Jerusalem artichoke (<i>Helianthus tuberosus</i> L.) biomass, a biogas plant digestate, and a <i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i> extract, acting alone or synergistically, on soil fertility and the development, health and physiological properties of sorghum plants. The results show novel information concerning differences in the composition and impact of ash, depending on its origin, soil properties and sorghum plant development. Sorghum ash was more effective than that from Jerusalem artichoke. Ash used alone and preferably acting synergistically with the digestate and <i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i> extract greatly increased soil fertility and the growth, biomass yield and health of sorghum plants. These improvements were associated with an increased chlorophyll content in leaves, better gas exchange (photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance), greater enzyme activity (acid and alkaline phosphatase, RNase, and total dehydrogenase), and a higher biomass energy value. The developed treatments improved environmental conditions by replacing synthetic fertilizers, increasing the sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub>, solving the ash storage problem, reducing the need for pesticides, and enabling a closed circulation of nutrients between plant and soil, maintaining high soil fertility."

The application of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) toward sustainable water economy and bioenergy production has become a subject of great interest. Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been widely exploited in wastewater treatment settings, whereby utilization of MNP additives by microorganism response for degradation of organics into biogas is seen to be eco-friendly and economically viable. The present study investigated the impact of two synthesized MNPs such as aluminum ferrite (AlFe2O4) and magnesium ferrite (MgFe2O4) on biogas production via biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. A BMP set-up of three (3) bioreactors was tested with a working volume of 0.8 L which comprises 0.5 L wastewater (WW) and 0.3 L activated sludge (AS) with 1.5 g of the MNPs and a control system without MNPs. The degradation of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was increased with set-ups that contained MNPs as compared to the control system, MgFe2O4 (93.96%) > AlFe2O4 (85.95%) > control (68.83%). In terms of biogas production, the methane yield was also recorded as MgFe2O4 (85.7%) > AlFe2O4 (84.3%) > control (65.7%). The physical and chemical stability of MNPs makes them more advantageous for application in biogas production. In the prospects of biogas enhancement and biodegradability, integrating MNPs in an anaerobic digestion system will result in a more efficient anaerobic process performance for biogas production."
pub.1167632884,"Harnessing the Carrier Solvent Complexity of Crop Biostimulant Liquid Formulations Using Locally Available Transesterified Waste Cooking Oil: Economic Recycling, Solvent Performance, and Bioefficacy Evaluation","Locally sourced waste cooking oil (WCO) was successfully base-catalyzed and transesterified with methanol into biodiesel to produce biostimulant (nitrobenzene) formulations and replace high-risk carrier solvents. Ideal synthesis conditions were composed of 1% NaOH, MeOH/oil molar ratio (6:1), reaction temperature (65 °C), a 3 h mixing rate, and 97-98% yields. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified five fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) including palmitic, linoleic, oleic, stearic, and eicosenoic acids with high solubilization and olfactory characteristics. Using anionic and nonionic emulsifiers in conjunction with recycled biodiesel, a stable emulsifiable concentrate (NB 35% EC) was created with greater storage stability, wettability, and spreading capabilities than those of organic solvent-based ones. The highest counts of fruits per plant (35.80), flowers per plant (60.00), yield per plant (3.56 kg), and yield per hectare (143.7 quintals) were recorded in treatments with 4 mL/L biodiesel-based EC in field bioassays. In addition to having superior biosafety, FAME-based EC exhibits minimal phytotoxicity and is less harmful to aquatic creatures. It was discovered that the average cost-effectiveness was 5.49 times less expensive than solvent-based EC. In order to utilize waste oils as a locally obtained, sustainable alternative solvent with a wide solubilization range, low ecotax profile, circular economy, and high renewable carbon index, this integrative technique was expanded."
pub.1018974229,Life Cycle Analyses and Resource Assessments,"Prof. Ulgiati stresses that we should always use an ecosystem view when transforming energy from one form to another. Sustainable growth and development of both environmental and human-dominated systems require optimum use of available resources for maximum power output. We have to adapt to the laws of nature because nature has to take care of all the waste products we produce. The presentation addresses a much needed shift away from linear production and consumption pattern, toward reorganization of economies and lifestyle that takes complexity--of resources, of the environment and of the economy--into proper account. The best way to reach maximum yield from the different kinds of biomass is to use biorefineries. Biorefinery is defined as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable products like heat, power, fuels, chemicals, food, feed, and materials. However, biomass from agricultural land must be used for the production of food and not fuel. Prof. Voss focuses on the sustainability of energy supply chains and energy systems. Life cycle analyses (LCA) provides the conceptual framework for a comprehensive comparative evaluation of energy supply options with regard to their resource requirements as well as the health and environmental impact. Full scope LCA considers not only the emissions from plant operation, construction, and decommissioning but also the environmental burdens and resource requirements associated with the entire lifetime of all relevant upstream and downstream processes within the energy chain. This article describes the results of LCA analyses for state-of-the-art heating and electricity systems as well as of advanced future systems. Total costs are used as a measure for the overall resource consumption."
pub.1059580677,n-butanol: challenges and solutions for shifting natural metabolic pathways into a viable microbial production,"The economic upturn of the past 200 years would not have been conceivable without fossil resources such as coal and oil. However, the fossil-based economy increasingly reaches its limits and displays contradictions. Bioeconomy, strategically combining economy and ecology willing to make biobased and sustainable growth possible, is promising to make a significant contribution towards solving these issues. In this context, microbial bioconversions are promising to support partially the increasing need for materials and fuels starting from fresh, preferably waste, biomass. Butanol is a very attractive molecule finding applications both as a chemical platform and as a fuel. Today it principally derives from petroleum, but it also represents the final product of microbial catabolic pathways. Because of the need to maximize yield, titer and productivity to make the production competitive and viable, the challenge is to transform a robustly regulated metabolic network into the principal cellular activity. However, this goal can only be accomplished by a profound understanding of the cellular physiology, survival strategy and sensing/signalling cascades. Here, we shortly review on the natural cellular pathways and circumstances that lead to n-butanol accumulation, its physiological consequences that might not match industrial needs and on possible solutions for circumventing these natural constraints."
pub.1138172815,Minimizing hazardous impact of food waste in a circular economy – Advances in resource recovery through green strategies,"Recent trends in food waste and its management have increasingly started to focus on treating it as a reusable resource. The hazardous impact of food waste such as the release of greenhouse gases, deterioration of water quality and contamination of land areas are a major threat posed by food waste. Under the circular economy principles, food waste can be used as a sustainable supply of high-value energy, fuel, and nutrients through green techniques such as anaerobic digestion, co-digestion, composting, enzymatic treatment, ultrasonic, hydrothermal carbonization. Recent advances made in anaerobic co-digestion are helping in tackling dual or even multiple waste streams at once with better product yields. Integrated approaches that employ pre-processing the food waste to remove obstacles such as volatile fractions, oils and other inhibitory components from the feedstock to enhance their bioconversion to reduce sugars. Research efforts are also progressing in optimizing the operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, pH and residence time to enhance further the output of products such as methane, hydrogen and other platform chemicals such as lactic acid, succinic acid and formic acid. This review brings together some of the recent progress made in the green strategies towards food waste valorization."
pub.1053279072,"Harmonising conflicts between science, regulation, perception and environmental impact: The case of soil conditioners from bioenergy","As the global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, humanity needs to balance an ever increasing demand for food, energy and natural resources, with sustainable management of ecosystems and the vital services that they provide. The intensification of agriculture, including the use of fertilisers from finite sources, has resulted in extensive soil degradation, which has increased food production costs and CO2 emissions, threatening food security. The Bioenergy sector has significant potential to contribute to the formation of a circular economy. This paper presents the scientific, regulatory and socioeconomic barriers to the use of the nutrient waste streams from biomass thermal conversion (ash) and anaerobic digestion (digestate) as sustainable soil amendments for use in place of traditional fertilisers. It is argued that whilst the ability of combined ash and digestate to remedy many threats to ecosystems and provide a market to incentivise the renewable bio-energy schemes is promising, a step-change is required to alter perceptions of 'waste', from an expensive problem, to a product with environmental and economic value. This can only be achieved by well-informed interactions between scientists, regulators and end users, to improve the spread and speed of innovation with this sector. "
pub.1167940398,Kappaphycus alvarezii as a renewable source of kappa-carrageenan and other cosmetic ingredients,"Kappa-carrageenan is one of the most traded marine-derived hydrocolloids used in the food-and-beverage, pharmaceuticals, and personal care/cosmetics industries. K. alvarezii (previously known as Kappaphycus alvarezii) is arguably the most important natural producer based on annual production size and near-homogeneity of the product (i.e., primarily being the kappa-type). The anticipated expansion of the kappa-carrageenan market in the coming years could easily generate &gt;100,000 MT of residual K. alvarezii biomass per year, which, if left untreated, can severely affect the environment and economy of the surrounding area. Among several possible valorization routes, turning the biomass residue into anti-photoaging cosmetic ingredients could potentially be the most sustainable one. Not only optimizing the profit (thus better ensuring economic sustainability) relative to the biofuels- and animal feed-routes, the action could also promote environmental sustainability. It could reduce the dependency of the current cosmetic industry on both petrochemicals and terrestrial plant-derived bioactive compounds. Note how, in contrast to terrestrial agriculture, industrial cultivation of seaweeds does not require arable land, freshwater, fertilizers, and pesticides. The valorization mode could also facilitate the sequestration of more greenhouse gas CO<sub>2</sub> as daily-used chemicals, since the aerial productivity of seaweeds is much higher than that of terrestrial plants. This review first summarizes any scientific evidence that K. alvarezii extracts possess anti-photoaging properties. Next, realizing that conventional extraction methods may prevent the use of such extracts in cosmetic formulations, this review discusses the feasibility of obtaining various K. alvarezii compounds using green methods. Lastly, a perspective on several potential challenges to the proposed valorization scheme, as well as the potential solutions, is offered."
pub.1175208884,Turning waste into resources: A comprehensive review on the valorisation of Elodea nuttallii biomass,"This review focuses on the alternative uses of Elodea nuttallii (Planch.) H.St.John biomass. Elodea nuttallii is as an aquatic invasive alien species classified in the EU as a Species of Union Concern. Its dense monospecific stands affect both aquatic ecosystems and human activities, thereby requiring specific monitoring and management measures. The handling of E. nuttallii has a high economic cost, and the biomass removed from natural environments is considered a mere waste product. The need to implement circular economy, reducing waste and preserving natural capital, has led to the research for the reuse and valorisation of waterweed biomasses, such as E. nuttallii. This review critically assesses the feasibility and potential applications of E. nuttallii biomass in various sectors, including bioenergy production, extraction of metabolites, and fertilization. Out of more than 200 articles from 1965 to 2023, only 16 were found to deal with the use of harvested biomass, all within the last 12 years. This review highlights that the valorisation of E. nuttallii biomass is an underrepresented topic in scientific literature, and therefore in industrial sectors. Studies on biogas production are the most represented and have shown that E. nuttallii chemical composition is suitable for energy production, but is better suited as an additional feedstock to other biomasses already used for this purpose. New more cost-effective applications, such as animal feed and biosorbent, should be further addressed. By investigating alternative uses for E. nuttallii biomass, this review contributes to the development of sustainable practices that would turn a costly waste into a valuable resource."
pub.1164494454,Yeast-driven valorization of agro-industrial wastewater: an overview,"The intensive industrial and agricultural activities currently on-going worldwide to feed the growing human population have led to significant increase in the amount of wastewater produced. These effluents are high in phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and heavy metals. These compounds can provoke imbalance in the ecosystem with grievous consequences to both the environment and humans. Adequate treatment of these wastewaters is therefore of utmost importance to humanity. This can be achieved through valorization of these waste streams, which is based on biorefinery idea and concept of reduce, reuse, and recycle for sustainable circular economy. This concept uses innovative processes to produce value-added products from waste such as wastewater. Yeast-based wastewater treatment is currently on the rise given to the many characteristics of yeast cells. Yeasts are generally fast growing, and they are robust in terms of tolerance to stress and inhibitory compounds, in addition to their ability to metabolize a diverse range of substrates and create a diverse range of metabolites. Therefore, yeast cells possess the capacity to recover and transform agro-industrial wastewater nutrients into highly valuable metabolites. In addition to remediating the wastewater, numerous value-added products such as single cell oil (SCO), single cell proteins (SCPs), biofuels, organic acid, and aromatic compounds amongst others can be produced through fermentation of wastewater by yeast cells. This work thus brings to limelight the potential roles of yeast cells in reducing, reusing, and recycling of agro-industrial wastewaters while proffering solutions to some of the factors that limit yeast-mediated wastewater valorization."

In this study, a 2 m<sup>3</sup> pilot-scale continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) operated under mesophilic conditions was utilized for co-digestion of BW and FW. The process obtained a CH<sub>4</sub> yield of 0.7 ± 0.2 m<sup>3</sup>/kg influent-volatile solid (VS), reaching a maximum yield of 1.1 ± 0.1 m<sup>3</sup>/kg influent-VS, with an average organic loading rate of 0.6 ± 0.1 kg-VS/m<sup>3</sup>/d and HRT of 25 days. The CH<sub>4</sub> production rate averaged 0.4 ± 0.1 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>/d, peaking at 0.6 ± 0.1 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>/d. Treatment of digestate through flocculation followed by sedimentation recovered over 90% of ammonium nitrogen and potassium, and 80-85% of total phosphorus in the liquid fraction. This nutrient-rich liquid was used to cultivate <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>, achieving a biomass concentration of 1.2 ± 0.1 g/L and 85 ± 3% and 78 ± 5% ammonium nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency, respectively. These findings not only highlight the feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of source-separated BW and FW in local biogas production but also demonstrate the potential of microalgae cultivation as a sustainable approach to converting digestate into nutrient-rich algae biomass."

Among various alternatives, the microbial route for various biofuels production is quite lucrative. Use of cellulose and lignocellulose for methane, H<sub>2</sub> , organic acids, ethanol, and cellulase has been explored a lot in the past few decades. The major leftover or a coproduct of these processes belongs to lignin-an aromatic cross-link polymer and one of the most abundant complex compounds on earth. A successful bioconversion route of lignin into high-value products is highly desirable for biorefinery perspective. It requires a complex set of enzymes/catalysts to decompose lignin through depolymerization and oxygen removal leading to its monomers that can be metabolized by engineered organisms to synthesize muconic acids, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), methane, and other high-value products. This article will focus on the opportunities and challenges in the bioconversion of lignin and its derivatives into PHAs."

This review paper presents an overview of the recent advancements in the biohybrid photoanode and photocathode materials. We discuss the reaction mechanism observed at photoanode and photocathode to enhance our understanding on the solar driven MES. We extend the discussion by showcasing the potential activity of EABs toward high selectivity and production rates for desirable products by manipulating their genomic sequence. Additionally, the critical challenges associated in scaling up the PMES system including the strategies for diminution of reactive oxygen species, low solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> in the typical electrolytes, low selectivity of product species are presented along with the suggestions of alternative strategies to achieve economically viable generation of (bio)commodities."

Anaerobic digestion (AD) is still reliable, cost-effective technology for waste management. Conventional AD was originally designed for sewer sludge digestion, is not effective for FW due to mainly high organics and volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation, hence better technical aptitudes and biochemical inputs are required for optimal biogas production. Besides, to overcome these challenges, FW co-digestion with complementary organic waste e.g. sewage sludge (SS) mixed which complement each other for better process design. The main aim of this article is to summarize the recent updates and review different holistic approaches for efficient anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of FW and SS to provide a comprehensive review on the topic.

Researchers are still looking for novel routes to prepare solid photocatalysts able to transform solar into chemical energy more efficiently. In many developing countries, biomass is a major energy source, but currently such countries lack of the technology to sustainably obtain chemicals and/or fuels from it. The Roadmap for Biomass Technologies, authored by 26 leading experts from academia, industry, and government agencies, has predicted a gradual shift back to a carbohydrate-based economy. Biomass and biofuels appear to hold the key to satisfy the basic needs of our societies for the sustainable production of liquid fuels and high value-added chemicals without compromising the scenario of future generations.

pub.1154855265,Characteristics of Solidified Carbon Dioxide and Perspectives for Its Sustainable Application in Sewage Sludge Management,"Appropriate management is necessary to mitigate the environmental impacts of wastewater sludge. One lesser-known technology concerns the use of solidified CO<sub>2</sub> for dewatering, sanitization, and digestion improvement. Solidified CO<sub>2</sub> is a normal byproduct of natural gas treatment processes and can also be produced by dedicated biogas upgrading technologies. The way solidified CO<sub>2</sub> is sourced is fully in line with the principles of the circular economy and carbon dioxide mitigation. The aim of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the production and application of solid CO<sub>2</sub> in the pretreatment and management of sewage sludge. Using solidified CO<sub>2</sub> for sludge conditioning causes effective lysis of microbial cells, which destroys activated sludge flocs, promotes biomass fragmentation, facilitates efficient dispersion of molecular associations, modifies cell morphology, and denatures macromolecules. Solidified CO<sub>2</sub> can be used as an attractive tool to sanitize and dewater sludge and as a pretreatment technology to improve methane digestion and fermentative hydrogen production. Furthermore, it can also be incorporated into a closed CO<sub>2</sub> cycle of biogas production-biogas upgrading-solidified CO<sub>2</sub> production-sludge disintegration-digestion-biogas production. This feature not only bolsters the technology's capacity to improve the performance and cost-effectiveness of digestion processes, but can also help reduce atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, a crucial advantage in terms of environment protection. This new approach to solidified CO<sub>2</sub> generation and application largely counteracts previous limitations, which are mainly related to the low cost-effectiveness of the production process."
pub.1083861776,Metabolic anchor reactions for robust biorefining,"Microbial cell factories based on renewable carbon sources are fundamental to a sustainable bio-economy. The economic feasibility of producer cells requires robust performance balancing growth and production. However, the inherent competition between these two objectives often leads to instability and reduces productivity. While algorithms exist to design metabolic network reduction strategies for aligning these objectives, the biochemical basis of the growth-product coupling has remained unresolved. Here, we reveal key reactions in the cellular biochemical repertoire as universal anchor reactions for aligning cell growth and production. A necessary condition for a reaction to be an anchor is that it splits a substrate into two or more molecules. By searching the currently known biochemical reaction space, we identify 62 C-C cleaving anchor reactions, such as isocitrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.1) and L-tryptophan indole-lyase (EC 4.1.99.1), which are relevant for biorefining. The here identified anchor reactions mark network nodes for basing growth-coupled metabolic engineering and novel pathway designs."

For this, the production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by Gluconacetobacter sp. was investigated. Glycerol as carbon source revealed to be beneficial compared to glucose. In addition, pure glycerol could be substituted by a crude glycerol waste stream from biodiesel production. Systematic analysis of the peptone and phosphate concentrations in glycerol-based media indicated a strong effect of peptone. Optimized parameters resulted in a titer of 25.4 ± 2.4 g/L EPS with a productivity of 0.46 ± 0.04 g*(L*h)<sup>-1</sup>. With decreasing peptone, a variation in the monomer ratios was observed. An accompanying change in molecular size distribution indicated the production of two different polysaccharides.

In order to meet current bio-economy challenges to produce high-value multiple products at a time, new integrated processes in research and development are necessary. Though various strategies have been posited for conversion of algal-based biomass to fuel and fine chemicals, none of them has been proved as economically viable and energetically feasible. Therefore, a range of other bio-products needs to be pursued. In this context, the algal bio-refinery concept has appeared with notable solution to recover multiple products from a single operation process. Herein, an algal-based bio-refinery platform for fuel, food, and pharmaceuticals considering Bio-refinery Complexity Index (BCI) has been evaluated, as an indicator of techno-economic risks.

pub.1016860272,Resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to High Concentrations of Furfural Is Based on NADPH-Dependent Reduction by at Least Two Oxireductases,"Biofuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass hold promises for a sustainable fuel economy, but several problems hamper their economical feasibility. One important problem is the presence of toxic compounds in processed lignocellulosic hydrolysates, with furfural as a key toxin. While Saccharomyces cerevisiae has some intrinsic ability to reduce furfural to the less-toxic furfuryl alcohol, higher resistance is necessary for process conditions. By comparing an evolved, furfural-resistant strain and its parent in microaerobic, glucose-limited chemostats at increasing furfural challenge, we elucidate key mechanism and the molecular basis of both natural and high-level furfural resistance. At lower concentrations of furfural, NADH-dependent oxireductases are the main defense mechanism. At furfural concentrations above 15 mM, however, (13)C-flux and global array-based transcript analysis demonstrated that the NADPH-generating flux through the pentose phosphate pathway increases and that NADPH-dependent oxireductases become the major resistance mechanism. The transcript analysis further revealed that iron transmembrane transport is upregulated in response to furfural. While these responses occur in both strains, high-level resistance in the evolved strain was based on strong induction of ADH7, the uncharacterized open reading frame (ORF) YKL071W, and four further, likely NADPH-dependent, oxireductases. By overexpressing the ADH7 gene and the ORF YKL071W, we inversely engineered significantly increased furfural resistance in the parent strain, thereby demonstrating that these two enzymes are key elements of the resistance phenotype."

These phototrophic organisms are unique in a sense that they utilise natural sources like sunlight, water and CO2 for their growth and metabolism thereby producing diverse products that can be processed to produce biofuel, biochemical, nutraceuticals, feed, biofertilizer and other value added products. But due to low biomass productivity and high harvesting cost, microalgae-based production have not received much attention.

pub.1132136841,Phyco-remediation of swine wastewater as a sustainable model based on circular economy,"Pork production has expanded in the world in recent years. This growth has caused a significant increase in waste from this industry, especially of wastewater. Although there has been an increase in wastewater treatment, there is a lack of useful technologies for the treatment of wastewater from the pork industry. Swine farms generate high amounts of organic pollution, with large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus with final destination into water bodies. Sadly, little attention has been devoted to animal wastes, which are currently treated in simple systems, such as stabilization ponds or just discharged to the environment without previous treatment. This uncontrolled release of swine wastewater is a major cause of eutrophication processes. Among the possible treatments, phyco-remediation seems to be a sustainable and environmentally friendly option of removing compounds from wastewater such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and some metal ions. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of treating swine wastewater using different microalgae species. Nevertheless, the practicability of applying this procedure at pilot-scale has not been explored before as an integrated process. This work presents an overview of the technological applications of microalgae for the treatment of wastewater from swine farms and the by-products (pigments, polysaccharides, lipids, proteins) and services of commercial interest (biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioelectricity, biogas) generated during this process. Furthermore, the environmental benefits while applying microalgae technologies are discussed."

The basic premise is that the very generation of electricity in STPs is advantageous for companies in the sanitation sector in Brazil, resulting in cost reductions of the treatment process. Gains at the end of the process are found in two levels, namely: (i) economic, by generating 165% of electricity from biogas burning in relation to the expend; (ii) energy, by adding a new sustainable and storable energy source equivalent to 4% of natural gas offered in the State of SP and 0,5% of electricity produced from biogas burning in relation to electricity consumption. In conclusion, the potential of electricity production linked to the biogas at STPs is capable of supply its domestic demand and export the surplus to other segments of the state and national economy."

Metabolic engineering is a field of broad fundamental and practical concept so we integrated the related technology achievements into the real practices of many metabolic engineering cases, such as biobased products production, environmental control and others. Now metabolic engineering is developing towards the systems level. Chinese researchers have also embraced this concept and have contributed invaluable things in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and related bioinformatics. A series of advanced laboratories or centers were established which will represent Chinese modern biotechnology development in the near future. At the end of this review, metabolic network research advances have also been mentioned."
pub.1017230262,Engineering a more sustainable world through catalysis and green chemistry,"The grand challenge facing the chemical and allied industries in the twenty-first century is the transition to greener, more sustainable manufacturing processes that efficiently use raw materials, eliminate waste and avoid the use of toxic and hazardous materials. It requires a paradigm shift from traditional concepts of process efficiency, focusing on chemical yield, to one that assigns economic value to replacing fossil resources with renewable raw materials, eliminating waste and avoiding the use of toxic and/or hazardous substances. The need for a greening of chemicals manufacture is readily apparent from a consideration of the amounts of waste generated per kilogram of product (the E factors) in various segments of the chemical industry. A primary source of this waste is the use of antiquated 'stoichiometric' technologies and a major challenge is to develop green, catalytic alternatives. Another grand challenge for the twenty-first century, driven by the pressing need for climate change mitigation, is the transition from an unsustainable economy based on fossil resources--oil, coal and natural gas--to a sustainable one based on renewable biomass. In this context, the valorization of waste biomass, which is currently incinerated or goes to landfill, is particularly attractive. The bio-based economy involves cross-disciplinary research at the interface of biotechnology and chemical engineering, focusing on the development of green, chemo- and biocatalytic technologies for waste biomass conversion to biofuels, chemicals and bio-based materials. Biocatalysis has many benefits to offer in this respect. The catalyst is derived from renewable biomass and is biodegradable. Processes are performed under mild conditions and generally produce less waste and are more energy efficient than conventional ones. Thanks to modern advances in biotechnology 'tailor-made' enzymes can be economically produced on a large scale. However, for economic viability it is generally necessary to recover and re-use the enzyme and this can be achieved by immobilization, e.g. as solid cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs), enabling separation by filtration or centrifugation. A recent advance is the use of 'smart', magnetic CLEAs, which can be separated magnetically from reaction mixtures containing suspensions of solids; truly an example of cross-disciplinary research at the interface of physical and life sciences, which is particularly relevant to biomass conversion processes."

Biotechnologies are an effective platform to attain green transition objectives, especially when synergically integrated to promote health and environmental protection. In this context, microalgae-based biotechnologies are considered among the most effective tools for treating gaseous effluents and simultaneously capturing carbon sources for further biomass valorisation. The production of biodiesel is regarded as a promising avenue for harnessing value from residual algal biomass. Nonetheless, the existing techniques for extracting lipids still face certain limitations, primarily centred around the cost-effectiveness of the process.This study is dedicated to developing and optimising an innovative and cost-efficient technique for extracting lipids from algal biomass produced during gaseous emissions treatment based on algal-bacterial biotechnology. This integrated treatment technology combines a bio-scrubber for degrading gaseous contaminants and a photobioreactor for capturing the produced CO<sub>2</sub> within valuable algal biomass. The cultivated biomass is then processed with the process newly designed to extract lipids simultaneously transesterificated in fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) via In Situ Transesterification (IST) with a Kumagawa-type extractor. The results of this study demonstrated the potential application of the optimised method to overcome the gap to green transition. Energy production was obtained from residuals produced during the necessary treatment of gaseous emissions. Using hexane-methanol (v/v = 19:1) mixture in the presence KOH in Kumagawa extractor lipids were extracted with extraction yield higher than 12% and converted in fatty acid methyl esters. The process showed the enhanced extraction of lipids converted in bio-sourced fuels with circular economy approach, broadening the applicability of biotechnologies as sustainable tools for energy source diversification."
pub.1152228944,Inoculum-to-substrate ratio and solid content effects over in natura spent coffee grounds anaerobic digestion,"Coffee is the second most traded commodity worldwide, and its production is associated with the generation of a large number of residues, which are underused and disposed of in landfills. Notably, the coffee industry annually generates approximately 6 million tons of industrial spent coffee ground (ISCG) when extracting coffee flavorings to produce soluble coffee. That resource loss scenario has been highlighted in sustainable waste management contexts as an opportunity to improve the coffee circular economy. Despite ISCG bioconversion to methane potentially meets the waste-to-energy purposes of reducing residues disposal in landfills, decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and increasing renewable energy sources, data about anaerobic digestion (AD) of ISCG remains quite restricted. That limitation becomes more apparent owing to the lack of data focusing on AD key parameters for ISCG as substrate. This study assessed the influence of inoculum-to-substrate ratio (ISR) and the solid content influences on mesophilic (37 °C) ISCG-AD throughout the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Central Composite Design (CCD). Results revealed that both factors, ISR and solid content, should be kept above a certain threshold of 0.5 and 6.0 gTVS L<sup>-1</sup> to ensure experimental reliability, as well as reproductively and above 1.0 and 8.0 gTVS L<sup>-1</sup> to avoid underestimation on the MY potential achieved. Concerning ISCG-AD kinetics, the quadratic model optimum condition was at 1.36 and 14.83 gTVS L<sup>-1</sup> for ISR and solid content, respectively. This optimum range for ISR and solid content could guide further development of process configurations for mono- and co-digestion of ISCG, avoiding underestimation of the MY potential and extended incubation periods."
pub.1148254732,Valorization of full-scale waste aerobic granular sludge for biogas production and the characteristics of the digestate,"Despite the dynamic development of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) technology in wastewater treatment, there is limited data on how the different properties of AGS and activated sludge (AS) translate into differences in waste sludge management. Waste sludge generated in both AGS and AS technology is the biggest waste stream generated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This study aimed to assess biogas production from waste AGS from a full-scale system. Additionally, the properties of the digestate were investigated in terms of its management in line with the assumptions of a circular economy. Both aspects are important because the characteristics of AGS differ from those of AS. Its dense, extracellular-polymer-rich granule structure makes the susceptibility of AGS to anaerobic stabilization lower than that of AS. Given the advantages of AGS for sustainable wastewater treatment and its increasing popularity, waste AGS management will pose a serious challenge for WWTP operators. Therefore, AGS from a full-scale municipal WWTP was valorized for biogas production by increasing the accessibility of the organics in the sludge by homogenization or ultrasound pretreatment. Ultrasound pretreatment released about an order of magnitude more organics from the biomass than homogenization and significantly improved the production of methane-rich biogas (455 L/kg VS, about 66% of CH<sub>4</sub>). The digestion time of pretreated AGS was reduced by 25% in comparison with that of untreated AGS making anaerobic digestion of AGS a feasible solution for sludge management. The AGS digestate was rich in Ca (77.0 g/kg TS), Mg (10.9 g/kg TS), N (35.1 g/kg TS) and P (32.4 g/kg TS), whereas its heavy metal levels and biochemical methane potential were low. AGS digestate is not only environmentally safe, but it can serve as a rich source of organics and elements essential for soil fertility and stability."
pub.1170235337,Valorization of Rejected Macroalgae Kappaphycopsis cottonii for Bio-Oil and Bio-Char Production via Slow Pyrolysis,"<i>Kappaphycopsis cottonii</i>, a prominent macroalgae species cultivated in an Indonesian marine culture, yields significant biomass, a portion of which is often rejected by industry. This study explores the potential valorization of rejected <i>K. cottonii</i> biomass through slow pyrolysis for bio-oil and biochar production, presenting an alternative and sustainable utilization pathway. The study utilizes a batch reactor setup for the thermal decomposition of <i>K. cottonii</i>, conducted at temperatures between 400 and 600 °C and varying time intervals between 10 and 50 min. The study elucidates the temperature-dependent behavior of <i>K. cottonii</i> during slow pyrolysis, emphasizing its impact on product distributions. The results suggest that there is a rise in bio-oil production when the pyrolysis temperature is raised from 400 to 500 °C. This uptick is believed to be due to improved dehydration and greater thermal breakdown of the algal biomass. Conversely, at 600 °C, bio-oil yield diminishes, indicating secondary cracking of liquid products and the generation of noncondensable gases. Chemical analysis of bio-oils reveals substantial quantities of furan derivatives, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and carboxylic acids. Biochar exhibits calorific values within the range of 17.52-19.46 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup>, and slow pyrolysis enhances its specific surface area, accompanied by the observation of carbon nanostructures. The study not only investigates product yields but also deduces plausible reaction routes for the generation of certain substances throughout the process of slow pyrolysis. Overall, the slow pyrolysis of rejected <i>K. cottonii</i> presents an opportunity to obtain valuable chemicals and biochar. These products hold promise for applications such as biofuels and diverse uses in wastewater treatment, catalysis, and adsorption, contributing to both environmental mitigation and the circular economy."
pub.1130242333,Bio-purification of sugar industry wastewater and production of high-value industrial products with a zero-waste concept,"In recent years, biorefinery approach with a zero-waste concept has gained a lot research impetus to boost the environment and bioeconomy in a sustainable manner. The wastewater from sugar industries contains miscellaneous compounds and need to be treated chemically or biologically before being discharged into water bodies. Efficient utilization of wastewater produced by sugar industries is a key point to improve its economy. Thus, interest in the sugar industry wastes has grown in both fundamental and applied research fields, over the years. Although, traditional methods being used to process such wastewaters are effective yet are tedious, laborious and time intensive. Considering the diverse nature of wastewaters from various sugar-manufacturing processes, the development of robust, cost-competitive, sustainable and clean technologies has become a challenging task. Under the recent scenario of cleaner production and consumption, the biorefinery and/or close-loop concept, though using different technologies and multi-step processes, namely, bio-reduction, bio-accumulation or biosorption using a variety of microbial strains, has stepped-up as the method of choice for a sustainable exploitation of a wide range of organic waste matter along with the production of high-value products of industrial interests. This review comprehensively describes the use of various microbial strains employed for eliminating the environmental pollutants from sugar industry wastewater. Moreover, the main research gaps are also critically discussed along with the prospects for the efficient purification of sugar industry wastewaters with the concomitant production of high-value products using a biorefinery approach. In this review, we emphasized that the biotransformation/biopurification of sugar industry waste into an array of value-added compounds such as succinic acid, L-arabinose, solvents, and xylitol is a need of hour and is futuristic approach toward achieving cleaner production and consumption."
pub.1113863511,Bioeconomy from experts’ perspectives – Results of a global expert survey,"Effective global collaboration is crucial to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It requires an understanding of the needs of individual countries and their expectations related to bioeconomy. With the aim to explore the prospective developments in the global bioeconomy over the next 20 years, the German Bioeconomy Council, an independent advisory body to the German Federal Government, commissioned BIOCOM-AG to invite experts from around the globe to share their insights in a global expert survey. The survey was conducted online in autumn 2017. 345 experts from 46 countries completed the questionnaire about future developments and strategies in the global bioeconomy. As claimed by the experts, the upcoming bioeconomy must primarily meet humanity's needs in the energy, agriculture, and food sectors. Moreover, innovative products based on renewable resources are anticipated to be of great importance. Even though all UN SDGs will be affected by future bioeconomy success stories, five SDGs stood out within the sample: SDG 12: 'responsible consumption and production'; SDG 9: 'industry, innovation and infrastructure'; SDG 13: 'climate action'; SDG 7: 'affordable and clean energy'; and SDG 11: 'sustainable cities and communities'. About three quarters of the experts emphasized the need to specifically address three conflicting goals in any future bioeconomy strategy: non-food uses of arable land, use of crop land to produce feedstock for meat, milk and egg production and, finally, the conversion of virgin forests into agricultural land. Most experts stated that reducing food loss and waste is crucial to eradicating the world hunger problem. The proposed solutions relied greatly on innovation and technological development. Bioeconomy expertise and know-how should be shared in close cooperation between developed and developing economies to reach UN SDGs. A supportive political framework would be the ultimate goal towards furthering the progress of a future bioeconomy all over the world."
pub.1107666790,Strain engineering for microbial production of value-added chemicals and fuels from glycerol,"While the widespread reliance on fossil fuels is driven by their low cost and relative abundance, this fossil-based economy has been deemed unsustainable and, therefore, the adoption of sustainable and environmentally compatible energy sources is on the horizon. Biorefinery is an emerging approach that integrates metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and systems biology principles for the development of whole-cell catalytic platforms for biomanufacturing. Due to the high degree of reduction and low cost, glycerol, either refined or crude, has been recognized as an ideal feedstock for the production of value-added biologicals, though microbial dissimilation of glycerol sometimes can be difficult particularly under anaerobic conditions. While strain development for glycerol biorefinery is widely reported in the literature, few, if any, commercialized bioprocesses have been developed as a result, such that engineering of glycerol metabolism in microbial hosts remains an untapped opportunity in biomanufacturing. Here we review the recent progress made in engineering microbial hosts for the production of biofuels, diols, organic acids, biopolymers, and specialty chemicals from glycerol. We begin with a broad outline of the major pathways for fermentative and respiratory glycerol dissimilation and key end metabolites, and then focus our analysis on four key genera of bacteria known to naturally dissimilate glycerol, i.e. Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus, in addition to Escherichia coli, and systematically review the progress made toward engineering these microorganisms for glycerol biorefinery. We also identify the major biotechnological and bioprocessing advantages and disadvantages of each genus, and bottlenecks limiting the production of target metabolites from glycerol in engineered strains. Our analysis culminates in the development of potential strategies to overcome the current technical limitations identified for commonly employed strains, with an outlook on the suitability of different hosts for the production of key metabolites and avenues for their future development into biomanufacturing platforms."
pub.1046184280,Analysis of Technological Innovation and Environmental Performance Improvement in Aviation Sector,"The past oil crises have caused dramatic improvements in fuel efficiency in all industrial sectors. The aviation sector-aircraft manufacturers and airlines-has also made significant efforts to improve the fuel efficiency through more advanced jet engines, high-lift wing designs, and lighter airframe materials. However, the innovations in energy-saving aircraft technologies do not coincide with the oil crisis periods. The largest improvement in aircraft fuel efficiency took place in the 1960s while the high oil prices in the 1970s and on did not induce manufacturers or airlines to achieve a faster rate of innovation. In this paper, we employ a historical analysis to examine the socio-economic reasons behind the relatively slow technological innovation in aircraft fuel efficiency over the last 40 years. Based on the industry and passenger behaviors studied and prospects for alternative fuel options, this paper offers insights for the aviation sector to shift toward more sustainable technological options in the medium term. Second-generation biofuels could be the feasible option with a meaningful reduction in aviation's lifecycle environmental impact if they can achieve sufficient economies of scale."
pub.1143649211,Bioeconomy and green recovery in a post-COVID-19 era,"The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a health crisis and repetitive lockdowns that disrupted different economic and societal segments. As the world has placed hope on the vaccination progress to bring back the socio-economic ""normal,"" this article explores how the bioeconomy can enhance the resilience and sustainability of bio-based, food, and energy systems in the post-COVID-19 era. The proposed recovery approach integrates technological innovations, environment, ecosystem services, ""biocities,"" food, rural economies, and tourism. The importance of integrating culture, arts, and the fashion industry as part of the recovery is underlined towards building a better bioeconomy that, together with environmental safeguards, promotes socio-cultural and economic innovations. This integration could be achieved supporting communities and stakeholders to diversify their activities by combining sustainable production with decarbonization, stimulating private investments in this direction and monitoring the resulting impact of mitigation measures. Food systems should become more resilient in order to allow adapting rapidly to severe crises and future shocks, while it is important to increase circularity towards the valorization of waste, the integration of different processes within the biorefinery concept and the production of bio-based products and biofuels."
pub.1124002682,Synthetic Biology Applied to Carbon Conservative and Carbon Dioxide Recycling Pathways,"The global warming conjugated with our reliance to petrol derived processes and products have raised strong concern about the future of our planet, asking urgently to find sustainable substitute solutions to decrease this reliance and annihilate this climate change mainly due to excess of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. In this regard, the exploitation of microorganisms as microbial cell factories able to convert non-edible but renewable carbon sources into biofuels and commodity chemicals appears as an attractive solution. However, there is still a long way to go to make this solution economically viable and to introduce the use of microorganisms as one of the motor of the forthcoming bio-based economy. In this review, we address a scientific issue that must be challenged in order to improve the value of microbial organisms as cell factories. This issue is related to the capability of microbial systems to optimize carbon conservation during their metabolic processes. This initiative, which can be addressed nowadays using the advances in Synthetic Biology, should lead to an increase in products yield per carbon assimilated which is a key performance indice in biotechnological processes, as well as to indirectly contribute to a reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emission."
pub.1031547339,Valorization of industrial waste and by-product streams via fermentation for the production of chemicals and biopolymers,"The transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to a bio-based economy necessitates the exploitation of synergies, scientific innovations and breakthroughs, and step changes in the infrastructure of chemical industry. Sustainable production of chemicals and biopolymers should be dependent entirely on renewable carbon. White biotechnology could provide the necessary tools for the evolution of microbial bioconversion into a key unit operation in future biorefineries. Waste and by-product streams from existing industrial sectors (e.g., food industry, pulp and paper industry, biodiesel and bioethanol production) could be used as renewable resources for both biorefinery development and production of nutrient-complete fermentation feedstocks. This review focuses on the potential of utilizing waste and by-product streams from current industrial activities for the production of chemicals and biopolymers via microbial bioconversion. The first part of this review presents the current status and prospects on fermentative production of important platform chemicals (i.e., selected C2-C6 metabolic products and single cell oil) and biopolymers (i.e., polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacterial cellulose). In the second part, the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of waste and by-product streams from existing industrial sectors are presented. In the third part, the techno-economic aspects of bioconversion processes are critically reviewed. Four case studies showing the potential of case-specific waste and by-product streams for the production of succinic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoates are presented. It is evident that fermentative production of chemicals and biopolymers via refining of waste and by-product streams is a highly important research area with significant prospects for industrial applications.

pub.1135457185,Biogas and biofertilizer production from organic fraction municipal solid waste for sustainable circular economy and environmental protection in Malaysia,"Waste management in Malaysia remains a persistent economic and environmental challenge. Up to date, more than 80% of Malaysian solid waste disposed at landfills and dumpsites. Therefore, Malaysia is facing an urgent need to move towards a sustainable solid waste management and thus resource recovery from organic solid waste. Hence, this study aims to investigate the feasibility of energy and bio fertilizer recovery from organic fraction municipal solid waste (OFMSW) via anaerobic digestion. The economic and environmental benefit analysis was investigated. Approximate and elementary analysis of OFMSW samples were carried out to estimate the potential production of biogas and bio fertilizer. It was found that organic waste contributes about 45% of the total MSW generated in Malaysia. Anaerobic digestion of 50% of organic waste is expected to produce 3941 MWh/day of electrical energy and 2500 t/day of bio fertilizer. In terms of environmental impacts, 2735 t/day of Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission, 1128 m<sup>2</sup>/day of landfilling area and 481 m<sup>3</sup>/day of leachate can be avoided. A net revenue of 3300 million RM (1 US Dollar ≈ 4.15 RM) can be generated by the sales of electricity via Feed-in-Tariff (FiT), sales of biofertilizer to local agricultural industries and inclusive of the saving generated from the reduction of OFMSW landfilling operations and leachate treatment at landfills. Economic development can go hand-in-hand with environmental sound practices in the field of waste management."
pub.1130697520,The bio-chemical cycle of iron and the function induced by ZVI addition in anaerobic digestion: A review,"Zero-valent iron (ZVI) is known to be an additive in facilitating waste treatment and improving biogas production in anaerobic digestion (AD) systems. This review concentrates on the chemical cycle of iron as well as the function of the iron cycle in the removal of four kinds of pollutants: organic carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus, which are commonly encountered in waste treatment. In recent studies, the addition of ZVI to an AD system promoted the in-situ production of CH<sub>4</sub> from CO<sub>2</sub>, enabling carbon capture through biotechnology. Additionally, using iron-carbon microbial electrolytic cells in AD systems in order to accelerate electron transport, as well as specific pollutant degradation mechanisms, are illustrated in the present study. Particularly, the main factors affecting the removal efficiency of contaminants in a ZVI-AD system such as pH, VFA/ Alkalinity (ALK), oxidation-reduction potential and particle size are reviewed. According to the above characteristics, combined with technical model and economic analyses, an AD system based on ZVI was considered to be an economical, efficient and carbon-neutral pollutant treatment technology. Accordingly, Iron-based AD is suggested to be a promising and sustainable approach orientated to a circular economy, which may be applied to many waste treatments fields."
pub.1113085928,Enhanced Saccharification and Fermentation of Rice Straw by Reducing the Concentration of Phenolic Compounds Using an Immobilized Enzyme Cocktail,"The production of bioethanol from rice straw can contribute to the rural economy and provide clean fuel in a sustainable manner. However, phenolic compounds, which are mostly produced during acid pretreatment of biomass, act as inhibitors of fermenting microorganisms. Laccase is well known for its ability to oxidize lignin and phenolic compounds derived from lignocellulosic biomass. In the present study, an immobilized enzyme cocktail containing laccase was isevaluated in regard to its ability to enhance the saccharification and fermentation processes by reducing the amount of phenolic compounds produced. Saccharification of rice straw with the laccase-supplemented immobilized enzyme cocktail reduced phenolic compounds by 73.8%, resulting in a saccharification yield of 84.6%. In addition, improved yeast performance was is noted during the fermentation process, resulting in a 78.3% conversion of sugar into ethanol with an ethanol productivity of 0.478 g/L/h. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the use of an immobilized enzyme cocktail comprised of Celluclast 1.5L, β-glucosidase, and laccase for the production of bioethanol from rice straw. This study details a potential approach to producing biofuels from agricultural biomass, the applicability of which can be improved through up-scaling."

The Diels-Alder reaction is of great importance in the chemistry of renewable resources and provides an atom-economic pathway for fine chemical synthesis and for the production of materials. The biobased furans furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural, which can be easily obtained from the carbohydrate part of plant biomass, were recognized as ""platform chemicals"" that will help to replace the existing oil-based refining to biorefining. Diels-Alder cycloaddition of furanic dienes with various dienophiles represents the ideal example of a ""green"" process characterized by a 100% atom economy and a reasonable E-factor. In this review, we first summarize the literature data on the regio- and diastereoselectivity of intermolecular Diels-Alder reactions of furfural derivatives with alkenes with the aim of establishing the current progress in the efficient production of practically important low-molecular-weight products. The information provided here will be useful and relevant to scientists in many fields, including medical and pharmaceutical research, polymer development and materials science."

The answer to these challenges should be simple, sustainable, and inexpensive. Thus, biomimetic-inspired circular and holistic processes combing water remediation and biofuel production can be an appealing concept to deal with these global issues. A simple circular approach using helical <i>Spirulina platensis</i> microalgae as biotemplates to synthesize Ni@ZnO@ZnS photocatalysts for efficient solar water decontamination and bioethanol production during the recycling process is presented. Under solar irradiation, the Ni@ZnO@ZnS-<i>Spirulina</i> photocatalyst exhibits enhanced activity (mineralization efficiency &gt;99%) with minimal photocorrosion and excellent reusability. At the end of its effective lifetime for water remediation, the microalgae skeleton (mainly glycogen and glucose) of the photocatalyst is recycled to directly produce bioethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process. An outstanding ethanol yield of 0.4 L kg<sup>-1</sup>, which is similar to the highest yield obtained from oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms, is obtained. Thus, the entire process allows effective solar photocatalytic water remediation and bioethanol production at room temperature using simple and easily scalable procedures that simultaneously fixes carbon dioxide, thereby constituting a zero-carbon-emission circular process."
pub.1072291315,Engineering organisms for industrial fuel production,"Volatile fuel costs, the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel security concerns are driving efforts to produce sustainable renewable fuels and chemicals. Petroleum comes from sunlight, CO(2) and water converted via a biological intermediate into fuel over a several million year timescale. It stands to reason that using biology to short-circuit this time cycle offers an attractive alternative--but only with relevant products at or below market prices. The state of the art of biological engineering over the past five years has progressed to allow for market needs to drive innovation rather than trying to adapt existing approaches to the market. This report describes two innovations using synthetic biology to dis-intermediate fuel production. LS9 is developing a means to convert biological intermediates such as cellulosic hydrolysates into drop-in hydrocarbon product replacements such as diesel. Joule Unlimited is pioneering approaches to eliminate feedstock dependency by efficiently capturing sunlight, CO(2) and water to produce fuels and chemicals. The innovations behind these companies are built with the market in mind, focused on low cost biosynthesis of existing products of the petroleum industry. Through successful deployment of technologies such as those behind LS9 and Joule Unlimited, alternative sources of petroleum products will mitigate many of the issues faced with our petroleum-based economy."

This leads to the creation of green cities through algae cultivation as waste and renewable materials can be put to good use. The challenges that arise when using algae and the future prospect in terms of SDGs and economy will also be covered in this review. The future of green cities can be enhanced with the adaptation of algae as the source of renewable plants to create a better outlook of an algae green city."
pub.1125404131,Simultaneous lipid production for biodiesel feedstock and decontamination of sago processing wastewater using Candida tropicalis ASY2,"BackgroundWithout sufficient alternatives to crude oil, as demand continues to rise, the global economy will undergo a drastic decline as oil prices explode. Dependence on crude oil and growing environmental impairment must eventually be overcome by creating a sustainable and profitable alternative based on renewable and accessible feedstock. One of the promising solutions for the current and near-future is the substitution of fossil fuels with sustainable liquid feedstock for biofuel production. Among the different renewable liquid feedstock’s studied, wastewater is the least explored one for biodiesel production. Sago wastewater is the byproduct of the cassava processing industry and has starch content ranging from 4 to 7%. The present investigation was aimed to produce microbial lipids from oleaginous yeast, Candida tropicalis ASY2 for use as biodiesel feedstock and simultaneously decontaminate the sago processing wastewater for reuse. Initial screening of oleaginous yeast to find an efficient amylolytic with maximum lipid productivity resulted in a potent oleaginous yeast strain, C. tropicalis ASY2, that utilizes SWW as a substrate. Shake flask experiments are conducted over a fermentation time of 240 h to determine a suitable fatty acid composition using GC-FID for biodiesel production with simultaneous removal of SWW pollutants using ASY2.ResultsThe maximum biomass of 0.021 g L−1 h−1 and lipid productivity of 0.010 g L−1 h−1 was recorded in SWW with lipid content of 49%. The yeast strain degraded cyanide in SWW (79%) and also removed chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate (NO3), ammoniacal (NH4), and phosphate (PO4) ions (84%, 92%, 100%, 98%, and 85%, respectively). GC-FID analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) revealed high oleic acid content (41.33%), which is one of the primary fatty acids for biodiesel production.ConclusionsIt is evident that the present study provides an innovative and ecologically sustainable technology that generates valuable fuel, biodiesel using SWW as a substrate and decontaminates for reuse."
pub.1164577176,Exploring the potential of Bacillus subtilis as cell factory for food ingredients and special chemicals,"BackgroundBacillus subtilis has been established as model microorganism for fundamental research in the laboratory on protein production/secretion and sporulation and as model bacterium for controlling spoilage in the food industry. It has also been used for production of (commercial) enzymes and several secondary metabolites such as vitamins. However, this doesn’t fully reflect the potential of B. subtilis as a cell-factory. Here, various strains of B. subtilis, including food-grade, spore-deficient strains and industrially used strains, were compared for their growth and metabolic potential. Industry-relevant parameters were analyzed for all strains under various aeration regimes, under anaerobic conditions, in various nutritious and nutrient-limited cultivation media, with and without organic nitrogen sources, and with and without sugar.ResultsPractical experiments were conducted to compare industrial relevant properties like growth rates, intracellular components and extracellular metabolite profile of different B. subtilis strains. Based on growth flexibility in different media, we found that some strains like NCIB3610 and DSM1092 are adapted to inorganic or organic nitrogen source utilization, which is highly relevant when considering a biorefinery approach using various cheap and abundant waste/sidestreams. Secondly, spore-deficient strains such as 3NA, 168 S and PY79S, showed advantages in microbial protein and acetolactate pathway expression, which is associated with applications in food industry for protein supplement and diacetyl production. Lastly, WB800 and PY79S exhibited potential for fermentative production of dipicolinic acid, 2,3-butanediol and lactic acid that could serve as precursors for biopolymers.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the broad potential for more extensive industrial use of Bacillus subtilis in the (bio-based) chemical industry for use of sidestreams, in the personal care industry, in the food industry for food additive production, and in the bio-sustainable industry for biofuel and bio-degradable plastic precursors production. In addition, selecting different B. subtilis strains for specific purposes makes full use of the diversity of this species and increases the potential of B. subtilis in its contribution to the bio-based economy."
pub.1149473342,CO2 adsorption on pyrolysis char from protein-containing livestock waste: How do proteins affect?,"Biogas generation through anaerobic digestion provides an interesting opportunity to valorize some types of animal waste materials whose management is increasingly complicated by legal and environmental restrictions. To successfully expand anaerobic digestion in livestock areas, operational issues such as digestate management must be addressed in an economical and environmentally sustainable way. Biogas upgrading is another necessary stage before intending it to add-value applications. The high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in biogas results in a reduced caloric value, so the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> would be beneficial for most end-users. The current work evaluates the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake properties (thermogravimetry study) of low-cost adsorbent materials produced from the animal wastes generated in the livestock area itself, specifically via pyrolysis of poorly biodegradable materials, such as meat and bone meal, and the digestate from manure anaerobic digestion. Therefore, the new element in this study with respect to other studies found in the literature related to biochar-based CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption performance is the presence of high content of pyrolyzed proteins in the adsorbent material. In this work, pyrolyzed chars from both meat and bone meal and co-digested manure have been proven to adsorb CO<sub>2</sub> reversibly, and also the chars produced from their representative pure proteins (collagen and soybean protein), which were evaluated as model compounds for a better understanding of the individual performance of proteins. The ultra-microporosity developed in the protein chars during pyrolysis seems to be the main explanation for such CO<sub>2</sub> uptake capacities, while neither the BET surface area nor N-functionalities on the char surface can properly explain the observed results. Although the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacities of these pristine chars (6-41.0 mg CO<sub>2</sub>/g char) are far away from data of commercially activated carbons (~80 mg CO<sub>2</sub>/g char), this application opens a new via to integrate and valorize these wastes in the circular economy of the primary sector."
pub.1136413570,Biodiesel production from alternative raw materials using a heterogeneous low ordered biosilicified enzyme as biocatalyst,"BackgroundCumulative reported evidence has indicated that renewable feedstocks are a promising alternative source to fossil platforms for the production of fuels and chemicals. In that regard, the development of new, highly active, selective, and easy to recover and reuse catalysts for biomass conversions is urgently needed. The combination of enzymatic and inorganic heterogeneous catalysis generates an unprecedented platform that combines the advantages of both, the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of enzymes with the ordered structure, high porosity, mechanical, thermal and chemical resistance of mesoporous materials to obtain enzymatic heterogeneous catalysts. Enzymatic mineralization with an organic silicon precursor (biosilicification) is a promising and emerging approach for the generation of solid hybrid biocatalysts with exceptional stability under severe use conditions. Herein, we assessed the putative advantages of the biosilicification technology for developing an improved efficient and stable biocatalyst for sustainable biofuel production.ResultsA series of solid enzymatic catalysts denominated LOBE (low ordered biosilicified enzyme) were synthesized from Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase and tetraethyl orthosilicate. The microscopic structure and physicochemical properties characterization revealed that the enzyme formed aggregates that were contained in the heart of silicon-covered micelles, providing active sites with the ability to process different raw materials (commercial sunflower and soybean oils, Jatropha excisa oil, waste frying oil, acid oil from soybean soapstock, and pork fat) to produce first- and second-generation biodiesel. Ester content ranged from 81 to 93% wt depending on the raw material used for biodiesel synthesis.ConclusionsA heterogeneous enzymatic biocatalyst, LOBE4, for efficient biodiesel production was successfully developed in a single-step synthesis reaction using biosilicification technology. LOBE4 showed to be highly efficient in converting refined, non-edible and residual oils (with high water and free fatty acid contents) and ethanol into biodiesel. Thus, LOBE4 emerges as a promising tool to produce second-generation biofuels, with significant implications for establishing a circular economy and reducing the carbon footprint."

Thus, this study assessed the biotechnology capacity—biomass production, biochemical composition, and nutrient uptake—from tequila vinasses (TVs) as the nutrient source of three indigenous microalgae—Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., and Chlamydomonas sp.—cultured under heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. The results demonstrated that under the mixotrophic regime, the three microalgae evaluated reached the highest nitrogen uptake, biomass production, and cell compound accumulation. Under this condition, Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. showed the highest nutrient uptake and biomass production, 1.7 ± 0.3 and 1.9 ± 0.3 g L−1, respectively; however, the biochemical composition, mainly carbohydrates and proteins, varied depending on the microalgal strain and its growth regime. Overall, our results demonstrated the biotechnological capacity of native microalgae from TVs, which may vary not only depending on the microalgal strain but also the culture strategy implemented and the characteristics of the residue used, highlighting—from a perspective of circular bio-economy—the feasibility of implementing microalgal bioprocess to reuse and valorize the nutrimental composition of TVs through biomass and high-valuable metabolite production, depicting a sustainable strategy for tequila agro-industry in Mexico.Graphic abstract"
pub.1141878774,Waste to energy conversion for a sustainable future,"Air pollution, climate change, and plastic waste are three contemporary global concerns. Air pollutants affect the lungs, green gases trap heat radiation, and plastic waste contaminates the marine food chain. Two-thirds of climate change and air pollution drivers are emitted in the process of burning fossil fuels. Pollutants settle in months, green gases take centuries, and plastics take thousands of years. The most polluted regions on the planet are also the ones that are greatly affected by climate change. Air pollutants grow in most climate-change affected areas, contributing to the greenhouse effect. Smog affects local and regional transboundary countries. The biggest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters may not be the worst-hit victims because wind and water flow distribute green gases and plastic waste worldwide. The major polluters are often rich and developed countries, and the worst affected countries are the underdeveloped poor communities. Technologically advanced countries may help the developing countries in research into removing particulate matter, green gases, and plastic waste. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Paris Accord have emphasized on immeasurable efforts to encourage the conversion of pollution, green gases, and plastic waste into energy. Conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into petrol, GHG gases into chemicals, biowaste into biofuels, plastic waste into building bricks, and concrete waste into construction materials fosters a circular economy. This work reviews existing waste to power, energy, and value-added product conversion technologies."
pub.1005896123,Designed for deconstruction – poplar trees altered in cell wall lignification improve the efficacy of bioethanol production,"• There is a pressing global need to reduce the increasing societal reliance on petroleum and to develop a bio-based economy. At the forefront is the need to establish a sustainable, renewable, alternative energy sector. This includes liquid transportation fuel derived from lignocellulosic plant materials. However, one of the current limiting factors restricting the effective and efficient conversion of lignocellulosic residues is the recalcitrance of the substrate to enzymatic conversion. • In an attempt to assess the impact of cell wall lignin on recalcitrance, we subjected poplar trees engineered with altered lignin content and composition to two potential industrial pretreatment regimes, and evaluated the overall efficacy of the bioconversion to ethanol process. • It was apparent that total lignin content has a greater impact than monomer ratio (syringyl : guaiacyl) on both pretreatments. More importantly, low lignin plants showed as much as a 15% improvement in the efficiency of conversion, with near complete hydrolysis of the cellulosic polymer. • Using genomic tools to breed or select for modifications in key cell wall chemical and/or ultrastructural traits can have a profound effect on bioenergy processing. These techniques may therefore offer means to overcome the current obstacles that underpin the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic substrates to bioconversion."
pub.1129990223,Valorization of swine manure biochar as a catalyst for transesterifying waste cooking oil into biodiesel,"As demand of proteins from meats has significantly increased with economy growth, the population of livestock proliferates. Thus, heavy amount of livestock byproducts released from livestock industries will become more problematic if they are handled in an unsatisfactory manner. In this study, swine manure (SM) waste was directly valorized to be used as a reaction catalyst for biodiesel production. Pyrolysis was adapted to produce swine manure biochars at 500 (SMB@500) and 650 °C (SMB@650), and the materials were used for conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesels (i.e., fatty acid methyl esters: FAMEs). The properties of SMBs and resulting pyrolytic gases (i.e., H<sub>2</sub>, CO, and C<sub>1-2</sub> hydrocarbons (HCs)) and liquids during pyrolysis were also characterized. SMBs used in this study included a large quantity of metallic contents that significantly contributed to the rapid reaction for biodiesel production. In detail, SMB@500 and SMB@650 showed higher than 96% of FAME yield at 305 and 210 °C of reaction temperature, while non-catalytic reaction using SiO<sub>2</sub> showed similar FAME yield at 330 °C. Thus, this work offers a sustainable way to recycle organic and inorganic materials in livestock manures for energy (biodiesel, pyrolytic oil, H<sub>2</sub>, and C<sub>1-2</sub> HCs) production."
pub.1127149388,Optimization of hybrid treatment of olive mill wastewaters through impregnation onto raw cypress sawdust and electrocoagulation,"This research investigation proposes a new method for sustainable olive mill wastewater (OMW) treatment and handling. It is based on the combination of its impregnation onto raw cypress sawdust (RCS) followed by electrocoagulation. The retention of OMW compounds onto various RCS doses show an important decrease of its chemical oxygen demand (COD) and its main cation and anion content. The maximum retention efficiencies of COD, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, PO43−$$ {PO}_4^{3-} $$, and SO42−$$ {SO}_4^{2-} $$ were about 51.0%, 75.3%, 28.7%, 77.9%, 84.7%, 41.1%, 98.3%, and 90.9%, respectively, for the highest RCS dose (200 g L−1). This organic matter- and nutrient-loaded biomass could be thermochemically converted through pyrolysis into biofuel and biochar for energetic and agronomic purposes, respectively. The treatment by electrocoagulation of the pre-treated OMW using mild steel electrodes could be considered an attractive treatment method since 75.6% of COD removal efficiency was achieved. Besides, this approach permits a significant energy consumption reduction by 46% as compared with the electrocoagulation process alone. It allows also a significant improvement of the treated effluent quality in terms of both organic and mineral contents that could be reused for the irrigation of olive trees in the context of circular economy."
pub.1017760382,Recent Land Use Change to Agriculture in the U.S. Lake States: Impacts on Cellulosic Biomass Potential and Natural Lands,"Perennial cellulosic feedstocks may have potential to reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by offsetting fossil fuels. However, this potential depends on meeting a number of important criteria involving land cover change, including avoiding displacement of agricultural production, not reducing uncultivated natural lands that provide biodiversity habitat and other valued ecosystem services, and avoiding the carbon debt (the amount of time needed to repay the initial carbon loss) that accompanies displacing natural lands. It is unclear whether recent agricultural expansion in the United States competes with lands potentially suited for bioenergy feedstocks. Here, we evaluate how recent land cover change (2008-2013) has affected the availability of lands potentially suited for bioenergy feedstock production in the U.S. Lake States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan) and its impact on other natural ecosystems. The region is potentially well suited for a diversity of bioenergy production systems, both grasses and woody biomass, due to the widespread forest economy in the north and agricultural economy in the south. Based on remotely-sensed data, our results show that between 2008 and 2013, 836,000 ha of non-agricultural open lands were already converted to agricultural uses in the Lake States, a loss of nearly 37%. The greatest relative changes occurred in the southern half that includes some of the most diverse cultivable lands in the country. We use transition diagrams to reveal gross changes that can be obscured if only net change is considered. Our results indicate that expansion of row crops (corn, soybean) was responsible for the majority of open land loss. Even if recently lost open lands were brought into perennial feedstock production, there would a substantial carbon debt. This reduction in open land availability for biomass production is closing the window of opportunity to establish a sustainable cellulosic feedstock economy in the Lake States as mandated by current Federal policy, incurring a substantial GHG debt, and displacing a range of other natural ecosystems and their services.

pub.1129099397,Engineering microbial pathways for production of bio-based chemicals from lignocellulosic sugars: current status and perspectives,"Lignocellulose is the most abundant biomass on earth with an annual production of about 2 × 1011 tons. It is an inedible renewable carbonaceous resource that is very rich in pentose and hexose sugars. The ability of microorganisms to use lignocellulosic sugars can be exploited for the production of biofuels and chemicals, and their concurrent biotechnological processes could advantageously replace petrochemicals’ processes in a medium to long term, sustaining the emerging of a new economy based on bio-based products from renewable carbon sources. One of the major issues to reach this objective is to rewire the microbial metabolism to optimally configure conversion of these lignocellulosic-derived sugars into bio-based products in a sustainable and competitive manner. Systems’ metabolic engineering encompassing synthetic biology and evolutionary engineering appears to be the most promising scientific and technological approaches to meet this challenge. In this review, we examine the most recent advances and strategies to redesign natural and to implement non-natural pathways in microbial metabolic framework for the assimilation and conversion of pentose and hexose sugars derived from lignocellulosic material into industrial relevant chemical compounds leading to maximal yield, titer and productivity. These include glycolic, glutaric, mesaconic and 3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid as organic acids, monoethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol and 1,2,4-butanetriol, as alcohols. We also discuss the big challenges that still remain to enable microbial processes to become industrially attractive and economically profitable."
pub.1142563287,Organosolv Fractionation of Birch Sawdust: Establishing a Lignin-First Biorefinery,"The use of residual biomass for bioconversions makes it possible to decrease the output of fossil-based chemicals and pursue a greener economy. While the use of lignocellulosic material as sustainable feedstock has been tried at pilot scale, industrial production is not yet economically feasible, requiring further technology and feedstock optimization. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of replacing woodchips with residual sawdust in biorefinery applications. Woodchips can be used in value-added processes such as paper pulp production, whereas sawdust is currently used mainly for combustion. The main advantages of sawdust are its large supply and a particle size sufficiently small for the pretreatment process. Whereas, the main challenge is the higher complexity of the lignocellulosic biomass, as it can contain small amounts of bark and cambium. Here, we studied the fractionation of birch sawdust by organosolv pretreatment at two different temperatures and for two different durations. We evaluated the efficiency of fractionation into the three main fractions: lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. The cellulose content in pretreated biomass was as high as 69.2%, which was nearly double the amount in untreated biomass. The obtained lignin was of high purity, with a maximum 4.5% of contaminating sugars. Subsequent evaluation of the susceptibility of pretreated solids to enzymatic saccharification revealed glucose yields ranging from 75% to 90% after 48 h but reaching 100.0% under the best conditions. In summary, birch sawdust can be successfully utilized as a feedstock for organosolv fractionation and replace woodchips to simplify and lower the costs of biorefinery processes."
pub.1132466716,A novel mechanism of β-glucosidase stimulation through a monosaccharide binding-induced conformational change,"It is urgent the transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to a sustainable bioeconomy based on bioconversion technologies using renewable plant biomass feedstocks to produce high chemicals, bioplastics, and biofuels. β-Glucosidases are key enzymes responsible for degrading the plant cell wall polymers, as they cleave glucan-based oligo- and polysaccharides to generate glucose. Monosaccharide-tolerant or -stimulated β-glucosidases have been reported in the past decade. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of β-glucosidase stimulation by glucose and xylose. The glycoside hydrolase 1 family β-glucosidase from Thermotoga petrophila (TpBgl1) displays a typical glucose stimulation mechanism based on an increased V<sub>max</sub> and decreased K<sub>m</sub> in response to glucose. Through molecular docking and dynamics analyses, we mapped putative monosaccharide binding regions (BRs) on the surface of TpBgl1. Our results indicate that after interaction with glucose or xylose at BR1 site, an adjacent loop region assumes an extended conformation, which increases the entrance to the TpBgl1 active site, improving product formation. Biochemical assays with TpBgl1 BR1 mutants, TpBgl1<sup>D49A/Y410A</sup> and TpBgl1<sup>D49K/Y410H</sup>, resulted in decreasing and abolishing monosaccharide stimulation, respectively. These mutations also impaired the BR1 looping extension responsible for monosaccharide stimulation. This study provides a molecular basis for the rational design of β-glucosidases for biotechnological applications."
pub.1124906097,"Valorization of byproducts from tropical fruits: Extraction methodologies, applications, environmental, and economic assessment: A review (Part 1: General overview of the byproducts, traditional biorefinery practices, and possible applications)","Tropical fruits represent one of the most important crops in the world. The continuously growing global market for the main tropical fruits is currently estimated at 84 million tons, of which approximately half is lost or wasted throughout the whole processing chain. Developing novel processes for the conversion of these byproducts into value-added products could provide a viable way to manage this waste problem, aiming at the same time to create a sustainable economic growth within a bio-economy perspective. Given the ever-increasing concern about sustainability, complete valorization through a bio-refinery approach, that is, zero waste concept, as well as the use of green techniques is therefore of utmost importance. This paper aims to report the status on the valorization of tropical fruit byproducts within a bio-refinery frame, via the application of traditional methodologies, and with specific attention to the extraction of phenolics and carotenoids as bioactive compounds. The different types of byproducts, and their content of bioactives is reviewed, with a special emphasis on the lesser-known tropical fruits. Moreover, the bioactivity of the different types of extracts and their possible application as a resource for different sectors (food, pharmaceutical, and environmental sciences) is discussed. Consequently, this review presents the concepts of tropical fruit biorefineries, and the potential applications of the isolated fractions."
pub.1039357597,A sustainable woody biomass biorefinery,"Woody biomass is renewable only if sustainable production is imposed. An optimum and sustainable biomass stand production rate is found to be one with the incremental growth rate at harvest equal to the average overall growth rate. Utilization of woody biomass leads to a sustainable economy. Woody biomass is comprised of at least four components: extractives, hemicellulose, lignin and cellulose. While extractives and hemicellulose are least resistant to chemical and thermal degradation, cellulose is most resistant to chemical, thermal, and biological attack. The difference or heterogeneity in reactivity leads to the recalcitrance of woody biomass at conversion. A selection of processes is presented together as a biorefinery based on incremental sequential deconstruction, fractionation/conversion of woody biomass to achieve efficient separation of major components. A preference is given to a biorefinery absent of pretreatment and detoxification process that produce waste byproducts. While numerous biorefinery approaches are known, a focused review on the integrated studies of water-based biorefinery processes is presented. Hot-water extraction is the first process step to extract value from woody biomass while improving the quality of the remaining solid material. This first step removes extractives and hemicellulose fractions from woody biomass. While extractives and hemicellulose are largely removed in the extraction liquor, cellulose and lignin largely remain in the residual woody structure. Xylo-oligomers, aromatics and acetic acid in the hardwood extract are the major components having the greatest potential value for development. Higher temperature and longer residence time lead to higher mass removal. While high temperature (>200°C) can lead to nearly total dissolution, the amount of sugars present in the extraction liquor decreases rapidly with temperature. Dilute acid hydrolysis of concentrated wood extracts renders the wood extract with monomeric sugars. At higher acid concentration and higher temperature the hydrolysis produced more xylose monomers in a comparatively shorter period of reaction time. Xylose is the most abundant monomeric sugar in the hydrolysate. The other comparatively small amounts of monomeric sugars include arabinose, glucose, rhamnose, mannose and galactose. Acetic acid, formic acid, furfural, HMF and other byproducts are inevitably generated during the acid hydrolysis process. Short reaction time is preferred for the hydrolysis of hot-water wood extracts. Acid hydrolysis presents a perfect opportunity for the removal or separation of aromatic materials from the wood extract/hydrolysate. The hot-water wood extract hydrolysate, after solid-removal, can be purified by Nano-membrane filtration to yield a fermentable sugar stream. Fermentation products such as ethanol can be produced from the sugar stream without a detoxification step."
pub.1014558272,High impact biowastes from South European agro-industries as feedstock for second-generation biorefineries,"Availability of bio-based chemicals, materials and energy at reasonable cost will be one of the forthcoming issues for the EU economy. In particular, the development of technologies making use of alternative resources to fossil fuels is encouraged by the current European research and innovation strategy to face the societal challenge of natural resource scarcity, fossil resource dependence and sustainable economic growth. In this respect, second- generation biorefineries, i.e. biorefineries fed with biowastes, appear to be good candidates to substitute and replace the present downstream processing scheme. Contrary to first-generation biorefineries, which make use of dedicated crops or primary cultivations to achieve such a goal, the former employ agricultural, industrial, zootechnical, fishery and forestry biowastes as the main feedstock. This leaves aside any ethical and social issue generated by first-generation approaches, and concomitantly prevents environmental and economical issues associated with the disposal of the aforementioned leftovers. Unfortunately, to date, a comprehensive and updated mapping of the availability and potential use of bioresources for second-generation biorefineries in Europe is missing. This is a lack that severely limits R&D and industrial applications in the sector. On the other hand, attempts at valorizing the most diverse biowastes dates back to the nineteenth century and plenty of information in the literature on their sustainable exploitation is available. However, the large majority of these investigations have been focused on single fractions of biowastes or single steps of biowaste processing, preventing considerations on an integrated and modular (cascade) approach for the whole valorization of organic leftovers. This review aims at addressing these issues by gathering recent data on (a) some of the main high-impact biowastes located in Europe and in particular in its Southern part, and (b) the bio-based chemicals, materials and fuels that can be produced from such residues. In particular, we focused on those key compounds referred to as ""chemical platforms"", which have been indicated as fundamental to generate the large majority of the industrially relevant goods to date.

pub.1103605921,From agro-industrial wastes to single cell oils: a step towards prospective biorefinery,"The reserves of fossil-based fuels, which currently seem sufficient to meet the global demands, is inevitably on the verge of exhaustion. Contemporary raw material for alternate fuel like biodiesel is usually edible plant commodity oils, whose increasing public consumption rate raises the need of finding a non-edible and fungible alternate oil source. In this quest, single cell oils (SCO) from oleaginous yeasts and fungi can provide a sustainable alternate of not only functional but also valuable (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-rich) lipids. Researches are been increasingly driven towards increasing the SCO yield in order to realize its commercial importance. However, bulk requirement of expensive synthetic carbon substrate, which inflates the overall SCO production cost, is the major limitation towards complete acceptance of this technology. Even though substrate cost minimization could make the SCO production profitable is uncertain, it is still essential to identify suitable cheap and abundant substrates in an attempt to potentially reduce the overall process economy. One of the most sought-after in-expensive carbon reservoirs, agro-industrial wastes, can be an attractive replacement to expensive synthetic carbon substrates in this regard. The present review assess these possibilities referring to the current experimental investigations on oleaginous yeasts, and fungi reported for conversion of agro-industrial feedstocks into triacylglycerols (TAGs) and PUFA-rich lipids. Multiple associated factors regulating lipid accumulation utilizing such substrates and impeding challenges has been analyzed. The review infers that production of bulk oil in combination to high-value fatty acids, co-production strategies for SCO and different microbial metabolites, and reutilization and value addition to spent wastes could possibly leverage the high operating costs and help in commencing a successful biorefinery. Rigorous research is nevertheless required whether it is PUFA-rich oil production (for competing with algal omega oils) or neutral bulk oil production (for overcoming yield limitations and managing process economy) to establish this potential source as future resource."
pub.1142587562,Pig farm biogas slurry can effectively reduce the pH of saline-alkali soils,"Pig farm biogas slurry is being increasingly used as a potent organic fertilizer for sustainable agriculture under circular economy. However, the effect of biogas slurry on soil pH is currently controversial, and the underlying mechanisms especially in saline-alkali soils are not well understood. A saline-alkali soil (pH = 9.2, EC = 2.0 ms/cm) was selected for soil column (0-50 cm) experiments with (BS) and without (CK) addition of pig farm biogas slurry to investigate the soil pH change and its driving factors. Our results show that the soil pH under CK ranged between 9.1 and 9.5 across different soil depths. Compared to CK, the BS-treated soil had lower pH at 0-20 cm depth and higher pH at 20-30 cm depth (<i>P &lt; 0.01</i>). The soil <math><msubsup><mrow><mi>NH</mi></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></math> concentrations were negatively correlated with pH values under BS (<i>P &lt; 0.01</i>), indicating that the oxidation of ammonium mainly contributed to the decrease of soil pH. Interestingly, the anions, such as Cl<sup>-</sup>, <math><msubsup><mrow><mi>SO</mi></mrow><mn>4</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo></mrow></msubsup></math> and <math><msubsup><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup></math>, were accumulated in the topsoil (0-20 cm) under BS, resulting in the changed correlations of these anions with Na<sup>+</sup> when compared to the control. FT-IR and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra uncovered that carboxyl, amide C, and total alkyl C groups may be responsible for reducing pH of the saline-alkali soil tested. The soil surface morphology confirmed a much tighter granular aggregate microstructure when mixing the biogas slurry with the soil. Overall, we concluded that from the perspective of soil pH, the utilization of biogas slurry for improving saline-alkali soil is feasible and sustainable."
pub.1124670232,Chapter One Genetic engineering for enhanced productivity in bioelectrochemical systems,"A shift from petrochemical processes toward a bio-based economy is one of the most advocated developments for a sustainable future. To achieve this will require the biotechnological production of platform chemicals that can be further processed by chemical engineering. Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are a novel tool within the biotechnology field. In BESs, microbes serve as biocatalysts for the production of biofuels and value-added compounds, as well as for the production of electricity. Although the general feasibility of bioelectrochemical processes has been demonstrated in recent years, much research has been conducted to develop biocatalysts better suited to meet industrial demands. Initially, mainly natural exoelectrogenic organisms were investigated for their performance in BESs. Driven by possibilities of recent developments in genetic engineering and synthetic biology, the spectrum of microbial catalysts and their versatility (substrate and product range) have expanded significantly. Despite these developments, there is still a tremendous gap between currently achievable space-time yields and current densities on the one hand and the theoretical limits of BESs on the other. It will be necessary to move the performance of the biocatalysts closer to the theoretical possibilities in order to establish viable production routines. This review summarizes the status quo of engineering microbial biocatalysts for anode-applications with high space-time yields. Furthermore, we will address some of the theoretical limitations of these processes exemplarily and discuss which of the present strategies might be combined to achieve highly synergistic effects and, thus, meet industrial demands."
pub.1016734670,Engineering yeasts for raw starch conversion,"Next to cellulose, starch is the most abundant hexose polymer in plants, an import food and feed source and a preferred substrate for the production of many industrial products. Efficient starch hydrolysis requires the activities of both α-1,4 and α-1,6-debranching hydrolases, such as endo-amylases, exo-amylases, debranching enzymes, and transferases. Although amylases are widely distributed in nature, only about 10 % of amylolytic enzymes are able to hydrolyse raw or unmodified starch, with a combination of α-amylases and glucoamylases as minimum requirement for the complete hydrolysis of raw starch. The cost-effective conversion of raw starch for the production of biofuels and other important by-products requires the expression of starch-hydrolysing enzymes in a fermenting yeast strain to achieve liquefaction, hydrolysis, and fermentation (Consolidated Bioprocessing, CBP) by a single organism. The status of engineering amylolytic activities into Saccharomyces cerevisiae as fermentative host is highlighted and progress as well as challenges towards a true CBP organism for raw starch is discussed. Conversion of raw starch by yeast secreting or displaying α-amylases and glucoamylases on their surface has been demonstrated, although not at high starch loading or conversion rates that will be economically viable on industrial scale. Once efficient conversion of raw starch can be demonstrated at commercial level, engineering of yeast to utilize alternative substrates and produce alternative chemicals as part of a sustainable biorefinery can be pursued to ensure the rightful place of starch converting yeasts in the envisaged bio-economy of the future."

Biodiesel produced from waste, non-edible seed oils is a cleaner, green and alternate source of fuel for diesel engines which can possibly add to circular bioeconomy. In this study, Citrus aurantium a novel, nonedible and waste seed oil (38% w/w) producing feedstock was subjected to biodiesel synthesis using recyclable zirconium oxide nano particles synthesized with Alternanthera pungens aqueous leave extract. Maximum yield of 94% was obtained through optimized reaction parameters of methanol to oil molar ratio 6:1, reaction time 120 min, temperature 87.5 °C and catalyst loading of 0.5 wt% using Response Surface Methodology. Green nano particles of zirconium oxide were characterized via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy diffraction X-Ray (EDX) while; physiochemical characterization of synthesized biodiesel was carried through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatography/Mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C). Fuel properties of methyl ester met international standards of ASTM D-6571, EN 14214 and China GB/T 20828-2007. It was concluded that biodiesel production from Citrus aurantium waste and non-edible seed oil can be efficiently employed for generation of renewable energy which would further provide assistance in transformation of linear economy to circular bioeconomy."
pub.1142132809,Waste-to-nutrition: a review of current and emerging conversion pathways,"Residual biomass is acknowledged as a key sustainable feedstock for the transition towards circular and low fossil carbon economies to supply whether energy, chemical, material and food products or services. The latter is receiving increasing attention, in particular in the perspective of decoupling nutrition from arable land demand. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the technical possibilities to convert residual biomasses into edible ingredients, we reviewed over 950 scientific and industrial records documenting existing and emerging waste-to-nutrition pathways, involving over 150 different feedstocks here grouped under 10 umbrella categories: (i) wood-related residual biomass, (ii) primary crop residues, (iii) manure, (iv) food waste, (v) sludge and wastewater, (vi) green residual biomass, (vii) slaughterhouse by-products, (viii) agrifood co-products, (ix) C<sub>1</sub> gases and (x) others. The review includes a detailed description of these pathways, as well as the processes they involve. As a result, we proposed four generic building blocks to systematize waste-to-nutrition conversion sequence patterns, namely enhancement, cracking, extraction and bioconversion. We further introduce a multidimensional representation of the biomasses suitability as potential as nutritional sources according to (i) their content in anti-nutritional compounds, (ii) their degree of structural complexity and (iii) their concentration of macro- and micronutrients. Finally, we suggest that the different pathways can be grouped into eight large families of approaches: (i) insect biorefinery, (ii) green biorefinery, (iii) lignocellulosic biorefinery, (iv) non-soluble protein recovery, (v) gas-intermediate biorefinery, (vi) liquid substrate alternative, (vii) solid-substrate fermentation and (viii) more-out-of-slaughterhouse by-products.

This requires novel and effective strategies to reduce the cost contribution of the cellulolytic enzymatic cocktails needed to convert the carbohydrates into simple sugars, in order to make large-scale commercial processes economically competitive. Here, we propose the use of the whole solid-state fermentation (SSF) medium of mixed filamentous fungi as an integrated one-pot strategy for on-site enzyme production, biomass hydrolysis, and ethanol production. Ten different individual and mixed cultivations of commonly used industrial filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Trichoderma harzianum, and Trichoderma reesei) were performed under SSF and the whole media (without the extraction step) were used in the hydrolysis of pretreated sugarcane bagasse. The cocultivation of T. reesei with A. oryzae increased the amount of glucose released by around 50%, compared with individual cultivations. The release of glucose and reducing sugars achieved using the whole SSF medium was around 3-fold higher than obtained with the enzyme extract. The addition of soybean protein (0.5% w/w) during the hydrolysis reaction further significantly improved the saccharification performance by blocking the lignin and avoiding unproductive adsorption of enzymes. The results of the alcoholic fermentation validated the overall integrated process, with a volumetric ethanol productivity of 4.77 g/L.h, representing 83.5% of the theoretical yield. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed one-pot integrated strategy using the whole SSF medium of mixed filamentous fungi for on-site enzymes production, biomass hydrolysis, and ethanol production. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

pub.1139666015,Overview of Feedstocks for Sustainable Biodiesel Production and Implementation of the Biodiesel Program in Pakistan,"The energy demand of the world is skyrocketing due to the exponential economic growth and population expansion. To meet the energy requirement, the use of fossil fuels is not a good decision, causing environmental pollution such as CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Therefore, the use of renewable energy sources like biofuels can meet the energy crisis especially for countries facing oil shortages such as Pakistan. This review describes the comparative study of biodiesel synthesis for various edible oils, non-edible oils, and wastes such as waste plastic oil, biomass pyrolysis oil, and tyre pyrolysis oil in terms of their oil content and extraction, cetane number, and energy content. The present study also described the importance of biodiesel synthesis via catalytic transesterification and its implementation in Pakistan. Pakistan is importing an extensive quantity of cooking oil that is used in the food processing industries, and as a result, a huge quantity of waste cooking oil (WCO) is generated. The potential waste oils for biodiesel synthesis are chicken fat, dairy scum, WCO, and tallow oil that can be used as potential substrates of biodiesel. The implementation of a biodiesel program as a replacement of conventional diesel will help to minimize the oil imports and uplift the country's economy. Biodiesel production via homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyzed transesterification is more feasible among all transesterification processes due to a lesser energy requirement and low cost. Therefore, biodiesel synthesis and implementation could minimize the imports of diesel by significantly contributing to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Although, waste oil can meet the energy needs, more available cultivation land should be used for substrate cultivation. In addition, research is still needed to explore innovative solvents and catalysts so that overall biodiesel production cost can be minimized. This would result in successful biodiesel implementation in Pakistan."
pub.1010274638,Assessing an effective feeding strategy to optimize crude glycerol utilization as sustainable carbon source for lipid accumulation in oleaginous yeasts,"BackgroundMicrobial lipids can represent a valuable alternative feedstock for biodiesel production in the context of a viable bio-based economy. This production can be driven by cultivating some oleaginous microorganisms on crude-glycerol, a 10 % (w/w) by-product produced during the transesterification process from oils into biodiesel. Despite attractive, the perspective is still economically unsustainable, mainly because impurities in crude glycerol can negatively affect microbial performances. In this view, the selection of the best cell factory, together with the development of a robust and effective production process are primary requirements.ResultsThe present work compared crude versus pure glycerol as carbon sources for lipid production by three different oleaginous yeasts: Rhodosporidium toruloides (DSM 4444), Lipomyces starkeyi (DSM 70295) and Cryptococcus curvatus (DSM 70022). An efficient yet simple feeding strategy for avoiding the lag phase caused by growth on crude glycerol was developed, leading to high biomass and lipid production for all the tested yeasts. Flow-cytometry and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy, supported by principal component analysis (PCA), were used as non-invasive and quick techniques to monitor, compare and analyze the lipid production over time. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis completed the quali-quantitative description. Under these operative conditions, the highest lipid content (up to 60.9 % wt/wt) was measured in R. toruloides, while L. starkeyi showed the fastest glycerol consumption rate (1.05 g L−1 h−1). Being productivity the most industrially relevant feature to be pursued, under the presented optimized conditions R. toruloides showed the best lipid productivity (0.13 and 0.15 g L−1 h−1 on pure and crude glycerol, respectively).ConclusionsHere we demonstrated that the development of an efficient feeding strategy is sufficient in preventing the inhibitory effect of crude glycerol, and robust enough to ensure high lipid accumulation by three different oleaginous yeasts. Single cell and in situ analyses allowed depicting and comparing the transition between growth and lipid accumulation occurring differently for the three different yeasts. These data provide novel information that can be exploited for screening the best cell factory, moving towards a sustainable microbial biodiesel production."
pub.1138487685,Polysaccharide utilization loci-driven enzyme discovery reveals BD-FAE: a bifunctional feruloyl and acetyl xylan esterase active on complex natural xylans,"BackgroundNowadays there is a strong trend towards a circular economy using lignocellulosic biowaste for the production of biofuels and other bio-based products. The use of enzymes at several stages of the production process (e.g., saccharification) can offer a sustainable route due to avoidance of harsh chemicals and high temperatures. For novel enzyme discovery, physically linked gene clusters targeting carbohydrate degradation in bacteria, polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), are recognized ‘treasure troves’ in the era of exponentially growing numbers of sequenced genomes.ResultsWe determined the biochemical properties and structure of a protein of unknown function (PUF) encoded within PULs of metagenomes from beaver droppings and moose rumen enriched on poplar hydrolysate. The corresponding novel bifunctional carbohydrate esterase (CE), now named BD-FAE, displayed feruloyl esterase (FAE) and acetyl esterase activity on simple, synthetic substrates. Whereas acetyl xylan esterase (AcXE) activity was detected on acetylated glucuronoxylan from birchwood, only FAE activity was observed on acetylated and feruloylated xylooligosaccharides from corn fiber. The genomic contexts of 200 homologs of BD-FAE revealed that the 33 closest homologs appear in PULs likely involved in xylan breakdown, while the more distant homologs were found either in alginate-targeting PULs or else outside PUL contexts. Although the BD-FAE structure adopts a typical α/β-hydrolase fold with a catalytic triad (Ser-Asp-His), it is distinct from other biochemically characterized CEs.ConclusionsThe bifunctional CE, BD-FAE, represents a new candidate for biomass processing given its capacity to remove ferulic acid and acetic acid from natural corn and birchwood xylan substrates, respectively. Its detailed biochemical characterization and solved crystal structure add to the toolbox of enzymes for biomass valorization as well as structural information to inform the classification of new CEs."
pub.1128398005,Assessing the potential for up‐cycling recovered resources from anaerobic digestion through microbial protein production,"Anaerobic digesters produce biogas, a mixture of predominantly CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> , which is typically incinerated to recover electrical and/or thermal energy. In a context of circular economy, the CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> could be used as chemical feedstock in combination with ammonium from the digestate. Their combination into protein-rich bacterial, used as animal feed additive, could contribute to the ever growing global demand for nutritive protein sources and improve the overall nitrogen efficiency of the current agro- feed/food chain. In this concept, renewable CH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> can serve as carbon-neutral energy sources for the production of protein-rich cellular biomass, while assimilating and upgrading recovered ammonia from the digestate. This study evaluated the potential of producing sustainable high-quality protein additives in a decentralized way through coupling anaerobic digestion and microbial protein production using methanotrophic and hydrogenotrophic bacteria in an on-farm bioreactor. We show that a practical case digester handling liquid piggery manure, of which the energy content is supplemented for 30% with co-substrates, provides sufficient biogas to allow the subsequent microbial protein as feed production for about 37% of the number of pigs from which the manure was derived. Overall, producing microbial protein on the farm from available methane and ammonia liberated by anaerobic digesters treating manure appears economically and technically feasible within the current range of market prices existing for high-quality protein. The case of producing biomethane for grid injection and upgrading the CO<sub>2</sub> with electrolytic hydrogen to microbial protein by means of hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria was also examined but found less attractive at the current production prices of renewable hydrogen. Our calculations show that this route is only of commercial interest if the protein value equals the value of high-value protein additives like fishmeal and if the avoided costs for nutrient removal from the digestate are taken into consideration."
pub.1108063071,FlbA-Regulated Gene rpnR Is Involved in Stress Resistance and Impacts Protein Secretion when Aspergillus niger Is Grown on Xylose,"Proteins are secreted throughout the mycelium of <i>Aspergillus niger</i> except for the sporulating zone. A link between sporulation and repression of protein secretion was underlined by the finding that inactivation of the sporulation gene <i>flbA</i> results in mycelial colonies that secrete proteins throughout the colony. However, Δ<i>flbA</i> strain hyphae also lyse and have thinner cell walls. This pleiotropic phenotype is associated with differential expression of 36 predicted transcription factor genes, one of which, <i>rpnR</i>, was inactivated in this study. Sporulation, biomass, and secretome complexity were not affected in the Δ<i>rpnR</i> deletion strain of the fungus. In contrast, ribosomal subunit expression and protein secretion into the medium were reduced when <i>A. niger</i> was grown on xylose. Moreover, the Δ<i>rpnR</i> strain showed decreased resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the proteotoxic stress-inducing agent dithiothreitol. Taking the data together, RpnR is involved in proteotoxic stress resistance and impacts protein secretion when <i>A. niger</i> is grown on xylose.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Aspergillus niger</i> secretes a large amount and diversity of industrially relevant enzymes into the culture medium. This makes the fungus a widely used industrial cell factory. For instance, carbohydrate-active enzymes of <i>A. niger</i> are used in biofuel production from lignocellulosic feedstock. These enzymes represent a major cost factor in this process. Higher production yields could substantially reduce these costs and therefore contribute to a more sustainable economy and less dependence on fossil fuels. Enzyme secretion is inhibited in <i>A. niger</i> by asexual reproduction. The sporulation protein FlbA is involved in this process by impacting the expression of 36 predicted transcription factor genes. Here, we show that one of these predicted transcriptional regulators, RpnR, regulates protein secretion and proteotoxic stress resistance. The gene is thus an interesting target to improve enzyme production in <i>A. niger</i>."
pub.1140409245,A dynamic risk assessment model to assess the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on the sustainability of the biomass supply chain: A case study of a U.S. biofuel industry,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly detrimental, and its death distribution peculiarity has severely affected people's health and the operations of businesses. COVID-19 has wholly undermined the global economy, including inflicting significant damage to the ever-emerging biomass supply chain; its sustainability is disintegrating due to the coronavirus. The biomass supply chain must be sustainable and robust enough to adapt to the evolving and fluctuating risks of the market due to the coronavirus or any potential future pandemics. However, no such study has been performed so far. To address this issue, investigating how COVID-19 influences a biomass supply chain is vital. This paper presents a dynamic risk assessment methodological framework to model biomass supply chain risks due to COVID-19. Using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) formalism, the impacts of COVID-19 on the performance of biomass supply chain risks have been studied. The proposed model has been applied to the biomass supply chain of a U.S.-based Mahoney Environmental® company in Washington, USA. The case study results show that it would take one year to recover from the maximum damage to the biomass supply chain due to COVID-19, while full recovery would require five years. Results indicate that biomass feedstock gate availability (FGA) is 2%, due to pandemic and lockdown conditions. Due to the availability of vaccination and gradual business reopenings, this availability increases to 92% in the second year. Results also indicate that the price of fossil-based fuel will gradually increase after one year of the pandemic; however, the market prices of fossil-based fuel will not revert to pre-coronavirus conditions even after nine years. K-fold cross-validation is used to validate the DBN. Results of validation indicate a model accuracy of 95%. It is concluded that the pandemic has caused risks to the sustainability of biomass feedstock, and the current study can help develop risk mitigation strategies."
pub.1103690908,"Metagenome, metatranscriptome, and metaproteome approaches unraveled compositions and functional relationships of microbial communities residing in biogas plants","The production of biogas by anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residues, organic wastes, animal excrements, municipal sludge, and energy crops has a firm place in sustainable energy production and bio-economy strategies. Focusing on the microbial community involved in biomass conversion offers the opportunity to control and engineer the biogas process with the objective to optimize its efficiency. Taxonomic profiling of biogas producing communities by means of high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing provided high-resolution insights into bacterial and archaeal structures of AD assemblages and their linkages to fed substrates and process parameters. Commonly, the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes appeared to dominate biogas communities in varying abundances depending on the apparent process conditions. Regarding the community of methanogenic Archaea, their diversity was mainly affected by the nature and composition of the substrates, availability of nutrients and ammonium/ammonia contents, but not by the temperature. It also appeared that a high proportion of 16S rRNA sequences can only be classified on higher taxonomic ranks indicating that many community members and their participation in AD within functional networks are still unknown. Although cultivation-based approaches to isolate microorganisms from biogas fermentation samples yielded hundreds of novel species and strains, this approach intrinsically is limited to the cultivable fraction of the community. To obtain genome sequence information of non-cultivable biogas community members, metagenome sequencing including assembly and binning strategies was highly valuable. Corresponding research has led to the compilation of hundreds of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) frequently representing novel taxa whose metabolism and lifestyle could be reconstructed based on nucleotide sequence information. In contrast to metagenome analyses revealing the genetic potential of microbial communities, metatranscriptome sequencing provided insights into the metabolically active community. Taking advantage of genome sequence information, transcriptional activities were evaluated considering the microorganism’s genetic background. Metaproteome studies uncovered enzyme profiles expressed by biogas community members. Enzymes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition and utilization of other complex biopolymers were identified. Future studies on biogas functional microbial networks will increasingly involve integrated multi-omics analyses evaluating metagenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome datasets."

Port and direct injection and spark and compression ignition engines are examined. We investigate diesel fuel from both petroleum and biosources as well as C2H5OH from corn, herbaceous bio-mass, and woody biomass. The baseline vehicle is a gasoline-fueled 1998 Ford Taurus. We optimize the other fuel/powertrain combinations for each specific fuel as a part of making the vehicles comparable to the baseline in terms of range, emissions level, and vehicle lifetime. Life-cycle calculations are done using the economic input-output life-cycle analysis (EIO-LCA) software; fuel cycles and vehicle end-of-life stages are based on published model results. We find that recent advances in gasoline vehicles, the low petroleum price, and the extensive gasoline infrastructure make it difficult for any alternative fuel to become commercially viable. The most attractive alternative fuel is compressed natural gas because it is less expensive than gasoline, has lower regulated pollutant and toxics emissions, produces less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and is available in North America in large quantities. However, the bulk and weight of gas storage cylinders required for the vehicle to attain a range comparable to that of gasoline vehicles necessitates a redesign of the engine and chassis. Additional natural gas transportation and distribution infrastructure is required for large-scale use of natural gas for transportation. Diesel engines are extremely attractive in terms of energy efficiency, but expert judgment is divided on whether these engines will be able to meet strict emissions standards, even with reformulated fuel. The attractiveness of direct injection engines depends on their being able to meet strict emissions standards without losing their greater efficiency. Biofuels offer lower GHG emissions, are sustainable, and reduce the demand for imported fuels. Fuels from food sources, such as biodiesel from soybeans and C2H5OH from corn, can be attractive only if the co-products are in high demand and if the fuel production does not diminish the food supply. C2H5OH from herbaceous or woody biomass could replace the gasoline burned in the light-duty fleet while supplying electricity as a co-product. While it costs more than gasoline, bioethanol would be attractive if the price of gasoline doubled, if significant reductions in GHG emissions were required, or if fuel economy regulations for gasoline vehicles were tightened."
pub.1100180839,Growth and metabolic characteristics of oleaginous microalgal isolates from Nilgiri biosphere Reserve of India,"BackgroundRenewable energy for sustainable development is a subject of a worldwide debate since continuous utilization of non-renewable energy sources has a drastic impact on the environment and economy; a search for alternative energy resources is indispensable. Microalgae are promising and potential alternate energy resources for biodiesel production. Thus, our efforts were focused on surveying the natural diversity of microalgae for the production of biodiesel. The present study aimed at identification, isolation, and characterization of oleaginous microalgae from shola forests of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR), the biodiversity hot spot of India, where the microalgal diversity has not yet been systematically investigated.ResultsOverall the higher biomass yield, higher lipid accumulation and thermotolerance observed in the isolated microalgal strains have been found to be the desirable traits for the efficient biodiesel production. Species composition and diversity analysis yielded ten potential microalgal isolates belonging to Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae classes. The chlorophytes exhibited higher growth rate, maximum biomass yield, and higher lipid accumulation than Cyanophyceae. Among the chlorophytes, the best performing strains were identified and represented by Acutodesmus dissociatus (TGA1), Chlorella sp. (TGA2), Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) and Hindakia tetrachotoma (PGA1). The Chlamydomonadales sp. recorded with the highest growth rate, lipid accumulation and biomass yield of 0.28 ± 0.03 day−1 (μexp), 29.7 ± 0.69% and 134.17 ± 16.87 mg L−1 day−1, respectively. It was also found to grow well at various temperatures, viz., 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C, indicating its suitability for open pond cultivation. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis of stationary phase cultures of selected four algal strains by tandem mass spectrograph showed C16:0, C18:1 and C18:3 as dominant fatty acids suitable for biodiesel production. All the three strains except for Hindakia tetrachotoma (PGA1) recorded higher carbohydrate content and were considered as potential feed stocks for biodiesel production through hydrothermal liquefaction technology (HTL).ConclusionsIn conclusion, the present investigation is a first systematic study on the microalgal diversity of soil and water samples from selected sites of NBR. The study resulted in isolation and characterization of ten potent oleaginous microalgae and found four cultures as promising feed stocks for biodiesel production. Of the four microalgae, Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) was found to be significantly thermo-tolerant and can be considered as promising feedstock for biodiesel production."

pub.1049715602,Technological options for the management of biosolids,"Background, aim, and scopeLarge quantities of biosolids (sewage sludge), which are produced from municipal wastewater treatment, are ever-increasing because of the commissioning of new treatment plants and continuous upgrades of the existing facilities. A large proportion of biosolids are currently landfilled. With increasing pressure from regulators and the general public, landfilling of biosolids is being phased out in many countries because of potential secondary pollution caused by leachate and the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Biosolids contain nutrients and energy that can be used beneficially. Significant efforts have been made recently to develop new technologies to manage biosolids and make useful products from them. In this paper, we provide a review of the technologies in biosolids management.Materials and methodsA survey of literature was conducted.ResultsAt present, the most common beneficial use of biosolids is agricultural land application because of inherent fertilizer values found in biosolids. Expansion of land application, however, may be limited in the future because of more stringent regulatory requirements and public concern about food chain contamination in some countries. Perceived as a green energy source, the combustion of biosolids has received renewed interest. Anaerobic digestion is generally a more effective method than incineration for energy recovery, and digested biosolids are suitable for further beneficial use through land application. Although conventional incineration systems for biosolid management generally consume more energy than they produce because of the high moisture content in the biosolids, it is expected that more combustion systems, either monocombustion or cocombustion, will be built to cope with the increasing quantity of biosolids.DiscussionUnder the increasingly popular low-carbon economy policy, biosolids may be recognized as a renewable fuel and be eligible for ‘carbon credits’. Because ash can be used to manufacture construction materials, combustion can provide a complete management for biosolids. A number of advanced thermal conversion technologies (e.g., supercritical water oxidation process and pyrolysis) are under development for biosolids management with a goal to generate useful products, such as higher quality fuels and recovery of phosphorus. With an ever-increasing demand for renewable energy, growing bioenergy crops and forests using biosolids as a fertilizer and soil amendment can not only contribute to the low-carbon economy but also maximize the nutrient and carbon value of the biosolids.ConclusionsLand application of biosolids achieves a complete reuse of its nutrients and organic carbon at a relatively low cost. Therefore, land application should become a preferred management option where there is available land, the quality of biosolids meet regulatory requirements, and it is socially acceptable.

pub.1121017330,The emissions from co-firing of biomass and torrefied biomass with coal in a chain-grate steam boiler,"In this study, biomass of rice straw (RS) and wood (WD) and their torrefied biomass (RS<sub>T</sub> and WD<sub>T</sub>) were used as solid biofuel (SBF) for co-firing individually with coal in a commercial continuous chain-grate steam boiler system, which was conducted at fixed input rate of heating value of mixture of SBF and coal and at fixed airflow rate. The effects of key system parameters on the gaseous and particulate pollutions and ash were examined. These include SBF type and blending ratio (R<sub>BL</sub>) of biomass (i.e., SBF) in the mixture of coal and biomass based on heating values for co-firing.The results indicated that wood, which possesses high heating value while less amount of ash, is more suitable for co-firing with coal than rice straw. Torrefaction can increase the heating value of biomass and homogenize its property, being beneficial to co-firing. Also, torrefaction can decompose the hydroxyl group of biomass, which makes biomass tending to possess hydrophobicity. This, in turn, helps the storage and transportation of biomass. Generally, adding the RS (with R<sub>BL</sub> = 5-10%), WD (2-15%), RS<sub>T</sub> (2-10%) and WD<sub>T</sub> (2-20%), respectively, with coal decreases the emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, but increases that of CO (except RS<sub>T</sub>). The emission of HCl is little. The addition of biomass also increases the emission of fine particulate matters (PM) especially PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the flue gases, raising PM<sub>2.5</sub>/PM<sub>100</sub> from 34.87 to 78.35 wt.% (Case 50%WD<sub>T</sub>). These emissions for the Cases tested satisfy with Taiwanese emission standards of stationary sources which set limitations of NOx, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO and HCl &lt; 350, 300, 2000 and 80 ppmv, while PM &lt; 50 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The results support the use of RS, WD, RS<sub>T</sub> and WD<sub>T</sub> for co-firing with coal.<i>Implications</i>: This study examined the suitability of using solid bio-fuels to co-fire with coal in an industrial chain-grate steam boiler system with a capacity of 100 kW, in order to achieve carbon-free emissions. Both biomass and torrefied biomass of solid bio-fuel were tested. The findings would be useful for proper design and rational operation of solid bio-fuel/coal co-firing combustion matching the appeal of sustainable material management and circular economy of biomass, and of adaptation of global warming induced by greenhouse gases. It also provides information for policy-makers to promote the co-firing application of biomass and related bio-waste materials."
pub.1021475071,The cellulose resource matrix,"The emerging biobased economy is causing shifts from mineral fossil oil based resources towards renewable resources. Because of market mechanisms, current and new industries utilising renewable commodities, will attempt to secure their supply of resources. Cellulose is among these commodities, where large scale competition can be expected and already is observed for the traditional industries such as the paper industry. Cellulose and lignocellulosic raw materials (like wood and non-wood fibre crops) are being utilised in many industrial sectors. Due to the initiated transition towards biobased economy, these raw materials are intensively investigated also for new applications such as 2nd generation biofuels and 'green' chemicals and materials production (Clark, 2007; Lange, 2007; Petrus & Noordermeer, 2006; Ragauskas et al., 2006; Regalbuto, 2009). As lignocellulosic raw materials are available in variable quantities and qualities, unnecessary competition can be avoided via the choice of suitable raw materials for a target application. For example, utilisation of cellulose as carbohydrate source for ethanol production (Kabir Kazi et al., 2010) avoids the discussed competition with easier digestible carbohydrates (sugars, starch) deprived from the food supply chain. Also for cellulose use as a biopolymer several different competing markets can be distinguished. It is clear that these applications and markets will be influenced by large volume shifts. The world will have to reckon with the increase of competition and feedstock shortage (land use/biodiversity) (van Dam, de Klerk-Engels, Struik, & Rabbinge, 2005). It is of interest - in the context of sustainable development of the bioeconomy - to categorize the already available and emerging lignocellulosic resources in a matrix structure. When composing such ""cellulose resource matrix"" attention should be given to the quality aspects as well as to the available quantities and practical possibilities of processing the feedstock and the performance in the end-application. The cellulose resource matrix should become a practical tool for stakeholders to make choices regarding raw materials, process or market. Although there is a vast amount of scientific and economic information available on cellulose and lignocellulosic resources, the accessibility for the interested layman or entrepreneur is very difficult and the relevance of the numerous details in the larger context is limited. Translation of science to practical accessible information with modern data management and data integration tools is a challenge. Therefore, a detailed matrix structure was composed in which the different elements or entries of the matrix were identified and a tentative rough set up was made. The inventory includes current commodities and new cellulose containing and raw materials as well as exotic sources and specialties. Important chemical and physical properties of the different raw materials were identified for the use "

pub.1154119272,Biofuel and Bio-economy Nexus,"Bio-economy is a primitive economic sector, and an increasing bioenergy production by biotechnology transforms to the newest one. Renewable biofuel is the keystone to the current and future bio-economy. Mainly, bio-economy is termed as a set of economic activities connecting the invention, development, utilization and production of biological products and processes sustainably without lessening their availability for future generations. In most developing countries, the nexus between biofuel and bio-economy is crucial in gross domestic product (GDP) and employment. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) mentioned that an advanced bio-economy would drive potential shifts in the global economy over the next 30 years. Still, renewable biofuel production has a positive and negative nexus with the development of the world’s bio-economy. The positive aspects of biofuel include proper utilization of biological resources, greenhouse gas mitigation, food security, job opportunities, poverty alleviation and human health improvement. Contrariwise, the negative aspects of biofuel involve biodiversity loss, indirect land-use change, forest alteration, water scarcity and pollution. Recently, negative impacts of biofuel expansion are specially marked as large constraints for globally sustainable bio-economic development. Governments of many countries have established participatory governance, policies and different financial initiatives toward achieving bio-economic sustainability by reducing constraints. In between 2000 and 2010, global biofuel yields increased sixfold, and a growing number of countries are taking bioenergy promotion policies.

Biofuels from biomass have brought worldwide attention to their potential to resolve various environmental problems, including climate change concerns and simultaneously help rural economy and livelihood aligning with the goals of the SDS. Most biomass-derived biofuel is oxygenated fuel, meaning it contains oxygen that provides more efficient combustion while reducing air pollutant gases. It has been highlighted that the global progress towards biofuel production and SDGs goals could significantly help to achieve a low carbon transition in the global energy supply. However, biofuels from biomass still have many challenges in large-scale production. The present review highlights the role of various types of biofuel production technologies advances, major challenges, and benefits in adapting biofuel to mitigate environmental pollution, worldwide carbon dioxide emissions reduction initiatives, and different biofuel policies adopted by different countries to achieve Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) goals."

pub.1154119277,Circular Economy Involving Microbial Consortia in Consolidated Bioprocesses to Produce Biofuels,"The application of circular economy has positioned as one of the pillars of the sustainable global agenda through the insertion of waste biotransformation into a variety of high-value compounds such as biofuels, which significantly reduce the concerns associated with environmental pollution such as the generation of greenhouse gases and final disposal expenses. In this context, the production of biofuels using lignocellulosic biomass is attractive since they are generated in large volumes, as well as the minimization, generation, treatment and disposal of wastes. This review addresses the sustainable production of biofuels through the use of microbial consortia in consolidated bioprocesses (CBP), presenting advantages and drawbacks of the use of synthetic microbial consortia (e.g., those designed by different mechanisms such as genetic modification) against native consortia (NC) isolated from different ecosystems to reduce costs and residence times. In addition, challenges and current perspectives to apply NC towards the generation of biofuels are comprehensively revisited since these consortia present excellent stability and resistance to change in environmental conditions or system disturbances. This offers an outstanding capacity to biodegrade numerous biomass resources (i.e., substrate), since they split complex metabolic tasks to achieve a remarkable performance, replacing the metabolic design representing a cutting-edge option for CBPs implemented in a sustainable biorefinery to generate biofuels in order to potentiate the use of biomass in the circular economy.Graphical AbstractA circular economy which involves consolidated bioprocesses to produce biofuels.

pub.1148300777,System dynamics applied to second generation biofuel in Brazil: A circular economy approach,"Scarcity of resources and risks to the energy supply have motivated a search for sustainable ways to produce alternative fuels using the concept of the circular economy, with the hope of meeting the sustainable development goals (SGD). Waste cooking oil (WCO) is a secondary resource in the production of second-generation (2G) biofuel and is an alternative sustainable fuel that can provide both economic and environmental benefits. This research investigated the use of WCO in biofuel production using the approach of system dynamics (SD) to analyze three scenarios over the period of time from 2020 to 2030. These three scenarios were baseline, non-sustainable and sustainable. The analysis simulated the three scenarios, and created a visualization of the circular supply chain of WCO in Brazil, and created a model that gave an overview of the situation. The analysis revealed that biofuels made from WCO are sensitive to the rates of disposal, recycling, water pollution, CO2 emissions and biofuel production in the three scenarios. The finding suggests that the baseline and non-sustainable scenarios are similar, and that the sustainable scenario could result in significant benefits by increasing the production of biodiesel production from WCO, and reducing the environmental impact."

pub.1123604464,Designing sustainability in blues: the limits of technospatial growth imaginaries,"In the midst of a global food crisis, the late 2000s saw tensions between rising food prices and demands for biofuels coalesce into a “food versus fuel” debate. In response to ensuing public outcries, governmental agencies, and researchers across the globe began mobilizing around alternative biofuel feedstock. Among these materials, algae emerged as the most “hopeful” sustainable alternative in producing biofuels. This article examines algal biofuel production systems designed offshore and integrated with wastewater treatment and carbon dioxide absorption processes to revitalize faith in biofuels in the blue economy. It discusses what makes algal biofuels sustainable by examining the ways practitioners talk about and design these integrated systems. Against the common refrain that algae’s photosynthetic and reproductive capacity makes these systems sustainable, this article underlines that there is nothing natural, innate, about algae to add to sustainable blue economies. Rather, algae become naturalized as biofuel source and bioremediation technologies through technoscientific discourses and interventions, which embed and reproduce anthropocentric approach to sustainability that centers on the ideology of growth. By drawing particular attention to the ways that integrated algal biofuel production systems depend on the constant generation of industrial waste, this article problematizes anthropocentric sustainability imaginaries and claims for imagining sustainability otherwise through the lens of blue degrowth to create a radical socio-ecological change."

For the future re-arrangement of a sustainable economy to biological raw materials, completely new approaches in research and development, production, and economy are necessary. The ‘first-generation’ biofuels appear unsustainable because of the potential stress that their production places on food commodities. For organic chemicals and materials these needs to follow a biorefinery model under environmentally sustainable conditions. Where these operate at present, their product range is largely limited to simple materials (i.e. cellulose, ethanol, and biofuels). Second generation biorefineries need to build on the need for sustainable chemical products through modern and proven green chemical technologies such as bioprocessing including pyrolysis, Fisher Tropsch, and other catalytic processes in order to make more complex molecules and materials on which a future sustainable society will be based. This review focus on cost effective technologies and the processes to convert biomass into useful liquid biofuels and bioproducts, with particular focus on some biorefinery concepts based on different feedstocks aiming at the integral utilization of these feedstocks for the production of value added chemicals."
pub.1169144191,Government Initiative and Policy for Agricultural Waste Utilization as Biofuel,"The use of agricultural waste as a feedstock for biofuel production is an environmentally friendly process that can contribute to a circular bioeconomy. However, the lack of financial support is a significant barrier to initiating an agriculture biomass-based fuel. Despite this, several countries are implementing policies to encourage the use of biomass-based fuel usage, such as the legal acts of the European Commission and the biodiesel policy by the Malaysian government. Utilizing agricultural waste for biofuel production can enhance future energy security without compromising food availability. However, there are various challenges to biofuel production using agricultural biomass, including environmental aspects, economic factors, social consequences, sustainable management, and soil fertility. Agricultural biomass utilization may upset soil fertility, carbon footprint, and sustainable food production. Therefore, there is a need for research on the development of a better biofuel economy that is supported by sustainable management practices. The valorization of agricultural waste for biofuel applications is crucial due to the rise in global population, enhanced farming and other food production and utilization ventures, and the emission of toxic gases. The need for cost-effective, readily available, and environmentally benign agricultural waste to biofuels has never been more critical. Global biofuel production can slow down environmental degradation and preserve the environment for future generations. Research on the application of agricultural wastes to meet the global renewable fuel demand can offer requisite knowledge to farmers, biofuel refiners, researchers, environmental enthusiasts, lawmakers, policy formulators, investors, government at various levels, and other stakeholders. Conclusively, utilizing agricultural waste as a feedstock for biofuel production can contribute to a circular bioeconomy and enhance future energy security. However, there are several challenges to biofuel production using agricultural biomass, including environmental aspects, economic factors, social consequences, sustainable management, and soil fertility.

The paper is a work in progress and is part of my PhD thesis. From the literature review, four approaches are identified which have led to the development of biofuels. A conceptual framework is proposed to identify elements of sustainability and innovation in biofuel production by smallholder farmers. The conceptual framework is proposed to enable a smooth transition towards a green economy; for promoters of biofuels to meet the challenges of an uncertain, complex and changing environment; and to discover the extent to which this affects community livelihoods and sustainability. The sustainable livelihoods approach provides the foundation on which the conceptual framework is developed. It is evident from the research that as the world embraces new technologies towards a low carbon economy, these technologies have special effects on the livelihoods of the smallholder farmers."
pub.1154119280,Biofuels in Low Carbon Economies and Societies,"The current sustainable transition plans seek to pursuit energy supply security with low carbon emissions. Although electrification is presented as a key factor to decarbonize demanding sectors (transport, buildings, and industry), energy provided by fuel combustion will be essential to cope with future demands. In this sense, it is necessary to rely on circular economy models based on low carbon biofuels. During the last decade, the biofuels industry transitioned from being sustainable and socially accepted to a deeply questioned solution due to the food versus energy debate. Therefore, using alternative feedstocks, such as wastes or residual biomass, is convenient to obtain biofuels creating new value chains during the transformation. This chapter is focused on the technologies developed for biofuel production capable of minimizing the carbon footprint. Production methods for gaseous biofuels and liquid biofuels are described. The possible integration of each technology is evaluated considering the availability of feedstocks and the emission savings obtained by main biofuels (bioethanol, biobutanol, and biomethane). This analysis reveals the need for diversification in feedstocks utilization and transformation and the intensification of waste management technologies. In this sense, a case study is presented considering the most extensive wastes produced worldwide (agricultural by-products) and the potential production of regular biofuels (bioethanol, biomethane, and biobutanol). Net energy production as biofuel and emission savings are analyzed for each case. This analysis reveals that bioethanol presents the best performance in terms of carbon neutrality. Finally, a revision of the most recent regulations affecting biomass transformation in biofuels and their role in the circular economy in Europe is included in the last section.

The main indicators of sustainable development of enterprises and the level of biofuel production are highlighted. The economic efficiency of production of different types of biofuel according to a sample of enterprises of the agrarian sector of the economy of Ukraine is estimated. The degree of the impact of biofuel production by Ukrainian agrarian enterprises on the indicators of their sustainable development has been established. For this purpose, both methods of deterministic analysis and statistical methods were used. The results of the application of these methods for a sample of Ukrainian agrarian enterprises showed that the impact of biofuel production on their sustainable development is quite significant. In particular, the dynamics of this production is positively correlated with the dynamics of operating income and profits of enterprises and with the change of most indicators that characterize the energy and environmental aspects of sustainable development of the surveyed companies. Among other things, there are statistically significant linear relationships between the growth rate of biofuel production and the growth rate of operating income and product profitability.

When the government was proposing mandatory targets in 2007–08, public controversy over ‘unsustainable biofuels’ was channelled into prospects for future biofuels to avoid environmental harm and land-use conflicts. This vision serves as an imaginary—a feasible, desirable future. Societal benefits have been envisaged according to specific models of economic competitiveness, valuable knowledge, and environmental sustainability— together comprising a prevalent imaginary of future ‘sustainable biofuels’. This has informed institutional change along two lines. First, targets are envisaged as a temporary transition until future ‘advanced biofuels’ make liquid fuel more sustainable. Second, UK research institutes realign their priorities towards seeking investment from foreign counterparts and global energy companies, in the name of making UK science and industry more competitive. Together these measures have been justified as necessary for a transition to advanced biofuels which would better contribute to a low-carbon economy. Although this imaginary may eventually be transformed into reality, initially realised has been institutional change that reinforces infrastructural dependence on liquid fuel for the internal combustion engine. As an imaginary, then, ‘sustainable biofuels’ can help explain how a policy agenda promotes one future, while marginalising alternatives."
pub.1029593779,Rural Economy and Bioethanol Production,"Biofuels are considered part of the potential sources of mitigation for the serious threat of global warming, by reducing human reliance on oil imported from unsafe sources at ever increasing costs. For the classic fuel supplier countries, biofuels are a source for the future, as local materials are used in their production. They generate jobs for the local population and do not require the importation of costly equipment and relevant expertise. A pioneer in the use of biofuels, Brazil has eliminated all oil imports and become energy independent. Recognising the positive effects of biofuel use, the EU and other countries are rapidly developing potential sources of their own biofuels. One of these sources could be agricultural cultures that are able to be developed under optimum conditions by endorsing and using modern and sustainable means and techniques in the rural economy. The sustainable use of the resources and the maintenance of the ecosystems in a good working order claims both the protection of the environment itself and the success of the farmers via the provision of fertility and productivity of the agricultural ecosystems, which will give them the leverage of competitiveness on the market and food safety in the long term. The paper herein intends to point out at a sustainable manner of having the economy’s engine function—i.e., agriculture—by means of advocating for the efficient use of the resources within the farms and their associations, along with the support for the transition to a low-carbon economy, thanks to the progress in the bioethanol production."

Existing certification schemes for sustainable biofuel production are, however, biased towards industrial-scale producers that have the financial capital and economies of scale to meet sustainability and certification objectives. Smallholder farmers in developing countries, by contrast, often lack the means and capacity to do so. Some of the challenges faced by smallholders include high certification costs, insufficient institutional capacity, inadequate financial and social incentives, poor group organization and lack of external support. Drawing lessons from existing certification programs, we argue that proponents of sustainable practices and standards must fully appreciate the complex realities of smallholder production systems. We provide policy recommendations for ensuring that no farmer is left behind in the quest to increase sustainable biofuel production."

pub.1167316654,Can biofuels help achieve sustainable development goals in India? A systematic review,"Biofuels are expected to play a pivotal role in developing economies' transition towards net-zero emissions. However, their promotion can cause multifaceted sustainability concerns. National biofuel policies often align with the optimistic discourse surrounding biofuels but may lack comprehensive measures to simultaneously address all sustainability risks. This study conducts a systematic review to evaluate the sustainability performance of biofuels and examines their implications for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A total of 12 sustainability indicators were identified as economic, social, and environmental priorities. Biofuel linkages with 8 SDGs, 21 targets, and 22 indicators were mapped. The analysis revealed a wider coverage of sustainability impacts associated with biodiesel compared to ethanol feedstocks for India. Notably, the sustainability effects of biofuels exhibited considerable variability across different spatial scales. Irrespective of the biofuel types, negative sustainability outcomes were found to be associated with socio-economic indicators related to food security, livelihood, and income, and environmental indicators like land use. Positive sustainability effects were observed for environmental indicators like water and soil quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. The study identifies policy gaps in addressing localized adverse effects of biofuels, emphasizing the need to align biofuel strategies with SDGs for more comprehensive and sustainable biofuel development in developing countries."

The EU-sponsored sustainability criteria, though, clashed with the criteria adopted by major palm oil producers, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. These conflicting standards have contributed to the current stalemate of trade negotiations with those partners. This chapter provides a political economy explanation of such a cleavage. It argues that competing interests of biofuel producers in the two negotiating sides, the centrality of palm oil export for Indonesia and Malaysia economies, and the low dependency of those partners on the EU as a trade partner have reduced the bargaining power of the latter in the negotiations. The open dispute against the WTO-compatibility of European sustainability criteria has further challenged the self-attributed image of the EU as a global leader in the promotion of sustainable development."

The paper draws on findings from action research conducted in Mozambique between December 2008 and July 2012. We analyse interactions between the changing governance context, the course of the multi-actor governance process, and the choices in relation to governance framework characteristics and content for four successive stages of governance framework development. This provides the basis for reflection on the competences required for effective multi-actor sustainability governance, and a discussion about the role of the nation-state in sustainability governance of global economies such as biofuels. The governance framework for sustainable biofuels has contributed to a more transparent and secure investment climate for biofuels in Mozambique. Key factors for success were (1) the presence of different types of competences during the various stages of the governance framework development, (2) closing the gap between ‘licences to sell’ and ‘licences to produce’ across different governance levels, and (3) balancing between the short- and long-term objectives for biofuel production in Mozambique and requirements of global biofuel markets. Developing-country nation-states can provide an essential contribution to these success-factors for global governance of sustainable biofuels."

Systems biology along with new engineering technologies can provide ways to generate chemicals of great significance such as advanced biofuels. Producing these important biofuels in high yields requires the correct engineering of, for example, a yeast cell’s metabolism. Removing bottlenecks in yeast metabolic pathways and relieving the stresses due to production of the advanced biofuels are fundamental in the generation of efficient industrial-scale production hosts. Systems-level research can reveal an understanding of the metabolic pathway. However, a number of challenges remain before advanced biofuels can be used commercially and economically.

Therefore, it remains a major obstacle for today's society to seek cost-effective strategies in addressing the ongoing issues associated with agro-wastes. The benefits and advantages of agro-waste processing and refining methods are believed to be cost-effective and eco-friendly, as well as could contribute positively toward more sustainable waste management and less-carbon intensive energy utilization path. Indeed, this chapter presents agro-waste-to-biofuel strategies that play a critical role in managing a circular economy, in which the system would effectively eliminate waste by adopting the continued use of resources. Promoting the benefits of the agro-waste-to-biofuel approach and the advantages of embracing the basic tenets of a circular economy can provide incentives for farmers, agro-business owners, and other stakeholders to embrace more sustainable practices in not only modernizing the sector but also contributing toward the overall sustainable development of the economy and society at large."

pub.1045813124,The Changing North–South and South–South Political Economy of Biofuels,"Since the 2007 food crisis, controversy has engulfed biofuels. Leading up to the crisis, world-wide interest in these fuels—which include biomass, biogas, bioethanol, and biodiesel—had been surging as states increasingly saw these as a way to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets and promote sustainable economic development. Now some consumers, notably in Europe, are scaling back demand as they worry that biofuels are responsible for increased food prices and deforestation. In contrast, some states—particularly Brazil and the USA, the world's leading bioethanol producers—continue to promote biofuel development, especially in developing countries. Partnerships arising from these efforts, we argue, reflect new patterns in the international political economy, where trade relationships among developing countries are strengthening, and where economic lines between developed and emerging developing countries are blurring. Given previously observed patterns of resource exploitation involving complex webs of North–South and South–South trade (such as for resources like palm oil in Indonesia), we anticipate that the emerging political economy of biofuels will repeat and reinforce many of these same environmentally destructive trends."

The concepts of green finance and green investment have expanded in recent years, bringing perspectives to support sustainable projects. In this study, we examine the scientific research in green finance to identify advances, main topics, and policy recommendations. We then explore how green financing can play an important role in supporting the development and implementation of biofuel projects in Brazil. The biofuel policy (RenovaBio) established a carbon market the so-called “Decarbonization Credits” (CBIOs), which is a financial instrument designed to incentivize the production and use of sustainable biofuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The findings suggest that green finance needs to advance with a clear definition of their requirements and standards not to fund non-green projects and projects that overlook social and environmental sustainability for economic benefits, and to enable investors to better assess risks and opportunities of their investments. Regarding green finance for biofuel, while some studies suggest that biofuels could play a role in the transition to a green economy, others warn of the environmental costs associated with large-scale production, which can lead to negative impacts on biodiversity, and land-water use. It is expected that the green finance issue in Brazil will find fertile ground in the biofuel sector. However, this will depend on sustainable agriculture practices, as well as on designing the RenovaBio program in such a way that is transparent, accountable, and socially and environmentally responsible."

All bio fuels needs some trade off to be called “green” or “environment friendly”. Research has been done to study the different claims about the role of biofuels in development of economies to reduction of poverty. But counterclaims are made by other researchers and calling biofuels a ‘Pandora’s box’ and questioning, large scale production of biofuels feasibility to countering fossil fuels. This paper examines the scope of biofuels from many aspects like: rural job creation, food and energy security, saving foreign exchange and economic diversification. But sill there are concerns how their usage can be effective in reducing green house gases and improving agricultural productivity. We study how biofuels can be stated as sustainable energy source, technically feasible, economically affordable, and globally viable from social and environmental contexts. Policies are to be made that reflect the multi-dimensional benefits of biofuels and it’s by products. It will help this infant industry to become competitive against petroleum-derived fuels and products. Basically biofuels has to create value for society in supply chain, from producers, suppliers, farmers, countries, regional bodies to end consumers. In short biofuel has to innovatively create value from every element of the material and energy supplied by nature. Basically it has to reinvent itself from petrochemicals industry.

The biggest challenge facing the future of the emerging liquid biofuels industry is selection of appropriate crops that will provide reliable and sustainable feedstocks for the increasing energy demands of a growing world population. With few exceptions, current first generation biofuel feedstocks are food crops that have been bred for attributes that are desirable for food production and quality, not biofuel content. In selecting the most appropriate bioenergy candidate species, a number of important issues should be addressed. Upper most in the thoughts of both scientific and lay communities is the so-called ‘food versus fuel’ debate. Further, it is argued that lands currently, or projected to be cultivated with biofuel crops should not be destined for food production. Similarly, lands currently not under agricultural production are being cleared for the cultivation of energy crops.

pub.1128480959,Sustainability of the four generations of biofuels – A review,"Biofuel has emerged as an alternative source of energy to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and combat global warming. Biofuels are classified into first, second, third and fourth generations. Each of the biofuel generations aims to meet the global energy demand while minimizing environmental impacts. Sustainability is defined as meeting the needs of the current generations without jeopardizing the needs of future generations. The aim of sustainability is to ensure continuous growth of the economy while protecting the environment and societal needs. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the sustainability of these four generations of biofuels. The objectives are to compare the production of biofuel, the net greenhouse gases emissions, and energy efficiency. This study is important in providing information for the policymakers and researchers in the decision‐making for the future development of green energy. Each of the biofuel generations shows different benefits and drawbacks. From this study, we conclude that the first generation biofuel has the highest biofuel production and energy efficiency, but is less effective in meeting the goal of reducing the greenhouse gases emission. The third generation biofuel shows the lowest net greenhouse gases emissions, allowing the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, the energy required for the processing of the third generation biofuel is higher and, this makes it less environmentally friendly as fossil fuels are used to generate electricity. The third and fourth generation feedstocks are the potential sustainable source for the future production of biofuel. However, more studies need to be done to find an alternative low cost for biofuel production while increasing energy efficiency. • First generation biofuel has the highest biofuel yield and energy efficiency. However, the production of the biofuel opposed many sustainable development goals. • Third and fourth generation biofuels show potential as a sustainable future green energy. • Methods of lipid extraction of microalgae biofuel and environmental consequences of the fourth generation biofuel should be further explored."

Although studies have emerged with a view to unravel the path to global environmental sustainability, the paths of biofuels remain scantly investigated. Hence, this study presented the maiden empirical support for the aggregated and disaggregated impacts of biofuels on environmental sustainability in five top biofuel-abundant economies (Brazil, China, Germany, Indonesia, and the United States) from 1995 to 2019. The papers add to the existing knowledge by considering the roles of green technological innovation (proxied by environmental-related technologies), affluence, green finance, population and coal in a novel STIRPAT framework. The stated model is empirically verified based on recent techniques encompassing CS-ARDL, CCEMG, AMG, and MMQR. The empirical results uncover that both effects of biofuels substantially moderate carbon emissions, thus paving the way for environmental sustainability. Besides, environmental-related technologies and green finance significantly mitigate carbon emissions, whereas affluence, population, and coal positively drive carbon emissions. The empirical regularity of the main estimators is confirmed based on the feedback from MMQR which uphold the validity of biofuels in mitigating carbon emissions at different quantiles. The outcomes of the causality analysis uncover unidirectional, bidirectional and non-causal nexuses. Policy insights that promote sustainable exploration of biofuels for achieving a carbon-neutral environment are exposited following the findings."

Consumption of oil derivatives in combustion engines and boilers has increased carbon dioxide, resulting in the global warming effect. Besides this, oil production is reaching the near-term peak, and the subsequent decline in production has been already detected. The world production of liquid biofuels, mainly ethanol and biodiesel, has increased by over 160 billion litres (equivalent to 4 Exajoules). In addition, the production capacity of other fuels such as biomethane, biobutanol, bioethanol and biomethane is continuously increasing. In the transport sector, biofuel is a real alternative to fossil fuels with a contribution of just over 3% today. Indonesia, the USA and Brazil are the largest producers with more than 40% of the global production. Germany and France in Europe are increasing their production with a strategy based on biomethane. A case study is presented considering the economic revenues of the transformation of the most widespread agricultural wastes into the most promising common biofuels."
pub.1006877481,10.4.1 Transitioning to Biofuels: A System‐of‐Systems Perspective,"Abstract Today, almost 60% of the petroleum consumed in the United States is imported. The U.S. transportation sector currently consumes for over two‐thirds of the 11 million barrels of oil used in the U.S. each day. Global demand for transportation fuels is increasing dramatically as developing countries expand their economies and become more energy intensive. Clean energy systems are needed to support sustainable global economic growth while mitigating impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels offer a near‐term solution for reducing U.S. oil consumption. Transitioning to a significantly larger biofuels industry will require the creation of a robust biomass‐to‐biofuels system of systems that operates in concert with the existing agriculture, forestry, energy and transportation markets. Using the fuel supply chain infrastructure as a framework, the current petroleum‐based transportation economy, a vision for biomass‐based fuels and the challenges associated with such a massive market and infrastructure transformation are discussed."

The integrative framework is applied to a case study of replacing 30% of gasoline used in transportation in Tennessee. Using high-resolution spatial data in a multiobjective mixed-integer programming model, we find that land use choice makes substantial impacts on the deployment of the supply chains under different objectives. When considering private cost alone, hay and pasture land concentrated in the east and central Tennessee will be the major source for switchgrass production. If targeting GHG emission minimization solely, more than 500 thousand hectares of the state’s cropland is converted to switchgrass for biofuel production. Moreover, the trade-off between cost and GHG emissions in the supply chains shows that the marginal rate of substitution between total cost and GHG emissions on the frontier curve increases at an accelerating rate. Our findings illustrate the importance of land resource management on the sustainability of a dedicated energy crop supply chain."

pub.1020739878,"Biofuels, Food Security, and Developing Economies","The last decade has witnessed major crises in both food and energy security across the world. One response to the challenges of climate change and energy supply has been the development of crops to be used for biofuels. But, as this book shows, this can divert agricultural land from food production to energy crops, thus affecting food security, particularly in less developed countries. The author analyses the extent to which biofuels feedstocks fit within the national food security strategy, agro-export orientation, and rural development plans and policies of developing economies. Two case studies, from Tanzania in East Africa and Borneo in Malaysia, are considered in detail, using the non-edible crop of jatropha as an example of how compromises can be reached to balance food and energy goals as well as export markets. The author develops a novel integrated approach, the Institutional Feasibility Study, as the basis of her analysis. She addresses key issues such as: how do global initiatives for green growth, energy security and sustainable development incorporate biofuels industry development? Does global biofuels trade present meaningful foreign and local investment opportunities for developing countries? To what extent does biofuels feedstock production help with poverty reduction and agricultural sector modernization? What role do the EU and the US commitments to biofuels blending targets play in the rapid industry development in developing countries? How does the biofuels industry fit within existing formal and informal institutional frameworks? Who are the winners and losers in the biofuels global value chain?"

pub.1046493099,Biodiversity conservation in the era of biofuels: risks and opportunities,"Growing demand for alternative energy sources has contributed to increased biofuel production, but the effects on biodiversity of land‐use change to biofuel crops remain unclear. Using a meta‐analysis for crops being used or considered in the US, we find that vertebrate diversity and abundance are generally lower in biofuel crop habitats relative to the non‐crop habitats that these crops may replace. Diversity effects are greater for corn than for pine and poplar, and birds of conservation concern experience greater negative effects from corn than species of less concern. Yet conversion of row‐crop fields to grasslands dedicated to biofuels could increase local diversity and abundance of birds. To minimize impacts of biofuel crops on biodiversity, we recommend management practices that reduce chemical inputs, increase heterogeneity within fields, and delay harvests until bird breeding has ceased. We encourage research that will move us toward a sustainable biofuels economy, including the use of native plants, development of robust environmental criteria for evaluating biofuel crops, and integrated cost–benefit analysis of potential land‐use change."

pub.1172919890,BIOFUELS: A REVIEW ON EMERGING TRENDS AND APPLICATIONS,"A biofuel is defined as any fuel derived from organic materials like plants, agricultural crops, their waste products, and by-products. Due to depleting oil sources, energy security issues, and growing environmental concerns from rising greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, biofuels have gained a lot of attention recently. Modern technology is causing a significant rise in energy demand, which is resulting in an excessive use of fossil fuels. As a result, renewable energy is being examined as a potential replacement and is becoming more and more significant due to its effects on the environment, society, and economy. The biofuels are categorized into solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels based on the biomass used in their production. Biofuels are derived from biomass, which absorbs a substantial amount of CO2 from the atmosphere, their production and utilization are often considered carbon-neutral. Biochemical conversion and thermochemical conversion are the two main methods used to convert biomass into energy. Through the use of these processes, the biomass is transformed into three main categories of products: biofuels, heat, and power for the production of electricity. Globally, there is an increase in the generation of biofuels employing various developing technologies and biological processes from various bioresources. Waste disposal difficulties could be resolved and environmental burdens reduced if biomass waste and agricultural crop leftovers are used to make biofuels Economic sustainability is just unsustainable in the current environment.

Five Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam) are examined by considering their economy, energy status, and automotive market scale. In this study, existing energy policies, fuel supply, demand status, petroleum and alternative fuel products, such as natural gas and biofuels, and oil refining/biofuels production capacity are investigated as components of energy mixing. If there are gaps between oil reduction targets and Business as Usual (BAU) consumption, or the required amount of biofuel use to achieve introduction target and possible supply, measures such as improved new vehicle fuel economy, adjustment of biofuel utilization, and natural gas utilization are considered to minimize gaps or to meet policy targets. An appropriate and cost-effective combination of measures is proposed as an alternative case for each country’s needs. Results show that biofuel utilization is one of the measures that is crucial in meeting policy targets. Even in the alternative case, however, estimated demand volume of biofuel exceeds domestic supply volume in some countries, while estimated demand volume of biofuel is lower than domestic supply volume in other countries. In order to solve these gaps and cultivate bio-fuel security within the ASEAN region, a concept of multi-national cooperation of biofuel is proposed.

Most of current discourse on 2G bioethanol is about developing efficient technologies and supportive policies for biomass utilization and energy distribution, while availability and supply of that biomass are often taken for granted. This paper challenges these presumptions of biomass availability and technological feasibility. Following a social-constructivist analysis of technology and focusing on how political actors, scientists, industry, green-revolution and organic farmers envision biomass, this paper argues that the innovation for 2G is hybrid and complex, rather than merely logistical and economic. Biomass as feedstock is not an off-the-shelf commodity, but a dynamic and fluid entity, the availability of which is dependent on a number of cultural, social, technological and economic factors. Policies are needed that recognize the multiplicity of agricultural practices if a sustainable biofuel system is to be developed."
pub.1024795980,Conventional and advanced biofuels,"Energy security and independence, increase and fluctuation of the oil price,
   fossil fuel resources depletion and global climate change are some of the
   greatest challanges facing societies today and in incoming decades.
   Sustainable economic and industrial growth of every country and the world in
   general requires safe and renewable resources of energy. It has been expected
   that re-arrangement of economies towards biofuels would mitigate at least
   partially problems arised from fossil fuel consumption and create more
   sustainable development. Of the renewable energy sources, bioenergy draws
   major and particular development endeavors, primarily due to the extensive
   availability of biomass, already-existence of biomass production technologies
   and infrastructure, and biomass being the sole feedstock for liquid fuels.
   The evolution of biofuels is classified into four generations (from 1st to
   4th) in accordance to the feedstock origin; if the technologies of feedstock
   processing are taken into account, than there are two classes of biofuels -
   conventional and advanced. The conventional biofuels, also known as the 1st
   generation biofuels, are those produced currently in large quantities using
   well known, commercially-practiced technologies. The major feedstocks for
   these biofuels are cereals or oleaginous plants, used also in the food or
   feed production. Thus, viability of the 1st generation biofuels is
   questionable due to the conflict with food supply and high feedstocks? cost.
   This limitation favoured the search for non-edible biomass for the production
   of the advanced biofuels. In a general and comparative way, this paper
   discusses about various definitions of biomass, classification of biofuels,
   and brief overview of the biomass conversion routes to liquid biofuels
   depending on the main constituents of the biomass. Liquid biofuels covered by
   this paper are those compatible with existing infrastructure for gasoline and
   diesel and ready to be used in mixture with them as ?drop-in? fuels:
   bioethanol, celullosic ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel and BtL diesel;
   their major advantages and drawbacks are compared."
pub.1016229855,Strategies for a Sustainable Pan-African Biofuels Policy,"Biomass is common in people’s daily lives and would not require any special policy if it would not have received a new dimension in the recent past: the production of CO2 neutral energy and in particular biofuels. Triggered by the highly industrialized countries especially in Europe, this has developed fast and like any development, has both positive and negative effects. In particular, the production of biofuels from biomass has become part of the international process of combating CO2 emissions especially in highly industrialized countries, but also in view of the volatility of fossil fuel supplies and the dwindling fuel reserves. Today, biofuels remain a key part of the global energy solution and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) represents a fascinating marketplace of untapped opportunities amid unique challenges. Due to the cost, land, and climate restrictions of producing biofuels in Europe and America and the current challenges Asian production is facing, many investors are turning to Africa for growing energy crops for biofuels production. The interest in biofuels production in SSA countries is gaining momentum such that the production of energy crops will become an integral part of the energy sector development for the future. Nevertheless, such a process will require long-term thinking and far-sightedness since bioenergy will change its position within the energy mix. The future energy mix will be most probably dominated by solar energy and biomass will mainly form the basis for sustainable chemical production processes. The growing international and domestic demand for biofuels will necessitate that SSA countries develop a Pan-African biofuels policy to address possible diverging or even conflicting international and SSA interests and to adopt the same policy or similar stipulations of fundamental principles for biofuels in the SSA region. This will also help to counter the possibility that SSA countries out-compete against each other or that SSA producers benefit little from private investments in the sector. This chapter discusses critical issues surrounding biofuels development and proposes the way forwards for the development of a Pan-African biofuels policy to ensure that biofuels are produced in a sustainable manner and that the negative effects of biofuels development on environment, economy and society do not outweigh the expected beneficial outcomes of energy security and poverty alleviation in Africa."
pub.1172052146,Technology projection in biofuel production using agricultural waste materials as a source of energy sustainability: A comprehensive review,"Biofuel production using agricultural waste materials as a source of energy sustainability is an important and promising approach to address both energy and environmental challenges. This process involves converting various types of agricultural residues and by-products into biofuels, which can be used as renewable and cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels This study focuses on different pre-treatment procedures, biofuel production, and agricultural waste materials as a biomass source of biofuel production, feedstocks, and technology conversion, the combination of thermochemical and biochemical conversion methods in biorefineries can enhance productivity, reduce waste, and increase resource use, while reducing environmental impact and energy consumption. This study investigates some of the difficulties associated with agricultural waste materials are diverse and can include crop residues (such as straw, husks, and shells), animal manure, food processing waste, forestry residues, and more. Researchers and companies are actively working to improve the efficiency and viability of agricultural waste-to-biofuel processes. The study suggests that incorporating agricultural waste valorization, such as biochar as a soil amendment, can enhance the sustainability of biofuel production. This approach can mitigate climate change and promote sustainable agriculture. The circular economy strategy can minimize waste byproducts. The study also suggests that governmental interventions can support sustainable practices and prioritize renewable energy sources. The study revealed that biofuel production from microalgae and energy crops is the most profitable and effective method, with commercial-scale production potential due to genetic engineering advancements. However, large-scale production remains challenging, necessitating new technologies to boost biofuel production and meet energy needs."
pub.1147056579,Evaluating the potential of marginal lands available for sustainable cellulosic biofuel production in Italy,"The European Union aims to provide as much as one quarter of its transportation fuels via biofuels derived from renewable sources by 2030. To put this into perspective, the Italian government has recently established an ambitious goal to support the wider uptake of advanced second-generation biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels for the transportation sector. A sustainable way forward is to grow perennial biomass crops on marginal lands, however the nationwide availability of those lands for lignocellulosic feedstock production remains uncertain. We identify and evaluate the potential of marginal lands in Italy to produce sizeable amounts of biomass for sustainable cellulosic biofuel production while limiting land use conflicts and negative ecological impacts. We applied spatial multi-criteria decision analysis techniques in geographic information systems to ultimately generate spatially-explicit national land suitability and availability maps at a fine resolution (250-m). We selected a broad range of leading cellulosic biomass crops that includes poplar (Populus × canadensis Moench), willow (Salix alba Linnaeus), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia Linnaeus), giant reed (Arundo donax Linnaeus), and vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides Linnaeus). Based on marginality criteria, our results suggest that such biomass plantations of perennial grasses and short rotation trees may produce 3.1–27.4 billion liters of cellulosic ethanol per year from 462,265 to 2,811,064 million hectares of available marginal lands. This estimated production may fulfill 7.8–69.1% of Italy's current liquid transportation fuel consumption, constrained by the requirement that each modelled location be within 70 km of a potential cellulosic biorefinery. Collectively, this study provides the cornerstone of efforts to rationally meet Italy's need for renewable fuels in a sustainable low-carbon economy future."
pub.1106338527,Application of Enzymes in Sustainable Liquid Transportation Fuels Production,"These days the shortage of petrochemicals and environmental pollution are two major challenges, which need to be overcome by our society. As limited petroleum resources have become increasingly depleted, shortage of petroleum oil as well as rise in gasoline prices have become crucial factors in restricting the global economy. Therefore use of biofuels produced from bio-based materials serve as good alternate to petroleum based fuels as these offer various benefits to society and environment. Biofuels also offer a sustainable liquid fuel as bioethanol and biodiesel for transport sector. But different challenges have been associated with biofuel sector and one of them is need of efficient hydrolysis methods. Use of enzymes for effective hydrolysis of biomass can address the issue of hydrolysis of biomass as different enzymes can target the different components of biomass specifically. Therefore different enzymes used for hydrolysis of biomass, fermentation, limitations of enzymes are discussed in this review. Because of the different topics and challenges listed in this review and paucity of government policies to create the demand for biofuels, it may take more time for the enzymes to hit the market place than previously projected."
pub.1137249943,1 Sustainable biofuels: opportunities and challenges,"Global energy demand is expected to increase by 48% in the next 20 years owing to the precipitous increase in the global population. Currently, 80% of the energy demand is met by fossil fuels. However, rapidly depleting fossil fuel reserves coupled with the negative environmental impacts from its combustion has prompted significant interest in sustainable biofuels. This will aid in the transition toward a carbon-neutral bio-economy. Several feedstocks have been identified as possible substrates for biofuel production. Agricultural residues have shown significant potential since they are environmentally benign, abundant, and low cost. Nevertheless due to its structural complexity, an appropriate pretreatment is required to enhance enzymatic and microbial conversion. Currently, first-generation biofuels such as bioethanol do not require intensive pretreatments; however, the major drawback is the utilization of food crops, thus contributing to the food versus fuel debate. Additionally, greenhouse gas emissions associated with first-generation biofuels are another obstacle. Second-generation biofuels such as bioethanol, biohydrogen, and biomethane appear to be most promising owing to its bioconversion from waste material. A major bottleneck in this process is the requirement of costly pretreatments and subsequent effluent treatment. Third-generation biofuels such as bioethanol from microalgae also show potential since process optimization could significantly enhance yields. Fourth-generation biofuels aim to utilize genetically optimized feedstocks that are designed to enhance capture of carbon dioxide; however, carbon capture and sequestration technology has limited the commercialization of this process. Integrated biorefineries have the potential to produce several generations of biofuels in one process, thereby completing valorizing the feedstock and enhancing the life cycle and techno-economic assessment of the bioprocess."
pub.1160252584,Integrated Catalytic Upgrading of Biomass-Derived Alcohols for Advanced Biofuel Production,"Sustainable biofuel production is necessary to meet the daunting challenge of “fueling” growing economies with a significantly reduced carbon footprint. Although its higher oxygen content often hinders the direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) into energy-dense biofuels, microbial biofuel production from LCB still has potential. The production of primary alcohols by acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation has been practiced for more than a century to attain near-theoretical maximum. However, ABE produced conventionally by native microorganisms is not equivalent to fossil fuel-based aviation fuels in terms of energy density, volatility, and cost-efficiency. Various strategies have been adapted for the microbial synthesis of advanced fuels from renewable feedstock with the advancements in genetic engineering. Yet, the presence of inhibitors and the inefficiency of microbes to utilize or transport the sugar mixtures from LCB often impede titer and yield. However, ABE mixtures can act as platform chemicals to synthesize high-value biofuels by biocatalytic or chemo-catalytic applications. Chemical catalysts, in particular, are used to produce higher alcohols ranging from 3-carbon to 20-carbon fuels from the ABE fermentation mixture. This article reviews the recent trends in the production of higher biofuels from ABE mixtures using biological and chemical catalysts. Focus is placed on genomic and metabolic engineering strategies implemented to upgrade microbes for higher biofuel production via the fermentation of renewable feedstocks. This paper also summarizes the advancements in the chemical conversion route of an ABE fermentation mixture into higher biofuels. Finally, the review provides insights into future research toward commercializing renewable and sustainable higher biofuels and chemicals."
pub.1174473852,Overview of Radiation-Based Technologies and Implementation of Microwave Thermochemical Technologies in the Development of Biomass-Based Biorefinery,"Waste biomass valorization intends to play a crucial role in facilitating transitions toward green and sustainable development. Currently, a cascade of technologies broadly classified under thermochemical and biochemical processes are extensively studied to optimize resource efficiency and extract potentially beneficial biomolecules from multi-varied waste materials. Identification and subsequent adoption of optimal and economically viable biomass valorization methods are essential for ensuring the efficient synthesis of different classes of value-added products like biofuels, bio-oil, biochar, bioplastics, biofertilizers, biosurfactants, biomethane, biogas, etc. Currently, thermochemical processes like pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), torrefaction, and gasification are mostly used for biomass-to-biofuel technologies due to their higher efficacy and sustainability. However, instead of relying solely on conventional thermal sources to carry out biomass-to-biofuel conversion, irradiation can be employed to generate the necessary heat, resulting in a more sustainable bio-recovery. Irradiation-assisted conversion approaches offer the notable advantage of rapid and homogeneous heating while also ensuring higher product quality, thereby making them cost-effective. Additionally, single-step processes utilizing different chemical catalysts can be employed to effectively convert the products or by-products obtained from the preceding processes into chemically valuable compounds. Therefore, these valorization strategies offer direct and efficacious conversion of biomass to bio-products, adding value to the waste and thereby contributing towards a circular bio-economy. In this chapter, we will comprehensively analyze the existing irradiation-based direct conversion techniques, elucidate their underlying mechanisms, and assess their effect on diverse biomasses for enhanced production of biofuel and value-added products."

pub.1140039536,Biofuel,"Energy is necessary for growth, and sustainable energy provides the opportunity to transform lives, economies, and the planet earth. In India, high population growth demands high energy security, and biofuels are likely to be one of the most advanced clean energy sources. The major raw materials for biofuels include microalgae, jatropha and vegetable oils, starchy and cellulosic materials, and municipal wastes. Their production techniques vary according to the raw material, biomass, efficiency level, land use pattern, and so on. Biofuel has great potential to mitigate climate change, provide job opportunities, and improve income, thereby alleviating poverty. However, various socioeconomic and environmental challenges impede its large-scale adoption. The foremost socioeconomic challenge is food price hike and food scarcity due to conflict between food and energy. Production often causes an imbalance in land and water uses and the displacement of farmers and indigenous communities, and thereby the collapse of the rural economy. Environmental challenges include overexploitation of soil and water, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Therefore, intensive research is required to find the best production technique, useful source, and economically viable bioconversion system to explore the new era of fuels."

Reflections from the fields in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh,"With self-sufficiency levels of crude oil being a distant dream and given India’s growing energy demand, biofuels has emerged as an important option for policy makers. This paper reviews the experiences of biofuels’ cultivation and its impact on land use, environment, and livelihoods of rural communities in the light of emergence of jowar and bajra as alternative feedstocks. Empirical data collected during 2013 in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh is used to analyze the present economics and future implications for success of these crops as viable alternatives. Findings indicate that use of major staple food crops such as jowar and bajra for biofuel production might not be feasible given the economies of scale, even as they would have a lasting impact on the food and fodder security."

Sticklen At present, food crops such as sugarcane sugar and corn seed starch are used to commercially produce ethanol. The goal of the biofuels industry is to produce biofuels from crop waste matter, that are non-food residues whose cellulosic matter are converted into hydrocarbon liquid fuels (mostly ethanol) after transportation and storage, pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose via the use of microbial cellulases for production of fermentable sugars, followed by fermentation of sugars. Despite recent improvements in pretreatment technology and modifications of genomes of bioenergy crops via anti-sense methods to lower their lignin contents for an enhanced hydrolysis [1], and improvements made in genomes of cellulase-producing microbes and even considering the synthetic biology [2], the costs associated with cellulosic biofuel production remains to be the inhibitory factor to the non-subsidized commercialization and sustainable economy of cellulosic biofuel industry."
pub.1144676132,Chapter 3 Biomass feedstocks for advanced biofuels: Sustainability and supply chain management,"Circular economy is increasingly being seen as a sustainable route to development. The utilization of traditional waste streams for wealth generation is experiencing increased focus from policymakers. Agricultural activities globally generate billions of metric tons of waste biomass annually, which includes solid, liquid, and gaseous residues. Valorization of such agro-waste as feedstock for bioethanol production seems to be the only feasible route toward the achievement of the national blending target of 20% ethanol-blending with petrol. The cellulosic agro-wastes offers a more sustainable option compared to 1st generation biofuels which were dependant on food crops such as sugarcane, corn, and oil seeds. Particularly, in geographies with limited land and water resources, the dilemma to choose between food crop and energy crop has led to food vs fuel and sustainability issues. Major energy sources of feedstock may be switchgrass, miscanthus, high biomass, or energy sorghum, as well as crop residues, such as rice straw, wheat straw, corn stover, and corn cobs. Governmental policies that regulate agriculture, industry, and trade significantly influence the profitability of biofuels and play an important role in the development of a country's energy sector. However, there needs to be an increased awareness about these policies at the grass root level. While doing site selection for any advanced biofuel plant, one of the key criteria is sustainable availability of feedstock with an efficient and robust biomass supply chain management system. Biomass is a sustainable low carbon source that can replace fossil carbon via multiple thermo-chemical and biochemical technologies to produce almost all advanced biofuels for road/aviation transport. This chapter reviews the various feedstocks available for advanced biofuel production, supply and process chain analysis, sustainability, and industrial optimization. Though examples for bioethanol are given, but the discussed biomass can also provide fungible fuels, methanol, and Hydrogen by various technology platforms."

The Energy Indicators Tool for Sustainable Development (EISD) and the Sustainability Indicators Tool Global Association for Bioenergy (GBEP) were applied. Performing a comparison of indicators in each performance (economic, social and environmental), it was found that the production of biofuels in Brazil is positive in most of them. Biofuels showed a favorable trend in economic indicators, not only in terms of cost, but also through the use of energy available to the consumer market. Environmental indicators showed an improvement in the efficient use of land, water and energy resources, while pesticide applications are relatively low in relation to the limits. In addition, it appears that the biofuels industries have contributed positively to rural economies, since the social indicators showed a relatively significant and positive increase in labor supply and salary level of the labor market in this sector. Also appears that existing tools are complementary and the results provide a basis for future discussions and the development of sustainability assessments in systems and bioenergy-related projects."
pub.1153160703,Utilization of nanomaterials in accelerating the production process of sustainable biofuels,"Around 84 % of the global energy needs are met by fossil fuels, notwithstanding their several drawbacks. Dependence on fossil fuels can be reduced when biofuels become more widely used. Compared to fossil fuel, biofuel is substantially less combustible and derived from renewable resources. Biofuel production from non-edible feedstocks can be enhanced by utilizing nanotechnology. Biofuel research to date has produced promising results, but very few recent studies have underlined the use of nanotechnology to enhance the biofuel production process. This study comprehensively reviews the potential use of nanotechnology in improving biofuel production processes. It also highlights the factors that affect nanomaterial performance in the biofuel production process. The nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles (NPs) are shown to be highly efficient, with harvesting Chlorella vulgaris biomass at an efficiency of 98.75 % in 1 min at pH 7. In terms of cost-effectiveness, naked modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) cost significantly less, ranging from £3-500 to £0.5–108 per kg following nanoparticle reactivation. Due to their toxicity, nanomaterials used in biofuel production systems have several detrimental effects on living organisms, the environment, and the economy. Developing non-toxic nanomaterials, utilizing cheaper nanoparticles, and doing additional research might increase knowledge availability and understanding to address the current issues."

Yet to critics, biofuels are seen as prime drivers in a global ‘land grab,’ rainforest clearance, and the dispossession of farmers. Responding to these concerns, firms in Madagascar have shifted production away from large plantations to small-scale production of the more ‘environmentally-friendly’ biofuel crop Jatropha curcas. Using a political ecology lens and building upon critical discourse analysis found in cultural political economy, I analyse perspectives of on the material effects and emerging politics surrounding a case of a British-biofuel start-up firm in the northwest Madagascar. I demonstrate that access to biofuel land and labour is dependent upon the inclusion of Malagasy in rural development projects. However, rather than delivering on the promises of biofuels, jatropha has largely emerged as a failed development strategy. This article examines the unaccounted for power that varied and diverse actors derive by promoting the inclusion of individuals and groups to share in benefits, and the material consequences of private sector development in the global south."
pub.1154458870,Biofuels in the nexus energy-environment-food,"The production of biofuels from biological resources has been the subject of much controversy. Their opportunity update deserves to be revisited for technological maturity and assess their relevance in response to current environmental concerns. Innovations in biotechnological and chemical processes allow a wide range of liquid and gaseous biofuels; their characteristics concern energy content, compatibility with fossil fuels and openness towards strictly chemical uses. The factors driving this technological market's evolution are the implementation of abundant public policies, the evolution of agronomic practices, the concern for carbon sequestration in soils, the expectations of the aeronautical sector with biokerosenes, and consumer behaviours. From field crops and forests, the mobilizable raw materials have been extended to microalgae, animal, households and plant wastes. Biofuels are then part of the territorial bio-economy and the circular economy. Value chains are more complex than those traditionally focused on biodiesel based on oilseeds and sucrose from beet, cane or starch from wheat or maize. The integration of economic actors and the scaling of markets have been the subject of foresight work at international and French levels. Environmental sustainability is generally proven, with reservations for some sources (soya, oil palm). Biofuels are part of a food-energy-environment nexus. Public policies, if based on the sustainability and social acceptability of biotechnology, will also guide the choices of economic interests alone.

While the region has a number of comparative advantages for developing a vibrant biofuels sector, including favorable climate and significant agricultural experience, the experience under the favorable Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) has exposed significant technical and non-technical barriers that must be overcome. Using information compiled through interviews with industry executives, government policy makers and civil society stakeholders, we provide a critical analysis of this experience focusing on non-technical barriers to investment. Survey results suggest that political uncertainty, poor regulatory frameworks, and lack of institutional commitment and business incentives are the main non-technical barriers. Having laid out the challenges, we propose potential policy positions to stimulate growth of the regional biofuels sector. Results point to the need to prioritize enhancing national legislation, developing risk prevention plans, creating supply and demand side incentives and increasing multilateral collaboration. While these findings are derived from the Caribbean Basin experience, they may also be applicable to small economies in other regions that are considering policies for biofuels industry development."
pub.1002411965,Potential Applications of Nanotechnology in Thermochemical Conversion of Microalgal Biomass,"The rapid decrease in fossil reserves has significantly increased the demand of renewable and sustainable energy fuel resources. Fluctuating fuel prices and significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels have been key impediments associated with the production and utilization of nonrenewable fossil fuels. This has resulted in escalating interests to develop new and improve inexpensive carbon neutral energy technologies to meet future demands. Various process options to produce a variety of biofuels including biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen, bio-oil, and biogas have been explored as an alternative to fossil fuels. The renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic nature of biofuels make them appealing as alternative fuels. Biofuels can be produced from various renewable resources. Among these renewable resources, algae appear to be promising in delivering sustainable energy options.Algae have a high carbon dioxide (CO2) capturing efficiency, rapid growth rate, high biomass productivity, and the ability to grow in non-potable water. For algal biomass, the two main conversion pathways used to produce biofuel include biochemical and thermochemical conversions. Algal biofuel production is, however, challenged with process scalability for high conversion rates and high energy demands for biomass harvesting. This affects the viable achievement of industrial-scale bioprocess conversion under optimum economy. Although algal biofuels have the potential to provide a sustainable fuel for future, active research aimed at improving upstream and downstream technologies is critical. New technologies and improved systems focused on photobioreactor design, cultivation optimization, culture dewatering, and biofuel production are required to minimize the drawbacks associated with existing methods.Nanotechnology has the potential to address some of the upstream and downstream challenges associated with the development of algal biofuels. It can be applied to improve system design, cultivation, dewatering, biomass characterization, and biofuel conversion. This chapter discusses thermochemical conversion of microalgal biomass with recent advances in the application of nanotechnology to enhance the development of biofuels from algae. Nanotechnology has proven to improve the performance of existing technologies used in thermochemical treatment and conversion of biomass. The different bioprocess aspects, such as reactor design and operation, analytical techniques, and experimental validation of kinetic studies, to provide insights into the application of nanotechnology for enhanced algal biofuel production are addressed."
pub.1166840169,"Solid Biofuel Production from Biomass: Technologies, Challenges, and Opportunities for Its Commercial Production in Nigeria","Producing durable and efficient solid biofuels should be an important consideration in Nigeria’s present economy due to the numerous advantages associated with it. It offers the benefit of energy generation, particularly in rural areas, and could potentially replace fossil fuels. However, the adoption and production of solid biofuels at commercial scale in Nigeria is limited by some challenges, including the lack of a developed supply chain structure, inadequate facilities, and air pollution. The present study summarizes the types of solid biofuel production technologies deployed in Nigeria as well as the biomass feedstock utilized in the production of fuel briquettes and pellets. While opportunities exist in the gasification of biomass in Nigeria, direct combustion is a readily applicable fuel conversion process that can be utilized to generate electricity from solid biofuel. The major challenges surrounding the full adoption of solid biofuel production and utilization in Nigeria are highlighted. Among others, promotion of clean energy alternatives, investments and financial incentives, sustainable renewable energy policy and energy transition plan, and legislative backing are identified as factors that could accelerate the commercial production and adoption of solid biofuel in Nigeria."

Therefore, the widespread interest in producing biofuels from microalgae has gained considerable interest among leading energy experts and researchers due to the burgeoning global issues stemming from the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, future energy security, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and the competition for limited resources between food crops and conventional biomass feedstock. This paper aims to present the recent advances in biofuel production from microalgae and the potential benefits of microalgae in the energy and environmental sectors, as well as sustainable development. Besides, bottlenecks and challenges mainly relating to techniques of cultivation and harvesting, as well as downstream processes are completely presented. Promising solutions and novel trends for realizing strategies of producing biofuels from microalgae on an industrial and commercial scale are also discussed in detail. Alternatively, the role of microalgae in the circular economy is thoroughly analyzed, indicating that the potential of scaling up current microalgae-based production could benefit from the waste-to-energy strategy with microalgae as a key intermediate. In the future, further research into combining different microalgae biomass pretreatment techniques, separating the microalgae feedstock from the cultured media, developing new species, and optimizing the biofuel production process should be carried out to reduce the prices of microalgae biofuels."
pub.1150794630,(Re)-thinking the bio-prospect of lignin biomass recycling to meet Sustainable Development Goals and circular economy aspects,"Lignin, as an abundant natural polymer with interesting mechanical, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, has the possibility to produce numerous chemicals and biofuels of current interest. However, the structural recalcitrance, heterogeneity, and complex extraction methods of lignin can hinder its transformation into value-added materials. Therefore, the research community is exploring innovative bioconversion technologies capable of effectively valorizing lignin. Thus, effective bioconversion and deconstruction methods have been recently studied. In this review, we first define lignin as a versatile raw material considering its characteristics, properties, and abundance. Then, lignin valorization is described in terms of the current opportunities and technical challenges. Finally, we discuss the industrial potential of lignin-derived products such as biofuels, biopolymers, biopesticides, and fertilizers. Those lignin-derived products are highly valuable for the energy and food industries, which are two main sectors challenged by the rapid growth of population, urbanization, and consumption. Thus, progress on lignin valorization would represent significant advancements in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and circular economy aspects."

Nigeria is a major exporter of fossil fuel but currently faced with serious energy crisis, which necessitates the search for a sustainable renewable form of energy as alternative to fossil fuel in order to meet the SDG 7. Biofuel has been identified as a sustainable form of renewable energy in Nigeria with sugarcane, cassava, plant seed and waste materials being possible feedstocks for bioethanol and biodiesel production. The feedstocks are predominantly available and accessible with the possibility of maximizing them to drive socio-economic growth. Use of waste materials and non-edible underutilized seed oil such as Jatropha curcas will help minimize the controversies associated with the use of food materials as feedstock for biofuel production in Nigeria and other nations in Africa. Furthermore, focus should be on developing the Nigerian waste management strategy, which has the potential of generating sufficient energy to drive the economy and serve as means of employment. It is also high time for Nigeria to develop its own technology to run biofuel production from its currently developed cassava and sugarcane industry. It might be necessary to create more awareness on the importance of biofuel as well as provide suitable business environment for local and international investors."
pub.1040055445,"Biofuels, sustainability and the transport sector in Lithuania","This review paper sets the stage for a look at the Lithuanian (hereinafter LT) transport sector and its transition towards sustainable mobility through the use of biofuels and implementation of the necessary policies to deliver the renewable energy targets.The assessment begins with a brief and reasonably balanced situational analysis of the transport subsectors—road (including ex-fleet vehicle market), off-road, railway, marine, and air—in Lithuania, and their direct relations to the biofuel sector. The paper also aims to examine the dynamics of GHG emissions (N2O, CH4, CO2), air and soil pollution (NO2, SO2, NMWOC, NH3, PM, CO, heavy metals), and related indicators in the whole LT transport sector during the economic transition period (1990–1995), economy growth period (1996–2007) and the first-world debt crisis period (2007–2010).The national biofuels industry has seen plenty of ups and downs over the past decade but have generally good growth prospects. The study found that the CO2 emission is growing recently in Lithuania and this growth could be attributed to almost all transport subsectors. One of the main problems responsible for this situation is the patchy nature of the regulation (there is no governmental decision indicated on setting of national fuel economy/GHG standard), from which most other problems arise.Transport activity has been a key facilitator and driver of economic prosperity in Lithuania and it is likely to continue to grow. It can produce both positive and negative effects on the environment and the quality of life depending on measures at all levels to promote its sustainable development."

Fossil fuel burning in the energy sector is the significant contributor to GHG, global warming and climate change. These scenarios have motivated scientists and policy makers to look for eco-friendly energy supply options with enhanced energy efficiency. Globally, biofuels, considered as a substitute for fossil fuels, have become top priority due to its eco-friendly nature, and many energy policy initiatives have taken place, especially in biofuel production and its use, and various advances in technology are in progress. The biofuel policies are instrumental in improving energy security by reducing foreign oil imports by promoting renewable energy resource. The government is also focusing on advances in research and industrial development on biofuel and biomass-based economy. New policy initiatives have ample opportunities for biofuel production from agricultural residues, industrial waste, and other wastes, which exist as unused or surplus. The sustainable production of biofuel and its use as a substitute for fossil fuels and related policy initiatives would help in the mitigation of climate change."

The assessment provided in this chapter shows how, stemming Geels (2002) from sociotechnical transition theory, there are several alternatives and competing biofuel technologies that differ in terms of feedstocks, refining methods and, most importantly, technoeconomic performance and environmental impacts. We distinguish first and next-generation biofuels and propose a general assessment of their production technologies. In addition, we introduce the Integrated Biorefinery as a new industrial concept to satisfy growing societal demands for green products and energy sources. We analyze the socioeconomic issues related to biofuels production, considering the impacts that biofuel development and policies can have on food security and land competition. From the macro-level landscape perspective, we assess public policy developments, especially focusing on the United States, Brazil, and the EU. We conclude that biofuel development has effects that are global and local, positive and negative, and short and long term. RD investments and public support directed to development of next-generation biofuels and integrated biorefineries play a major role in addressing this challenge."

However, ~90% of commercially made energy from nonrenewable fossil fuels are being used by the transport sector, and several drawbacks are associated with these highly demanding fossil fuels such as limited lifespan and the tremendous air pollution associated with them. The drawbacks and concerns related to fossil fuels have attracted the attention of environmentalists to search for similar or more efficient energy resources for a continuous and balanced supply of energy under sustainable environmental control, and biofuels are one of them. In spite of a lot of research in the biofuel area it has not been progressing well for practical implementation due to the high cost. Based on earlier studies the current cost of manufacturing ethanol is ~Rs 95/L using sugarcane bagasse waste. Additionally, this cost may be further reduced by viable cost analysis, which may contribute to enhance the efficiency of bioethanol without affecting its manufacturing cost and long-term sustainability."
pub.1168322167,Paper-Mill Wastes for Bioethanol Production in Relation to Circular Economy Concepts: A Review,"This review explores circular economy principles in regard to ethanol production from paper-mill sludge. Environmental sustainability and renewability over fossil fuels make second generation ethanol an attractive energy source in a rapidly growing population and consumption world. Paper sludge (PS), a by-product of the pulp and paper (P&P) industry, can no longer be recycled for paper production and is mainly disposed of in landfills. Therefore, it poses a major environmental challenge. However, it has shown potential as a valuable raw material for ethanol production, along with other pulp and paper products, due to its abundant availability and high cellulosic content. This waste-to-energy (WtE) technology for ethanol production is proposed as an alternative, aligning with circular economy concepts to maximize resource efficiency and minimize waste. This review underlines the circular economy aspects of bioethanol production within paper mill sludge management systems. Circular economy principles applied to ethanol production from PS offer a promising avenue for sustainable biofuel development that not only addresses waste management challenges but also enhances the overall environmental performance of biofuel production. Furthermore, economic benefits are described, highlighting the potential for job creation and community development."

pub.1143454908,"Challenges on waste-to-energy for the valorization of industrial wastes: Electricity, heat and cold, bioliquids and biofuels","In light of legislative requirements and circular economy principles, valorization of wastes is the best strategy for its management. The biodegradable fraction of industrial wastes is a sustainable source of biomass, thereby optimizing its management by energy valorization, decreasing the quantity of waste that needs to be managed (and its economic costs), minimizing the environmental impact and health risks, and reducing the high dependence of industries on primary sources and fossil energy. Although traditional biomass sources, such as wood, crops, agricultural and forestry residues, and food and municipal wastes, are renewable, sustainable and cost-efficient, they compete with food and their energy processes release waste into the environment. Waste to Energy (WtE) is a recent, efficient and sustainable method of waste management based on the idea that energy sustainability involves both sustainable energy sources and sustainable energy systems. This paper reviews studies that propose industrial waste and by-products as sustainable, renewable and unlimited sources of biomass for use in sustainable energy systems to generate electricity, heat and cold, bioliquids and biofuels. The advantages and disadvantages of various types of resources are presented, and their limitations and the challenges that must be overcome are analyzed and compared."
pub.1112113817,Circulating blame in the circular economy: The case of wood-waste biofuels and coal ash," The transition from coal-based electricity to ‘carbon neutral’ biofuels derived from forests has catalysed a debate largely centred upon whether woody-biofuels drive deforestation. Consequently, a crucial point is often missed. Most wood pellets used in electricity production are derived from waste-wood; a practice considered acceptable by many otherwise strongly opposed to the industry. We highlight that, precisely because waste-wood is a ‘waste’, its carbon-neutral credentials should be questioned. We then examine a parallel development occurring within the same industrial system; the recovery of electricity producers’ combustion-ash residues for concrete production. Contrasting how accounting practices allocate upstream carbon to these ‘wastes’ in the cases of wood pellets and coal-ash reveals how decisions are shaped by industry imperatives, rather than established lifecycle techniques. If the politics of emissions allocation continue to evolve in this way, it may become increasingly difficult to distinguish where progress towards a low-carbon, environmentally sustainable and circular economy is real, from where it is an artefact of biased and inconsistent accounting practices."

pub.1165906101,Microbial Intervention in Waste Remediation for Bio-Energy Production,"The extensive exploitation of fossil fuels and the increasing global demand for energy entailed producing alternative fuels to swamp fossil fuels. Production of biofuels from biological, agricultural, municipal, and other waste products can be an alternative option to fossil fuels. Presently, biofuel production from waste products has marginally reduced the dependency on fossil fuels for energy. Eco-friendly renewable energy fuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol, biobutanol, biohydrogen, and biogas resulting from biomass conversion from agricultural waste, microalgae, or biological wastes have significantly contributed to the wellness of the economy as well as the environment. Biofuels are generated by biological processes such as fermentation via applications of suitable microorganisms from different genera with diverse biofuel production mechanisms. The effect of wastes on the environment, potential waste products which could be used as raw material for biofuels production, types of biofuels produced from the waste products, and potential microorganisms used in biofuel production have been discussed in the present chapter. Emphasis has been given to putative biochemical pathways involved in bio-energy production, along with recent research and updates on utilising different sustainable resources for bio-energy production. Finally, the chapter has concluded with prominent challenges encountered during biofuel production from waste materials and potential mitigation strategies for them."
pub.1175083433,Lignocellulosic biomass in circular economy: A techno-transition in carbon neutrality towards sustainable energy production,"The ongoing energy crisis and global warming threat represent major challenges of the century. Our dependence on conventional fuels has reached to a critical level where attempts are made to reduce the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission and impede its ramifications. Simultaneously, it is projected to have alternative greener energy resources to reduce the deleterious effect of biofuels on humans and the environment. The lignocellulosic biomass (LCB, an abundant feedstock) constitutes an important renewable resource with potential to replace non-renewable ones for energy production. The shift in the usage of natural resources projects biofuels on the forefront to overcome the growing energy crisis and offer a sustainable solution to the global warming to minimize its impact at the global scale. Offering a long-term viability, biofuels upholds a key component in the economic prosperity of a nation. This article highlights important aspects of feedstock selection, a concise and comprehensive account of the pre-treatment procedures, and enzymatic saccharification of the LCB employed in the biofuel production. Considering the biomass heterogeneity and optimization in predicting and managing the outputs and huge capital and operating expenditures, the study presents integration of the microbial saccharification with established biofuel technologies towards enhancing efficiency and overall productivity. Additionally, an account of the artificial technology and machine learning approaches employed in harnessing renewable resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, have been added. Holding a greater promise, the review adds to the need of developing robust and efficient LCB conversion methods to scale up and excel in sustainable energy production for a greener future."
pub.1042810831,Topic: Liquid Biofuel Production,"Liquid biofuels, bioethanol, and biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) are practical and offer attractive advantages over other forms of biomass energy resources in terms of high energy density and ease of storage and transport. However, there has been no significant increase in the production of these fuels in the past few years. The reason is that there is no profitability for producers owing to high production cost and no benefits for consumers because of unstable product quality and lower fuel economy and power. Moreover, emergence of next-generation automobiles (e.g., battery-powered and fuel cell electric vehicles) will lower the demand for gasoline. From this perspective, it seems as if there is no role left for biofuel production in Japan’s future energy system. However, from another perspective, biofuels may have a vital function under some circumstances, if appropriate and profitable technologies are developed. Using the example of a novel biodiesel production process using resin catalysts, this article discusses those technologies and circumstances in which biofuels can be a part of future sustainable energy systems."

Policies and practices are consequently necessary to support a just transition towards a low-carbon economy. Therefore, this study aimed to understand multi-actor perspectives on policies and practices relevant to the just transition in biofuel development. Applying a socio-legal approach based on the JUST framework, this study focused on the Indonesian biofuel industry, which is primarily driven by crude palm oil (CPO) production. This study also added comparative perspectives from Thailand’s biofuel industry. The primary data were gathered from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs), while the secondary data were from research, policy, and other government archives. Based on the results, oil palm plantations in Indonesia and Thailand are crucial for macroeconomic development. However, smallholder farmers in Indonesia, especially independent ones that do not join farmer groups, remain marginalised by the current regulations. In fact, many benefits from biofuel practices and policies accumulate disproportionately towards large corporations, while marginalised groups bear the costs. The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification that should induce market accessibility and competitiveness has not fully reached most rural farmers. Furthermore, various overlapping regulations and perplexing data differences exist from multiple ministries and administrative levels. Thus, palm oil stakeholders in Indonesia demand a dedicated institution for integrated regulation and monitoring of the industry, similar to the National Palm Oil Policy Committee in Thailand. The myriad of legal, political, socio-economic, and justice issues thus necessitates all hands on deck to ensure a just transition for all stakeholders of the Indonesian biofuel industry."

The world economy is now transforming into sustainable and renewable energy-based economy from carbon-based economy. This high demand of these sustainable energy sources has been a keen interest among the scientists because global warming and pollution are getting worse.Researches have been conducted to develop alternative fuels such as hydrogen and biofuels, as an alternative fuel to petroleum-based fuels and the energy storage devices like batteries, and supercapacitors. Renewable energies like solar and wind are available in plenty but practical and potential applications need the development of energy storage devices. In new technological development, nanotechnology and nano-materialsNanomaterials have played a significant part by enhancing the storage and transformation capacity of energy. Batteries and supercapacitors are among the most successful applications of modern nanotechnology.

However, their large scale cultivation and associated lipid recovery are confined by a number of factors. In this perspective, an endeavor has been made in this work to analyze the limiting factors for large scale microalgal cultivation by an analytical framework using interpretive structural modeling approach. The limiting factors were first identified through a comprehensive literature study and then, the interactions among the factors were formulated. Subsequently, the key factors that drive the system were identified by the multiplication properties of matrices principle. The results indicated that various operational and environmental factors would influence the mircroalgal culturing technology, the economy of fuel production and sustainability of the process. The study also showed that there were no autonomous and linkage factors indicating that no factors in this study with weak drive and weak dependence powers and all the factors considered were stable. Moreover, it was identified that the relevant policy mechanism with incentives and other supportive measures would benefit the growth of the algal biofuel industry.

The tree owns only ~10% palm oil with the rest as oil palm biomass. Deploying biofuels in replacing unsustainable conventional fuels has received global attention. As the use of palm biodiesel is linked to food versus fuel issue, other palm bio-waste resources such as oil palm biomass, which is abundantly available can be fully exploited. Various palm biomass to solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels conversion technologies have been developed. Among the exploited palm-based second-generation biofuels, biogas from palm oil mill effluent is the most low-hanging and is commercially implemented. This paper (part II) focuses on the second-generation biofuels derived from oil palm biomass. The related policies, issues, and challenges faced are discussed followed by some suggestions toward optimizing and diversifying the resources to develop a circular palm oil economy."

While the focus of this book is on some of the science behind advanced biofuels production using microbes, enormous changes are required for the world to quit its addiction to fossil fuels. Thus, it is worthwhile to raise and consider some of the larger issues around future biofuels production. These certainly call for a large public debate, and careful consideration by policy makers. In addition to the social issues, biofuels production raises a number of ethical questions and it can even be argued that there is an ethical imperative to produce biofuels (Buxy and Tait 2011). First, I lay out the case, perhaps already well-made elsewhere, for the need to develop new energy sources and then discuss some of the larger issues surrounding new energy development."

This paper constructs a dynamic game model that, for the first time compares the incentive effects of four common subsidy modes on waste cooking oil supply for biofuel refining and sales of waste cooking oil refined products. The model considers the impact of preferential tax treatment, a raw material subsidy, a sales subsidy and an investment subsidy on the profits of biofuel enterprises and waste cooking oil recyclers. Results indicate that common approaches adopted in developed economies such as raw material price subsidies and finished products sales subsidies increase the profits of both biofuel enterprises and recyclers. On the contrary, investment subsidies, which are relatively common in some regions of China, increase the profits of recyclers, while reducing revenues achieved by biofuel enterprises. To promote the supply chain, policy should give priority to raw material price subsidies and finished products sales subsidies, and for investment subsidies, however, the government should be cautious."

Oil, coal, and natural gas are the primary sources of the chemicals and energy that directly impact the economy. However, the reserves of these resources are continuously reducing. New alternatives have emerged, including biotechnological tools such as microbial consortia (MC) to produce biofuels, chemicals such as organic acids, and processed foods. The diversity of MC as a biotechnological tool allows it to be used in complex substrates, opening the possibility of using other solid waste to implement consolidated bioprocesses (CPs). This review presents an overview of the uses of MC and CP for producing biofuels using different feedstocks."
pub.1149765619,Synthetic Biology-Based Advanced Biotechnological Approach in Microalgal Biorefinery,"As fossil fuels are declining, global economies need sustainable energy sources. Biofuel, the most promising candidate for the energy crisis, is still not competitive as compared to fossil fuels. Thus, higher yields of biofuel and simultaneous production of high-value commodities (HVCs) to compensate for the production cost are a plausible strategy. Microalgae in this context are a successful candidate, due to their ability to produce various nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and many other HVCs alongside biofuels. Higher sequestration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to biomass and the ability to recycle nutrient-rich cosmopolitan waste with a biorefinery-based approach give microalgae an advantage over other photoautotrophs. This biofuel and HVC-rich biomass can be further enhanced by regulating some specific targets like pathway genes, transcription factors, enhancers, and repressors. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and Clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats /CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) are some technologies used for this purpose. The combination of these synthetic biology approaches with bioprocess improvement can help in increasing biofuel and HVC production. However, the unavailability of microalgal genomes is a bottleneck in their genetic engineering for a sustainable biorefinery. The advances in multi-omics technologies give possible solutions for effectively understanding the microalgal genomes. Thus, in this chapter, we discuss microalgal physiology in light of synthetic biology and aforementioned genome editing techniques in combination with major bottlenecks and their solutions."

However, these changes mainly occur in the urban areas and the rural population section has long been ignored by policy makers and government in the provision of energy. It is only recently that solar and biofuel are finally making in road to provide cheap and clean energy sources to rural population. As a result, literature on consumer behavior of rural population towards sustainable energy sources are still very scarce. The present research aims to fulfil this gap by developing a conceptual model to investigate the adoption of solar power and biofuel energy resources in the cross-cultural setting of Malaysia and Pakistan. The data was collected from the rural areas of Pakistan and Malaysia. The two-stage data analysis method of partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) have been applied to satisfy both linear and non-linear regression assumption respectively. The results show that consumer in rural areas of Pakistan are willing and possess intention to adopt both biofuel and solar power for commercial and domestic use. Additionally, the results confirm that Branding, Economic and Altruistic factors are important in yielding intention to use towards biofuel and solar power panel in Pakistan which are validated by the results obtained in Malaysia. Other factors such as climate change awareness, retailer services quality and ease of use are also important. The results offer wide ranging theoretical and managerial implications.</p>"
pub.1174432305,Manifesting Sustainability Toward Food Waste into Bioenergy: Biorefinery in a Circular Economic Approach,"The global issue of excessive food waste has raised significant concerns, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable interventions incorporating eco-friendly technologies. Around 1.3 billion tons of food are discarded every year, representing a one-third of the world total food production. This food wastage comes at a considerable cost to the world economy, estimated at around $750 billion. The escalating generation of food waste highlights the pressing need for effective measures to address this issue with a dual purpose. Utilization of food waste includes distillery waste, feed and poultry waste, oil processing waste, cooking oil waste, seafood waste, dairy waste, vegetable and fruit waste for production of various biobased products reducing economic losses and promoting sustainability by harnessing. This encompasses the utilization of diverse bioprocesses, including acidogenesis, fermentation, photosynthesis, solventogenesis, methanogenesis, bio-electrogenesis, and oleaginous processes, each capable of yielding a wide spectrum of valuable products. Within this book chapter, the primary emphasis on products, specifically bioelectricity, biodiesel, and biofuels, as crucial elements for achieving sustainability and advancing the objectives outlined in sustainable development goals (SDG)-12. SDG-12 leads to responsible consumption and production, particularly SDG 12.3, which aims to halve global per capita food waste. To ensure the economic viability of these bioprocesses and align with sustainable goals, it is imperative to adopt a biorefinery strategy that optimizes the utilization of residual organic waste for the recovery of a diverse range of green products within a circular economy framework."

Through trade and international agreements, global changes increasingly affect development options for both industrialized and developing economies. At national level, continued population growth, expanding economies and urbanization have, especially in densely-populated areas, led to unprecedented competition for land and water resources between agriculture and other uses such as infrastructure, urban, industry and recreation/nature. This challenges the agricultural sector to produce sufficient, more diverse and safe food, fibre products and feedstocks for biofuel in a sustainable manner. This has to be achieved in an increasingly competitive and globalizing economy. Meeting these challenges requires significant changes in the way agriculture and the value chain are organized."

pub.1132138309,Impact of Fermentation Types on Enzymes Used for Biofuels Production,"Biofuels are a sustainable and renewable source of energy that can be produced from energy crops (like sugarcane and corn), vegetable oil, microbes, organic waste, or biomass. It emits a reduced amount of carbon dioxide as compared to conventional fuels, and in this way, it plays an essential role in lessening the emission of carbon dioxide. Now-a-days, the global energy market has been progressing swiftly because of the reduction of fossil fuels, a perpetual increase in the world population, and industrialized economy. Due to an increase in demand for fuels and its consequent impact of depleting eco-friendly environmental condition and global warming upshots, the development of alternate energy are prime priorities in the research and development area. The bioenergy generated from the biomass signifies a sustainable alternative energy reservoir that gained immense recognition in different divisions from government, public, industries, and researches for its sustainability. The need of these alternative sources is because of toxic gases emission as these gases commence to adverse effects like receding of glaciers, a decline of biodiversity, weather variation, and raise in sea level, and the tremendous requirement for this fossil fuel is additionally affecting the global economic ventures since there is an escalation in the rates of crude oil. The high-speedy modern world progresses by both industrialization and motorization, and it is the primary reason for the inconstant fuel demand. So, promptly the researchers are continuously working in the production of sustainable biofuel from sustainable biomass, acknowledging it as an efficient alternative to supersede non-renewable fuels (Gaurav et al. 2017)."
pub.1142396688,Chapter 3 Plants: a sustainable platform for second-generation biofuels and biobased chemicals,"The world economy is progressively shifting from fossil–based linear economy to bioeconomy. The mobilization of sustainable biomass sources for the production of biobased products is important in this transition. Under this scenario, biofuels and other derived products from plant biomass represent the most abundant reserve of renewable sources, and they can play an important role in different fields, including long-distance transportation such as aviation. First-generation biofuels and value-added chemicals produced from food crops will be progressively reduced to meet the trajectory included in the Renewable Energy Directive in favor of more advanced bioproducts. To meet the global demands, it will be necessary to expand the availability of feedstocks and to increase the productivity of the feedstocks currently used in the industry. Plants have been traditionally domesticated for several applications, including food, feed, and fiber stocks. The domestication of plant species for energy-related traits may be important to increase energy production and for their diversification from the food chain. For this reason, the breeding of novel phenotypes and biotechnological and genetic approaches for improving biomass composition are in constant growth. With this chapter, we provide an overview of the main approaches for the conversion of plant feedstocks into bioenergy, more specifically biogas, bioethanol, and plant oil-based biofuels, together with other principal biobased chemicals that can be obtained during the process. Furthermore, we describe the features of the novel nonfood energy crops and briefly analyze the role that genetic engineering may have in improving bioproducts and increasing their competitiveness, thereby addressing the current socioeconomic and environmental requests."
pub.1000993861,"Biofuel production and implications for land use, food production and environment in India","There is a large interest in biofuels in India as a substitute to petroleum-based fuels, with a purpose of enhancing energy security and promoting rural development. India has announced an ambitious target of substituting 20% of fossil fuel consumption by biodiesel and bioethanol by 2017. India has announced a national biofuel policy and launched a large program to promote biofuel production, particularly on wastelands: its implications need to be studied intensively considering the fact that India is a large developing country with high population density and large rural population depending upon land for their livelihood. Another factor is that Indian economy is experiencing high growth rate, which may lead to enhanced demand for food, livestock products, timber, paper, etc., with implications for land use. Studies have shown that area under agriculture and forest has nearly stabilized over the past 2–3 decades. This paper presents an assessment of the implications of projected large-scale biofuel production on land available for food production, water, biodiversity, rural development and GHG emissions. The assessment will be largely focused on first generation biofuel crops, since the Indian program is currently dominated by these crops. Technological and policy options required for promoting sustainable biofuel production will be discussed."
pub.1105564629,A Regional Perspective on Biofuels in Asia,"This chapter explores the potential for a regional perspective on biofuels in Asia. In the late 2000s, there were high expectations in many Asian countries that biofuels could be produced and consumed on a large scale, and enhance energy security, provide jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There were also high expectations of significant biofuel trade, particularly of exports from Southeast Asia to the EU and Japan. Several Asian countries have biofuel blending mandates and produce modest quantities of biofuels. Current levels of biofuel use in Asian countries may be feasible, but it is likely to be difficult for biofuels to account for a large share of transport fuel use. Overall, this chapter concludes that large-scale increases in production are probably not realistic without large-scale diversion of land from other uses such as food production, and without further pressure on the environment and other resources necessary for production, particularly water. It is not always clear where large amounts of land might be available, so there is no clear source of large-scale sustainable biofuel exports. Encouragement of smaller scale production tailored to local conditions as a way to promote rural development, poverty reduction, and management of certain kinds of waste may be more realistic. However, without large economies of scale, it will be difficult to reduce costs. In addition, there are various other challenges to the promotion of small-scale biofuels such as capacity of farmers, availability and cost of land, water, labor, and other inputs, and availability of markets for final outputs. If the main goal is to increase rural employment rather than energy security or GHG emissions reduction, then there may be other ways to accomplish this besides biofuels. Sustainability standards and certification systems are one possible way to encourage the development of biofuels in a positive direction. However, while they may enable sustainable incremental production, they cannot create new land for biofuels, and if they are to be effective, they should restrain the availability of new land by preventing excessive land use change from forests or food crops."
pub.1144686454,12 Vermicomposting and bioconversion approaches towards the sustainable utilization of palm oil mill waste,"The rapid growth of the world's population has led to a huge increase in food production and in turn to a huge increase in the amount of waste generated. Waste management is consequently becoming a major challenge throughout the world. Vegetable oil production has increased in recent years due to a higher demand for cooking oil. In this context, palm oil now occupies the top position in the vegetable oil market, and oil palm is one of the world's most rapidly expanding tropical crops. However, increased production of palm oil results in the generation of huge amounts of waste from palm oil mills. Therefore, waste management is a major challenge for this growing agro-industry, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia, the major palm oil-producing countries. Palm oil mill waste (POMW) can either be vermicomposted to make biofertilizer or it can be bio-converted into biofuels, thus providing an opportunity for simultaneous waste management and establishment of a sustainable bio-economy. A number of recent studies have investigated the treatment of different types of waste generated in palm oil mills, mainly considering biodegradation processes. This chapter outlines some cost-effective and eco-friendly technologies for converting palm oil mill waste into biofuel and other value-added products. Vermicomposting is a particularly effective biotechnique for managing organic waste, in terms of viability and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, palm oil biowaste is rich in microbes and its use in producing biofuel is promising. The main goal of this chapter is to promote the utilization of palm oil mill waste under the umbrella of green, sustainable technology that can potentially boost the economies of the palm oil-producing countries."

The quantitively assessment model and approach have been established coupling upstream CO2 source and deliverables with downstream algal biofuel deliverables at the uniform algae level of Nannochloropsis oceanica. This life cycle assessment investigated the following impacts: transportation distances and purification modes with flue gas CO2 concentrations, lipid content with specific productivity and CO2 biofixation coupling the nutrient supply, final products including algae, jet biofuel and biodiesel. The results indicated that flue gas with a wide range of CO2 concentration was compared for two type deliverables including algal CO2, edible CO2. Flue gas with low CO2 concentration is appropriate for on-site algal CO2 deliverable within 10km while flue gas with above 95% CO2 is flexible to transportation distance and appropriate for edible CO2 deliverable. Specific productivities and CO2 fixation both comply with negatively logarithmic relationship with lipid contents. Coupling f algae specific productivity and CO2 evaporation, the total CO2 fixation efficiencies were investigated above 90% at below 28 % lipid but obviously decrease at above 40% lipid. The LCA indicated that allocation is a crucial issue to balance energy, environment and economy decision on target product choice and by-products. Coupling solar energy utilization and by-product of bioactive nutrients effects, the positive energy gains have been investigated at a wide range of lipid contents despite of jet biofuel or biodiesel."

pub.1147295666,Biotechnological Intercession in Biofuel Production,"Fossil fuels in large quantities are being used despite their role in increasing environmental problems. Worldwide usages of biomass-based biofuels are necessary for environment preservation and development of sustainable communities. Therefore, to move from an economy zone that is dependent on nonrenewable sources of energy to one with advanced multiplicity of renewable sources will definitely not be an effortless progression. It will rather require investment of imperative exploration efforts to get adapted to dynamics of a varying energy market, make cost-effective progressions, and evade overlap with shared significance markets, such as, agriculture, food, and livestock production. Research and development projects working toward production of biofuels are mainly targeted at conversion of plant/microbial biomass to renewable fluidized fuels. Foremost challenges encountered for the production of biofuels include lack of domestication of biofuel crops, low oil/fatty acid produced from biofuel plants/microbes, 256as well as of lignocellulose recalcitrance to chemical and enzymatic breakdown. Day by day, research on genetic, genomic resources available for plant/microbial enhancement, elucidation of lipid metabolism to assist exploitation of fatty acid biosynthetic approach and phyto cell wall biosynthesis and assemblage all over the world are broadening.

This chapter briefly describes the biotechnological interventions that can make major advancements in strain improvement for commercial scale production of biofuels. Generally, biofuels are derivative of renewable organic products and are frequently considered as green substitutes to fossil energy repository owing to their enormous contribution to carbon dioxide emissions reduction. Augmentation of oil concentration in seeds has been attained through exploitation of expression levels of enzymes implicated in the production of triacylglycerols. For sustainable society to persist, reliance on biofuels would decrease dependence on fossil fuels as energy sources. Advancement in phytobiomass features for biofuel generation is in the inaugural phases. Additionally, amalgamation of cell surface biotailoring and metabolic biotailoring will definitely generate additional profitable microorganisms for economical and less exhaustive manufacturing of biofuels."

pub.1173012343,Biorefineries for sustainable waste valorization,"Industrial production of biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, biodiesel, etc. utilizes plant-based feedstocks (corn, sugarcane, sugar beet, oil seeds, algae) with high concentration of carbohydrates or lipids. Most of these feedstocks, after extraction of sugar, starch, and lipid for the synthesis of biofuel, contain high concentrations of fiber, protein, and minerals which could be utilized and upcycled into potential animal feeding ingredients to support sustainable food supply. In addition, human beings generate large volumes of food wastes each year which include crop residues, organic processing wastes, fruit/vegetable discards, etc. These food wastes and discards contain readily available nutrients including carbohydrates, starch, lipids, proteins, and minerals but are prone to be spoiled quickly. Converting food wastes and discards into appropriate feeding ingredients would significantly reduce the cost, energy, and carbon footprint for animal feed production and achieve a sustainable food supply. On the other hand, biomass that is not feasible for feed, organic wasting materials such as sewage sludge, municipal solid wastes, and animal manure are major concerns for environmental pollution including air, soil, and water and contribute largely to “greenhouse” effect. Treatments of these organic wasting materials by thermochemical transforming, composting, and anerobic digestion can efficiently reduce their environmental impacts while producing materials of benefit such as bio-fertilizer, biochar, energy, and industrial-valued chemicals. Among these products, bio-fertilizer and biochar can be applied to agricultural land to improve soil fertility which could directly affect the productivity of crops that grow on the soil. Therefore, an integrated biorefinery of agricultural and food wastes including the production of biofuel, animal feed, bio-fertilizer, with appropriate treatment of wasting materials from agricultural processing and animal production should be a trend for a more sustainable agricultural economy. In this chapter, different types of biorefineries and their contribution to the supply of energy and food, with protection of soil, water, and air quality to facilitate the formation of a circular economy will be discussed."
pub.1112940509,"Circular Integration of processes, industries, and economies"," Circular Economy has emerged as a popular research topic that is shaping public policy in Europe, China, America and elsewhere. It complements the conceptual basis of the Industrial Ecology framework, but places more emphasis on business models to create closed-loop material systems. However, the Circular Economy concept currently lacks robust engineering design methods, leading to many researchers question its effectiveness. In contrast, Process Integration is lesser known publicly, despite being widely applied in industry to achieve substantial reductions in industrial energy, water, and utility use. These three areas have developed in parallel with minimal cross-pollination, but are in fact potentially complementary. This contribution proposes the new unified concept of Circular Integration for greater transdisciplinary research cohesiveness in the sustainable development of processes, industries, and economies. Circular Integration combines elements from Process Integration, Industrial Ecology, and Circular Economy into a multi-dimensional, multi-scale approach to the minimisation of resource and energy consumption. Circular Integration thus provides an engineering toolbox for planning a Sustainable and Circular Economy. To demonstrate its potential, the paper presents a case study on sustainable biofuel production. The possible solution leverages existing industrial resources to potentially produce enough fuel to fulfil 37% of current demand for global air and marine transport. The Circular Integration framework can also be generalised to systems other than transport and energy, aiming to catalyse greater transdisciplinary research for the analysis, design, and implementation of sustainable and circular systems."

From the very beginning, identifying and evaluating all potentially high value-added chemicals that could be removed from available renewable feedstocks requires robust, efficient, selective, reproducible, and benign analytical approaches. With this in mind, green and sustainable separation of natural products from agro-industrial waste is clearly attractive considering both socio-environmental and economic aspects. In this paper, the concepts of green and sustainable separation of natural products will be discussed, highlighting the main studies conducted on this topic over the last 10 years. The principal analytical techniques (such as solvent, microwave, ultrasound, and supercritical treatments), by-products (e.g., citrus, coffee, corn, and sugarcane waste) and target compounds (polyphenols, proteins, essential oils, etc.) will be presented, including the emerging green and sustainable separation approaches towards bioeconomy and circular economy contexts."

Since the biological production of fuels, from vegetal biomass, offers sustainable and economically attractive options compared to petroleum-based production. However, the 98complexity of vegetal biomass does not allow the process to be simple. Furthermore, there are still many important biological and technological barriers for the processing of biofuels being competitive. Besides, bioprocesses normally required multiple steps of feedstock pretreatment and subsequent conversion to fuel. Those steps are being consolidated into single microbial processes using metabolically engineered species (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zimmomona mobilis, and Clostridium thermocellum).

pub.1028818088,Replication of industrial ecosystems: the case of a sustainable biogas-for-traffic solution,"Distributed energy systems are key in building a sustainable energy economy. Biofuels are an example of an industry that needs to be based on a system of rather small-scale local production units due to the limited transportation radius of biomass. Moreover, the benefits of biofuels are greater if their production is based on the integration of local production activities and consumption among traditionally separate industries, as implied by the notion of industrial symbiosis. Such an arrangement, however, requires the establishment of industrial ecosystems that are customised to local conditions, which increases costs and uncertainty for the involved stakeholders and the integrating company. In this paper, we discuss replication strategy as a means of transferring not only technical knowledge, but also the business format to new locations, thereby achieving ‘economies of repetition’. The case of a biogas-for traffic solution serves as an illustrative example. We analyse the establishment of a ‘vanguard’ ecosystem and assess the potential of replicating the solution in six other locations. Based on this, we propose a replication framework that builds on functional modularisation, collaboration mechanisms required for cooperating with the relevant stakeholders, and organisational learning. The replication approach is expected to be useful for the companies attempting to build sustainable distributed energy systems based on industrial symbiosis."
pub.1150221131,"Microalgae biodiesel: A sustainable source of energy, unit operations, technological challenges, and solutions","The decline in reserves of fossil fuels has shifted the world towards renewable and sustainable alternative fuels. Microalgae, a rich source of triacylglycerol, are a potential candidate for biodiesel production. The rising industrial uses of algae led to the development of different unit operations. Unraveling the biochemistry of compounds present in algae to produce biofuels and byproducts, biomass productivity and efficient extraction of bioactive compounds remain key hurdles. This review brings into light the different cell disruption methodologies, with reduced environmental hazards caused by conventional methods. The production of lipids for biofuel like biodiesel cannot alone sustain the algae-based economy. Therefore, using lipid extracted biomass for various other purposes serves it a solution. Lipid Extracted Biomass has numerous applications, including the production of biofuels like biohydrogen and biogas, biochar, bio-composites, carbon quantum dots and bio-polythene of different densities. It can also be used as animal feed, manure to improve soil fertility and to treat wastewater. The present article discusses the state-of-the-art technologies developed for algal biomass cultivation, harvesting and drying. This comparative discussion on different algal biofuels’ unit operations will reveal associated technological challenges arising during various unit operations, from cultivation to lipid extraction and its conversion to biodiesel. This study presents a sustainable solution for extracting lipids from microalgae by utilizing its byproducts for several commercial purposes. The study concludes that modifications are required in the conventional approaches of harvesting, drying along with cultivation to improve the bioeconomic potential of algae"
pub.1045364197,Brazil as a new international cooperation actor in sub-Saharan Africa: Biofuels at the crossroads between sustainable development and natural resource exploitation,"Over the last decade, emerging economic powers have become increasingly influential actors in the formerly closed circle of donor countries. In the frame of south–south cooperation initiatives, large economies in the global south are working with less advanced developing countries. While a significant literature on China's role regarding mining and oil and gas exploration in Africa has developed, an analysis of the new dynamics of South–South cooperation and its effect on the political economy and sustainability of rural development and energy diversification in African countries is largely absent. As an effort to start filling this gap, we analyze the opportunities and frictions introduced by Brazilian actors in the biofuel sector in a set of sub-Saharan African countries. By assessing the political, technical and economic dimensions present in Brazil's south–south cooperation strategy for this region, we find that the arrival of Brazilian biofuel actors to Africa is leading to deep asymmetries between powerful and less preeminent actors, undermining the overall sustainability of the offered development model."
pub.1154908491,Recent advances on lignocellulosic bioresources and their valorization in biofuels production: Challenges and viability assessment,"Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) waste materials are abundant in nature, and because of their high cellulose content, they rank among the most widely accessible and preferred feedstocks for the development of cost-effective biorefineries. The main obstacle to the long-term viability of this waste valorization at the pilot size, however, is the complexity of the structural composition of these wastes and the lack of a suitable bioprocess for their economical and efficient biotransformation. The current review investigates the potential for economically viable and environmentally friendly biotransformation of LCB wastes into cellulolytic enzymes and biofuels generation technologies. The review focuses on the efficient synthesis of enzymes and energy from LCB wastes through biotransformation. Based on the update progress, the information of the complexity constraint that currently exists in the LCB structure and the successful limitation surmounted have also been evaluated. To improve the overall bioprocess on a sustainable scale, other possible sustainable recommendations have also been proposed. Such LCB waste valorizations can contribute to the circular economy for sustainable future applications."
pub.1155199345,Production of Biofuels and Value-Added Products Using Anaerobic Digestion of Wastewater,"Water resources are significantly polluted by industrial, agricultural, and residential wastes. With the growth of industries and the economy, the rate of water contamination has increased. Water treatment requires removing harmful pollutants and proceeds with recycling or discharge into water bodies. Regular water treatments are cost- and energy-consuming. Anaerobic digestion includes specialized bioreactors, a microbial inoculum of restricted or facultative anaerobes. It has a significant advantage for producing value-added products, such as biofuels and petrochemicals, by metabolizing wastewater with the help of microbes. It is a beneficial two-in-one process and is highly economical in energy production and wastewater treatment. Instead of using cost-consuming different generation feedstocks for energy production, we can use the polluted wastewater released from various industries to increase the yield of energy and other value-added derivatives. The ultimate aim of this review is to visualize the recent advances in anaerobic digestion of different wastewaters from industries to produce biofuels and other value-added products. Accomplishing sustainable energy and simultaneous water treatment requires wide-ranging improvements in all economic, social, and technical aspects. Anaerobic digestion will be a future investment for a sustainable environment."
pub.1144717704,How sustainable are biofuels in a natural resource-dependent economy?,"For biofuels to promote growth in low-income agriculture-dependent economies, sustainability should be at the forefront of their biofuel programs. The high dependence on natural resources exposes such economies to resource misuse and environmental mismanagement risks. This research uses the case study of Uganda to assess the land, energy, water, and carbon footprints of maize, cassava, and sugarcane ethanol. All three pathways have positive energy balances, and the carbon footprints range between 0.89–3.12, 0.85–2.19, and 0.24–0.49 kg CO2eq/L of maize, cassava, and sugarcane ethanol, respectively. It would take about 15 years for maize ethanol, 14 for cassava ethanol, and 6 for sugarcane ethanol to break even with reference to gasoline if feedstocks were produced on converted grassland. Sugarcane ethanol is superior to maize and cassava ethanol, and its benefits derive from the carbon-neutral co-product electricity and a relatively higher ethanol yield per hectare. The study findings flag the ethanol processing stage and feedstock farming as key emission hotspots. They also reflect the emissions-reducing potential of ethanol exhibited by a decline in national emissions. Land requirements are minimal, and this demand diminishes with the improvement in crop yields. Overall, there are high prospects of economic and environmental gains. However, agricultural investment and immediate attention to poor crop yields are required alongside a regulated framework and the promotion of low-carbon energy sources."
pub.1118123219,Next-Generation Biofuels—Opportunities and Challenges,"India being a developing economy is using a huge amount of energy for sustaining its growth, most of which comes from fossil fuels at present. However, India is importing around 87% of its crude oil requirement which is a major burden on the exchequer. The most potential fuel either to supplement or substitute petroleum-derived fuels in the Indian context is biofuels. Biofuels are not only renewable but environmental friendly as well. The first generation of biofuels (ethanol, biodiesel) is derived from energy-containing molecules such as sugar, starch, vegetable oil, and animal fats. Fuel produced from these sources can have an adverse impact on the food security. Also, the yield of biofuel from these sources is limited. Therefore, efforts are required to generate advanced biofuels by identifying effective non-edible feedstocks. Research is needed for improvement in the conversion technologies performance along with cost reduction. The next-generation biofuels are mainly stemmed from lignocellulose, non-food materials, algal biomass, and energy crops grown on marginal lands. Biofuels are sustainable and have the potential to address the issues of climate change and energy security. However, challenges such as high production cost, lack of realistic support price, enforcement of mandates, poor supply chain, and adherence to quality norms are some of the deterrents for their commercialization. New technologies such as hydroprocessing and nano-catalysts would emerge as an attractive proposition in times to come."

pub.1129330703,Sustainable biofuel and bioenergy production from biomass waste residues using microwave-assisted heating: A comprehensive review,"With drastic fossil fuel depletion and environmental deterioration concerns, a move towards a more sustainable bioenergy-based economy is essential. Lately, the application of microwave (MW) irradiation for waste processing has been attracting interest globally. MW-assisted heating possesses several advantages such as the provision of high microwave energy into dielectric materials with deeper penetration for internal heat generation, showing beneficial features in improving the heating rate and reducing the reaction time. Consequently, the most recent literature regarding the applications of MW-assisted heating for biomass pretreatment as well as biofuel and bioenergy production was reviewed and consolidated in this study. An impressive increase in the product yield and improvement of the product properties are reported, with the use of MW-assisted heating in several conversion routes to produce biofuels. Despite being a promising technology for biofuel production, some major fundamental data of MW-assisted heating have not been comprehensively identified. Therefore, the feasibility of this technology for large-scale implementation is still subpar. Understanding the interaction between the feedstock and the microwave electromagnetic field, and the optimization of several operational and mechanical parameters are the two main keystones that would propel the industrialization of MW heating in the near future. This provides key insights leading to increased feasibility and more advanced application of MW heating."
pub.1018151757,Global assessment of research and development for algae biofuel production and its potential role for sustainable development in developing countries,"The possibility of economically deriving fuel from cultivating algae biomass is an attractive addition to the range of measures to relieve the current reliance on fossil fuels. Algae biofuels avoid some of the previous drawbacks associated with crop-based biofuels as the algae do not compete with food crops. The favourable growing conditions found in many developing countries has led to a great deal of speculation about their potentials for reducing oil imports, stimulating rural economies, and even tackling hunger and poverty. By reviewing the status of this technology we suggest that the large uncertainties make it currently unsuitable as a priority for many developing countries. Using bibliometric and patent data analysis, we indicate that many developing countries lack the human capital to develop their own algae industry or adequately prepare policies to support imported technology. Also, we discuss the potential of modern biotechnology, especially genetic modification (GM) to produce new algal strains that are easier to harvest and yield more oil. Controversy surrounding the use of GM and weak biosafety regulatory system represents a significant challenge to adoption of GM technology in developing countries. A range of policy measures are also suggested to ensure that future progress in algae biofuels can contribute to sustainable development."

Increasing global demand leads to depletion of natural resources, continued expansion of population globally, and industrialized economy. Primary energy demand has grown that increased gas and oil production. Increased consumption of imported oil possibly will impede economic growth. Alternative energy production is a prominent issue in the research and development market due to the increased demand for fossil fuels and the resultant impact of global warming challenges. Bioenergy derived from biomass is a long-term alternative energy source that has acquired significant support in various sectors, including government laws, industry, and the public sector. It requires support from the government, the general public, industry, and research to ensure its long-term existence. Manufacturing processes, including chemical conversion, that is an inexpensive process, large-scale production of biofuels, have not been well explored and explained in this chapter.

pub.1165050613,Future bioenergy source by microalgae–bacteria consortia: a circular economy approach,"Future sustainable approach of bioenergy production that uses microalgae–bacteria consortium to produce bioelectricity and biofuel for industrial and daily activities.
The potentiality of microalgae–bacteria consortia applied in a circular economy is acknowledged and explored; however, the commercialization of biofuel from microbial technology remains complex and controversial regarding the practicability of the technology. This review provides a concise and comprehensive analysis of various extraction techniques of the microalgae-bacteria consortium, algae cultivation methods, and biofuel production processes. The conversion processes are critically reviewed along with the challenges faced to lay the foundation of in-depth microalgae–bacteria biotechnology. The yield of biohydrogen produced and the lipid content of the obtained biomass can be greatly improved through the cultivation of a microalgae–bacteria consortium compared to the pure culture of microalgae. The consumption of nutrients in wastewater by the microalgae–bacteria consortium protects the environment as the effluent returned to nature is of minimum toxicity. The symbiotic relationship between microalgae and bacteria has enhanced the lipid productivity of biomass in previous studies. In contrast to other recent reviews, the linkage of the circular economy with the microalgae–bacteria consortium was critically reviewed and discussed. Uncertainties under culturing conditions and techno-economics are the concerns and factors that impede the development of microalgae–bacteria consortia in energy commercialization."
pub.1167918183,Biomass Resources and Biofuel Technologies: A Focus on Indian Development,"As a result of the depletion of fossil resources, ongoing population growth, and the industrialized economy, energy demand has been rising quickly throughout the world. India is now the world’s third-largest oil consumer, surpassing Japan and Russia. Today, biofuel research is conducted worldwide because surrounding two essential characteristics: sustainability and renewability. Biofuels have gained considerable significance as a result of dwindling oil sources, worries about energy security, and the escalating environmental issues associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In most cases, biofuels are produced by subjecting materials that have been densified to the process of heat conversion. In the disciplines of research and development, alternative energy development is a top focus. Due to the depletion of fossil fuel resources, it has become important to find innovative replacements for fossil fuels, such as biofuels, to generate heat and power. Biofuels may be generated using several methodologies, encompassing biological, chemical, and physical approaches. The three steps of densification systems’ pre-, during-, and post-pelletization procedures convert biomass into pellets. Several agricultural wastes, such as grain dust, crop leftovers, and fruit tree residues, are available as sources of agricultural energy. Bioenergy from biomass, such as leftovers and energy crops, can be used to produce contemporary energy carriers.

pub.1018849952,Global principles for sustainable biofuel production and trade,"This article examines international attempts to regulate the production of and trade in biofuels by establishing criteria and indicators and certification schemes. It focuses on the norms underlying the criteria and the community constructed on the basis of them. The theoretical approach here rests on a discussion of these norms and on their constitutive role. This role creates a community and gives an institutional basis for the global public domain. Accordingly, different norms create the network on which environmental governance is based. It is assumed that commonly accepted criteria form a common norm. The article analyses eleven criteria and indicator systems and compares the criteria adopted. Eight were created for biofuels and bioenergy and three are used in forest certification. Comparison reveals that the criterion aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is used in Northern systems, whereas commonly accepted environmental criteria are biodiversity and minimization of pollution. The web of norms on which biofuel production and trade is based comprises environmental norms together with the general norm of sovereignty and the norms of the market economy."

The natural products from algae have attained significant attention owing to their extraordinary efficiency which makes them suitable for a plethora of application as biofuels, waste water remediation agents, therapeutics, food and feed, nutraceuticals, biocontrol agents, and aquaculture. Despite the huge potential of algae, studies are limited owing to the fact the difficulties in isolation and cultivation, the significant impact of nutrients, contaminants, and sessional variations. Waste waters tend to act as a source of nutrients, thereby facilitating the growth of algae, which in turn quench the excessive nutrients and heavy metals leading to the phycoremediation of waste waters. Algae can produce a plethora of biofuels including biodiesel, biogas, and bioethanol to name a few. This chapter elaborates the potential of algae biomass as a renewable feedstock for biofuel production and their further utilisation as a promising source of nutraceuticals and high-value products, which can be a sustainable solution making the best out of waste for a better global environment and economy."
pub.1058252809,Macroalgae and their potential for biofuel.,"Abstract Green technologies are in demand worldwide to meet the fuel needs of the increasing population together with combating global warming. Although biofuels from conventional energy crops and lignocellulosic biomass can substitute for fossil fuels, there is much controversy over questions raised regarding impacts on food supply and security and their cost effectiveness. A high photosynthetic efficiency and production rate confer algae with attractive credentials for third-generation biofuels. Algae (both microalgae and macroalgae) represent an economical and environmentally sustainable renewable source of biomass for the production of biofuels. Algal biofuels are attractive in that they do not compromise food supplies and arable land. Microalgae have hitherto received more attention than macroalgae. Nevertheless, the latter can also serve as a viable option for biofuel generation. Carbohydrates obtained from macroalgal biomass can be used for fermentative production of bioethanol. Macroalgal biomass can store large amounts of oil which can be exploited for the production of biodiesel. Methane and hydrogen can readily be produced from macroalgal biomass through biologically mediated degradation. The biorefinery approach, integrating bioprocessing and low-environmental-impact chemical technologies, would be more pertinent in effecting maximum and efficient utilization of macroalgal biomass through the generation of diverse products from a single biomass feedstock. This review encompasses the potential and prospects of macroalgae as sources for biofuels and the role of biorefinery approach in invigorating macroalgal fuel economy."
pub.1154915754,New Chemical Processes aimed at Sustainable Development in Brazil,"Agriculture has an important role in many countries and especially in developing countries. More than 3billion people (almost half the world's population) live in rural areas, of whom 2.5billion derive their livelihoods from agriculture. Almost three-quarters of the world's added-value agricultural products are generated in developing countries, where this sector contributes substantially to their gross domestic product. Until the 1990s, agriculture was seen as a means of producing food. However, with the increase in global energy demand, plus the fact that the current oil-based economy was not able to supply a healthy, safe and sustainable way of life, it was shown that agricultural products could supply a unique set of energy and chemical alternatives in both the short and the long term. In this context, Brazil has shown that it can contribute significantly to the supplying of renewable feedstocks, bioenergy, biofuels and chemicals, and also new and sustainable technologies. The Brazilian experience with energy from renewable feedstocks started in 1970s with its national alcohol programme (Proálcool) based on sugarcane. However, it was not until the 2000s that the quantities of biofuels increased considerably and today Brazil is recognized as a world leader in this field. Not only has biofuels production increased significantly in recent years, but the production of biochemicals (organic acids, amino acids, polymers and solvents) based on sugarcane has also seen a significant growth."

Sustainable agriculture is a discipline that addresses current issues such as climate change, increasing food and fuel prices, poor-nation starvation, rich-nation obesity, water pollution, soil erosion, fertility loss, pest control, and biodiversity depletion. Novel, environmentally-friendly solutions are proposed based on integrated knowledge from sciences as diverse as agronomy, soil science, molecular biology, chemistry, toxicology, ecology, economy, and social sciences. Indeed, sustainable agriculture decipher mechanisms of processes that occur from the molecular level to the farming system to the global level at time scales ranging from seconds to centuries. For that, scientists use the system approach that involves studying components and interactions of a whole system to address scientific, economic and social issues. In that respect, sustainable agriculture is not a classical, narrow science. Instead of solving problems using the classical painkiller approach that treats only negative impacts, sustainable agriculture treats problem sources. Because most actual society issues are now intertwined, global, and fast-developing, sustainable agriculture will bring solutions to build a safer world. This book series gathers review articles that analyze current agricultural issues and knowledge, then propose alternative solutions. It will therefore help all scientists, decision-makers, professors, farmers and politicians who wish to build a safe agriculture, energy and food system for future generations."
pub.1125082903,A multi-objective robust optimization model to design sustainable sugarcane-to-biofuel supply network: the case of study,"Nowadays, oil price fluctuation, fossil fuel depletion, and the potential environmental impact of these energy resources are highly threatening the global economy. Developing renewable resources, hence, is quite unavoidable. Sugarcane, as a source of renewable energy, can be converted to bioethanol. Therefore, this study has proposed a mixed-integer linear programming to design an international network of the sugarcane-to-biofuel supply chain. To deal with uncertainty, the robust optimization approach is employed in order to maximize the profit earned from the bioethanol sales at the foreign/domestic markets, minimize the environmental impacts caused by these supply chain activities, and maximize this network generated employment. The multi-echelon supply chain model involves different production/storage capacities, bio-refineries technologies, and transportation modes. This supply chain configuration has specified the optimal production capacity/technology, the appropriate transportation mode in each route, and the bio-refineries’ development capacities. The biofuel export price and the domestic/foreign markets’ demands are among the SC uncertain parameters addressed through the robust possibilistic programming. Finally, the tri-objective model has been solved using an approach that considers the decision maker’s preferences; the model performance has been verified by a case study performed in Iran. To verify the robust model’s efficiency, the DLP realization model is also formulated.Graphical abstractThe structure of global sugarcane-to-biofuel supply chain network."
pub.1139876618,Conversion of biomass to biofuels and life cycle assessment: a review,"The global energy demand is projected to rise by almost 28% by 2040 compared to current levels. Biomass is a promising energy source for producing either solid or liquid fuels. Biofuels are alternatives to fossil fuels to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Nonetheless, policy decisions for biofuels should be based on evidence that biofuels are produced in a sustainable manner. To this end, life cycle assessment (LCA) provides information on environmental impacts associated with biofuel production chains. Here, we review advances in biomass conversion to biofuels and their environmental impact by life cycle assessment. Processes are gasification, combustion, pyrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis routes and fermentation. Thermochemical processes are classified into low temperature, below 300 °C, and high temperature, higher than 300 °C, i.e. gasification, combustion and pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is promising because it operates at a relatively lower temperature of up to 500 °C, compared to gasification, which operates at 800–1300 °C. We focus on 1) the drawbacks and advantages of the thermochemical and biochemical conversion routes of biomass into various fuels and the possibility of integrating these routes for better process efficiency; 2) methodological approaches and key findings from 40 LCA studies on biomass to biofuel conversion pathways published from 2019 to 2021; and 3) bibliometric trends and knowledge gaps in biomass conversion into biofuels using thermochemical and biochemical routes. The integration of hydrothermal and biochemical routes is promising for the circular economy."
pub.1122585724,Research and Production of Second‐Generation Biofuels,"The global demand for fossil fuels is very high, but their use is not sustainable since its reserves are declining. Additionally, fossil fuels are responsible for the generation and accumulation of greenhouse gases. Thus, renewable fuels capable of sequestering carbon dioxide are in high demand. The production of first‐generation biofuels from conventional fuel crops competes with food for arable land while producing low yields. The use of food crops like sugarcane, grains, and vegetable oils as biofuels may cause a threat to the food security system. Thus, there has been a great demand for the production of second‐generation biofuels, which require lignocellulosic biomass as nonedible feedstocks that can be converted to sugar from which bioethanol can be produced. The emission of greenhouse gases from the transport sector can be reduced by substituting fossil fuels by biofuels. Second‐generation biofuels can utilize nonarable land and consume waste products. Research on second‐generation biofuels has emerged mainly in the developed and some developing countries like India, China, and Brazil. This chapter describes research and production of second‐generation biofuels. A mixture of many oxygenated hydrocarbons comprise the feedstocks. Thus ,the removal of oxygen becomes a necessity for converting it to a high‐quality fuel by different routes such as catalytic cracking and hydrodeoxygenation. The most significant issue of a green economy is the application of gaseous fuels obtained from lignocellulosic mass for sale, subject to the renewable fuel standard. Private industrial investments and research funds should merge for the commercial production of biofuels at a cheaper rate."

Innovation ecosystems are the evolving interconnected sets of actors, activities, artefacts, and institutions who are vital to the innovative performances of single actors or actor groups consisting largely of firms in the products and services sector. To develop sustainable CE ecosystems, participating firms need to involve the consumers and users in their innovation processes. The automotive industry is to a large extent an industry in which incorporating customer requirements in product development is critical to success. In addition, growing expectations and growing awareness of environmental issues drive the industry to develop environmentally friendly products. However, CE solutions and, specifically, sustainable tyres have not yet been given due consideration. Likewise, the specific preferences of the end-users of sustainability-focused cars such as electric vehicles (EVs) and users of biofuels are unknown in the CE context so far. Based on the current state of research, this article addresses an important, unexplored topic of product circularity. Being the first article on consumer interests and active contributions to CE automotive products, it also extends the first articles on CE software products. A survey of 168 traditional car owners (no EV/biofuels users), 29 users of biofuels, and 40 EV affine consumers was conducted in Germany to create an empirical foundation for the specification of CE configuration software for sustainable automotive products, particularly sustainable tyres. The results show different preferences among these user groups, but also the importance of other characteristics not captured by the distinction by car ownership. In particular, the perception of climate change and the use of test reports or rating portals were variables that had significant influence on configuration preferences."
pub.1148411908,"8 Wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater utilization in the production of microalgae-based fuels","Biofuel production from microalgae is affected by the cost of the cultivation of microalgal biomass. The cultivation of microalgae for third-generation biofuels in wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater could be a cost-effective way to obtain microalgal biomass. This option would serve to reduce costs and treat wastewaters and reclaimed water at the same time. Autotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation make use of wastewater and nutrients, using light and CO2 to obtain high percentages of nitrogen and phosphorous removal. The advantage of microalgae grown in this way is twofold: wastewater treatment and microalgal production without the addition of water and nutrients. Biofuels from microalgae grown in this way would replace fossil fuels with renewable and carbon-neutral fuels in a sustainable way and contribute to the circular economy of water resources. In this review, an updated evaluation of microalgal cultivation in wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater together with biofuel generation will be shown."
pub.1166093710,Assessing the interrelationship between fossil fuels resources and the biomass energy market for achieving a sustainable and green economy,"This study examines a path to carbon neutrality by analyzing the connections between fossil fuels, biomass energy, green growth, and innovation. Using Chinese data from 1970 to 2020 and an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, we found a positive relationship between biofuel use and agricultural bio-energy growth in the short and long term. We also found that reducing fossil fuel dependence boosts bio-energy cultivation. The study suggests China can transition to environmentally friendly energy sources, such as biofuels, by reducing reliance on fossil fuels like coal, in line with the carbon neutrality goal set by the Chinese government."
pub.1174434574,Waste Biomass Supply Chain for Sustainable Bioenergy Production,"The advancement of ecologically benign, renewable, and sustainable alternative energy sources is vital for the current global economic theories. The largest source of renewable energy, bioenergy podia advance the economy and the circular economy by serving as a strategic component. To fulfill the expanding demands of humanity, biomass materials such as agricultural products, alcohol fuels industrial waste, landfill gas, solid waste, and wood have attracted interest for use in the synthesis of biofuels. The energy generated from biomass is less harmful to the environment, inexpensive, readily accessible locally in great quantities, and offers job opportunities for employees in diverse global boundaries. Sustainability, the decline in emissions of greenhouse gases and an upsurge in manufacturing jobs are the benefits of using renewable sources to manufacture energy, chemicals, and fuels. These elements promote the development of local economic and social systems. The current chapter focuses on the availability of numerous waste biomass materials and their characteristics as viable renewable energy sources. The analysis also includes the current state of the world's energy supply, the need for sustainable alternative energy sources, established and developing technologies for biomass conversion, and the circular economy of waste biomass management. From the review, it is possible to infer that utilizing cost-effective sources for implementation in energy platforms and biofuels will increase the competitiveness of bio-based companies and boost the economics of existing value chains. Understanding the characteristics of biomass materials enables us to determine the best approach to use them for energy in the future and cut down on our reliance on fossil fuels."
pub.1169751436,Conversion of Sewage Sludge into Biofuels via Different Pathways and Their Use in Agriculture: A Comprehensive Review,"The valorisation of sewage sludge for sustainable agricultural use and biofuel production proposes an effective and beneficial management of sewage sludge in a closed-loop cycle. The management of sewage sludge biowaste is a rising problem due to increasing waste storage expenses. In this sense, the use of circular economy principles in sewage sludge management creates opportunities to develop new technologies for processing. The biorefinery model allows the application of wasteless technologies via sewage sludge valorisation in terms of agricultural use and biofuel production, especially with the hydrothermal carbonisation method. Applying hydrothermal carbonisation in the treatment of biosolid sewage sludge has numerous benefits due to processing highly hydrated organic waste into carbon hydro char, a high-quality solid biofuel. The direct use of sewage sludge in the soil does not allow for full use of its functional properties. However, the hydrothermal carbonisation of sewage sludge results in biocarbon pellets, making it a viable approach. This work also discusses the barriers (legal, chemical, biological, and technical) and possibilities related to sewage sludge biorefining processes."
pub.1139115976,Food waste disposal and utilization in the United States: A spatial cost benefit analysis,"Food waste is generated from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources, and is conventionally disposed of in landfills. To nurture the development of a circular economy for food waste, its valorization by technologies that create fuels, power, or products is being investigated. These technologies offer the potential to dispose food waste while generating sustainable resources. While some literature exists on the economics of food waste utilization options, no existing study simultaneously characterizes different facility scales and locations across many food waste pathways. This study develops a series of cost-benefit models that depict the economic favorability of several food waste management pathways by state: landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion, incineration, and biofuels production via hydrothermal liquefaction. Economic favorability primarily depends on the local tipping (gate) fee charged by the facility; however, additional revenue streams realized from the sale of biofuels, biopower, or bioproducts can reduce this dependence. Local market prices for biofuels, biopower, or bioproducts generated from food waste determine the profitability of technologies that generate these products. The magnitude of these revenue streams depends on local market factors and the economies of scale leveraged for large facilities. Significant spatial variability in these results exists across the United States, driven by the differences in tipping fees, O&M costs (e.g., labor rates), and product market prices. This study supports decision-making by industry, state, and local governments, as well as furthering research in the area of sustainable utilization of food waste."

This strategy coincides with SDGs 7 and 12, which promote clean energy along with ethical consumerism, by converting waste cooking oil into biofuel. It reduces dependency on fossil fuels, reduces emissions, and promotes sustainable energy sources. Furthermore, using WCO biodiesel adheres to the circular economy concept, reducing waste and pollution while conserving resources (SDGs 12, 14, and 15). To optimize this process, a hybrid technique comprising RSM, ANOVA, and particle swarm optimization is being explored. Researchers achieved 90% biodiesel production employing this technology, encouraging both eco-friendly energy and resource-efficient practices. The optimized parameters produced remarkable results: 82.98% biodiesel generation with a reaction time of 101 minutes, 2% catalyst, and a methanol-to-oil ratio of 20%, demonstrating the potential of this integrated strategy. "

pub.1153330919,"Microalgal-Based Bioenergy: Strategies, Prospects, and Sustainability","The fuel crisis with the slumping reserves of fossil fuels and the exponential increase in the demand of energy necessitate a paradigm shift to a more sustainable and eco-friendly energy system. Microalgal biofuel has been recognized as one of the most prominent and versatile alternative renewable energy sources because it can be converted into a wide array of biofuels, such as biodiesel, bioethanol, bioelectricity and biogases such as syngas, methane, hydrogen, and hythane etc., with a lower carbon emission profile. To attain the economic viability of algal fuels, a collective biorefinery approach addressing both the operational and technical limitations is quintessential. The current review critically analyzes and categorizes energy aspects of microalgae through various direct and indirect approaches with the perspective of a circular economy. These approaches include complicated thermochemical and biochemical processes integrating the recovery of a wide range of value-added products apart from biofuels, thus defining a cascading approach for a multi-product-based biorefinery model. A glimpse of recent technological advancements comprising hybrid cultivation systems, prospects of co-culturing, and the role of automated/modeling approaches in the industrial-scale production of “algal-based bioenergy” is also discussed in detail. Further, the review has also scrutinized and highlighted the developments and bottlenecks in genetic and molecular aspects of strain improvement for bioenergy production. Furthermore, the study also correlated the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of producing this green energy by evaluating the prospects and pitfalls to obtain a holistic picture on this alternative fuel for a bio-based sustainable economy."
pub.1086187497,"4 Biofuels Technology, economics, and policy issues","Although in the present day fossil fuels account for over 80.3% of the primary energy consumed in the world, their inherent finitude renders them unreliable resources. Moreover, the threat of climate change associated with the rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the consequent concerns for the long-term environmental sustainability of the current economic model has contributed to the emergence of the idea that modern society should move toward a biobased circular economy following an imminent paradigm shift. Research on biofuels is part of this new model, taking into consideration economic, social, environmental, and policy issues that are at stake. In this chapter, we attempt to address this challenging task by trying to understand where we stand (both from a technological and economic point of view) on the way toward this paradigm shift, and how policy and regulation drivers impact on this transition toward a sustainable economy."
pub.1096465532,Policies and Instruments Affecting Water Use for Bioenergy Production,"Bioenergy related water use intensifies existing water stress, increasing the importance of sustainable management of water resources for sustainable bioenergy production and use. This paper discusses policies and instruments of importance for water use for bioenergy production, considering both biomass production and the subsequent conversion to solid/liquid/gaseous fuels and electricity. Water policies on the biomass production side should focus on ensuring efficient water use. While environmental policy instruments such as command-and-control approaches support maintaining specific water quantities and quality standards for biofuel production, market-based tools can help users to identify least-cost options for biofuel operation. For the energy conversion side, water quality is the key issue that needs to be addressed with adequate policy instruments. Finally, the evaluation of water-use policies and instruments for bioenergy production should not only relate to their direct impacts on water use, but should take into account overall impacts on the economy."
pub.1126839758,Valorization of Biomass Residues from Forest Operations and Wood Manufacturing Presents a Wide Range of Sustainable and Innovative Possibilities,"Purpose of ReviewFor the past few decades, consumers have increasingly demanded biodegradable, petroleum-free, and safe products for the environment, humans, and animals, with improved performance. In terms of energy consumption, modern society has progressively sought to reduce fossil fuel utilization and greenhouse gas emissions. This review presents and discusses the possibilities of using biomass residues that are derived from forest operations and wood manufacturing to produce biofuels and biomaterials as sustainable alternatives that could boost the development of renewable technologies and bio-economy.Recent FindingsForest biomass residues are composed primarily of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in varying proportions depending upon the species. Residues from forest operations have heterogeneous compositions due to the presence of branches, foliage, tree tops, and bark, compared with those derived from wood manufacturing industries. Several technological approaches have been developed to add value to forest biomass residues through their conversion to biomaterials such as wood-based composite panels, wood-plastic composites, wood pellets, and biofuels, such as biochar, bio-oil, syngas (thermochemical approach), and biogas (biochemical approach).SummaryForest biomass residues are valuable lignocellulosic materials, but research is still required regarding their conversion into value-added products given their heterogeneous compositions and varied physicochemical properties. Obstacles such as transportation costs and their complex structural and chemical mechanisms that resist decomposition need to be better overcome in developing high-quality and economically viable biofuels and biomaterials. In contrast, wood-based panels, composites, pellets, and biofuels produced by the wood manufacturing industries exhibit superior properties and characteristics for commercialization. Recent studies regarding valorization of forest biomass residues are a welcome recognition of the need to transition to a sustainable economy, and a definitive strategy for achieving objectives that have been set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

Technologies are being developed and improved to optimize the use of abundant biomass and to generate several value-added products. Efficient nutrient recovery requires additional energy-intensive steps for effective valorization. Moreover, appropriate waste collection and pretreatment practices increase the degree of valorization. The use of biomass waste in biorefineries has significant potential to yield biofuels and organic fertilizers. Further research and development are required to develop effective biorefining technologies to enable the efficient exploitation of bioresources. Greater consideration should be applied to energy pathways to support this technology. Therefore, there is a demand for innovation in the integrated biorefining approach in response to changing markets, and novel commercial models should be introduced into the circular economy."

pub.1044186902,Sustainable Capital? The Neoliberalization of Nature and Knowledge in the European “Knowledge-based Bio-economy”,"As an EU policy agenda, the “knowledge-based bio-economy” (KBBE) emphasizes bio-technoscience as the means to reconcile environmental and economic sustainability. This frames the sustainability problem as an inefficiency to be overcome through a techno-knowledge fix. Here ecological sustainability means a benign eco-efficient productivity using resources which are renewable, reproducible and therefore sustainable. The KBBE narrative has been elaborated by European Technology Platforms in the agri-food-forestry-biofuels sectors, whose proposals shape research priorities. These inform policy agendas for the neoliberalization of both nature and knowledge, especially through intellectual property. In these ways, the KBBE can be understood as a new political-economic strategy for sustainable capital. This strategy invests great expectations for unlocking the productive potential of natural resources through a techno-knowledge fix. Although eco-efficiency is sometimes equated with biological productivity, commercial success will be dependent upon new combinations of “living” and “dead” labour."

The “green economy” idea has presented this context with a chance to alter how society handles the interplay between the environmental and economic spheres. The related concept of “green nanotechnology” aims to use nano-innovations within the fields of materials science and engineering to generate products and processes that are economically and ecologically sustainable, enabling society to establish and preserve a green economy. Many different economic sectors are anticipated to be impacted by these applications, including those related to corrosion inhibitor nanofertilizers, nanoremediation, biodegradation, heavy metal detection, biofuel, insecticides and pesticides, and catalytic CO2 reduction. These innovations might make it possible to use non-traditional water sources safely and to create construction materials that are enabled by nanotechnology, improving living and ecological conditions.

pub.1138062302,Does the green economy really foster food security in Sub-Saharan Africa?,"Over the last decade, the green economy concept has emerged as a fundamental policy framework for sustainable development in developing countries. This paper contributes to the current debate by providing an empirical investigation of the effect of the green economy on food security in 35 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period of 2001–2015. The results provide evidence that green economy indicators have controversial effects on food security (food availability and the proportion of undernourished people). Indeed, the results show that biofuels contribute to decreased food security in Sub-Saharan African countries, whereas renewable energy improves food security. Carbon dioxide emissions have no effect on food security. The results are robust to alternative robustness checks, such as the two-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) system."
pub.1103269759,Assessing Social Sustainability for Biofuel Supply Chains: The Case of Aviation Biofuel in Brazil,"Aviation fuels derived from biomass are generally perceived as sustainable alternatives compared with their fossil counterparts. However, the production of jet biofuels will have impacts on environment, economy and society simultaneously. Despite that a large number of studies have evaluated environmental impacts or techno-economic feasibility of aviation biofuels, very few studies took social aspects into consideration. Thus, this study seeks to provide a social sustainability evaluation for aviation biofuels with a supply chain perspective. Three potential jet biofuel supply chains, based on different feedstocks, i.e. sugarcane, eucalyptus and macauba, were analyzed in the context of Brazil. The assessment is performed mainly with a process-based approach combined with input-output analysis. A set of social sustainability issues, including employment, working condition, labor right, gender equity and social development, were evaluated in a quantitative manner. The results show the three supply chains lead to differentiated levels of social effects. The macauba-based supply chain generates the highest number of jobs and highest GDP value, whereas the eucalyptus-based supply chain offers more employment opportunities for women. In comparison, the sugarcane-based supply chain has relatively moderate social effects. For future work, the assessment of social sustainability needs to cover a wider range of social issues, in order to extend the comprehension of social sustainability regarding biofuels. Additional research is suggested to bridge the methodological gaps in social sustainability assessment."
pub.1086154115,Plant Biomass as Biofuels,"Abstract   Sustainable and renewable fuel sources are imperative to maintain future global commerce, mobility and economic prosperity, to alleviate current dependency on fossil fuels and to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from combustion in vehicles. Plant biomass and its derivatives represent an abundant carbon source for the production of biobased alternatives to petroleum‐based transport fuel. The production of first‐generation biofuels is currently the most advanced, with bioethanol being manufactured commercially in many countries. However, the major disadvantage of first‐generation biofuels is that they introduce competition for land on which human food crops are grown. Second‐generation biofuels from lignocellulose address this issue, but their production is not yet fully commercial. Advanced biofuels from algae are an alternative biofuel technology currently in the early stages of development. Minimising renewable plant biomass feedstock cost, improving biomass feedstock yields, establishing efficient, coordinated processes for carbon neutral commercial production and changing policy in favour of developing existing and future biofuel technologies are some of the challenges that must be overcome before biofuels can become competitive with fossil fuels.   Key Concepts    Global prosperity is closely linked to transport of goods and people; however, for practical, political and environmental reasons, the combustion of fossil fuels is not sustainable. Biofuels offer an alternative that is minimally disruptive to the existing infrastructure at this early stage in the transition towards a biobased economy.   Biofuels are mainly derived from plants and are characterised according to the source of the plant material used in their production; ‘first‐generation’ (1G) biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) are derived from the fermentation of sugar‐ or transesterification of oil‐rich food crops; ‘second‐generation’ (2G) biofuels come from plant biomass that is not suitable for human or animal consumption, such as straw, wood, energy crops or inedible plant oils; ‘advanced biofuels’ are generated by microbes, notably, oleaginous yeasts or microalgae, where the microbe does not convert the substrate to fuel but is the immediate source of the fuel.   Advanced biofuels can further be classified as ‘third generation’ if they are made by naturally occurring microbes or ‘fourth generation’ if the biofuels are produced by synthetic biology in engineered microbes.   First‐generation ethanol and biodiesel are relatively simple to produce and used in fuel blends throughout the world.   Lignocellulose (LC) forms the structure of plant cell walls and is the most abundant natural polymer on the Earth but is very resistant to degradations; to produce 2G ethanol, lignocellulosic biomass must be pretreated to release the sugars, which are then fermented to ethanol.   Advanced biofuels are largely at the experimental phase of development.   Whatever the source, biofuels"
pub.1000208302,Environmental Impacts of Biofuel Production in Africa,"Although total bioethanol production in Africa in 2006 was less than 500 million litres, the potential is considered high. South Africa and East Africa alone are estimated to have an annual potential of 7.3 and 1.3 billion litres, respectively. In addition, there is intense interest in biodiesel with large-scale projects being developed across the continent. The land considered for biofuels is significant, estimated at 5.5 million hectares, some of which will be located in fragile ecosystems and in ecologically sensitive environments. In Mali, Ghana, Sudan, Ethiopia and Madagascar, up to 2.5 million hectares of land has already been allocated to foreign investors for biofuel production. The motivating policy goals for biofuels production and the high degree of biodiversity and diverse climatic conditions notwithstanding, increased production, different agricultural practices especially on highly degraded land due to long-term agricultural mismanagement portend key environmental issues associated with land requirements and farming systems, conversion technologies and scale of operation. Impacts include destruction of habitats and biodiversity, deforestation, and declining water quantity and quality. Whilst these impacts may not be apparent in Africa, they present important researchable questions for planning as Africa gears for increased participation in the international biofuels markets. Tools to define and assess areas suitable for sustainable biofuels production exist, and should be used by governments to include biofuels into an overall energy, climate, land-use, water and agricultural strategy. This shall benefit society, the economy and the environment as a whole."
pub.1160714739,Holistic and integrated life cycle sustainability assessment of prospective biomass to liquid production in Germany,"As a part of the developing bioeconomy, liquid biofuels may play an important role for transportation due to the hope for a sustainable drop-in alternative to substitute fossil fuels and maintaining existing economic infrastructures. In this case study we applied Holistic and Integrated Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment to a prospective technical concept for the production of biofuels from wood residues, sorghum and straw via gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis located in the German federal state Brandenburg. Through this quantitative and qualitative sustainability assessment we identified synergies and hot-spots of biofuel production on a detailed and aggregated level, as well as compare the impacts to fossil fuels and other alternative transport systems. 99 social, ecological and economic indicator results addressing 14 out of 17 SDGs show contributions but also sustainability risks of such biofuels for the SDGs. The total substitution factor of impacts (f = 21.38) for all indicators of biofuels compared to fossil fuels indicates significantly higher impacts of biofuels production, in particular for land (SDG 15, f = 30.43), water (SDG 14, f = 125.57), consumption and production patterns (SDG 12, f = 54.11), low energy efficiency and maintaining problematic global supply chains and working conditions. However, the impacts on climate can be lower (SDG 13, f = 0.42), if residual heat is effectively and efficiently used. Comparing the transportation systems and use phases of fuels, all types of car-based individual transportation including fossil fuels (f = 6.50), biofuels (f = 9.16) and electric drive (f = 6.46) had significant higher impacts than transportation by train. Besides technological downsides, such as the high energy demand, biofuels may play a minor role for specific applications with no other alternative energy technologies in the future. In conclusion, it is very questionable whether such liquid biofuels are a suitable drop-in solution to substitute fossil fuels in a significant quantity. In a final discussion we referred to the necessary societal-ecological transformation with structural changes of production, consumption, political economy and global supply chains. In the future, Holistic and Integrated Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment will be further improved by closing indicator and database gaps, including a cost analysis and direct stakeholder participation, as well as absolute sustainability assessments on how much biofuel production is sustainable."

Bioenergy and biofuels have the capability to combat these issues; however, food security and capacity limitations are major limitations of using first-generation biofuels, which utilize food crops containing sugars and starchy materials. Inexpensive and nonedible lignocellulosic wood materials may be alternatives for the generation of biofuels. The value-added biomaterials produced from woody biomass possess tremendous applications in food, bakery, pharmaceutical, textiles, and medical sectors. Moreover, lignocellulosic woody biomass is a promising feedstock for the production of biofuels and value-added products due to its abundance in huge amounts in developing countries like India. However, this biomass cannot be utilized directly as a feedstock due to its chemical complexity, and hence, it is recommended to pass it through a suitable pretreatment for easy extraction of fermentable sugars. Pretreatment and hydrolysis are two crucial steps, which help in the utilization of woody biomass for the synthesis of industrially important primary and secondary metabolites, which control the overall economy of the process. A low-cost pretreatment and hydrolysis steps would help to overcome economic and technical challenges faced by bioethanol refineries. This chapter describes the biofuel production and synthesis of value-added products like sugar alcohols, organic acids, industrial enzymes, and prebiotics using softwood and hardwood."
pub.1137350033,Bioconversion of Biowastes for Energy Applications,"The evolution from fossil energy to bioenergy economy demands the scientific breakthroughs and advancements in modern chemical manufacturing. For sustainability, the generation of chemicals and fuels must be originating from renewable resources. The white biotechnology, a technology that uses living cells such as bacteria, yeast, and fungi to produce degradable products, can deliver the essential enzymes for bioconversion of wastes into products that can be used for energy applications. Biowastes from various sources including industrial management (pulp, paper industry, and food industry), fruit and vegetable, animal (slaughterhouse waste), waste wood, and agriculture could be utilized as sustainable materials for nutrient-complete feedstock creation and biorefinery development. This chapter mainly emphasizes the possibility of utilizing biowastes from the existing waste management for the creation of chemicals, byproducts, and biofuels through various bioconversion processes. The first portion of the chapter deliberates the recent prominence and forecasts on feedstock creation of chemicals and biofuels. In the second part, the various sources of biowastes from existing waste management sectors and different bioconversion methods are systematically discussed. The third part presents the applications of biowastes for value-added products, chemicals, and biofuels. It is noticeable that the generation of compounds for chemical industries and biofuels for sustainable future via bioconversion of biowastes for energy applications is a significant research area with remarkable prospects for large-scale industrial production to meet the growing need for energy sustainably."
pub.1004869435,The Role of Biotechnology in Energy and Environment,"The replacement of fossil fuels with more carbon-neutral and renewable sources has become a key necessity of the time. The proposition that energy can be obtained from biomass with a decisively positive energy balance and at a scale sufficiently large to have a substantial impact on sustainability and security objectives is both supported by several recent studies. Developing a sustainable economy more extensively based on renewable carbon and eco-efficient bioprocesses is one of the key strategic challenges for the twenty-first century. First-generation biofuel production has increased significantly since 2000. However, the potential social, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels have been the subject of considerable controversy. The way to avoid the negative effects of producing biofuels from food supplies is to make lingo-cellulosic-derived fuels available within the shortest possible time. Second-generation biofuels is one strong option to ensure diversification in energy supply and sustainability. These are not yet produced commercially, but a considerable number of pilot and demonstration plants have been set up in recent years. This is because the manpower, investment, innovation and technology deployment are required on a vastly larger scale. A comprehensive approach involving plant breeders, agronomists, bioprocess engineers, biotechnologists and microbiologists is needed. Biotechnological approaches are likely the most powerful approach available to address the dual challenges of biomass recalcitrance and large-scale sustainable production."
pub.1175687813,Catalytic co-pyrolysis and kinetic study of microalgae biomass with solid waste feedstock for sustainable biofuel production,"Microalgae, while promising biofuel production, pose challenges in pyrolysis due to elevated moisture and protein levels, resulting in suboptimal fuel properties. Catalytic co-pyrolysis offers promising possibilities for sustainable resource utilization and waste management, generating bio-oil. This review explores biofuel production from co-pyrolysis of microalgae biomass, and waste feedstock, investigating reactor design, catalyst impact, and reaction mechanisms. Also, the investigation encompasses both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects, aiming to unravel the underlying reaction mechanisms and rate laws governing these processes. The kinetic studies provided vital information, laying the groundwork for optimizing reactor design and improving process conditions. Reactor selection is crucial for efficient processes, optimizing heat and mass transfer. Catalysts, especially Cu/HZSM-5, Ni–Mg/ZSM-5, CaO and Ce, enhances bio-oil quality and yield by reducing nitrogenous and oxygenated compounds and promoting high-value aromatics hydrocarbons. In co-pyrolysis, synergistic effects enhance bio-oil quality through interactions between acid and base catalysts. HCl presence during PVC co-pyrolysis with microalgae alters chemical profiles, influencing chlorine distribution in biochar and bio-oil. This research emphasizes comprehending optimal reactor design, catalyst dynamics, and reaction pathways for achieving efficiency, yield enhancements, and reduced environmental impacts. These advancements open doors towards producing valuable biofuels and chemicals from various microalgae biomass and plastic waste sources thereby contributing towards sustainability & circular economy practices in waste management."
pub.1158311499,An integrated approach to the sustainable development and production of biofuel from biopolymers and algal biomass derived from wastewater,"Production of sustainable energy has attracted researchers to solve the necessity of energy and the impact of fossil-based fuels on environment. Biofuels solve the demand for non-renewable based fuels and protects the environment from CO2 pollution. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be obtained from wastewater, plant sources and industrial activated sludge. As of now only P3HB is being used for producing HAME so research has to be done for using other monomers as a substrate by doing esterification of them. The production of biochar, bio-oil and synthesis gas from microalgae by pyrolysis has gained importance in present day. Yet further analysis is required to optimise the yield and enhance the quality of biochar and bio-oil. This review focuses the process involved in synthesis of biofuel from bio-based polymers and microalgae as it alleviates the issues of demand for fuel and emission of greenhouse gases from non-renewable fuel combustion. The universe is in the urge of relying more on circular economy-based research for the effective usage of available sources and proper waste management. Using a holistic algal bio-refinery for obtaining high value-added by-products might decrease wastes and create sustainable feedstock conversion into bioenergy. Algal biomass has also been offered as a potential candidate for CO2 absorption from the environment or as a potential industrial source."
pub.1008139343,Constructing Sustainable Biofuels: Governance of the Emerging Biofuel Economy,"In recent decades, new modes of governance have emerged in which an array of non-nation-state actors (NNSAs) drive norms and behaviors related to the production and consumption of goods and services with potentially large environmental and social impacts. These modes of governance are evident in the governance of biofuels, where intergovernmental organizations, national and subnational governments, corporations, and civil society organizations have recently developed an array of standards, metastandards, and codes of conduct attempting to define the conditions in which crops can be grown, processed, and used as fuel. Although the field is populated by dozens of efforts, a few binding state-sponsored regulations appear to dominate the major markets for biofuels in the United States and European Union. Nevertheless, existing regulations were heavily influenced by NNSAs. Further, several state-derived modes of governing take the form of metastandards that permit standards developed by NNSAs to be used in their place, resulting in a hybrid system of state and nonstate governance regimes. The regimes taking shape attempt to minimize the negative impacts of biofuel production in numerous ways; for example, by introducing penalties for production associated with direct and indirect land use change, crediting for the coproduction of livestock feed, and encouraging biofuel production on marginal lands. However, these issues are plagued by contradictions, raising questions about how sustainability is defined and assessed in the context of biofuel governance."

We use an approach grounded in agrarian political economy to critically analyze the literature on how biofuel policies interact with broader production, trade, and agro-ecological processes. We focus on policies involving the most prominent crops in the places where biofuel production has advanced the most (i.e. USA, Brazil, and the EU), but also extend analysis to their relations with broader transformations in production, commercial, and even governance practices around the world. We investigate the political and economic interests driving biofuel policies, and how these set the terms in which state interventions and policies are conceived and implemented. We find that these are not developed and implemented according to environmental or inclusive pro-poor development purposes, but according to state interests in energy security and its intersection with a tense alliance between corporate sectors, rendering many policy mechanisms ineffective or even outright counterproductive to effectively facilitate more socially and environmentally sustainable energy production and agricultural practices."

The current linear “take-make-discard” economic model is no longer sustainable for the survival of humanity. In this regard, agriculture and the production of food, fiber, feed, biofuel, and biological raw materials are generators of a large amount of waste and by-products such as crop residue, agro-industries, livestock, and aquaculture which are currently burned or buried in soil, without any previous treatment, causing pollution of soil, air, water, and contributing to the global warming. This missed biomass can be inputs for the bio-economy approaches due have a composition rich in macromolecules, nutrients, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity. For the design of strategies for sustainable exploitation, the circular economy and bio-economy are frameworks with objectives, goals, and strategies to close production cycles with zero waste-seeking material and energy integration. This chapter discusses the challenges and perspectives where the circular economy and bio-economy should be systematically addressed with decision-makers and analysis tools for the sustainable use of biomass from agricultural activities with novel technologies, and effective public policies with the participation of actors and stakeholders."
pub.1118097393,Chapter 1 Wheat,"Utilizing wheat by-products for value-added products is a critical step toward sustainable bio-based economics. Wheat straw is the main by-product obtained after wheat harvesting and utilization of these abundant but inexpensive materials as renewable resources for the industrial application such as straw particleboard fabrication, arabinoxylans extraction, and lignocellulosic biofuel production will pave a new road by turning agricultural wastes into valuable products and certainly bring additional avenues to the rural economy. Milling industry by-products wheat bran and germ contain important health-enhancing bioactive components such as phenolics, carotenoids, β-glucan, vitamins, and dietary fibers. Feedstock utilization could be optimized via the development of biorefinery concepts, in which high-value phytochemicals should be initially extracted followed by the thermochemical or biochemical conversion to produce biofuels or biochemicals. In addition, integration of cellulosic ethanol production and existing starch-based ethanol production via co-fermentation of wheat straw and wheat grain could boost ethanol concentration and yield, and consequently accelerate the commercialization of ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. Overall, upgrading the traditional industry into viable biorefineries for the production of biofuels, biochemicals, and biopolymers is essential to a sustainable and healthy bio-based society in order to substitute petrochemicals."
pub.1174699699,Preparation of Biofuel from Kitchen Waste Cooking Oil,"Moving toward a sustainable ecosystem requires the mitigation of the ecological impacts caused by various human activities. Energy generation is one such major activity as most of it is sourced from fossil fuels like coal and oil. Fossil fuel utilization serves as the prime source of atmospheric pollution as well, and their shortage is perpetually increasing their prices. Diesel is a major source of fuel for many industrial operations in major economies. This increases its demand to an extent where the procurement of diesel becomes challenging, especially for small-scale industries. The pollution caused by diesel can’t be controlled in this situation. Biofuels are among the promising alternatives to diesel fuels. The source material used for biofuel production is wood, biomass, vegetable oils, and waste cooking oils (WCOs). Using waste vegetable oil to synthesize biodiesel through transesterification will minimize the raw material cost. The conversion of waste vegetable oil contributes to solving major problems like energy security, pollution, and food security. In this study, biofuel is prepared from WCO, and the physiochemical properties and parameters were tested. It was discovered that the initial moisture content was 1.02%, and the process produced a 75% yield of biodiesel."

As the Chinese economy continues to develop, the government has made securing a reliable and secure energy supply one of its top priorities. A local biofuels business was evaluated by Beijing as a potential answer to the country's increasing oil imports, private automobile usage, and smog-related expenses."" This would not only lead to increased wages and employment opportunities in rural areas of the nation, but it would also provide alternate markets for grain. Renewable energy sources for transport have lately received a lot of support and encouragement in China. Based on official figures produced by the GSI, China supported biofuel production in 2006 to the tune of RMB 780 million, which is equivalent to US$ 115 million, or about US$ 0.40 per litre. The five licenced producers were offered a variety of incentives, including tax rebates, low-interest financing for capital investments, and direct payments connected to their production.

The first stage of the design of this empirical study involved establishing a focus group in order to construct and adjust a data collection instrument in the form of a questionnaire to be applied to a broader set of managers and informed professionals with a critical view of the country’s future and the models and alternatives to economic development and diversification of the economy on a sustainable basis. Energy plays a fundamental role in Angola’s economic and social development. Excessive dependency on the oil sector and inefficient production due to high costs, combined with changes in global environmental and energy policies, make it essential to reflect on the evolution of the country’s energy sector, equating a different economic development model, the diversification of the economy, and the exploration of other sources of energy, such as biofuels. Renewable energies emerge as a safe, healthy, environmentally friendly and economically viable energy alternative that could bring the Angolan economy closer to that of developed countries. Biofuels have become popular and have begun to be seen as a valid alternative to fossil fuels because they have lower production costs and they cause less impact on nature. Furthermore, since they are biodegradable, they can be commercialized at a lower cost from renewable sources. According to the respondents, the research results show that the best energy alternatives to reduce oil dependency are solar energy, biodiesel, hydraulic energy, and bioethanol. An assessment of the attractiveness and potential of biofuels show that the best alternative is bioethanol, followed by biodiesel."

To affect this major shift in energy use and fuel source in the near future, dramatic improvement in the efficiency of converting cellulose into biofuels will be a key step. Optimization of downstream fermentation and separation processes through microbial engineering and industrial technologies integration are clearly important steps that need to be taken. In addition, altering feedstock properties to facilitate cellulose breakdown to energy-rich sugars will also play an important role in minimizing the environmental and financial costs for biofuel production. With the rapid advances in genomics and molecular techniques in the past decade, the stage is set for the design and engineering of candidate feedstocks to endow them with specific traits or transgenes in order to facilitate their disassembly. In this chapter, we will concisely review and discuss the considerations and present status on the use of genetic engineering as an approach to modify plants for optimal biofuel production."

pub.1151412569,Sustainable Production of Biofuels Using Intensified Processes,"This book includes for first time the synthesis and intensified process design in the production of top biofuels. The production of biofuels is not new. In 2019, global biofuel production levels reached 1,841 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, in stark comparison to the 187 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day that was produced in 2000. Growth has largely been driven by policies that encourage the use and production of biofuels due to the perception that it could provide energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in relevant sectors. From a technical point of view, almost all fuels from fossil resources could be substituted by their bio-based counterparts. However, the cost of bio-based production in many cases exceeds the cost of petrochemical production. Also, biofuels must be proven to perform at least as good as the petrochemical equivalent they are substituting and to have a lower environmental impact. The low price of crude oil acted as a barrier to biofuels production and producers focussed on the specific attributes of biofuels such as their complex structure to justify production costs. Also, the consumer demand for environmentally friendly products, population growth and limited supplies of non-renewable resources has now opened new windows of opportunity for biofuels. The industry is increasingly viewing chemical production from renewable resources as an attractive area for investment. In this sense, the novelty and attractiveness of this book are that the application of process intensification techniques will be developed (a topic that has not been studied extensively in the bioprocess area so far) that will allow the generation of clean, efficient and economical processes for biofuels in a competitive way in the market."
pub.1147725107,Bio‐economy for sustainable growth in developing countries: The case of oil palm in Malaysia and Indonesia,"Abstract Malaysia and Indonesia are two vivid examples of economic development built upon land exploitation. The concept of ‘bio‐economy’ illustrates a pathway for countries to move on to a more sustainable course of development by creating added value downstream and diversifying away from primary production. Growing a local oleochemical industry was naturally the first step for Malaysia and Indonesia as the world's largest palm‐oil producers. This was extended to biofuel production, which first aimed for export revenues. The biofuel sector later became an important buffer for the palm‐oil industry to absorb excessive stock with domestic blending targets during low price periods. Meanwhile, the utilization of biomass for power generation has grown significantly for both exports and local use. Converting biomass into second‐generation biofuels and other advanced bio‐based materials has also attracted great interest from foreign investors. However, the high cost of biomass mobilization has limited the deployment of advanced biorefineries. One interesting option is to integrate waste management with the production of high‐value bioenergy and biomaterials, adopting the model of a multi‐feedstock biorefinery. While several bio‐based industrial clusters were set up to attract investment with the consolidation of infrastructure surrounding major ports, more effort is still needed to explore and identify feasible business models with optimized supply chains. Cross‐border cooperation may open new doors for building regional bio‐based value chains. The ongoing digital revolution may provide breakthroughs in chain integration and technology deployment. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Each country has its own Governmental policies, laws, and incentives that boost the course for the establishment of performing and sustainable processes. These facts have created the search for new economic and environmentally friendly processes to treat these subproducts before or concomitantly with biofuels production. This chapter presents different highly specific starchy and/or lignocellulosic biomass-degrading enzymes that have been specially developed to act as the main biocatalyzers for efficient liberation of sugars to be employed in biofuels production. The involved enzymes are individual or cocktail formulations that include cellulases, hemicellulases, laccases, and amylases, depending on the composition of biomass. Enzymatic treatments are then applied on pretreated biomass in separate or simultaneous processes under mild conditions with certain energy economy. However, the cost of enzymatic products is still one of the bottlenecks of this technology. So, advantages, challenges, and innovation of these processes are described."

A systematic narrative review was conducted to address the current information scarcity on bioenergy logistics and discuss methods for moving forward. Regardless, the biofuels supply chain primarily supports biofuels and has numerous logistical concerns, including feedstock, conversion, and generation. The ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation has coordinated the ASEAN's present bioenergy development that shows slow yet determined steps. As a result of policies and mandates, bioenergy production has progressed steadily, as well as a continuous improvement of current energy logistics (mostly fossil fuel‐based) to increase biofuel deployment. The current logistics for bioenergy is still lacking and technologically ill‐equipped, with significant inefficiency and sub‐optimality issues. Huge support to re‐engineer and retool bioenergy logistics is necessary to make bioenergy competitive with fossil fuels in ASEAN countries with varying economic and modernization status. Regional cooperation is key in developing an efficient and optimal logistical system for bioenergy in ASEAN, which needs to be supported with intensified R&D, smart solutions, green financing, incentive system, risk management, and policy frameworks. Green logistics is advocated to push forward decarbonizing the future across the ASEAN region with bioenergy.

pub.1005415594,Chapter Twelve Prospect of the Legume Tree Pongamia pinnata as a Clean and Sustainable Biodiesel Feedstock,"The demand for energy continues to increase due to population growth. In contrast, stocks for fossil fuel–based energy are limited and cannot be replenished, and therefore there is a need to find renewable resources to meet the increasing demand for energy around the world. With the declining reserves of fossil fuels, it has become apparent that biofuels are destined to make a substantial contribution to the future energy demands of the domestic and industrial economies. The use of vegetable oils from plants such as Jatropha curcas, canola, oil palm, and soybean has the potential to provide environmentally acceptable biodiesel, where production is greenhouse gas neutral, with reductions in current engine emissions. However, some of these feedstocks (e.g., oil palm and canola) are costly, making the production of biodiesel economically marginal due to their need for nitrogen fertilizer. The very high energy demands of nitrogen fertilizer production, transportation, and associated atmospheric pollution relating to NOx release from N fertilizer present a scenario where biofuels produced from legumes in association with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia may provide a major energy advantage over non-legume biofuel feedstock crops. Legumes may also produce NOx emissions at significantly lower levels than artificially fertilized crops. It thus appears strategic to utilize legumes and biological nitrogen fixation as a conduit for nitrogen input to enhance the sustainability of soils, whether it be for amelioration, rehabilitation, or for productive agricultural systems (e.g., biofuels), and to mitigate climate change. In the context of biofuels, legume-derived feedstocks that do not compete with other legumes or food crops for land, water, and fertilizer have the potential to provide a sustainable source of liquid fuels with minimal environmental impacts. A strong candidate legume species for biofuel feedstock is the tree legume Pongamia pinnata."

Growing and processing sugarcane produces significant amounts of byproducts, including bagasse, crop residue, molasses, filter‐press mud, and boiler fly ash. These products represent an important opportunity to generate value‐added and specialty products and enhance sugarcane's sustainability by facilitating a circular economy, where agricultural by‐products are reused instead of disposing them (linear economy), in order to reduce resource use and energy demand. Examples of value‐added products range from biochar, construction materials, animal feed, biofuels, nanoparticles, and fertilizer. Paramount to the success of the bio‐based circular economy is creating useful products that are sustainable, economically, and environmentally acceptable. Some potential roadblocks to creating a successful bio‐based circular economy from Louisiana's sugarcane by‐products are highlighted.

The utilization of plant materials for the production of ethanol is a severe problem economically and socially, and mainly for the environment. Shrimp shell waste is a potential raw material for the production of biofuel. The use of shrimp shells and its chitinous material for the manufacture of biofuels is a sustainable way to reduce the cost of the ethanol as well as to reduce the environmental pollution caused by selfish waste. Several microorganisms are known to produce chitinolytic enzymes, which can convert chitin into its monomer, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine. The chitin, as well as N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, can be utilized by the microorganisms as the sole carbon source for biofuel production. In this study, the extraction of chitin from shrimp shell waste, use of chitin and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine as the sole carbon source, simultaneous saccharification, and fermentation of chitin and utilization of raw shrimp shell as a biocatalyst for production of bioethanol and biodiesel were discussed."

pub.1168536833,Application of waste biomass for the production of biofuels and catalysts: a review,"Sustainable development is imperative, and the worldwide energy production must focus on the transition from petroleum derivatives to biomass-based biofuels and bioproducts to achieve a bio-based economy. The global interest in the processing of waste biomass to obtain bio-based products is continuously increasing. However, biorefineries have not yet been consolidated. The effective conversion of biomass components for the generation of value-added biochemicals and biofuels is a determining factor for the economic success of biorefineries. Therefore, exhaustive research has been performed to consolidate the biorefinery industry. This review summarizes the current advances in liquid biofuel production and solid catalysts prepared from waste biomass, as well as their advantages, drawbacks, and statistical data. It offers an extensive perspective, covering conventional methods and cutting-edge techniques such as biochemical and thermochemical biomass conversion technologies (e.g., hydrolysis, fermentation, pyrolysis, and gasification) to produce bioalcohols, biodiesel, renewable diesel, bio-jet, and bio-oil. In addition, the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts using residual biomass and different synthesis routes and their role in biofuel production were analyzed. This review contributes to the analysis of the importance of identifying and valorizing a wide spectrum of raw materials (i.e., urban, forestry, industrial, and agricultural) that have the potential to be used as catalyst precursors and biofuel feedstock. Finally, a techno-economic analysis, the main challenges, and the future scope of the diverse methods used to prepare biofuels and catalysts are discussed. This review examines numerous aspects from biomass to catalysts, thus providing relevant information for researchers, students, policymakers, and industry experts.Graphical abstract"

pub.1141877037,6 Perspectives and role of lignocellulosic biorefinery in strengthening a circular economy,"Industrial production of a wide range of fuel and value-added chemicals completely depends on fossil resources. For the past two decades, lignocellulosic biorefinery shows a tremendous potential for developing sustainable renewable resources. The upgradation of biomass in integrated biorefinery will be the best approach to compete with fossil-based refineries. The role of lignocellulosic biorefinery is not only to meet energy needs but also to reduce environmental problems by replacing conventional petroleum sources. For a large-scale biorefinery, an inexpensive, natural, and renewable resource like lignocellulosic feedstock is widely used for the production of biofuel/bioenergy and value-added chemicals/products that include 5-hydroxymethylfurfural(5-HMF), sugar alcohols, organic acids, such as levulinic acid, succinic acid, formic acid, and phenols. Further, these chemicals can be converted to a wide range of derivatives for various applications in polymers, biofuel, and solvent industries. For conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into value-added products, various efficient technologies are used where the waste is completely valorized through a process addressing the circular economy. This chapter provides an overview of the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstock into top value-added products in high yields through various technological conversion processes and the role of biorefinery for developing renewable fuel and chemicals toward a sustainable bioeconomy."
pub.1138201510,Metagenomics: adding new dimensions in bioeconomy,"The ever-increasing population and its high energy demand had encumbered the existing natural resources and intensify the research on finding sustainable alternatives such as bioenergy paradigm that escalates the bioeconomy. The utilization of ubiquitous lignocellulosic biomass paved the way for the development of biorefineries for the production of biofuels and value-added products. However, this road is a quite arduous as currently available natural system is not capable enough of surmounting all tasks of degrading complex lignocellulosic biomass. The advent of next generation sequencing such as metagenomics revolutionize the exploration of “unseen majority” from diverse environments. This approach provides direct access of bioactive prospects and in-depth characterization of genome of microbes. The current exploration of novel enzymes and host systems through metagenomic approaches opens a pandora’s box for enhancing the bioenergy sector that plays considerable role in bioeconomy. As we are moving in the era of sustainable development thus advanced sequencing methodologies, algorithms, bioinformatic software’s have been continuously developed for more comprehensive downstream analysis of metagenome. There is growing need for establishing circular economy that completely relies on advanced bioprocessing steps. Therefore, this review highlights some glimpses about current execution of metagenomic approaches and propose a futuristic model for the development of circular economy."

The use of agro-industrial wastes does not subtract resources destined for food consumption. In addition, waste utilization would result in a reduction of its accumulation, with a consequent decrease of environmental impact and financial losses due to the relevant disposal. In this context, a wide variety of exploitable agricultural resources can be used to support this sustainable growth. However, the characterization represents the first step towards a targeted and proficient exploitation of the chemical and energetic potential of a residual biomass. In this work, some representative residual (Mexican) biomasses were investigated: pepper residues (Hungarian yellow and red variety), coconut shells (Cocos nucifera), flamboyant pods (Delonix regia), seeds of avocado (Persea Americana), palm (Palma de Coroco) and nance (Byrsonima crassifolia) were chemically characterized and the relevant potential applications for the synthesis of biofuels and fine chemicals were specifically evaluated. Lipids, structural carbohydrates, and lignin were specifically valorized in a proficient cascade of technologies, which aim to exploit the correspondent potential, according to the principles of biorefinery and circular economy."
pub.1167140375,"Environmental, combustion, and performance investigation of low viscous biofuel in port fuel injection spark-ignition engine","In order to avoid the food vs. fuel debate, other than food-based products, agricultural products are effective sources for fuel development. Various parts of plants and trees are used to produce sustainable, low-viscous biofuels, which are gaining much attraction due to their superior burning abilities. The turpentine biofuel produced from pine tree oil has been used for gasoline engines because of its better calorific value and other notable benefits. An attempt has been made to investigate the suitability of turpentine biofuel as a 50% replacement for gasoline in automotive applications to identify the optimum blend ratio. In this study, the experiments are conducted in the port-fuel-injected gasoline engine at different loading conditions of 0 kg to 15 kg at 1800 rpm. Using turpentine blends in a port-fuel-injected SI engine, performance characteristics have been observed with up to a 3–5% improvement in brake thermal efficiency and fuel economy for all concentrations of turpentine biofuel due to their higher calorific value. However, the implementation of turpentine biofuel has shown remarkable reductions in unburnt hydrocarbons by 50% and carbon monoxide emissions by 90% due to its superior burning ability. However, this reduction is not witnessed in oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide emissions due to the lower octane number and higher viscosity, which result in a 30% and 5% increase, respectively. Interestingly, the combustion characteristics are observed to be better at part load operations for lower concentrations (30%) of turpentine biofuel in the blends, and this trend has not been noticed at higher concentrations of turpentine biofuel. Finally, it has been concluded that turpentine biofuel would be a better option for the partial replacement of gasoline by up to 30%. However, for further investigation, the anti-knocking characteristics of the turpentine biofuel need to be improved, especially in 40% and 50% turpentine biofuel blends using suitable anti-knocking agents."
pub.1031678830,From the petroeconomy to the bioeconomy: Integrating bioenergy production with agricultural demands,"Abstract Production of biomass for bioenergy generation, and in particular production of biologically derived liquid fuels, is attracting great interest as an alternative to the fossil fuel economy. Biofuels represent as yet only 1% of world agricultural output, but this small extension has triggered widespread fears, many now shown to be groundless, such as the fear that it was biofuels that drove up food prices in 2008. This perspective reviews the literature on the extent to which biofuel production can be integrated into agricultural production, taking a global view of the potential for land, water and other resources to be extended beyond current food, feed and fi ber applications. As opposed to the focus on negative impacts, there are benefi cial practices in biofuels that could be expected to propagate to agriculture more generally and have a positive impact on yields and practices. These include (1) promoting a shift from wasteful annual crops to perennials, particularly low‐input high‐diversity (LIHD) crops; (2) sequestering carbon in soil both organically and as biochar; (3) improving conservative water management practices; and (4) recycling resources. The possibilities of encouraging biofuel production (and biomass for bioenergy generally) in the tropical South, for consumption in the temperate North, based on certifi cation of such sustainable practices in the South, could be expanded if global trade in biofuels were liberalized.

Although bio-based processes are very attractive, thorough sustainability analyses are required to highlight weaknesses and to address actions for improvement. This chapter addresses these issues with a focus on the production of biobutanol—a second-generation biofuel—from renewable resources via the biotechnological route. The LCA of the biobutanol production is proposed. The analysis has had three objectives: (i) compare two process layouts; (ii) identify key hotspots along the supply chain of biobutanol production from an agro-food waste; and (iii) compare the environmental performance of producing biobutanol with that of conventional, fossil-based alternatives. The analysis points out that the total production cost of biobutanol is almost six times higher than the conventional gasoline under the best scenario. From the environmental point of view, the process is amongst the highly ranked ones with respect to the production processes typically proposed for the second-generation biofuels."

pub.1092446564,Enhanced microalgal lipid extraction using bio-based solvents for sustainable biofuel production,"<p>Bio-based solvents are efficient replacements for traditional fossil-derived solvents in microalgal lipid extraction towards developing environmentally friendly biofuel production processes.</p>
<p> Global energy crisis and climate change urge to find alternative energy sources to help in transitioning from a petroleum-based to a more sustainable bio-based economy. In this context, microalgal biomass is regarded as a promising renewable energy feedstock for biodiesel production due to its high lipid accumulation and growth rate. Conventional extraction methods for lipid recovery from microalgae rely on hazardous petroleum-derived volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as hexane, which is being strictly regulated in the chemical industry. Therefore, the goal of this work is to assess the feasibility of using renewable bio-based solvents for microalgal lipid extraction to develop environmentally-friendly biofuel production processes. In particular, lipid extraction studies were conducted on two microalgal strains, Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis sp., via the Soxhlet method using various bio-based solvents ( i.e. ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF)), compared to the benchmark VOC solvent (hexane). All bio-based solvents outperform the extraction capacity of hexane, with 2-MeTHF and ethyl lactate, respectively, providing two-fold and three-fold lipid extraction yields in comparison with the conventional solvent, hexane. Moreover, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles produced from both strains indicate the suitability of bio-based solvents to extract target lipids for biodiesel production. In addition, the overall biodiesel yield is significantly increased when using bio-based solvents for microalgal lipid extraction, with 2-MeTHF duplicating the overall biodiesel yield provided by hexane in both strains, Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis sp. Lipid extraction with ethyl lactate also duplicates the overall biodiesel yield produced from Chlorella vulgaris . Furthermore, bio-based solvents decrease the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the extracts, hence increasing the biodiesel quality for practical applications. Overall, bio-based solvents exhibit the potential for replacing hexane in developing sustainable processes for biodiesel production. Thus, these findings support the role of renewable solvents in developing eco-efficient processes for biofuel production towards building a bio-economy based on renewable sources. </p>"

Not only do they provide food, but they are increasingly proving to be a reliable local source of energy and materials. Biofuels from palm oil and sugarcane are prominent examples where the palm and sugar mills serve as biorefineries – providing food, fuels as well as materials. Nevertheless, there are also associated environmental impacts which need to be considered along with economic considerations. A life cycle approach is useful for both environmental as well as economic assessment. In particular eco-efficiency, a tool combining both environmental and economic aspects is very useful to analyze biorefinery configurations and look at the trade-offs between the environmental and economic aspects. The increase of value-added products from the biorefineries may lead to increased economic benefits but also increased environmental emissions. Indicators such as eco-efficiency show the relative advantages of the enhanced biorefinery system as compared to conventional food or biofuel production systems. Thus, they provide important information to decision-makers both for industry and policy."

In this context, biofuels production has expanded in the first decade of this century, and the same increase can occur with biomaterials in the years to come. However, despite the large appeal of biofuel, various concerns regarding its sustainability have been raised, constraining production and imposing the necessity to attest compliance with some principles and criteria. As a result of interest group advocacy, a diversity of sustainability initiatives has emerged in recent years in the bioenergy context, which may soon be extended to chemicals and biomaterials as well. This chapter presents the main technical regulations and standards for bioenergy currently in place and discusses the social, economic, and environmental issues these address. Guided by the set principles and criteria, there is evidence supporting that, if implemented correctly, the bio-based economy can indeed offer significant contributions toward sustainable development."

The article focuses mostly on recent achievements in the technical and processing aspects of pyrolysis. The aim of the review is to present the latest research on the process of waste biomass pyrolysis to fuel production. The paper describes the mechanisms of the pyrolysis process, composition, and properties of the obtained fractions, namely pyrolysis gas, bio-oil, and biochar. Additionally, the technical aspects of the pyrolysis process are mentioned, with particular attention to the construction of the reactors. The process of waste biomass pyrolysis allows for obtaining many chemical compounds (second-generation biofuels). Optimization of the pyrolysis process allows obtaining the desired products that are applied in the chemical industry, energy, and transport. The application of pyrolysis gas, oil, and biochar as valuable chemical compounds are related to the intensifying effects of climate change, biofuel production, and waste management in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.

pub.1142908176,Circular Economy in Brazil,"Despite the importance of its natural environment and of its agribusiness sector, Brazil is a largely urbanised country, but unfortunately with significant inequalities. In several cities, mainly in the North (N) and Northeast (NE) administrative regions, there are the shantytowns (favelas), lacking basic sanitation, differently from Southeast (SE), the most industrialised region in the country. In this context, Circular Economy can contribute significantly to improve basic sanitation in the country, with the sustainable use of the residues for different purposes. In fact, Circular Economy in Brazil is still in its early stages, and is more developed in the bioenergy and bioeconomy sectors (Circular Bioeconomy). This is mainly due to the long-term country’s experience in bioenergy, with the Proalcool Program, which has started in 1975, and nowadays is the second largest biofuels program worldwide, only behind the USA. Other bioenergy and biofuels programs in Brazil include biodiesel and biogas programs with a significant development on the energy conversion from biomass residues, including sugarcane bagasse, wood residues, rice husks, and others. Such residues are used for not only thermal and electricity generation but also for pellets and second-generation ethanol production. Additionally, the energy conversion of other residues from urban and rural areas focus on electricity generation and biomethane production. There are also other uses of biomass residues, such as fertigation (fertilisation and irrigation with vinasse) of sugarcane crops and animal feed; however, other uses with higher added value are still in its early stages. Nowadays, in Brazil, there is an important environmental and social legislation, being applied with the corresponding enforcement, which addresses recycling, reverse logistic, and energy conversion of urban residues. Considering the importance of Circular Economy for a sustainable use of waste, this chapter presents an overview of the Circular Economy in Brazil, focusing also in Circular Bioeconomy. It includes recent detailed data about the existing legislation and enforcement, with specific information about the more important case studies related to the use of waste for energy conversion. Special emphasis was performed for different sectors, such as vehicles, electronics, health services, construction and demolition, and plastic. In addition, the chapter presents the recent policies on municipal solid waste and sanitation, as well as the recent RenovaBio Program for bioenergy, just started in the biofuels sector.

pub.1122668532,Bioethanol from Waste – Prospects and Challenges of Current and Emerging Technologies,"Demand for the sustainable production of biofuels is growing rapidly, with bioethanol to be the most widely produced biofuel. Its production has emerged from the need to decarbonize our economy in order to mitigate climate change and to restrain depletion of fossil resources. In this study a literature review on the current status and emerging technologies for second generation bioethanol production from waste has been implemented. Specifically, the examined feedstocks included lignocellulosic streams, industrial food processing waste streams and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The study revealed that the sustainable production of second‐generation ethanol is highly dependent on the ability to overcome substantial technological barriers. In recent years, major research efforts have focused toward this direction, bringing cellulosic bioethanol through bioconversion and thermochemical pathways to commercial production. At the same time, the progress toward large‐scale valorization of the other waste streams is still very limited, since the relevant processes are still unsustainable mainly due to high energy demands and enzyme consumption."
pub.1058063845,Commentary: Powering America with sustainable energy in the 21st century,"The United States continues to rely heavily on foreign oil and coal-based electricity for its transportation and power generation needs, respectively. The perennial lack of a national energy policy has deprived the United States of strong direction towards the development of sustainable domestic energy resources, which are abundantly available, enhance the country's energy security, and reduce its carbon footprint. Technology innovation and economies of scale in the last ten years have made wind, solar thermal, biomass, and natural gas viable and cost-competitive alternatives to highly polluting coal. Biomass and natural gas can produce base-load electricity, whereas wind and solar can address peak demand, when combined with fossils or with energy storage systems like batteries. In vehicles, biofuels and electric motors can rather seamlessly replace gasoline and reduce significantly our dependence on foreign oil. While each form of alternative energy has its own advantages, they can all contribute to economic growth in the 21st century by attracting investment, creating jobs, generating tax revenues, and making the entire US economy more sustainable."
pub.1170334316,Renewable Carbon in Industry 4.0: Toward the Sustainable Bioeconomy,"The concept of renewable carbon and its relevance in the context of sustainable economy and mitigation of environmental impacts caused by fossil fuel usage is essential. Carbon is a versatile chemical element, present in various molecules and widely utilized in the industry for fuel production, chemicals, polymer materials, energy, and others. However, the use of fossil carbon is limited and has adverse environmental impacts, such as the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) responsible for global warming. In pursuit of alternatives, the concept of renewable carbon gains prominence, referring to resources that can be regenerated through the carbon cycle, such as CO2 and methane from natural or anthropogenic sources. Renewable carbon sources include microalgae biomass, lignocellulosic residues, the pulp and paper industry, as well as fruit and vegetable processing waste. The production of biofuels and high-value products from these sources forms the foundation of sustainable bioeconomy, which seeks to employ advanced technologies for efficient and circular utilization of natural resources. Sustainable bioeconomy is crucial to address the challenges posed by the growing global population and to ensure environmental preservation. Combining agricultural and forest biomass is a promising strategy to meet the demand for raw materials and expand clean energy and bioproducts production.

pub.1124904484,Algae Biodiesel: Fundamentals and Future Prospects,"Global economy has been benefited from fossil fuels in the past but at the cost of increasing CO2 level and other environmental hazards. Fast-growing concern about global warming, exhaustion of nonrenewable energy reserves and rising cost of petroleum-derived fuels, led to quest for other sustainable renewable energy alternatives. In current scenario, renewable and environment-friendly biofuel production is the only sustainable alternative to shrinking petrodiesel reserves. Over the years, biodiesel has grabbed the most focus as a potential liquid biofuel. First-generation biodiesel was produced mainly from edible vegetable oils and provoke large number of debate, primarily owing to competition with overall food production. Subsequently, second-generation biodiesel was produced by using nonedible oil sources like karanja, jatropha and mahua oils. First- and second-generation biodiesel have demerits, mainly the expensive set up, land requirements for plants cultivation and competition with net food production. Moreover, biodiesel derived from these sources could not practically fulfill the small part of current transport fuels requirements. Thus, the focus of researchers has been shifted to the third-generation biofuel from microalgae, which is highly promising. Utilization of microalgae for different types of renewable biofuel production is having diverse benefits of overcoming the energy crisis and environmental pollution control. Microalgae are photosynthetic eukaryotes and capable to grow in different growth conditions with CO2 biofixation. Microalgae are 10–50 times efficient in solar energy capture than plants and also higher in biomass accumulation than energy crops. Algae can grow in diverse aquatic habitat and on land that is agriculturally barren, therefore, no arable land competition for food and feed. The key attraction of biodiesel production with microalgae lies in their ability to tolerate high CO2 concentration. Moreover, wastewater (rich in nutrients) can be effectively utilized for microalgae cultivations and subsequently results in wastewater recycling. Biodiesel from algae appears to be the most economic and sustainable energy source with the CO2 utilization and wastewater recycling."

Biofuels and biocommodities should unavoidably play a major role in shaping the new global energy landscape by providing alternatives to most of the current oil-refinery products. The accelerating shift toward lignocellulosic and microalgal biomass as well as waste effluents could considerably diminish the fossil fuel usage. Thus, innovative concepts such as microbial cell factories, green chemistry, and renewable Power-to-X technologies could convert these substrates to drop-in fuels, platform chemicals, and even biopolymers.

pub.1134314039,Environmental Impact and Challenges Associated with Bio-Based Energy,"The growth of global economy and industry along with population explosion has led to an exponential enhancement in the consumption of energy in the past few decades. With this escalation in demand for energy, the utilization of renewable/sustainable energy sources, to provide long-term sustainable benefits to society, has also spiralled on a massive scale. Approximately 85% of the world energy consumption is primarily reliant on fossil fuels, a non-renewable source of energy. Thus, bio-based energy, a sustainable source of carbon-based energy, is considered as a substitute for the depleting non-renewable energy sources. Owing to the decreased carbon emissions, in comparison to fossil fuels and associated government support policies, the global demand for biomass-based energy plants is increasing rapidly. Though, the utilization of biomass in the form of food crops like maize, wheat, sugarcane and soybeans for the generation of biofuel is unlikely a sustainable approach. Further, the thermochemical processes of generation of biofuels from biomass have its associated environmental concerns such as generation of detrimental toxins and its accidental release into the atmosphere, during thermal decay and chemical reformation procedure. The chapter thus takes into account the various types of biomass and its promising techniques for generating energy, in addition to highlighting the environmental impacts along with Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission for bio-based energy generation/utilization alternatives."

Various researchers have published on the environmental, biophysical, economic, agronomic, social, and political constraints on successful biofuel second generation (2G) implementation on the energetic matrix in the last few decades. However, according to the circular economy and the Sustainable Development Goals, the balance of the economic, social, and ecological dimensions for 2G biofuels production must take place in the fight against poverty and sustainability to answer the following constraints: environmental impacts related to the cultivation and use of perennial crops on marginal land and usage of agroindustrial lignocellulosic biomass and waste, optimization of processes in biorefineries and innovative public policies with stakeholders participation. This chapter aims to describe the innovative development of biofuels from biomass as the most attractive option from the point of view of energy security, rural development, and mitigation of GHGs in transport and the experience with the development of public policies and mandates."
pub.1168247815,Enzyme Cocktails Catalyzed Bioconversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass into Bioethanol," Abstract: Sustainable production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass (LBM) is considered one of the promising solutions to solve the current energy crisis caused by overreliance on fossil fuels. Enzymatic hydrolysis is a crucial step in determining the efficient conversion of biomass cellulose into biofuels as well as high value-added chemicals, and it has the characteristics of efficient reaction, economy, and environmental friendliness. With the advancement of enzyme engineering technology, enzymes have been endowed with more functions, such as mixed substrate utilization, inhibitor resistance and specific metabolism, called enzyme cocktails. This Paper introduces the typical procedure of enzymatic hydrolysis of LBM and discusses their applications in hybrid LBM hydrolysis. In addition, the challenges of enzymatic LBM hydrolysis and possible development directions are outlined to guide integrated enzymatic strategies in biorefinery processes. "
pub.1151952644,How Would Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and Bioethanol Impact in Electric Mobility Transition?,"We live in a transition economy, from fossil fuels based to a more sustainable one, targeting emission neutrality of carbon dioxide (CO2). The CO2 gas is the primary greenhouse gas, and it is recognized as the leading cause of global warming and subsequent climate change events. Several alternative technologies are under study, and substantial funding has been applied to reduce emissions and eliminate greenhouse gases. Most advanced technologies so far are sustainable and economically competitive and need a push from governments to fly even higher such as solar and wind renewable energy generation and bioethanol (C2H5OH) and hydrogen (H2) for fuels. The third generation of solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs: metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells) can use H2, CO or biofuels for onboarding energy generation at lower temperatures (ca. 600 °C), offering high electrical efficiency and none or low polluting gas emissions. Combined with biofuels such as bioethanol, MS-SOFCs would offer a solution for the transports electrification. This solution uses the infrastructure already existing in many countries and would be a pivotal component in sustaining the transformation required and keeping alive the net of values constructed over the years by biofuels agroindustry."
pub.1147933962,Trends in Biodiesel Production from Algae and Animal Fat Wastes: Challenges and Prospects,"The maximum and uncontrolled use of fossil fuels is being faced from last few decades due to extreme energy requirements, leading the entire globe in search of any renewable and biodegradable energy source having no harm to environment. For this purpose petroleum fuels are being replaced with biofuels which are considered to be eco-friendly and cost-effective. Biodiesel is proved to be most fascinating fuel in last few years and can be obtained from algae, animal fat waste, and waste cooking oil. It is safe to use fuel with low or no emission report. Algae are broad aquatic group and are biodiesel feedstock, can be easily grown, and have specific features leading to significant biodiesel production. The other big source of biodiesel is animal fat waste which can easily attained due to maximum usage of poultry and meat in daily life. Regardless of the easy availability of these resources, there are yet some issues like pretreatment conditions, algae growing, etc. which need to be resolved for significant biodiesel production. Sustainable biofuel economy can be pursued if the environmental conditions affecting biofuel are completely understood. As an end result, sustainable energy supply with low emitting gases will replace the petroleum fuel industry."
pub.1146765608,Enzymatic catalysis as a tool in biofuels production in Brazil: Current status and perspectives,"Growing fossil raw material demand, especially for producing fuels, has caused serious damage to the environment, mainly in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To minimize non-renewable fuel use and impacts, biomasses can be used as substitutes to achieve a sustainable circular economy, especially in Brazil, which is one of the largest biomass producers in the world. Ethanol, biodiesel, and biogas/biomethane have been extensively studied as alternatives to fossil fuels, the two first being already produced at industrial scales and used as vehicle fuels in Brazil. Additionally, different biomasses have been used as raw materials to produce biofuels, and enzymatic catalysis have shown promising potential to achieve feasible and sustainable processes. Some main enzymes are amylases, which are used extensively in corn starch hydrolysis to produce first generation (1G) ethanol using a well-established process, while cellulases and xylanases are promising in hydrolyzing lignocellulosic materials for producing second generation (2G) ethanol. Lipases, on the other hand, are interesting catalysts for effectively converting triacylglycerols (TAGs), and free fatty acids (FFAs) from several vegetable oils or animal fats into biodiesel. This review comprehensively address biofuels production in Brazil, with a focus on the current status of industrial enzymes, exploring their characteristics, advantages, and discussing current technical challenges for their industrial application."

pub.1138675070,Development of Alternative (Clean) Energy Sources: The EU Experience,"The article is concerned with studying the European experience in the development of alternative (clean) energy sources, identifying problems and prospects for the production and consumption. The publication considers the advantages for countries from the use of new generation of energy carriers, including: independence from the countries – suppliers of traditional energy; ensuring ecological production and consumption; environmental protection and minimization of risk to the climate, human health, biodiversity, etc. The article provides the EU regulatory documents, namely: Directive 2018/2001/EC on alternative energy sources as part of the «Clean Energy for All Europeans» package and National Energy and Climate Plans (NECP) for 2021-2030, which set out the mechanism for fulfilling new goals for 2030 as to alternative energy sources. The new directive establishes a mandatory goal for alternative energy sources for the EU for 2030 (not less than 32%), provides for measures for various sectors of the economy, as well as transport, and strengthened criteria for ensuring the sustainability of bioenergy. The transition of the EU to the use of biofuels is explained by the course of sustainable development of European countries in the sphere of energy and ecology, the status of the economy and the general ecological policy of the countries. The division into generations of biofuels is provided as follows: the first generation, or conventional fuel, is fuel from ordinary food crops grown on arable land; the second generation is biofuels made from various types of biomass; the third generation is made exclusively of algae; the fourth generation of biomass involves the use of biochemical methods for carbon capture. It is determined that the production of biofuels can give impetus to the revival of the national agrarian economy, improving the environment, enhancing the ecological safety of the country, as well as promoting the development of the country’s logistics infrastructure."
pub.1148109820,An overview of sustainable approaches for bioenergy production from agro-industrial wastes,"Biofuels are perfect replacements for conventional fossil fuels, as they are environmentally friendly, non-polluting, locally available, sustainable, renewable, and accessible. The biomass, available abundantly on the earth's crust can be used for the production of biofuels via the circular economy concept. The presence of high organic content, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), etc. makes them excellent candidates for bioenergy generation. Bioenergy generation from agro-industrial wastes, a major biomass feedstock, is considered to be a promising technology for overcoming fossil fuel depletion as well as environmental pollution. Also, the utilization of agro-industrial wastes as feedstocks in large quantities resolves the concerns associated with waste management, which otherwise piles up and causes severe environmental pollution and health-hazardous effects. Thus, the current review mainly focuses on bioenergy generation via valorization of agro-industrial wastes. It also discusses various methodologies employed for the production of different biofuels e.g., biogas, biohydrogen, bioethanol, biodiesel, etc. The review further highlights the production strategies, limitations, and prospects of agro-industrial wastes as feedstock for bioenergy generation and waste management. It gives detailed insight into the integrated depolymerization and hydrolysis of biomass where it can be effectively used as a “green tool” in various industries e.g., biorefinery applications, and be a step towards a “cleaner ecosystem and future”."
pub.1030900509,Bioenergy for sustainable development: An African context,"This paper assesses the sustainability concerns of bioenergy systems against the prevailing and potential long term conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa with a special attention on agricultural and forestry waste, and cultivated bioenergy sources. Existing knowledge and processes about bioenergy systems are brought into a “sustainability framework” to support debate and decisions about the implementation of bioenergy systems in the region. Bioenergy systems have been recommended based on the potential to (i) meet domestic energy demand and reduce fuel importation (ii) diversify rural economies and create employment (iii) reduce poverty, and (iv) provide net energy gains and positive environmental impacts. However, biofuels will compete with food crops for land, labour, capital and entrepreneurial skills. Moreover the environmental benefits of some feedstocks are questionable. These challenges are, however, surmountable. It is concluded that biomass energy production could be an effective way to achieve sustainable development for bioenergy pathways that (i) are less land intensive, (ii) have positive net energy gains and environmental benefits, and (iii) provide local socio-economic benefits. Feasibility evaluations which put these issues into perspective are vital for sustainable application of agricultural and forest based bioenergy systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Such evaluations should consider the long run potential of biofuels accounting for demographic, economic and technological changes and the related implications."

Cities have a crucial role in climate change, as they use 2/3 of the world’s energy, producing 70% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In order to reduce the large ecological footprint of the utilization of conversional energy sources (coal, gas, and oil) and enhance a nation’s energy independence (security), it is crucial to find alternative fuels. Biomass residues are characterized as a sustainable and carbon-neutral energy source. Hence, this review describes a critical assessment of not only the quality characteristics of several waste and biomass residues for bioenergy production and biofuels but also the value-added products that could be produced from wastes to enhance industry (e.g., pharmaceutical, cosmetics, packaging industry, etc.). Furthermore, the challenges and potential solutions of waste utilization for bioenergy production and the transformation of value-added products for urban sustainability are also explored. Despite the high-quality characteristics and the availability of these wastes, several critical factors should be taken into account. Biomass residues could contribute to sustainable development goals (SDG), such as sustainable cities and communities, clean energy, responsible consumption and production, the economic growth of a country, and, as a result, urban development."

These directions are drawn mainly from our research experience and expertise in the energy sector and other natural resource areas. First, we believe that future sustainability and resilience in natural resource management can be enhanced through better utilization of outcomes from process- or physical-based climate change models, such as Global Climate Models. Second, directly related to the electric power sectors is a better harnessing variability and unpredictability via flexibility, transmission, and storage. Third, future natural resource management should consider interdependence of multiple systems, such as power, natural gas, and water systems, through co-optimization of these interdependent systems. We elaborate each of these three future research directions in this chapter."

The present energy distribution is directly reliant on the accessibility of nonrenewable energy reserves, which results in rising energy demands, atmospheric carbon dioxide accumulation, and an increase in greenhouse gases. It elevates the concept of the circular bio-economy of “the sustainable utilization of the lignocellulosic waste into a range of by-products and biofuels” generally recognized as biorefinery as defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The essential target for biorefineries is to obtain both high-volume biofuels and high-value structural chemicals. A lignocellulosic biorefinery is a second-generation system that mainly depends upon the utilization of lignocellulosic crops and non-crop feedstock, and different industrial waste such as sugarcane bagasse via thermochemical conversion. At the same time, various challenges are also aligned with the development of the lignocellulosic biorefineries such as seasonal availability, land usage, yields, and accumulation of various inhibitors during the pretreatment steps. Improved strains, streamlining of the regional substrates, integrated bioprocess, and compatibility to the existing petrochemical infrastructure will hold the key to the circular bio-economy-based biorefineries."
pub.1168554837,Moving towards Biofuels and High-Value Products through Phytoremediation and Biocatalytic Processes,"Phytoremediation is an eco-friendly technology that utilizes plants and plant–microbe interactions to remove a wide spectrum of organic and inorganic pollutants from contaminated environments such as soils, waters and sediments. This low-impact, environmentally sustainable and cost-effective methodology represents a valuable alternative to expensive physical and chemical approaches, characterized by secondary pollution risks, and is gaining increasing attention from researchers and popular acceptance. In this review, the main mechanisms underlying the decontamination activity of plants have been clarified, highlighting the environmental remediation in fertility and soil health. Studies have illustrated the high potential of phytoremediation coupled with green and sustainable biocatalytic processes, which together represent a non-polluting alternative for the conversion of plant biomass into renewable resources. The convenience of this technology also lies in the valorization of the bio-wastes towards biofuels, energy purposes and value-added products, contributing to an effective and sustainable circular approach to phyto-management. The strategy proposed in this work allows, with the use of totally green technologies, the recovery and valorization of contaminated soil and, at the same time, the production of bioenergy with high efficiency, within the framework of international programs for the development of the circular economy and the reduction of greenhouse carbon emissions."

Policies for developing new and renewable energy in Indonesia aims to encourage the optimization of the use of biofuels from oil palm. This policy still raises pros and cons, so that analysis needs to be carried out through an environmental science perspective. This study aims to assess the sustainability of palm oil (CPO) as a basic material for making biodiesel from environmental, social, and economic aspects, as well as to provide recommendations on a sustainable palm oil biodiesel policy strategy. The method used is a qualitative analysis. Descriptive analysis of supporting literature is used to assess environmental, social, and economic aspects of palm oil-based biodiesel sustainability in Indonesia. The use of biodiesel in the country is expected to be sustainable in line with the stipulation of the mandatory biodiesel of 30 percent (B30) in 2019 by the Government as a substitute for fuel mixture.

Thus, the corresponding noise frequencies (and mainly the infrasound ones) present high interest, especially from the viewpoint of sustainability, due to the potential effects on human safety and health (H_S&H) in sustainable engineering projects. Moreover, the occupational safety and health (OSH) visualization (a fact of unveiling the social dimension of sustainability) of occupational workplaces (by evaluating the infrasound and audible noise frequencies generated by diesel engines) could help a safety officer to lessen crucial risk factors in the OSH field and also to protect, more efficiently, the employees by taking the most essential safety measures. This study (i) suggests a technique to determine the infrasound and audible sound frequencies produced due to vibrations of diesel engines, by using biofuels (i.e., sustainable utilization of resources), in order to evaluate potential effects on human safety and health at the workplaces of sustainable engineering projects, and (ii) it ultimately aims to contribute to the improvement of the three “sustainability pillars” (economy, social, and environmental). Therefore, it provides experimental results of the frequency of the noise (regarding the infrasound and audible spectrum) that a diesel motor generates by vibration, in the frame of using different engine rpms (850, 1150, and 2000) and a variety of biofuel mixtures (B20-D80, B40-D60, B60-D40, and B80-D20). The article shows that the fuel blend meaningfully affects the generated noise, and more particularly, the usage of biofuel blends coming from mixing diesel oil with biodiesel (a fact of the emerging environmental dimension of sustainability) can produce various noise frequencies, which are determined in the infrasound and audible spectra (~10–23 Hz). The suggested technique, by ameliorating the OSH situation, doubtless will help enterprises to achieve the finest allocation of limited financial resources (a fact corresponding to the economic dimension of sustainability), allowing financial managers to have more available budget for implementing other risk-reduction projects."
pub.1064580298,Analysis of Sustainable Cassava Biofuel Production in Nigeria,"Nigeria's biofuels policy advocates the adoption of cassava as feedstock for a 10%-biofuel substitution option in Nigerian transport fuel demand. This policy option is expected to address energy security and environmental consequences of using fossil fuels as the sole source of transport energy in the country. This paper appraised the technological and economic factors necessary for achieving Nigeria's cassava-based biofuel initiative at different substitution levels of 5, 10, and 15% by the Year 2020. A multi-stage energy forecasting and project analysis framework adapted from Coate's structure for technology assessment, as well as engineering economy methodology was used for the study. Technological analysis entailed determining petrol consumption projection, R&D capability, input feedstock requirements, environmental considerations and land requirement for feedstock crop production while engineering economy analysis evaluated the economic viability of the project. The results showed that petrol consumption in Nigeria and bioethanol substitution requirements were in the range of 18,285.7 – 19,142.84 thousand tons and 914.28 (5% low demand) – 2871.43 (15% high demand) thousand tons, respectively by 2020. Cassava feedstock and landmass requirements for bioethanol production were in the range of 4.64 – 14.53 million tons and 4.08 – 12.80 thousand sq. km, respectively while carbon dioxide savings were between 1.87 – 5.89 million tons by 2020. The recovery price for cassava bioethanol was estimated to be US$ 0.74/litre [Formula: see text]. Petrol being subsidised presently is harmful to the environment though it ‘oils’ the economy. Nigeria currently subsidizes petroleum products to the tune of 28% of 2011 budget. The government plans to remove this by 2012. Thus we conclude that weighing both economic and environmental benefits of bioethanol substitution in petrol consumption in Nigeria, the study showed that bioethanol production from cassava feedstock would be both technically and economically viable, provided subsidy, which depends on political will on the side of the government, is introduced for the first ten years of its implementation."
pub.1171656190,Economics of sustainable lignocellulose biomass and biofuel logistics in Malaysia,"Lignocellulose biomass is an inedible and renewable resource that can be used to produce biofuels sustainably and thus help to mitigate climate change while helping to ensure energy security. Tropical countries like Malaysia are assumed to have abundant biomass resources, but the fragmented farming landscapes common in Southeast Asia raise challenges for biofuel production, which largely stem from logistics operations and have an adverse impact on economies of scale and the viability of biorefineries. This thesis seeks to understand the costs and supplies associated with biomass transport, assess the impacts of landscape fragmentation on biorefineries, and identify optimum biorefinery locations. Ten sources of biomass (agroforestry residues from fields, sawmills, and processing plants) were considered, taking into account various logistical factors, supply scenarios, and impacts of landscape fragmentation. The study began with a simulation of biomass transport across Peninsular Malaysia, using GRASS GIS software to estimate costs and supplies. Eighty-nine points within each district were designated as potential locations. Biomass transport was recorded as a major cost component in operational expenditures. The capital expenditures for various conversion pathways and biorefinery operations were estimated across relevant orders of magnitude, with the biofuel supplies also being simulated. The study identified four optimum locations for various types of biomass, presenting detailed cost and supply structures. The two most competitive biomass types are rice straw and pressed palm fibre (PPF). Costs ranged a) from 130.6 to 206.3 USD/tonne, yielding 0.47 to 0.97 million tonnes of PPF fermented biofuel per year, and b) 123.2 to 207.8 USD/tonne for rice straw, yielding 0.49 to 0.56 million tonnes of fermented biofuel per year. In tonnes of oil equivalent (toe), both together amounted to 5–7% of Malaysia’s annual petroleum consumption. Surprisingly, the findings suggest that an abundance of biomass does not necessarily result in lower biofuel costs, because factors such as spatial fragmentation and moisture content amplify transport costs. Our analysis emphasises the need for strategic planning, including the use of larger trucks, early moisture removal, and the establishment of local consolidation centres to manage biomass effectively. It highlights the need for a more holistic and strategic approach in order to understand supply zone specifics with a view to unlocking Malaysia’s potential for sustainable biofuel production."

Alternative methods for utilising waste glycerol are also being sought, e.g., by converting it into other valuable chemical products or biofuels. Therefore, various technologies are being developed to ensure effective and sustainable utilisation of this type of waste. The production of value-added products from waste glycerol strongly determines the improvement of the economic viability of biofuel production and corresponds to the model of a waste-free and emission-free circular economy. This paper characterises the mechanisms and evaluates the efficiency of existing methods for microbiological utilisation of waste glycerol into liquid biofuels, including biodiesel, bioethanol and biobutanol, and identifies further production avenues of value-added products. In addition, it presents the results of a bibliographical analysis of publications related to the production of liquid fuels and economically valuable products from glycerol, assesses the progress of research and application work and, finally, identifies areas for future research."
pub.1047231331,Life-Cycle Analysis of Biofuels and Electricity for Transportation Use,"As the global population and economy continue to grow, demand for energy will continue to grow. The transportation sector has been relying solely on petroleum, consuming more than 50 % of the global world oil production. The United States is the top oil-importer country. Two major issues facing the transportation sector in the U.S. and other major countries are energy security and environmental sustainability. Improvements in the energy efficiency of vehicles and the substitution of petroleum fuels with alternative fuels can help slow the growth in the demand for petroleum oil and mitigate the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels and electricity are being promoted for their potential reduction of petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions. This chapter examines the potential reduction of life-cycle energy use and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of biofuels in internal combustion engine vehicles and electricity in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery-powered electric vehicles."
pub.1142161540,Extending LCA Methodology for Assessing Liquid Biofuels by Phosphate Resource Depletion and Attributional Land Use/Land Use Change,"Many pathways towards reaching defossilization goals build on a substantially increased production of bio-based products and energy carriers including liquid biofuels. This is, amongst others, limited by land and phosphorous availability. However, it is challenging to adequately capture these limitations in LCA using state-of-the-art LCI and LCIA methods. We propose two new methods to overcome these challenges: (1) attributional land use and land use change (aLULUC) evenly attributes LU-/LUC-related burdens (emissions) occurring in a country to each hectare of cropland used in that country and (2) phosphate rock demand as a stand-alone resource indicator for a finite resource that cannot be replaced. Approach, calculations and used factors are described for both methods, and exemplary results for biofuels are presented. We conclude that both methods can yield additional insight and can support finding solutions for current challenges in agriculture."

The successful utilization of biomass derived from agricultural feedstocks to replace petroleum and petrochemical products would strongly support the sustainable bio-economy and biorefinery industry around the world. C5 and C6 sugars produced by the deconstruction of lignocellulosic materials through hydrolysis processes can be further converted to key intermediate chemicals, including furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furan and organic acids. Among these, furfural is considered as a promising biomass-derived platform which can be a key intermediate for producing a variety of C4 and C5 species, such as, furan, tetrahydrofuran, pentanediol, lactic acid, and levulinic acid. This review will show the catalytic processes, especially, heterogeneous catalysis, for converting furfural into value-added biochemicals and biofuels. The applications of these compounds are added as background information, and the research trends based on several publications and patents in the past decade are intensively analyzed."

pub.1113528636,Regulation and production of lignocellulolytic enzymes from Trichoderma reesei for biofuels production," Lignocellulosic biomass serves as a renewable feedstock for production of biofuels and value-added biochemicals, and biorefinery of lignocellulosic feedstocks contributes greatly to the sustainable development of economy. However, release of fermentable sugars from lignocellulose is suffering from the high cost and low efficiency of lignocellulolytic enzymes. Filamentous fungi, especially Trichoderma reesei, are considered as the most efficient producers of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, and improvement of enzyme production efficiency and optimization of enzyme composition are of great significance for biorefinery of lignocellulosic biomass. This review introduces the effects of environmental conditions, such as carbon and nitrogen sources, light and pH, on cellulase production from filamentous fungi. In addition, the recent progress on the novel regulatory network and the strategies for efficient cellulase induction and production in filamentous fungi are discussed. Optimization of cellulase ingredients and the effects of accessory enzymes on lignocellulose hydrolysis are also summarized. Efficient production of an optimized cocktail of lignocellulolytic enzymes with improved hydrolysis efficacy will greatly contribute to biofuels production from lignocellulosic biomass."

Lithuania has limited quantity of indigenous energy resources and is depended upon the import of energy resources, such as natural gas, petroleum and hard coal. Up to the year 2009 about 70–80% of electricity was produced from NPP. Lithuanian energy dependence from energy resources in 2009 was about 50.3%. At the end of 2009, NPP was decommissioned and the structure of gross inland fuel and energy consumption changed radically. Lithuania׳s energy dependence on the imports of fuel increased to about 82% and considerably exceeded the EU average 54%. The share of indigenous and renewable energy sources (RES) in gross inland fuel and energy consumption increased from 14.7% in 2009 to 21.4% in 2013 from which about 86% of RES belonged to solid biofuels. The RES became one of the main driving forces of the country׳s economy.In this paper, the Lithuanian solid biofuel resources and energy production up to the 2013 are presented. Growing stock volume, forest coverage, productivity of stands and consumption for energy production in Lithuania and its counties are defined. Fuels and energy flows diagram and distribution of solid biofuels by economy sectors and consumer groups are shown. Solid biofuels usage impact to gross inland and final energy consumption was studied. Implementation of solid biofuels for heat and electricity generation in Lithuania was researched. Solid biofuel prices were examined and comparison with prices of natural gas and fuel oil was done. Principles and criteria for sustainable solid biofuels production and usage were disclosed. The reduction of total greenhouse gases emissions in Lithuania and other EU countries were shown. Strategic initiatives to increase the RES share in electricity and heating sectors till 2020 were highlighted."
pub.1176151107,RELEVANCE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIOFUEL PRODUCTION,"Strategic management of modern enterprises must take into account the goals of sustainable development, which makes the study of biofuel production extremely relevant. This issue is important for agricultural enterprises, as they can simultaneously serve as both suppliers of raw materials for biofuels and as producers and consumers of biofuels. The production of biofuels from plant biomass raises discussions regarding sustainability, the effectiveness of greenhouse gas emission reductions, the importance for agriculture, and the food-or-fuel dilemma. Therefore, the aim of the research is to determine the advantages and prospects for the development of enterprises that supply raw materials and produce biofuels using animal fats in Ukraine as a type of activity for agricultural producers. The possibilities and experience of using livestock waste for the purpose of obtaining energy and biofuel production in the countries of the European Union are considered in the article. The results of the study indicate an increase in the consumption of biofuels from animal fats in the EU countries. This creates new opportunities for Ukrainian agricultural enterprises through the export of animal fats. The largest producer and exporter of animal fats in Ukraine is PrJSС “MHP”. The advantages of producing biofuels from animal fats have been identified, which include economic benefits for agricultural enterprises, energy supply stability, stimulation of research and innovation, reduction of environmental impact, and the development of a circular economy. At the same time, potential risks associated with the production of biofuels from animal fats are highlighted. These risks include the need to ensure environmental safety and ethical use of resources, for which appropriate legal acts and regulations need to be developed. The integration of biofuels from animal fats into existing energy systems must also be addressed. As a result of the research, a conclusion was made about the prospects for the creation of bioenergy enterprises in Ukraine and the increase in the export volumes of animal fats, which serve as raw materials for biodiesel production."
pub.1050351871,Economic and Environmental Aspects of Biofuels,"Within the framework of sustainable development, a quadruple transition (demographic, food, energetic and environmental) is necessary. The integrated biomass valorization, including the production of biofuels via the biorefinery concept lies at the cross section of these global challenges. Biofuels production competes for water and land use with respect to feed and food production. Securing these resources in an uncertain geopolitical environment is a strategic issue for many countries. It also has favorable (climate change mitigation) and adverse implications (fertilizers consumption, local pollutions). Therefore, the topic leads to huge political and economic debates at national and international scales. The results obtained from the implementation of supportive strategies for the development of this “new” bioeconomy indicate, at least in the near future, mixed results in comparison to the objectives that have been set. This may be explained by windfall effects created on the international markets and underline two imperative needs. The development and improvement of environmental methods, such as life cycle assessment expanded to the scope of international trade and not restricted to the regional or national economies will be necessary in order to install ambitious and unambiguous agreements for policymaker’s in the future international conferences such as the ones on climate change."
pub.1160568559,Impact of large-scale Bio-CCS deployment on forest biomass competition and forest industry production,"This study investigates the implications of large-scale Bio-CCS deployment on forest-based biofuel, kraft pulp, and district heating production, focusing on the resulting biomass competition. Using the Nordic Forest Sector Model (NFSM) with a Bio-CCS add-on, we integrate negative emission trading into the EU Emissions Trading System across a range of CO2 price levels. The findings reveal that biofuel production increases with higher carbon dioxide prices, with different technologies demonstrating profitability at different price points. As CO2 prices rise, the competition for high-quality biomass intensifies between the biofuel and kraft pulp sectors, while district-heating biomass boilers serve as important buffers. Notably, The deployment of Bio-CCS in kraft pulp mills and biofuel plants significantly raises the demand for pulpwood, while district heating remains unaffected. As a result, district heating systems consume more forest residues and industrial residues. Consequently, increased use of Bio-CCS results in higher pulpwood and sawdust prices. The extreme test with a carbon price of 300€/tCO2 reveals a higher risk of carbon sequestration leakage, while the increased harvest levels in the studied areas remain sustainable. This modeling approach and its main conclusions offer valuable insights for other forest-based economies."
pub.1171794429,Unlocking High-Value Products from Diatoms via Biorefinery Processes for a Sustainable Biocircular Economy,"As a repository of valuable pigments, fatty acids, and proteins, microalgae, particularly diatoms, make promising foundations for bioprospecting of biomedical, nutraceuticals, biofuel, feed, and food. Therefore, they are considered as next generation biomass. The necessity to valorize these biomasses is essential to bolster the economic feasibility of their industrial production through diverse biorefinery processes. The capacity for conducting multiple extractions concurrently offers prospects for obtaining various metabolites, biogas, and biofertilizers from diatom biomass. This unique feature significantly enhances the economic sustainability of diatom-based biorefineries. An effective biorefinery approach is highly desirable as it has the capability to fully capitalize the potential of diatoms. This chapter offers insights into the inherent value of diatoms and outlines the scenario of biorefinery processes aimed at realizing a sustainable biocircular economy. This information could serve as a solid foundation for making well-informed and profitable decisions in the realm of diatombased bioproducts, thereby contributing to both economic success and sustainability."

pub.1107149571,Chapter 5 Sustainable Waste-to-Energy Technologies: Fermentation,"The food industry contributes significantly to the global economy, and there is great interest in continuously improving economic and environmental performance in this sector. At the same time, depletion of natural resources and the rising price of raw materials draw attention to the need to develop fuels from renewable energy sources, especially waste materials. Production of biofuels, particularly fuel alcohols using lignocellulosic biomass, has gained increased interest over the last decade. As the cost of processing lignocellulosic raw materials is very high, it is reasonable to evaluate cheaper and renewable raw materials like food waste to produce fuel alcohols and other clean fuels like hydrogen. Food waste is a rich source of nutrients for microbes and can be converted to biofuels using fermentation processes. This not only contributes to development of low-carbon renewable fuels like ethanol, butanol, and hydrogen, but also helps in effective utilization of wastes resources from the food sector to obtain economic and environmental benefits. Integrating fuel production from food waste into existing biofuel infrastructure can be very economical, since food waste can generally be obtained at low or zero cost. However, several technological and economic barriers must be addressed to commercialize biofuel production from food wastes."

The dynamic SC model involves conflicting multi-objective, multi-feed, multi-product, multi-technology, multi-transport, and multi-echelon aspects from the 2018–26 time period. The sustainable techno-economic-environmental friendly model provides solutions to the major challenge of the biofuel energy sector i.e. biomass feed unavailability and biofuel demand fluctuation depicting real-time stochasticity to be handled using probabilistic-based chance constraint programming (CCP) methodology. The uncertain parameter is obtained via randomly generated data points following a Gaussian distribution. The model allows handling of multiple types of biomass feed with a non-uniform spatial–temporal distribution. Turnkey biofuel imports are blended with the indigenous products at the distributor echelon to maintain product quality and production shortfall simultaneously. The Pareto profit is calculated keeping in purview the money value with time, inflation, and asset depreciation using Net Present Value (NPV) and green-house-gas emissions (GHGe). The case study is implemented in a developing nation’s economy namely India where 70% of the nation’s population depends on agriculture and forestry. The CCP-based approach provides a significant result in terms of carbon savings of 90.38% and contributes to 7.69% of the nation’s earnings. Further, the sensitivity study indicates the need for at least 24.98% biomass feed supply to avoid the collapse of the bioenergy sector.Graphical abstract"
pub.1057944836,Perspectives on achieving sustainable energy production and use,"The traditional definition of sustainability calls for policies and strategies that meet society’s present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Through the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, U.S. policy formally established the goal of creating and maintaining “conditions under which [humans] and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.” However, we have not yet succeeded in making sustainability operational. The long-standing and current debates on setting energy policy, regulating greenhouse gases, and promoting alternate fuels illustrate the complexity of making sustainability operational. Achieving operational sustainability requires three critical elements: advances in science and technology, application of effective government regulations and policies, and green business practices. Not only are these elements necessary, all three must work together across the economy. A key lesson drawn from the history of environmental regulation and especially in the climate debate is that sustainability cannot be advanced without a convergence of government and business interests even when the requisite technology is available. The biofuel system presents an immediate and tangible test case for the successful interaction of these three critical elements. The massive investments in science and technology by both government and industry to develop new feedstocks and conversion methods are showing promise. From a regulatory perspective, existing statutes and new mandates impact all parts of the biofuel supply chain—a complex system involving feedstocks, conversion technologies, transport, storage, handling, and end use. Forward-looking businesses in the biofuel sector are integrating sustainability objectives into their business strategies, such as designing feedstock conversion processes to generate biofuel coproducts that can add substantial revenue. The combination and coordination of such activities have the potential to achieve sustainable biofuel production and to demonstrate the kind of critical approaches that are essential to making sustainability operational in this and other energy sectors."
pub.1136213656,3 Biomass to Fuel and Chemicals: Enabling Technologies,"Circular bioeconomy aims at strengthening the resource efficiency by recycling materials that substitute fossil by the carbon present in biomass to obtain sustainable neutral energy as well as chemical sources. The concept of utilization of biomass as a source of renewable energy and other commercially important products is very much overlapping with the concept of circular economy and this intersection of circular economy and bioeconomy can be termed as circular bioeconomy. These biomass resources can be classified into agricultural residue, forest biomass, energy crops, algal biomass, and urban waste. Their conversion to biofuels and chemicals can be accomplished through different thermochemical, physiological, and biological pathways. While thermochemical processes involve the application of high temperature, physicochemical and biological processes employ chemicals and microorganisms, respectively, to obtain value-added products. The bioproducts produced are classified into four generations depending based on the source. The most commonly derived biofuels and chemicals are syngas, bioethanol, bio-oil, hydrogen, etc. However, the cost related to the biomass collection, segregation, transportation, and storage is still a concern. But, with reform in the biomass management system and forming laws encouraging the re-utilization of generated waste, the concept of circular bioeconomy can be implemented to address the issues of climate change, environmental pollution, and fossil fuel depletion. Comparative evaluation of large-scale projects is necessary to identify the best available technology for biofuel production. Furthermore, the existing sustainability issues of the biomass supply chain should be addressed to ensure all-year-round delivery of feedstock to the conversion facility. A robust business model would attract investors and accelerate the commercialization of biomass-derived biofuel."
pub.1162878229,Recent Advances in Seaweed Biorefineries and Assessment of Their Potential for Carbon Capture and Storage,"Seaweeds are among the most important biomass feedstocks for the production of third generation biofuels. They are also efficient in carbon sequestration during growth, and produce a variety of high value chemicals. Given these characteristics together with the relatively high carbohydrate content, seaweeds have been discussed as an ideal means for CO2 capture and biofuel production. Though third generation biofuels have emerged as some of the best alternatives to fossil fuels, there is currently no large-scale production or mainstream use of such liquid fuels due to the many technical challenges and high production costs. The present study describes the concept of coastal marine biorefineries as the most cost-effective and sustainable approach for biofuel production from seaweeds as well as atmospheric carbon capture and storage (CCS). The suggested refinery system makes use of marine resources, namely seawater, seaweed, and marine microorganisms. Firstly, extensive screening of the current literature was performed to determine which technologies would enable the emergence of such a novel biorefinery system and its merits over conventional refineries. Secondly, the study investigates various scenarios assessing the potential of seaweeds as a means of carbon sequestration. We demonstrate that the removal of 100 Gigatons of excess CO2 using seaweed farms can be achieved in around 4 months to less than 12 years depending on the area under cultivation and the seaweed species. The total bioethanol that could be generated from the harvested biomass is around 8 trillion litres. In addition, high-value chemicals (HVC) that could potentially be recovered from the process represent a considerable opportunity with multi-billion-dollar commercial value. Overall, coastal marine biorefineries have strong potential for a sustainable green economy and represent a rapid approach for climate change mitigation."
pub.1112779112,Assessing Microalgal Biodiesel Sustainability via MCI and LCA Frameworks,"Natural resource extraction have increased three folds during the last four decades. Of which, economic development has been its main driving factor. Ensuring material security and environmental sustainability is of utmost importance for a sustainable economic growth. Circular economy addresses this challenge, via promoting reutilization of a product’s components and promoting value durability. It promotes a closed loop economy which reduces virgin resource extraction and promotes recycling. The energy requirement for this economic system will require energy sources of high recycling potential. A good candidate may be found in biofuels, because of its quick reutilization of the atmospheric carbon dioxide. Currently, one of the most promising feedstocks for biofuels is microalgae. It has the capacity to grow in non-arable land and produce significant amounts of oil per hectare. Several studies have assessed the environmental impact of its production, but none has considered its applicability in a circular economy. In this paper, we propose the frameworks of life cycle assessment and the material circularity indicator by the Ellen MacArthur foundation to assess the applicability of microalgal biodiesel in a circular economy. We utilized the life cycle assessment frameworks in assessing the feedstock’s impact to global warming, resource depletion, and bulk waste, while the material circularity indicator is utilized to quantify its reutilization. Comparison was carried out to jatropha biodiesel as a reference feedstock due to its similar popularity. The results of the study can provide new perspectives on how to promote microalgal biodiesel in a circular economy."

pub.1147054252,Participation of Smallholder Farmers in Modern Bioenergy Value Chains in Africa: Opportunities and Constraints,"Advancements in the modern bioenergy sector have not comprehensively involved smallholder farmers. To date, their role in developing sustainable bioenergy solutions has been peripheral, seen only as potential producers of bioenergy feedstock. This identity means smallholder farmers are unable to take advantage of the numerous opportunities in the sector. This review is meant to assess the available opportunities and constraints for smallholder farmers to engage in the bioenergy value chains. The major findings show that (1) there are minimum policy provisions to support smallholder farmer participation in the bioenergy sector; (2) existing sector incentives are inclined to benefit already established biofuel companies; (3) collective action remains the best approach for engaging smallholder farmers in bioenergy value chains; (4) smallholder farmers human capital is insufficient to support their participation beyond their traditional role as producers; (5) inherent smallholder farmer challenges related to limited access to land, lack of knowledge, inadequate labour and water scarcity affect their ability to participate; (6) public investment in bioenergy in Africa has been low and not sustained; (7) conditions in biofuel production models involuntarily exclude other smallholder farmers from participating and (8) smallholder farmers are unable to utilize opportunities offered through the second-generation biofuels. Some of the major recommendations of the article include the need to establish sector incentives (including financial support) directly targeting smallholder farmers, improving land tenure security, supporting comprehensive and practical training programmes, re-orientation of existing smallholder farmer cooperatives and promotion of investment in research and development of second-generation biofuels."

pub.1167997792,The Multifaceted Perspective on the Role of Green Synthesis of Nanoparticles in Promoting a Sustainable Green Economy,"The current economic development paradigm, which is based on steadily rising resource consumption and pollution emissions, is no longer viable in a world with limited resources and ecological capacity. The ""green economy"" idea has presented this context with a chance to alter how society handles the interplay between the environmental and economic spheres. The related concept of ""green nanotechnology"" aims to use nano-innovations within the fields of materials science and engineering to generate products and processes that are economically and ecologically sustainable, enabling society to establish and preserve a green economy. Many different economic sectors are anticipated to be impacted by these applications, including those related to corrosion inhibitor nano fertilizers, nano remediation, biodegradation, heavy metal detection, biofuel, insecticides & pesticides, and catalytic CO2 reduction. These innovations might make it possible to use non-traditional water sources safely and to create construction materials that are enabled by nanotechnology, improving living and ecological conditions. Therefore, our aim is to highlight how nanotechnology is being used in the green economy and to present promises for nano applications in this domain. Additionally, we want to critically examine the practical difficulties these applications raise, especially in consideration of any possible implications for the health and safety of those employed within this innovative sector.

pub.1131884252,Potential Raw Materials and Production Technologies for Biorefineries,"Biomass use has increased exponentially in the last decade. Its use is not only limited to biofuel production but it has expanded to chemicals and direct bioenergy, among others. First‐ and second‐generation biomass has been used lately for biofuels production. However, the biomass used in these generations is from edible crops, which threatens the food security and competes with the use of productive land. Therefore, it is necessary to look for biomass that is readily available and has the potential of obtaining value added materials without risking the food security. Efforts have been made in converting the biomass using efficient, sustainable, and cost‐effective processes into useful products. Although, processes are available on large scale but improvements are still required to make the product market competitive. This chapter highlights the potential raw materials and biomass conversion technologies for moving toward a bio‐based economy."
pub.1072639832,Battles over Biofuels in Europe: NGOs and the Politics of Markets,"In this paper, we argue that a consortium of NGOs has played a significant role in shaping the market for, and restricting the use of, biofuels as an alternative to conventional fuels for road transport in Europe. This paper considers why a number of NGOs (Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, RSPB, Friends of the Earth) have chosen to enter the biofuels debate, and how they have variously developed policy, agreed a political campaign, and exercised political influence, in a key area of the world's response to major global climate change: how to reduce the carbon footprint of transport. We found that in many cases the development of NGO policy has been driven more by narrow political opportunities for influence than by broader and more coherent policy responses to global climate change or economic development, or indeed rigorous assessment of the scientific evidence. The research provides evidence of how NGO policies and lobbying significantly affected biofuel policy changes, review processes, target reductions, and sustainability regulation in the UK and in Europe. We consider that politically instituted markets, such as the one for biofuels, are examples of the emergence of new forms of governance of capitalist political economies facing a novel and pressing combination of drivers (climate change, energy security, resource constraints, and sustainable land-use). Politically instituted markets open up possibilities for political intervention from non-governmental or party-political actors, in ways that other markets do not. If political shaping of markets by NGOs becomes more widespread, issues of democratic legitimacy and public scrutiny will become ever more pressing. The paper is based on in-depth interviews with senior scientific directors and policy-makers in five NGOs, and of senior officials in UK government departments and the European Commission (DG Environment and DG Transport and Energy). It forms part of a wider ESRC research project in Brazil, the USA and Europe on the Transition to Sustainable Bioeconomies."

The objective of this research is to understand the processes involved in this type of production, including the challenging issue of mycotoxin contamination. These toxins can be metabolized by microorganisms during the fermentation process, making the material suitable for animal feed. The selection of articles was made through Scopus and VOSviewer, which were analyzed to understand the feasibility of producing bioethanol from residual barley. Concluding that residual barley is a viable option for bioethanol production, as it contains significant amounts of starch. Furthermore, it can bring economic and environmental benefits, presenting advantages for the entire production chain, aligning with the principles of a circular economy by utilizing waste that would otherwise be discarded. The research also highlights the importance of adopting sustainable practices in biofuel production."

pub.1157858170,2 Lignocellulosic biomass: A feedstock to support the circular economy,"Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is a promising sustainable material for future liquid fuel. The diminishing fossil fuel reserves and negative environmental effects have driven accelerated research in the biofuels domain. Agroindustrial waste-derived LCB is a competitive nonfood feedstock for the sustainable production of critical liquid fuels, such as bioethanol or biobutanol, and chemical compounds through biorefinery processes. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the primary components of LCB. Large quantities of sugars present in cellulose and hemicellulose can be biochemically synthesized using acid as a catalyst or enzymatically destroyed and converted into biofuels via fermentation. Catabolic enzymes reduce the pretreatment of lignocelluloses to simple sugars in hydrolysis reactors during bioethanol production from LCB. Intriguing pretreatment methods based on biological approaches to enhance the efficacy of bioconversion processes and overcome barriers to the commercialization of renewable biorefineries are required to increase the efficiency of bioconversion processes and remove obstacles to their commercialization. The efficient and cost-effective bioethanol production from LCB depends on developing a suitable pretreatment method. Several combinations of bioethanol, biohydrogen, biojet fuel, biomethane, and biodiesel have been evaluated in a biorefinery system, and their potential has been proven to be substantial. Several alternative pretreatment techniques, such as physical, chemical, biological, or a combination of these, help to improve lignocellulose breakdown, thereby decreasing the recalcitrance biomass and enabling enzyme access to their substrates. Nonetheless, the pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials generates several lignocellulose-derived byproducts that inhibit microbial growth and fermentation yields. The present work focuses on the sustainable utilization of lignocellulosic waste biomass, its pretreatment, and its utilization as a feedstock for biofuel production in a biorefinery."
pub.1009308311,Assessing the current Brazilian sugarcane industry and directing developments for maximum fossil fuel mitigation for the international petrochemical market,"Abstract The EU proposes that 5.75% of the transportation fuels market consist of biofuels by 2010 and the USA proposes that all gasoline be blended with 10% bioethanol by 2012. While these targets have not yet been reached, an aura of critique is emerging, arguing that biofuel mandates are not sustainable. One of the major ensuing topics surrounding biofuel sustainability is the food versus fuel debate in reference to first‐generation (or food‐based) technology. This article will reveal that for the specific case of sugarcane in Brazil, first‐generation bioethanol is more sustainable than expansion to include second‐generation (non‐food‐based) technology. Two life cycle assessments are conducted. First, a cradle‐to‐factory gate analysis with focus on fossil fuel reduction potential. Fertile land is consumed and occupied by all biomass crops; the biomass option with the highest mitigation potential per land can be considered the most sustainable and least intrusive to food production. Ethanol, on average, can mitigate 104GJ/ha/a, which is equivalent to 17 barrels of oil annually. This can increase to 353GJ/ha/a for the foreseeable best practice situations, higher than the second‐generation option. A first‐step chemical biorefinery producing ethylene achieves 509GJ/ha/a. Second, the BASF‐developed eco‐efficiency model, which links both environmental impacts and economic profitability in one, easy‐to‐interpret graph, is used as validation. Overall it is calculated that a best practice first‐generation ethanol and its later dehydration to ethylene are the most eco‐efficient options. The biobased economy deserves highly specific assessments. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"

High titer ethanol (5%) can be achieved from corn and wheat by using simpler steps (grinding/milling, cooking, and liquefaction) before fermentation using the yeast strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Recently, bioethanol from corn and wheat is adopted at industrial-scale in several developed and developing countries to fulfill the demands of the bioethanol. Fuel ethanol production is an energy-efficient process today, additional research is ongoing to improve its long-term economic viability."
pub.1163579788,Yeast-Mediated Biomass Valorization for Biofuel Production: A Literature Review,"The European Union has recommended that about 10–50% of the global energy requirement should be supplemented by waste biomass resources by 2050 in order to achieve the objective of having net-zero-emission economies. This has led to intensive research being conducted on developing appropriate biofuel production technologies using advanced or integrated systems to tackle local, national, and global energy challenges using waste feedstock. Researchers have realized the potential of microbes (e.g., yeast strains) for bioenergy production. For this paper, both non-oleaginous and oleaginous yeasts were reviewed, with a specific focus being placed on their diversity in metabolism and tolerance to the various challenges that arise from the use of waste feedstock and influence bioprocessing. Gathering in-depth knowledge and information on yeast metabolism has paved the way for newer and better technologies to employ them for consolidated biorefineries to not only produce biofuels but also to cut down process expenses and decrease the risks of net carbon emissions. The rationale for using yeast strains improved by metabolic engineering and genetic manipulation that can substantially meet the challenges of alternate fuel resources is also described in this paper. This literature review presents the advantages and disadvantages of yeast-based biofuel production and highlights the advancements in technologies and how they contrast to conventional methods. Over the last decade, scientific publications have endorsed the idea of biorefineries for environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and sustainable biofuel production."

In this paper, a new energy development and management model is proposed. This proposed approach aims at utilizing available natural resources and considers the community as the main stakeholder to implement the model. Locally produced wastes are considered as one source for generating energy to ensure “zero-waste” living. Some sustainable energy development techniques, such as cooking stoves, biofuel cells, green biodiesel, and direct solar energy, are also proposed. To justify this model, a case study was conducted in Mineville community of Nova Scotia, Canada, to show that local people can be self-reliant in terms of supplying their energy needs. This model is also preferred as a component in improving the local economy in a sustainable manner."
pub.1171528353,ENERGY CROPS FOR BIOFUEL PRODUCTION,"Biofuels (biodiesel and bioethanol) produced from various biobased sources have recently attracted a lot of attention because of their potential to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions while lowering the growing reliance of the globe on fossil fuels. The goal might be to provide biomass-based alternative fuel that is both readily available and economically viable in order to meet both national goals for biofuel blending and the energy deficit. Currently, maize, sugarcane, molasses, wheat, and other grains crops, cassava, sugar beets, palm, soybean, rapeseed, etc. are used for biofuel production. Recent consideration has been given to lignocellulosic biomass as another potential feedstock because of its non-food competition and abundant supply. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used to ferment the sugars found in sugar cane and sugar beets as well as those obtained from the starch in corn and other cereals in order to economically produce ethanol from a range of feedstocks. The additional bio-resources, in addition to cellulosic biomass being the ideal substitute for producing bioethanol and non-edible oil containing biomaterials for producing biodiesel for vehicle traffic, might make the energy sector sustainable. The production of biofuels from energy crops is essential to the growth of the global economy and the slowing of climate change. The CO2 released during the combustion of biomass is absorbed by plants to grow. Because the quantity of CO2 emitted during usage has already been fixed during plant growth, no net CO2 is produced when agricultural biomass is used to generate energy"
pub.1113233250,Biochemical Strategies for Enhanced Biofuel Production,"The socio-environmental issues such as increasing world population, globalization, environmental concerns, and energy security lead to utmost need for utilizing biodegradable agricultural wastes for the production of biofuels. Therefore, the focus is to deploy technologies for utilization of renewable lignocellulosic sources, which are available worldwide in copious amounts, for the production of second-generation biofuels. Lignocellulosic ethanol is considered as one of the environmentally-friendly alternatives to fossil fuel, which is produced by exploiting lignocellulosic biomass using different techniques. There are three major steps involved in bioethanol production: pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, and fermentation. Pretreatment allows increasing surface area and getting accessible cellulosic material to hydrolytic enzymes; this is further hydrolyzed to fermentable pentose and hexose sugars through enzymatic saccharification. The overall economy of the process depends on pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, and utilization of both pentose and hexose sugars to ethanol. The integrated fermentation approaches result in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation to enhance bioethanol yield and productivity. The development of industrial strains for bioethanol production is another challenge to utilize both pentose and hexose sugars, and withstand under adverse environmental conditions, i.e., high ethanol and inhibitors tolerance, and tolerance to high temperature and low pH. The present chapter focuses on pretreatment, enzymatic and co-fermentation strategies, integrated approaches, and optimization on process parameters to enhance the lignocellulosic ethanol yield for sustainable biofuel production."

The pre-dried MSS was analyzed using proximate and ultimate analyses, FTIR spectroscopy, and DTA-TGA thermogravimetry to evaluate their suitability as a feedstock for thermochemical conversion and biofuels production. The optimization of the pyrolysis reactions was performed using a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor and the investigation of the influence of some key operational parameters (final temperature and heating rate) on the pyrolysis products distribution shows that 600 °C and 10 °C/min are the optimal conditions to obtain a maximum bio-oil yield (44.31 wt.%). The characterization of the obtained pyrolysis products indicates (i) a high aliphatic character of the bio-oil, with the occurrence of several organic compounds (n-alkanes, n-alkenes, carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds); (ii) good fuel properties of the pyrolytic oil comparable to those of fossil fuels, promoting its application  as liquid biofuel; (iii) a high calorific value of the obtained syngas (HHV around 16.68 MJ/m3)  encouraging its use as a source of renewable energy or for pyrolysis reactor heating (iv) a highly porous biochar with good carbon and nitrogen contents which could be investigated as a biofertilizer."
pub.1127621621,9 Pectinases: significance in the digestion of pectin-rich agrowaste,"Sustainable economic development is one of the primary requirements of each economy. In order to keep our environment clean and to eliminate greenhouse gases, alternative sources of energy, such as biofuel, are needed. Biofuel provides energy security, it builds economic growth, and reduces the effect of CO2 which impacts negatively on our environment. Lignocellulosic biomass has proven to be a potential feedstock for the production of biofuels as it is feasible and the most abundant biopolymer available on Earth. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has ample ability to produce biofuel while also reducing CO2 emissions. Enzymatic hydrolysis is the process used for the alteration of LCB into substances for the production of the biofuels. LCB is mainly made up of lignin, the polysaccharides, cellulose and hemicelluloses, and pectin. Pectin functions like the matrix on which the cellulose and hemicelluloses are embedded. For complete degradation of lignocellulosic biomass pectin removal is required, which can be achieved by the action of pectinase. Microbial pectinases can be regarded as an eco-friendly approach to cellulosic degradation. Also, use of pectinases reduces the glutinousness of feed and increases its absorption ability, while also releasing nutrients by the action of enzymes which reduces the amount of feces. This chapter discusses the applications of pectinase in various industries, its production, classification, and the future prospects of pectinase enzyme."

pub.1168734549,The potential seaweed resources assessment: Its cultivation prospect and future biofuel feedstock,"Global issues on energy and fuel for sustainable development industrial and household system are a major concern in the world economy. Biofuel is a renewable energy source that can potentially be a replacement for fossil fuels. The utilization of algal biomass or seaweed organic matter is a good source of ethanol, methanol, biobutanol, and biodiesel. Malaysia’s waters recorded approximately 400 species of macroalgae, with several species found to be a potential source for biofuel application. An expedition study for the seaweed natural resources was carried out in December 2016 in coastal areas in Johor and Melaka, Peninsular Malaysia.

The design of offshore mariculture system specifically for seaweed farming for biomass production for biofuel. The prototype was constructed and deployed in Bidong Island, Terengganu in 2016 before the monsoon. At the end of the monsoon period, the prototype is still stable in situ. Selected seaweed species with biofuel potential were trial cultivated on the system and the growth performance of the particular species was monitored. The suggested species for biofuel are Gracilaria and Ulva, while Kappaphycus is targeted for the food industry. Gracilaria and Ulva were also studied for their bioremediation potential and suitability to grow on the system. Gracilaria spp. was able to grow on the system, indicating the designed system is feasible for biomass production of seaweed. Further, the selected seaweed species can function as biofilters for the nutrients in the environment and acceptability for a wide salinity range meaning that the system can be applied in different locations such as estuary, inshore, or offshore. Seaweed biofuel and its subsequent advantage related to pollution-free energy generation is of critical importance."
pub.1181229410,From biogas to biomethane: Comparison of sustainable scenarios for upgrading plant location based on greenhouse gas emissions and cost assessments,"Addressing the global energy crisis and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) necessitates shifting towards renewable energy sources, with biomethane emerging as a viable alternative. This study evaluated three scenarios for biomethane production from biogas: localized upgrading for biofuel use, district upgrading for biofuel use, and district upgrading with grid injection. By utilizing economic assessments and spatial and network analysis, the optimal locations for upgrading plants were identified to minimize transportation costs and GHG emissions (CO2 equivalents). Results indicate that Scenario 1 achieves the lowest emissions and operating costs (41 MEUR), while Scenarios 2 and 3, despite higher initial investments (152–173 MEUR), offer significant economies of scale (1187–1321 MEUR) and substantial annual production capacities (8.8 × 106 Sm³ of biomethane). Comparative and sensitivity analyses show renewable energy sources reduce GHG emissions by up to 83.7% and significantly lower operating costs. This research underscores the critical role of strategic planning and renewable energy integration in optimizing the biomethane value chain for environmental sustainability and economic viability while also emphasizing the need for further research to refine these findings."
pub.1126105194,Financing Strategies for Sustainable Bioenergy and the Commodity Chemicals Industry,"The global economy is poised to follow a circular route to meet the sustainability goals compared to the linear model followed in the last two centuries for economic development. Biofuels and bio‐based industry that are based on utilizing renewable biomass for value‐added products have emerged in recent decades to challenge and complement the existing energy and chemical industry. While the technological prowess and market penetration of these bio‐based products is on a positive trajectory, the financing options available to commercialize them are in their infancy. The existing methods of technology valuation are skewed towards opportunities that are high on return investments and the bio‐based industry has to face challenges to meet investors' requirements, primarily due to high initial capital investment, long gestation period before returns, and feedstock variability; thereby increasing the risk. The valuation methods of investment bankers and institutional investors should change to include the social and environmental aspects, along with economic factors, to manifest sustainable financing of projects. If this happens, sustainable bio‐based industry is on the right track to realize commercial and social success in the new economy."
pub.1173518376,Technological Processes in the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels,"Abstract  Air transport expansion in recent decades has been continuous. The main aviation fuels used so far are mainly petroleum products, the annual consumption of which (2017) amounts to approximately 300 Mt. The gases emitted by the aviation industry (carbon dioxide CO 2 , nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide) exert a powerful pressure on the environment. The development of the aviation industry will also provoke a growing demand for fuels, and the fuels used will deepen the environmental, social and economic effects. This necessitates the implementation of the concept of sustainability of aviation transport and the replacement of conventional with sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). In the coming years, the production of aviation biofuels will increase as part of the use of renewable energy and the development of the circular economy-bioeconomy. This report briefly presents the current status of developed and deployed bioreactive fuels in aviation; certified technologies; the potential raw materials that can be used and an assessment of the economic and environmental characteristics of biokerosenes. The report also indicates global initiatives and policies to promote the use of biofuels, as well as the commitments made by the airlines. "
pub.1141188867,An Overview of Electro‐Fermentation as a Platform for Future Biorefineries,"Many countries have set up policies to decrease fossil fuel dependency and petro‐based synthesis of commodity chemicals. Fermentative biofuels and bioresource recovery processes are expected to assist considerably in this context of sustainable transition to a bio‐based economy. The utilization of renewable resources such as waste biomass is often considered an attractive feature of fermentative bioprocesses. However, limitations regarding the robustness of process and selectivity of target products are often considered bottlenecks to their sustainable commercialization. Particularly, in conventional fermentation processes, microorganisms produce undesired by‐products to attain intracellular redox balance, which leads to a low yield of target products. Recently, electro‐fermentation has emerged as an innovative approach for changing metabolic pathways of fermentative microorganisms towards target products with higher yields and productivities by changing intracellular redox potential. Lab‐scale EF studies have successfully demonstrated superior performance over conventional fermentation to produce a wide variety of biofuels and commodity chemicals. This book chapter provides an overview of fundamental and applied aspects of various value‐added products synthesis with the EF process and identifies research gaps for future development."

The application of bioeconomics principles provides the use of by-products of agriculture, forestry, food waste, and wastewater as raw materials for electricity and heat. The objective is to analyse the prerequisites for bioenergy development as one of the circular economy areas. FGLS estimations are performed over the period of 2007–2018. The leading position in terms of bioenergy sphere growth is occupied by the European Union, followed by the countries of Asia and North America. The division of biomass into “traditional” and “modern” is discussed, where traditional biomass is mostly used for cooking and space heating in developing countries, while the EU is focusing on the development of second-generation (2G) biofuels when the biofuel is produced from non-food raw materials. It is estimated that the annual production of energy from renewable sources is about 225 thousand tons of o. e. in Ukraine. It is found that the legal field and the strategic directions of the bioeconomy in the European Union and Ukraine coincide, but the pace of development of bioenergy in Ukraine can be described as very slow. To increase the bioenergy potential, it is recommended to apply green tariffs, renewable energy certificates, and subsidies to energy producers."

The coloration step, a vital aspect of textile production, is notorious for its detrimental effects on the environment, particularly concerning water consumption, pollution, and resource depletion. This chapter delves into the multifaceted issues surrounding textile coloration wastewater and explores innovative solutions for its treatment and sustainable management based on microalgae cultivation. The current conventional treatment methods are critiqued for their energy-intensive nature, high capital costs, and generation of nonvaluable byproducts. In response, microalgae-based treatment emerges as a promising alternative, addressing effluent purification and the generation of valuable byproducts, such as pigments and biofuels. The valorization of microalgal biomass after treatment, specifically the extraction of pigments, is thoroughly examined. These natural pigments hold promise as sustainable alternatives for textile dyeing and functionalization, offering numerous advantages, including environmental friendliness, biodegradability, and potential incorporation into textile substrates for enhanced properties. Moreover, using microalgae presents a circular economy approach by reducing CO2 emissions, treating wastewater, and generating biofuels.

pub.1072434538,Carbon Remediation for the Airline Industry via ATF Drop-in Substitution: Strategic and Operational Perspective,"The need to address environmental challenges by aviation industry is apparently obvious. As evidenced within the industry, it takes a three pronged strategy - more efficient aircraft, improving operational efficiencies and development of sustainable biofuels. In terms of actual growth of airline business, the two major drivers are domestic air service expansion within BRIC economies and rapid spread of Low Cost Carrier (LLC) models. Focusing not only on environmental challenges, even sustainable business development and growth of LCC depends critically on ATF substitution by alternative fuels. The inherent need for carbon subsidy and airline-airport partnership towards sustainable substitution with bio-alternatives is discussed in first part of the paper. A framework for such an airline airport win-win partnership is delineated. In the second half of the paper, focus shifts to complexity of operationalisation of blended ATF strategy for airlines as well as manufacturer from a sophisticated operational safety and liability perspective. The need for aircraft manufacturer and airline cum airport partnerships for globally acceptable and operational safety for partial drop-in substitution on the lines of biofuel certification standardisation and usability is examined. The authors highlight that carbon neutral strategy by aviation industry is not just critical in terms of environmental dimension but as would be evidenced in the coming decades critical in terms of capitalistic interests as well."
pub.1167448677,Formation of the information and analytical support system for the development of biofuel industries on the base of agricultural sector enterprises,"The project proposal focuses on the role and importance of information in the transformation process of economic policy in general and agrarian policy in particular, given the programmed (by the Recovery Plan of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Fund Programme) inclination towards bioeconomic orientation of the recovery (reconstruction) of the national economy sectors from the war consequences, directing their further activities and coordinated ontogenesis towards sustainable and comprehensive socio-ecological and economic development of business entities (including agro-oriented and biofuel producers). The definition, scope and categorical differences between information and information-analytical support of agricultural enterprises, including those engaged in biomass processing into biofuels, are revealed. It has been proved that the quintessence of this ontogeny is the approximation of the European Green Deal's levers into the national regulatory framework, which allowed, among other things, to identify national, sectoral and niche progress in the relevant digital developments, “greening” of finance and further needs of Ukraine within the framework of EU membership and post-war recovery. The typologies of information and information-analytical support of agricultural enterprises engaged in the production of biofuels under the principles of “green” post-war recovery and bioeconomy are elaborated and presented. The importance of introducing and applying a unified universal information and analytical system, which includes an information system, a database, information resources and registers, in the economic practice of biofuel production in the agricultural sector of Ukraine is outlined. Features of the agricultural enterprises engaged in the production of biofuels are examined in terms of the architecture design of a unified system on information and analytical support of their activities, its compliance with the best European practices, including those related to traceability and safety of the agro-food value chain in the new military-driven socio-economic reality and the potential for substitution of imported diesel and petrol. A general concept of the information and analytical support system model is suggested, being acceptable under the martial law conditions for agricultural enterprises engaged in biofuel production. The article proposes a general concept of a model of an information and analytical support system which is acceptable under the legal regime of martial law for enterprises of the agricultural sector of economy engaged in biofuel production. Regarding the suggested system, it has been proved that the latter has sufficient potential for adaptation to specific operational needs, production conditions and security risks, allowing for the sectoral specifics of other enterprises in the agricultural sector of Ukraine."
pub.1132240096,Biofuel Production with Castor Bean: A Win–Win Strategy for Marginal Land,"The urgency to reduce resource depletion and waste production is expected to lead to an economy based on renewable resources. Biofuels, for instance, are a great green alternative to fossil fuel, but they are currently derived from edible vegetable oils such as soybean, palm, and sunflower. Concerns have been raised about the social–economic implication and ecological impacts of biodiesel production. Cultivating new lands as biodiesel feedstock rather than food supply, with the consequent increase in food prices, leads to so-called indirect land-use change (ILUC). Establishing bioenergy crops with phytoremediation ability on contaminated soils offers multiple benefits such as improving soil properties and ecosystem services, decreasing soil erosion, and diminishing the dispersion of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) into the environment. Castor bean is an unpalatable, high-biomass plant, and it has been widely demonstrated to possess phytoremediation capability for several PTEs. Castor bean can grow on marginal lands not suitable for food crops, has multiple uses as a raw material, and is already used in biodiesel production. These characteristics make it perfect for sustainable biodiesel production. Linking biofuel production with environmental remediation can be considered a win–win strategy."

Consequently, there is an urgent need for minimizing the CO2 level to tackle climate change. Utilization of CO2 for synthesizing valuable commodities, such as biofuel and biochemical, is an effective strategy toward mitigating climate change as well as the energy crisis. Moreover, the conversion of CO2 into valuable products is also a promising step for achieving carbon neutrality and exemplifying a circular economy. In this regard, several methods, such as physical, chemical, and biological, are available for the utilization and conversion of CO2. However, biological methods for the conversion of CO2 into biofuels and biochemicals are more sustainable as they are environmentally friendly and cost-effective compared to the chemical methods. Thus, in this chapter, different CO2 bioconversion processes with their efficacy and their limitations have been discussed.

The development of such biodevices requires significant improvements in terms of efficiency of enzyme immobilization at the electrodes, so as to enable direct electron transfer, and to increase and stabilize the current densities. Many works during the last years aimed at reaching higher current densities, thus power densities, while increasing the long term stability of the enzymatic bioelectrodes. Search for new enzymes, wild type or mutants, new entrapment procedures, but also new electrode architectures, have been targeted. This review focuses on the materials developed and involved during the last few years to meet these demands via nanostructuration of electrode interfaces. Discussion is essentially focused on cases where direct electron transfer between enzymes and electrochemical interfaces are involved. After having introduced the main reasons for the need of nanostructuration, the materials and methods that are newly developed are described. The consequences on improved performances for enzymatic bioelectrodes are discussed, and finally major challenges for future research are addressed."
pub.1149022066,Technological and environmental advantages of a new engine combustion mode: Dual Biofuel Intelligent Charge Compression Ignition,"With the rapid development of the world economy, the demand for energy will inevitably increase the resource shortage and environmental pollution problems. Therefore, the coordinated development of energy and environment is an important way to achieve the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, the dual biofuel intelligent charge compression ignition (ICCI) mode fuelled with butanol and biodiesel was demonstrated to achieve a high-efficiency and ultra-low emissions, which will have global real-world energy influence. The maximum thermal efficiency of the butanol/biodiesel ICCI mode is 3.5% higher than the absolute efficiency of the conventional mode, and the nitrogen oxide emissions decreased by 76.69% to 99.47%. The butanol/biodiesel ICCI mode has the potential to achieve carbon neutrality in the road transport sector and mitigate the greenhouse effect. Hence, direct air pollutants would be eliminated. Meanwhile, with the increasing production of biofuels worldwide, this work not only improves the environmental pollution and relieves the energy crisis, but also provides a method to deal with the mutual restraint between energy, environmental and technology."
pub.1136749079,Quality assessment of pellets and briquettes made from glued wood waste,"In accordance with sustainable economic and social development, Europe supports the use of energy from renewable sources to decrease the use of fossil fuels. Among renewable energy sources, wood, especially production wood waste from the supply chain, represents an exploitable source in line with a circular economy development. In this context, processing of residues produced by wood companies becomes an important resource. This work deals with the possible energy recovery of glued wood wastes. Two solid biofuels were produced from glued wood wastes: pellets and briquettes. They have been produced in collaboration with a local company and analyzed according to the applicable EN ISO international standards. The results were compared with the limits imposed by the standards in order to identify their quality class and their applicability to the current market. The amount of adhesive present in the wood wastes does not negatively affect the intrinsic characteristics of the material that is suitable for the production of solid biofuels. In addition, the amount of wood waste containing cross-linked polyurethane was calculated in order not to compromise the quality of solid biofuels made therefrom."
pub.1174138828,Agricultural Waste as a Source of Fine Chemicals Through Thermochemical Methods,"The escalating demand for sustainable sources of fine chemicals has drawn attention towards utilising agricultural waste as a valuable resource. This chapter explores the potential of agricultural waste conversion through thermochemical methods to yield fine chemicals. Thermochemical processes, including solvolysis, hydrolysis, hydrogenation, pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal liquefaction through conventional and non-conventional heating methods including microwave, ultrasonic, radiative heating, etc., stand out as transformative technologies for converting agricultural waste into biofuels like bio-oil, biochar and syngas. This chapter presents the key catalysts used for hydrolysis and solvolysis, including zeolites, heteropolyacids, metals, metal oxides, carbon-based catalysts, etc. Additionally, the importance of effective characterisation techniques for feedstock and the analysis of resulting biofuels, laying the foundation for proper utilisation in multiple applications, are highlighted. The potential of agricultural waste as a renewable feedstock for producing green fuels and value-added chemicals aligns with the goals of circular bioeconomy and sustainability. Furthermore, the utilisation of agricultural waste biomass in the context of a circular bioeconomy is explored.

pub.1131443891,From plant biomass to biofuels and bio-based chemicals with microbial cell factories,"Global energy demands and global warming represent key challenges of the future of human society. Continous renewable energy supply is key for sustainable economy development. Waste plant biomass represent abundant source of renewable energy that can be transformed to biofuels and other value-added products, which is currently limited due to the lack of cost-effective biocatalysts. The bottleneck of this process is the degradation of structural polysaccharides of plant cell walls to soluble compounds that can be fermented to solvents or transformed to biogas via methanogenesis and can be used as biofuels or chemical raw materials. In order to replace traditional physical and chemical methods of lignocellulose pretreatment with more environmentally friendly biological approaches, native microbial enzyme systems are increasingly being explored as potential biocatalysts that could be used in these processes. Microbial enzymes are useful either as catalysts in the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses or as components incorporated in engineered microbes for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocelluloses. The unprecedented development of tools for genetic and metabolic engineering for a wide range of microorganisms enabled significant progress in the development of microbial cell factories optimized for the producton of biofuels. One of the most promising strategies aimed towards this goal, i.e. systematic design and heterologous expression of »designer cellulosomes« in industrial solventogenic strains is adressed in detail."

One of the most efficiently cycled and sustainable process of capturing and storing energy on earth is photosynthesis. Currently, this deceivingly simple process on earth can assimilate the energy several times that is being used each year, globally. This energy can be extracted in the form of ethanol using lignocellulosic biomass, switchgrass or wood chips and/or oil using soy, jatropha, tobacco seeds, and microalgae, which form an array of the most promising renewable and clean energy resources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. However, the recalcitrant cell wall in plants, competition for arable land, low content of fuel precursors as well as water usage are major barriers to the economically viable biofuel production. In this context, gene mining to engineering tools may lead to optimization of metabolic pathways which will create value-added biomass production and enable environmental adaptability for the next-generation biofuels. This chapter mainly focuses on recent advancements in the applications of transgenic technologies in plants and algae through photosynthetic chassis for biofuel production."
pub.1132581820,System analysis of the bio‐based economy in Colombia: A bottom‐up energy system model and scenario analysis,"Abstract The transition to a sustainable bio‐based economy is perceived as a valid path towards low‐carbon development for emerging economies that have rich biomass resources. In the case of Colombia, the role of biomass has been tackled through qualitative roadmaps and regional climate policy assessments. However, neither of these approaches has addressed the complexity of the bio‐based economy systematically in the wider context of emission mitigation and energy and chemicals supply. In response to this limitation, we extended a bottom‐up energy system optimization model by adding a comprehensive database of novel bio‐based value chains. We included advanced road and aviation biofuels, (bio)chemicals, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and integrated biorefinery configurations. A scenario analysis was conducted for the period 2015–2050, which reflected uncertainties in the capacity for technological learning, climate policy ambitions, and land availability for energy crops. Our results indicate that biomass can play an important, even if variable, role in supplying 315–760 PJ/y of modern bio‐based products. In pursuit of a deep decarbonization trajectory, the large‐scale mobilization of biomass resources can reduce the cost of the energy system by up to 11 billion $/year, the marginal abatement cost by 62%, and the potential reliance on imports of oil and chemicals in the future. The mitigation potential of BECCS can reach 24–29% of the cumulative avoided emissions between 2015 and 2050. The proposed system analysis framework can provide detailed quantitative information on the role of biomass in low carbon development of emerging economies. © 2020 The Authors.

This can be achieved by maximizing the share of renewable energy in India’s overall energy mix, currently is dominated by fossil fuels. After industry and transportation sector comprising of air, water and surface modes is the second largest contributor of GHG emissions. Ever since the evolution of mobility, the transportation landscape continues to be occupied mostly by internal combustion engines (ICE) that employs fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are majorly import dependent and cause of huge foreign exchange outflow. Therefore, the need of the hour is to leverage captive alternative energy sources that can help mitigate risk of climate change besides positively impacting economy and society. Biofuel - a renewable transportation fuel, both in gaseous & liquid form, is a very promising, alternate clean energy source. Biofuels are environment friendly and help improve the rural economy. Besides facilitating energy self-reliance, biofuels utilize existing infrastructure and ecosystem of ICE automotive industry. Praj Bio-Mobility<sup>TM</sup> platform envisions the use of bio-based renewable feedstock for the production of low-carbon transportation fuels for all modes of transportation. This unique platform also works in tandem with e-mobility solutions.

pub.1155848331,Channeling Growth for Sustainable Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: Do Sectoral Patterns of Growth Matter?,"Is sub-Saharan Africa’s growth a quality growth (Quality growth implies growth that creates a dynamic economy while enhancing health, being good stewards of natural resources, and fostering equal opportunity to reduce poverty.)? Does the growth engender sustainable development? In a panel of 40 sub-Saharan African countries over thirty years, the study investigated the quality of SSA’s growth along different sectors to reduce the level of poverty. The preliminary results indicate that the poverty-reducing effectiveness of growth varies considerably across sectors, across space, and over time. The study found that the services sector has a more poverty-reducing effect than growth in the agriculture or manufacturing industries. The result is tenable since these sectors (manufacturing and agricultural sectors), particularly in developing countries, are characterized by the excessive utilization of non-renewable sources of energy (such as wood fuels, petroleum, coal, and biofuel) in their operations, thereby increasing carbon emissions. The increase in carbon emissions creates extreme weather, which in turn damages homes and businesses. This can prevent the poor from escaping poverty, and it is often the trigger that tips the vulnerable into poverty. The results suggest that to engender sustainable development, reduce poverty, and promote green growth economy in the region, governments, and policymakers in SSA must redirect the economy toward a knowledge-based economy by expanding the services sector."
pub.1045109807,Microalgae Potential and Multiple Roles—Current Progress and Future Prospects—An Overview,"Substantial progress has been made in algal technologies in past few decades. Initially, microalgae drew the attention of the scientific community as a renewable source of biofuels due to its high productivity over a short period of time and potential of significant lipid accumulation. As of now, a technological upsurge has elaborated its scope in phycoremediation of both organic and inorganic pollutants. The dual role of microalgae—i.e., phycoremediation coupled with energy production—is well established, however, commercially, algal biofuel production is not yet sustainable due to high energy inputs. Efforts are being made to make the algal biofuel economy through modification in the cultivation conditions, harvesting, and extraction of value added products. Recent studies have demonstrated algal biomass production with various types of wastewater and industrial effluents. Similarly, the recent advent of eco-friendly harvesting technologies—such as low-cost green coagulants, electrochemical harvesting, etc.—are energy efficient and economical. Contemporary improvement in efficient lipid extraction from biomass will make algal biodiesel economical. The absolute extraction of all the value added products from algal biomass, either whole cell or lipid extracted biomass, in a complete biorefinery approach will be more economical and eco-friendly."

pub.1147933968,Food Processing By-Products and Waste Utilisation for Bioethanol Production,"Globally, a rising trend in population and economy has caused an increase in the global demand for energy. Although, fossil fuels have been the most predominantly used fuel, the resources utilised for the production of fossil fuels have begun to deplete. This has resulted in the emission of various deleterious gases, which have consequently caused global warming including various alterations in climate, environment and biodiversity. In order to combat this challenge of depleting fossil fuel reservoirs and global warming, biofuels have been considered a suitable candidate for substituting fossil fuels. Biofuels are a sustainable and environment-friendly form of energy which are produced from biomass. Over the past few decades, researchers are persistently finding novel sources that can serve as the feedstock to generate biofuels. Of the variety of biofuels being generated, bioethanol has been recognised as a promising biofuel because of the various advantages associated to its chemical properties, cost of production, sustainability and impact on environment. Additionally, bioethanol is one such biofuel that requires carbohydrate source for its production. Therefore, the interests of various researchers have now inclined towards wastes generated from food industries. Food waste is generated from different sectors including agriculture, municipalities, industries, forestry and corporations. The food processing wastes are a rich source of various nutrients. Mostly, these wastes are either discarded in landfills or are used as an animal feed. However, their disposal has been reported to result in severe environmental hazards. Therefore, to avert this challenge of environmental pollution, researchers have considered valorisation of food waste into biofuel an efficacious strategy, especially bioethanol.This chapter deals with the importance of utilisation of food waste for the production of biofuels, with primary focus on bioethanol production. The chapter also elucidates the types of feedstocks used for bioethanol production. It also delineates different types of food processing wastes and strategies to employ them for bioethanol production."

Raise in economic and environmental concerns made the researchers tune their efforts to make the processes economically cheap and environmentally sustainable through the biological approach. Biorefineries aim at integrating the different conversion processes to produce a wide range of products, including biofuels and high-value chemicals using biomass as the source. The linear economy aims to produce the product, use the product, and dispose of it after use, in contrast to this circular economy (CE) is regenerative by design which aims at maximizing the utilization of the components, materials by reusing them or bringing them back to the production of other product. Therefore an evolution from a linear economy to a CE needs to be adopted to develop sustainable green technologies and biorefinery processes to close the loops of the utilization of raw biomass. The circular bioeconomy (CBE) principally focuses on the effective use of raw biomass resources including agro/forestry biomass, postconsumer products, and developing technologies/processes used in biorefineries to support the transition from the use of virgin/raw biomaterials to secondary materials in production, including the use of waste-to-energy technologies. This chapter aimed at providing insights into the recent developments in research related to improving CBE through sustainable green technology, novel biorefinery processes, and the critical challenges in cascading potential, policies, and regulations for implementing the CE."
pub.1051941133,Product developments in the bio‐based chemicals arena,"Abstract  Around the world, significant able steps are being taken to move from today's fossil‐based economy to a more sustainable economy based on biomass. A key factor in the realization of a successful bio‐based economy will be the development of biorefinery systems allowing highly efficient and cost‐effective processing of biological feedstocks to a range of bio‐based products, and successful integration into existing infrastructure. The recent climb in oil prices and consumer demand for environmentally friendly products has now opened new windows of opportunity for bio‐based chemicals and polymers. Industry is increasingly viewing chemical and polymer production from renewable resources as an attractive area for investment. Within the bio‐based economy and the operation of a biorefinery, there are significant opportunities for the development of bio‐based building blocks (chemicals and polymers) and materials (fiber products, starch derivatives, etc.). In many cases this happens in conjunction with the production of bioenergy or biofuels. The production of bio‐based products could generate US $10–15 billion ofrevenue for the global chemical industry. The economic production of biofuels is often a challenge. The co‐‐production of chemicals, materials food and feed can generate the necessary added value. This paper highlights all bio‐based chemicals with immediate potential as biorefinery ‘value added products’. The selected products are either demonstrating strong market growth or have significant industry investment in development and demonstration programs.

pub.1105339509,Green grabs and rural development: How sustainable is biofuel production in post-war Sierra Leone?,"In Sub-Saharan Africa, now dubbed the ‘Green OPEC’ of the global bioenergy economy, biofuels have been hailed as a ‘new profitability frontier’ that will provide ‘win-win’ outcomes and deliver development to poor communities. Yet, in an era of economic recession and soaring food prices, their ‘sustainability’ has been at the centre of controversy. This paper focuses on the case of Sierra Leone, where in 2008, a Swiss bioenergy company ushered in the largest foreign direct investment since the end of the country’s civil war. Although recently set back by the catastrophic impacts of the Ebola crisis, there continues to be much support for the government’s strategy to secure foreign direct investment in biofuels production in agriculturally rich regions of the country. Bioenergy proponents believe that such investments will transform rural areas, in light of the fact that Sierra Leone has over the last decade been consistently ranked as one of the poorest in the world, facing food insecurity, high unemployment and entrenched poverty. But land access and control remain central to debates around biofuels and development, particularly for poor rural people living in project areas. This paper explores the perceptions of a wide range of project stakeholders, many of whom have differing interpretations of what biofuel sustainability entails. The paper concludes by reflecting on the implications this may have for the present post-Ebola environment, where evolving policy discussions on land investment and ‘green’ development continue to assume a key part of the government’s recovery trajectory."
pub.1020852525,Policies and instruments affecting water use for bioenergy production,"Abstract Bioenergy‐related water use can intensify existing water stress, increasing the importance of sustainable management of water resources for sustainable bioenergy production and use. This paper presents a review of policies and instruments that can influence how bioenergy production affects water availability and use. It discusses policies and instruments of importance for water use for bioenergy production, considering both biomass production and the subsequent conversion to solid/liquid/gaseous fuels and electricity. Water policies on the biomass production side should focus on ensuring efficient water use. While environmental policy instruments, such as command‐and‐control approaches, support maintaining specific water quantities and quality standards for biofuel production, market‐based tools can help users identify least‐cost options and increase efficiency. For the energy conversion side, water quality is the key issue that needs to be addressed with adequate policy instruments, but water scarcity can also constrain biofuel industry growth. It is important that policies and instruments for water management on the biomass production and energy conversion side are coordinated to ensure that efficiency is achieved along the entire production chain. Finally, the evaluation of water‐use policies and instruments for bioenergy production should not only relate to their direct impacts on water use, but should also take into account overall impacts on the economy. This is of particular importance given the likely future large‐scale expansion, the potentially large impacts on both water and land, and the potentially large benefits for rural economies of bioenergy expansion. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"
pub.1170330436,The Role of Anaerobic Biorefinery in the Development of a Sustainable Economy,"A bioeconomy is considered a better way of reducing environmental impacts, particularly greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions caused by using the fossil fuels. The replacement of these fuels by using biobased products and bioenergy would be beneficial to the environment, as well as to the local economy. Biorefinery is an ideal concept, where a variety of products are produced from organic feedstock, including chemicals, fuels, polymers, etc. Among the various biorefineries, the anaerobic biorefinery concept is becoming popular, which follows anaerobic digestion (AD) as the ultimate step to dispose of any biodegradable waste. Different entities involved in the anaerobic biorefineries are evaluated in this chapter, with emphasis on feedstocks, energy usage, and sustainable applications of by-products and products generated. The factors affecting upstream and downstream processes are discussed. This chapter also presents the present and upcoming applications and market sizes of AD-based products and their by-products, including biofuels, biochemicals, biofertilisers, etc. By incorporating AD technology into biorefineries, sustainable development goals can be achieved more rapidly in areas such as water quality, sanitation, and energy efficiency.

This is also important contributors to environmental degradation with the release of a large amount of wastewater. The wastewater of distilleries consists of very high concentration of BOD, COD, total solids, phosphate, sulfate, and different hazardous compounds. It causes serious environmental dilemma. A variety of physicochemicals and biological processes have been also researched for the safety of environment, human beings, and other living organism’s health. The prospective of biogas production from anaerobic digestion treatment process of distillery spent wash was also investigated. The anaerobic digestion needs less capital and production cost per unit in comparison to other renewable resources of energy, for example, hydro, sunlight, and wind. In addition, the potential of biogas toward electricity production is very economical. In addition, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were achieved through biogas production. In the SDGs, nonetheless, the goal number seven initiates the need to employ efficient and sustainable renewable resources of energy to accomplish several global goals. The different precise objectives within SDG number 7 are such as considerably amplify the role of renewable energy sources to global energy matrix by 2030, boost up in the supply of contemporary and sustainable energy applications for all in emergent countries by expansion in infrastructure, enhance the energy efficiency improvement rate throughout the globe and technology up gradation. Biofuels from wastewater such as distilleries become the most advanced and efficient alternative energy source. These sustainable biofuels will be expected to play an important role in the quest of these above-mentioned goals. Energy is highly related with all of the other sustainable development goals, and recognition of these interconnections is significant to successfully execute them. It is now time to act in response to a historic agreement toward climate change solution in place. So the delivering on SDG7 is a foundation stone of that goal. On the other hand, if biofuels are anticipated to be fundamental in the recreation of sustainable development renewable energy goals in the discontinuation of fossil fuels generally on the basis of its environmental responsiveness, so this is the only prudent to evaluate how it completely merits its contemplation. However, the breakthroughs accomplished hitherto indicate that the future seems definitely bright and intense along with their power to generate a practicable neutral renewable energy resource from waste matter to sustain the comprehensive force toward the achievement of SDG number seven."
pub.1091341823,Assessment of Sustainability Indicators for Biodiesel Production,"Biodiesel production may provide a sustainable route to reduce environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption. In order to minimize environmental impacts of biodiesel production, the chemical process should be optimized to minimize waste generation and energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to design biodiesel chemical reactions and processes using green chemistry and green engineering principles to develop sustainable chemical processes. This study provides the results of the synergistic effect of microwave and ultrasound irradiations to produce biodiesel using ethanol or methanol as the alcohol donor. The biodiesel yields are presented along with their respective green metrics, such as atom economy, environmental factor (E-factor), atom economy (utilization) or atomic efficiency, mass intensity, reaction mass efficiency, atom utilization, and stoichiometric factor. These green metrics are crucial to determine the sustainability and environmental impact of biodiesel production. Evaluation of these green metrics indicates that methanol is a better alternative for biodiesel production provided it is derived from renewable sources. Sustainability indicator concepts used for biodiesel production in this study can be applied to various biofuels and other chemical reaction designs, synthesis and process development."

The importance of the circular economy as a new direction of economic development is increasingly contributing to sustainable development. The diversification and expansion of economic activities are considered through biofuel production to be an effective way of increasing the share of renewable sources in solving the world's ecological problems. For governments to guarantee clean home energy access, biogas energy must be produced and used sustainably. The production of biogas from biomass has various economic effects that can significantly support sustainable development objectives. Strategic planning, cooperation, and innovation are required to optimize these economic gains to overcome governmental and regulatory difficulties, market dynamics, technological restrictions, and budgetary restraints. Market risks—classified as political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental (PESTLE)—impact this. To determine the PESTLE restrictions and evaluate their effects on the sustainable development of technology in the EU, this study reviews peer-reviewed literature. The Pestel method is used to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats because the market is subject to constant changes and is characterized by dynamics. PESTEL analysis can detect new opportunities in the biofuels market that a company can use for its growth and overtake potential competition in strategic steps."

As part of this study, the biodiesel production process was analyzed in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the basis of the obtained results, the key factors influencing the emissions level of the biodiesel production process were identified. In order to assess the sensitivity of the results of the adopted allocation method, this study included calculations of GHG emissions with an allocation method based on mass, energy, and financial shares. The article reviews recent advances that have the potential to enable a sustainable energy transition, a green economy, and carbon neutrality in the biofuels sector. The paper shows that the technology used for the production of biodiesel is of great importance for sustainable development. The possibility of using renewable raw materials for the production of fuels leads to a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels and lower emission of pollutants. It showed that during the combustion of biodiesel, the percentages of released gas components, with the exception of nitrogen oxides, which increased by 13%, were significantly lower: CO2—78%, CO—43%, SO2—100%, PM10—32%, and volatile hydrocarbons—63%. Moreover, it was found that biodiesel undergoes five times faster biodegradation in the environment than diesel oil."
pub.1115214191,Phyco-Remediation of Dairy Effluents and Biomass Valorization: A Sustainable Approach,"The world’s energy demand is rising dramatically with increasing human population and economy. The fossil fuels that comprise crude oil, natural gas and coal are the major energy sources required for the transport and industries. The burning of fossil fuels not only emits greenhouse gases but also produces some persistent organic matter into the atmosphere such as carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds that creates serious environmental and human health issues. In addition, vast growth of industrial activities in the last few decades has led to making of an enormous amount of industrial wastewater. Fossil fuels and freshwater are limited nonrenewable resources that will deplete in the next few years; hence the world has been forced to look for new renewable and sustainable energy sources. Microalgae have been recently recognized as one of the promising feedstocks for biodiesel production. Since microalgae have the capability to grow in wastewater as well as remediate nutrients, which translate it an environment friendly and economically viable biofuel feedstock. The present chapter emphasizes on the possibility of utilizing dairy wastewater as nutrients for microalgae cultivation and subsequent nutrient remediation, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. In the end, limitations and economic assessment of dairy wastewater-derived microalgal biomass and biofuel have been assessed. The study compiled in the present chapter indicates that the algae grown on dairy wastewater have been a prospective source of low-cost biomass/lipid for production of biofuels."
pub.1158315942,Brazilian Agriculture and the International Political Economy of Climate Change,"Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use in Brazil accounted for 72% of the total in 2020. Apart from this, the agricultural sector, particularly the agribusiness, with growing economic power and political influence over the last three decades, has been linked to the path of deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado, central to Brazilian identity and international perceptions of the country in terms of climate change. In this chapter, we analyze the heterogeneous trajectory of the agricultural sector as key to understanding the past, present, and future role of Brazil in the International Political Economy of Climate Change. The questions we seek to answer in this chapter are thus: What is the influence of different subsectors of Brazilian agriculture, mainly agribusiness, on the role of Brazil in the international political economy of climate change? Will the trajectory of the different sectors reduce or increase the level of climate commitment of Brazil? We answer these questions through the analysis of the agricultural subsectors’ positions on GHG emissions and climate policy responses of the national government in four historical periods, using the Climate Commitment Approach. In this regard, we look at three dimensions: technical modernization, political power, and relation to climate change."

pub.1148220322,Chapter 1 Biomass: The driver for sustainable development,"In the last century, the use of energy in all the economic sectors has increased considerably, mainly due to the growth of population as well as changes in the lifestyle. Almost 80% of the total energy used in the world comes from non-renewable sources, as petroleum and natural gas. Nevertheless, the excessive use of these fuels has caused the climate change problem, as well as the drop in the production of fossil fuels; indeed, due to its non-renewable nature, the extraction of the available amounts of fossil fuels will be more expensive as time goes by. Therefore, in order to keep a sustainable growth of all economic sectors, alternative energy sources have been explored. From these sources, biomass is one of the most interesting, since it can be used to produce biofuels, chemicals, value-added products as well as bioenergy. So, biomass is considered as the main driver toward the sustainable development. In this chapter, the current situation on the energetic and transportation sectors will be described to justify the necessity to move to a biomass-based economy. Finally, future insights on the development of a biomass-based economy will be presented."
pub.1004239390,Brazilian Public Policies and Sustainable Development that Influence the National Bioindustry,"Brazil is an emerging country member of the BRICS, the seventh world economy and considered one of the countries with mega-biodiversity. However, it has a duality between economic development and sustainable use of natural capital also showing social and environmental fragility. Public policies try to solve these problems improving science, technology, and innovation by-laws (tax incentives; innovation; science, technology, and Innovation framework) and papers (White; Green). One of the strategic areas considered in these policies is biotechnology, particularly when associated with the development of a green economy, like biofuels. Biotechnology is an area of intense scientific production, and policies that stimulate research and cooperation between public and private sectors to promote innovation, reducing institutional barriers and facilitating access to tax incentives for private companies are substantial achievements for bioindustry development. On the other hand, national policy related to genetic resources access and traditional knowledge associated prevented progress in the commercialization of local biodiversity during 15 years. Policies created by Brazilian governments aligning economic development and natural resources, through genetic resources access and traditional knowledge associated law; are necessary for the national bioindustry development and as a model for other countries."

This transition involves both the energy sector and goods production sector and should combine new production models with new consumption models oriented toward reduction, reuse, and sharing practices. For this transition to happen, efforts are needed from all involved players: researchers and industries which have to develop new production models, consumers which have to adopt new consumption practices, and policy-makers which have to develop a favorable regulatory and legislative environment for such changes to occur. In this chapter we look closely at this latter element of the transition, specifically assessing the impact that standards and regulation played on the biofuel sector. We identify pros and cons associated with such intervention, drawing lessons applicable broadly to the bioeconomy transition."
pub.1090659369,Toward a sustainable bioeconomy in West Africa: A focus on biorefining,"Abstract Considering its size and expanding population, Africa needs to play a more active role in preventing global warming. The economy of most West African countries is driven by agriculture and the export of processed wood resulting in the generation of tons of wood and agricultural waste. The waste is usually disposed of by burning, which releases harmful greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the environment. Wood and agricultural wastes are valuable biomass feedstocks for second‐generation biofuels and chemicals. The availability of diverse feedstocks makes the West African sub‐region suitable for setting up biorefineries. However, the limiting factors for establishing biorefineries such as appropriate technology, infrastructure and forward‐looking policies have to be addressed. The currently high cost of biofuel production and competitive crude oil prices also make it seem unfeasible for West African countries and other developing economies to invest in this industry. Therefore, we present an idea for developing a multipurpose modular biorefinery model to meet the energy needs of the region with an added advantage of creating new markets and jobs. We also discuss what new energy policies should be focused on in order to fast‐track the development of the bioenergy sector. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Microalgae-based biofuel production is costlier when compared to conventional fuels as it needs techniques for biomass culturing and processing. This chapter covers the hydrothermal gasification (HTG) of algae biomass for bio-hydrogen production. Microalgae are third-generation feedstocks that help in carbon dioxide sequestration, high biomass productivity, cultivable in wastewater, etc. Sustainable energy development can be achieved by reducing carbon dioxide emissions during the conversion of algae biomass into bioenergy. This chapter covers the two major mechanisms (supercritical gasification and steam reforming) involved in bio-hydrogen production via the HTG process. Further research is needed in the safe storage, transportation, and distribution of bio-hydrogen as an alternate source of energy."
pub.1057644854,Joint Water Quantity-Quality Management in a Biofuel Production Area—Integrated Economic-Hydrologic Modeling Analysis,"Water management in the Pirapama River Basin in northeastern Brazil is affected by both water quantity and water quality constraints. The region is known for significant sugarcane-based ethanol production—which is the key to the Brazilian economy and expected to grow dramatically under recent changes in climate and energy policies. Sugarcane production in the region goes hand in hand with controlled fertirrigation practices with potentially significant adverse impacts on the environment. To assess sustainable water allocation in the basin, an integrated hydrologic-economic basin model is adapted to study both water quantity and quality aspects. The model results show that incorporating water quality aspects into water allocation decisions leads to a substantial reduction in application of vinasse to sugarcane fields. Embedding highly nonlinear water quality constraints in a basin optimization model is demonstrated to be an effective tool to address the water management problems in rapidly developing biofuel areas of Brazil and elsewhere."

Owing to its non-degradable nature, plastic particles remain in surroundings for extended periods which automatically facilitate its out spreading. Therefore, there is a need to shift to bio-based plastics, as bio-based green economy hinges on sustainable employment of bioresources for generating a broad spectrum of products, biofuels, chemicals and bioplastics. Typically bioplastics are synthesized from bio-based resources considered to contribute more to sustainable production of plastic as a part of the circular economy. Bioplastics are luring attention and growing as counterfeit material for petroleum-derived plastics owing to their biodegradability. Recently an engrossed interest has been burgeoning in producing drop-in polymers and new-fangled bioplastics by utilizing lignocellulosic feedstock. This paper reviews the enormous potential of lignocellulosic feedstock as a significant inedible substrate for bioplastic synthesis. Polyhydroxyalkanoates, polyurethanes, polylactic acid and starch-bioplastic are prevailing bio-based plastic comparably derived from lignocellulosic biomass. In forthcoming years bioplastic derived years’ bioplastic derived from lignocellulose will loom as valuable material in numerous fields for an extensive range of cutting-edge applications."

pub.1164488119,Sustainable Routes for the Depolymerization of Lignocellulosic Biomass,"Abstract Lignocellulosic biomass is the world largest renewable resource used as a raw material to produce high‐value‐added chemicals, such as biofuels and other biomaterials. However, the complex chemical structures of its main constituents, named cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, pose a challenge to the breakdown of these biopolymers into smaller units. In this scenario, sustainable methods for the depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass aim to chemically break these macromolecules into simple monomers and dimers, while minimizing the use of hazardous chemicals and energy‐intensive processes. Different depolymerization strategies have been proposed, including enzymatic, electrochemical, acid‐catalyzed, and solvent‐based methods. Nevertheless, the development and improvement of sustainable approaches toward depolymerization technologies is still ongoing, and there is still room for further research to optimize the efficiency, cost‐effectiveness, and scalability of the processes. While the successful depolymerization of biomass may significantly contribute to the transition to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy, this article outlines the most recent developments focusing on the particularities of these processes, including biological, electrochemical, thermal, and chemical methods."
pub.1033055030,Grafting our biobased economies on African roots?,"Sustainable development has become defined as a core demand for innovation over the past decade. With the ensuing step from a fossil-fuel-based to a bio-based economy, the need for biomass production for biofuels and biomaterials has increased dramatically. Although the United States has enough land surface available for domestic production, it is not likely that the necessary biomass to ‘fuel’ Europe can be grown domestically, and therefore, Europe plans several investment initiatives in non-domestic agriculture, including locations in Africa. China, as one of the most important growing economies in the world is also increasingly investing in African agriculture. In Africa, a large percentage of arable land is currently not in use for agriculture. Additionally, the production potential of developing countries near the equator is significantly higher than the production potential of countries in more temperate climates such as most of Europe. The production of biomass for biorenewables has come under increasing criticism due to its supposed threat to the production of food in Africa. Thus, the consequences for developing countries and the delicate natural balance of protected ecosystems are debated. Here we question how differences in Chinese and European worldview and the way these inform the respective value systems affect the current development towards an Africa-based growth of biomass for biofuels and -materials."

It provides municipal water and wastewater services to over 2 million inhabitants, with 59 wastewater treatment plants where almost 70,000 ton/year of dewatered sludge is produced. Today’s challenge is to respond to climate change, finding new solutions for the recovery of biofuels (biomethane), nutrients (e.g., phosphorus) and energy by water cycle: this is the basis of our Master Plan for the bio-refineries, part of the #Waterevolution launched by CAP Group. The European Commission has adopted an ambitious new Circular Economy Package to stimulate Europe’s transition towards a circular economy that will boost global competitiveness, foster sustainable economic growth and generate new jobs. How important are the new series of actions on water reuse? How beneficial could these be for the circular economy? The existing municipal wastewater treatment plants can be renovated and integrated to become multi-purpose urban bio-refineries that serve citizens in the treatment and valorization of municipal waste streams, such as wastewaters and organic waste, towards a coherent urban strategy. Existing anaerobic digesters have residual treatment capacities that allow for the co-digestion of sewage sludge and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, which will increase the recovery of biofuels (biomethane) and nutrients (e.g., phosphorus) in existing treatment plants. The combination of eco-innovative technologies with anaerobic co-digestion allows for the integrated recovery of biomethane, phosphorus, and biopolymers. In such a scenario, CAP Group can and wants to deliver a circular economy approach. To this aim, CAP Group has defined a territorial Master Plan to implement eco-innovative and energy-efficient solutions for renovating existing wastewater treatment plants close to the circular value chain by applying low-carbon techniques for recovering materials that are otherwise lost. In order to include leading edge sustainable solutions, the Master Plan considers synergic interaction with the major, ongoing innovative actions of European Horizon 2020, such as the “SMART-Plant” project coordinated by the Italian University of Verona. The project was undertaken by CAP Group in August 2016 at the water treatment plant in Niguarda-Bresso (Milan) with the scientific support of the CNR and the technological collaboration of FCA.

pub.1168051464,Chapter 16 Phycoremediation and water reuse in bioenergy production from algae and cyanobacteria in relevance to sustainable development goals,"Algae and cyanobacteria are alternative renewable sources of bioenergy. Appertaining to their fast growth and fewer nutrient requirements, round-the-year cultivation in barren lands with wastewater is considered suitable over other energy crops. With the growing demand for fuels in various sectors, bioenergy like biodiesel, bioalcohol, biohydrogen, methane, and bio-crude (product of pyrolysis/hydrothermal liquefaction) is derived from algae/cyanobacteria as a support to other energy sources. Phycoremediation or bioremediation by algae/cyanobacteria is one of the most effective biological wastewater treatment processes. Algae/cyanobacteria are cultivated in effluents with high inorganic/organic loads from different industries like poultry, slaughterhouses, paper, textile, distillery, “supercritical water gasification”, produced water (while extracting nonrenewable oil/gas) landfill leachate, etc. Biomass for bioenergy integrated with phycoremediation provides techno-economic effectiveness of practical commercialization and sustainable energy production. It contributes to climate change alleviation, reducing competition with crop irrigation, carbon, and water footprint. Phycoremediation is useful in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage based bioenergy production while reducing the water footprint. In the biorefinery approach, the recycled wastewater cultivation medium is further reused for developing biomass for biofuel and coproduct development like feed, pharmaceuticals, pigments, lubricants, biochar, polysaccharides, bioplastics, biofertilizers, etc. While “water recycling” is imperative to essentially reduce “blue water footprint,” the recycled medium also contains different growth promoters and inhibitors. Microalgae cultivation is related to sustainable development goals (SDGs) about the environment (water, land, biodiversity, greenhouse gases), economy (energy, investment, industrialization), and social base (awareness, education). Biofuels (1st/2nd/3rd/4th) from all generations provide clean energy (SDG 7). Also, biofuel generation using wastewater is directly related to SDG 6/7/12/13. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the different aspects of phycoremediation in biomass production and reuse strategies of wastewater to reduce water footprint in relation to SDGs during bioenergy generation from algae/cyanobacteria."
pub.1172112421,"Bio-surfactant: Definitions, Types, Applications, Genetics, and Circular Economy","The world׳s growing population, the increasing demand for food, the emergence of industrialization, and the production of agricultural waste are all linked to one another. As food byproducts decompose, they can release hazardous heavy metals, enzymes, and active degrading microbes into the environment, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. To address these issues, the bioeconomy provides a cost-effective and circular economic model for the production of biofuels. By utilizing cost-effective waste feedstocks for the production of valuable products, waste can be reduced, reused, and recycled in a green economy bio-process. This review delves into the connection between green economy concepts and the production of sustainable biofuels, and its applications to health-related sectors. Additionally, it highlights the advantages of recent progress in the production of, characterization of, and bio-waste classification of biofuels, the limitations of the current approach, the techno-economic assessments, the market evaluations, the potential obstacles, and the future directions of the field. A biosurfactant is a compound with a low molecular weight that can be used in industrial settings because of its chemical properties and its ability to stay stable in different conditions. Its chemistry and cost depend on the type of substrate it׳s made from, how it׳s used, and how it׳s used. Recently, they׳ve been used to fix or help with a range of environmental issues, like bioremediating contaminated soils with dangerous pollutants like hydrocarbons and metals. Biosurfactants can be chelating agents for heavy metals because of their ability to bind to them. But the main way they work in the environment is by reducing surface tension, which makes it easier to dissolve and dissolve pollutants. Biosurfactants are not very toxic, but they can be used as biocides in certain amounts, usually higher than their mousellar concentration. Recently, they׳ve been made using different materials like organic waste and fermentation, which makes them more useful and research-friendly in a circular economy."

pub.1100812692,The carbon-nitrogen nexus of transportation fuels,"The advocation of a biobased economy has created a compelling case for consideration of biofuels as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. However, biofuels must be evaluated on multiple criteria to ensure they truly are an improvement over the fossil fuels they are to replace. This study evaluates the carbon (C) footprint (emissions – sequestration) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions footprint of two fossil fuels, two first generation biofuels, and eight cellulosic fuels, many with process inputs allocated multiple ways to allow for different valuation of inputs and products. For both C and Nr results, fossil and first generation fuels were often the worst options, while cellulosic fuels look notably better, often in both criteria. For most fuels, there is a trade-off between a low C footprint and low Nr emissions footprint, which is investigated throughout the entire nutrient cycles here. Biofuels usually have lower C footprints and higher Nr emissions due to intensive farming processes, while fossil fuels have a high C footprint and lower Nr emissions. However, cellulosic fuels from feedstocks with low farming inputs switchgrass and low intensity high diversity grassland, or from waste feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste and newsprint have low C and Nr footprints, making them better options for transportation fuels. However, just because these fuels have smaller C and Nr footprints than other fuels does not imply they are absolutely sustainable. The capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services should also be considered before sustainability claims are made."

pub.1153314636,Chapter 20 A chemical approach towards the sustainability of biofuels: Environmental and economic aspects,"Nowadays biomass is being treated as the most comprehensive source of renewable energy and a starting material for fuel generation. The abundance and renewable nature of biomass has increased its usefulness as a far-reaching alternative resource of transportation fuel. In order to use biomass as fuels, its major components like carbohydrates, hemicellulose, lignin, and starch require the removal of oxygens, so that oxygen-rich carbohydrates can be transformed into hydrocarbons. Hence, the bio-based economy has been implemented as a prior preference in order to scale down disastrous impacts of Greenhouse gas (GHG) along with fossil fuel consumption. In this connection, an amplification in the production of biofuels has been witnessed in the first decade of this century. This chapter presents a molecular-level understanding of the chemistry involved in the transformation of biomass into hydrocarbons, sustainability and economic aspects of the process. If the chemistry of generation of transportation fuels from biomass is studied minutely, then the global status of biomass can be well scrutinized and in near future it will contribute a lot more toward sustainable developments of biofuels, both from environmental and economic perspectives."
pub.1086041557,China's energy status: A critical look at fossils and renewable options," China relies heavily on fossil fuels to keep the wheel of its huge economy running. Fossil fuels are however not a sustainable energy source due largely to their environmental footprint and supply insecurity. These concerns have necessitated the need for alternative energy sources that are both renewable and environmentally friendly. This policy direction is in line with the Kyoto protocol that constrained countries to follow certain energy consumption pattern that encourages the use of less carbon intensive energy sources. In line with this protocol, China has over the years adopted the use of various renewable energy sources including solar, wind, marine, as well as hydropower. This commitment by the Chinese government has yielded significant result over the years. Notably, between 2014 and 2015, wind and solar energies were responsible for 25.4% of electrical energy produced in China. However, enabling laws to support the optimum consumption of these energies has not been provided, thereby resulting in a serious setback. In spite of the increased production in renewable energies, biofuels have contributed only marginally to the entire growth. Biofuels are very important considering the contribution of the transport sector to carbon emissions. Although there are ethical issues associated with current biofuels due to energy-food nexus, this review submits that algal biofuel could serve as an alternative. To this end, there is urgent need for the government to put in place laws and policies that will support not only production but also consumption of renewables, including algal biofuel, so that dependence on coal and other fossil fuels can be further reduced. This will not only reduce the country's dependence on oil import which is currently at 59.4% but greatly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."

pub.1170932594,Analytical study of opportunities for Next Generation Biofuels Market,"The emergence of better science around the issue of land use change associated with the production and usage of biofuels cast doubt on the use of first-generation biofuels, made from edible agricultural feedstocks, as a tool to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. While many countries sought to enter the international biofuels market, and draw on the latest technology to move away from crop based biofuels and into cellulosic and algae-based advanced fuels. By 2015, liquid biofuels had become commonly traded commodities worldwide. The impetus behind biofuels was partially due to novel drivers such as green jobs and the interest in the decarbonization of specific sectors of the economy such as transport, but also to provide countries dependent on oil imports with an alternative to enhance their energy security and create new export opportunities.
 In 2015, countries made commitments toward a more environmentally balanced future through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and now seek to expand policies for low-carbon development after the agreement reached in Paris at COP21. The year also marked a milestone in the bioeconomy, as the point in time when the production of second-generation biofuels (2G) finally took off at commercial scale. Developing countries now face a new set of market opportunities and policy dilemmas to enhance their usage of biomass, which can now be transformed into more valuable products. Developing countries interested in engaging in advanced biofuel markets for the attainment of the SDGs, and as an instrument to meet their commitments under COP21. By carrying out a non-exhaustive mapping of cellulosic ethanol projects and recent policy lessons around the globe.
 Next generation biofuels made from non-edible feedstocks, put forward a promising response to the food versus fuel debate. Nevertheless, process improvements have been a key factor in decreasing costs for the industry and allowing market expansion. Historically, the United States of America (US) has had the largest installed capacity for cellulosic ethanol production of deployed second-generation biofuel facilities, followed by China, Canada, European Union (EU) and Brazil, respectively. Projects in these countries vary significantly in their technological approaches and feedstocks used for fuel production, including the use of corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, municipal solid waste, and forestry residues, among others. One common trait is that companies that possess technology and knowledge in the European Union and the United States engage in partnerships to deploy advanced ethanol facilities abroad, for example, the Fuyiang project, which is a cooperation between Italy-based Beta Renewables and Guozhen Group in China."

pub.1181205232,Hydrothermal liquefaction: exploring feedstock for sustainable biofuel production,"A number of technological strategies utilizing various types of biomass for the production of hydrocarbons have been put forth but their energy intensive methods are a concern for improved efficiency of biofuel production. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has emerged as a promising and feasible technology towards utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. The suitability of different biomass feedstock for HTL is intricately tied to their macromolecular composition and process parameters. The comprehensive analysis of feedstock for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) signal towards the immense potential of various biomass feedstock, such as corn stover, Miscanthus, pine biomass, Spirulina, sugarcane bagasse, rice bran etc. in contributing significantly to renewable energy production. The study emphasizes that the composition of biomass is critical in influencing bio-oil yield during the HTL process. Biomass components like cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, each play distinct roles in determining the efficiency of conversion. Specifically, feedstock with higher cellulose and hemicellulose content, such as Miscanthus and sugarcane bagasse, demonstrate superior bio-oil yields. The analysis of proximate factors affecting HTL efficiency reveals that moisture content, ash content and high heating value (HHV) are pivotal in optimizing the process. In addition to composition and physical characteristics, the article underscores the significance of growth conditions and nutrient utilization in cultivating biomass feedstock. Integrating HTL with biomass cultivation can create a sustainable, closed-loop system where nutrients from the HTL process are recycled back into cultivation. Biomass offers a renewable energy alternative, however it also poses challenges related to land use and potential competition with food production. Sustainable practices, such as utilizing agricultural and forestry residues and optimizing collection as well as storage processes, can alleviate some of these concerns. By optimizing feedstock selection, process parameters, and integrating sustainable practices, HTL can play a decisive role in advancing biofuel production and contributing to a more sustainable energy future. The interplay between biomass composition, processing efficiency, environmental impacts, and economic feasibility is essential for realizing the full potential of HTL technology in the bio-economy. The current analysis sheds light on the relationship of bio-oil yield with macromolecular components including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as well as process parameters like ash content, moisture content, higher heating value, fixed carbon and volatiles. Focusing on process optimization, this study embodies a closer analysis of literature aimed at defining optimum strategies for enhancement of HTL."
pub.1154139789,Pulses Waste to Biofuels,"Human dependency on fossil fuels has increased due to an unprecedented population growth rate. There is a dire need to propel our energy dependency from fossil fuels to renewable energy resources. Increased pollution and the growing energy demand make it necessary to look for greener alternatives. Biodegradable waste utilization like agricultural and forestry residue, nonedible plant material is promising, economical, and environment-friendly substitutes for fossil fuels. The biofuel production could significantly bring down the dependency of India on foreign oil and fossil fuels. Here, the efficient usage of legume residues obtained from agroindustrial and food processing has several benefits. This chapter summarizes the potential for valorization of legume residue linked to the generation of unavoidable waste. The basic outline of biofuel production includes preparation and degradation of carbohydrate content in the substrate using pretreatment methods. Pretreatment of the substrate is done for enhancing delignification. Pretreatment processes can encompass biological, physical/mechanical, chemical, and physicochemical treatments. This is followed by either saccharification and fermentation to yield bioethanol/biogas or esterification to yield biodiesel or biolubricant. Cellulose microfibrils (CMF) were successfully extracted from pea pods by using various chemical treatments. Enzymatic saccharification of the soybean hull was done by using cellulase, beta-glucosidase, and Viscozyme (cell wall degrading enzyme complex). Legume residues like pea pods, broad beans pods, pigeon pea wood, fava bean straw, and soybean hull are generated annually in huge amount and represent an interesting source for biofuel production. Lignocellulosic biomass has enormous potential for serving as a promising substitute for fossil fuels and satisfy the steadily increasing fuel demands. Efficient utilization of all agricultural residue can help in reducing environmental impacts. The residue extraction will lead to achieve, a zero-waste economy and sustainable biofuel generation."
pub.1153841888,"Exploring the heterogeneous effects of technological innovations on environmental sustainability: Do structural change, environmental policy, and biofuel energy matter for G7 economies?"," The global economy has realized that global warming issues should not be treated with levity. Instead, conscientious and meticulous measures must be taken to address the unwavering ravaging impacts of ecological complications of which technological innovations stand out. Despite the emphasis on technology as a viable pathway to zero emissions by the recent 26 th Conference of the Parties (COP26), the feasibility of achieving the global target remains vogue from the empirical perspective. Hence, this study presents the first empirically based evidence on the heterogeneous effects of technological innovations on environmental sustainability in Group of Seven (G7) countries from 1995 to 2019. For robust policy insights, the study controls for the functional roles of structural change, environmental policy, biofuel energy, and trade openness in verifying the empirical model. The empirical evidence relies on second-generation estimators comprising cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL), augmented mean group (AMG), common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG), and panel method of moment quantile regression (PMMQR) that are robust for the issues of slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. The main findings show that the various components of technological innovations, structural change, environmental policy, and biofuel energy support environmental sustainability by exerting statistically adverse effects on CO 2 emissions. In contrast, trade openness appears as a deterrent to sustainable environment by statistically and positively impacting CO 2 emissions. Besides, the findings reveal bidirectional and unidirectional causality pathways in the nexuses investigated for G7. Based on the empirical fallouts, viable policy insights that lead to achieving the net zero emissions target are formulated. "
pub.1115933851,Food wastes and sewage sludge as feedstock for an urban biorefinery producing biofuels and added‐value bioproducts,"Abstract  The updated Bioeconomy Strategy document “A sustainable bioeconomy for Europe: strengthening the connection between economy, society and the environment”, which was issued by the European Commission in October 2018, encourages the exploitation of organic wastes according to a pyramidal hierarchy in which the extraction of valuable biomolecules, which will be used as they are or as precursors of high‐added‐value compounds, is a priority in biofuel production. This review considers a biorefinery platform in which food waste and sewage sludge are adopted to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs) through a dark fermentation process. VFA fermentation is optimized by slightly acid pH (6–7), short hydraulic retention time (1–7 days) and high organic load rate (more than 10 gTS L −1 d −1 ). Attention has been focused on VFA exploitation for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production via a ‘feast and famine’ strategy performed in sequencing batch reactors. The obtained PHA yields are around 0.4–0.5 gPHA gCOD −1 . Moreover, VFAs allow for the production of biofuels, such as hydrogen and methane, through single‐ or double‐staged anaerobic digestion. Innovative bioelectrochemical upgrade strategies for biogas helps producers to obtain biomethane for the automotive sector. Moreover, biogas has recently been tested for the production of polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic made by microorganisms from C1 carbon sources (CO 2 and CH 4 ). Digestates from anaerobic bioreactors are still rich in nitrogen and phosphorus compounds. These latter compounds have been identified as critical raw materials due to their low availability in the European Union and to increasing demand from the growing global population. Thus, nutrient recovery from digestate allows users to close the loop of the ‘circular economy’ approach. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry "

pub.1131443147,Sustainability Assessment of Biorefinery Systems Based on Two Food Residues in Africa,"The overexploitation of fossil fuels as main energy source to support the global economy is identified as the most responsible of the current critical situation from an environmental viewpoint. The need to replace fossil fuels has posed the attention on alternative energy sources such as biofuels, in both developed and developing countries. Africa, for example, has enormous natural resources in the form of biomass from agriculture and other related processes (i.e., food residues). An action that can help fight climate change is the implementation of biofuel refineries to maximize the value of biomass by converting it into a range of products, like energy vectors, biomaterials, feed and fertilizers. By using emergy evaluation and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) this study focused on the potential development of sustainable biotechnological processes fed by biowaste and bioresidues in two African countries (Egypt and Ghana). We assessed the sustainability level of two biofuel productions based on starch and lignocellulosic feedstocks (i.e., cassava peel and corn stover, respectively). A first understanding of the sustainability of the case studies was obtained and the results showed that the biorefinery based on cassava peel was more sustainable from both the user and donor perspectives. Indeed, the LCA results showed that impact categories Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Acidification Potential (AP) had lower values for cassava compared to corn stover biorefinery and emergy outcomes highlighted that the starch-rich feedstock had lower Unit Emergy Value (UEV) and higher renewability percentage (94%). These results suggest that biorefineries are an option for world bioeconomy strategy as they enable optimization of agricultural and food residues and their environmental performance in producing a renewable substitute for fossil fuels and other non-renewable materials is promising."

The aviation industry, facing increasing demand for both conventional and alternative fuels, is exploring blue hydrogen as a cleaner substitute for traditional jet fuels. This paper evaluates recent advancements in blue hydrogen production methods and hydrogen carriers such as ammonia, metal hydrides, formic acids, carbohydrates, and liquid-organic-hydrogen carriers (LOHC). Developed economies are actively researching biofuels as potential alternatives to petroleum, offering reduced emissions, enhanced fuel security, and improved sustainability. The power-to-liquid (PtL) method is employed to assess a sustainable alternative fuel, chemically matching regular jet fuel using water, CO2, and renewable energy. The study examines various biofuels and their application in aviation, comparing the techno-economic and environmental performance of PtL fuels to fossil and biomass-derived jet fuels. To estimate combustion flue gas properties, a model using Aspen Plus is developed, simulating the performance of a CFM56–7B turbofan engine with alternative fuels. Biodiesel, ethanol, n-butanol, 70% NH3–30% H2, and CH4 are evaluated, demonstrating comparable temperatures to conventional jet fuels. The NH3-H2 blend, while exhibiting lower thrust, limits the aircraft range due to reduced thrust compared to JET-A1 and kerosene-gasoline fuels. Ethanol shows slightly better thrust and range performance than the NH3-H2 blend but still falls short of conventional jet fuels. Biofuel and n-butanol emerge as promising replacements, demonstrating comparable thrust and range performance, with only a 15% reduction in aircraft range compared to JET-A1 fuel. The study provides valuable insights into the potential of these alternative fuels, emphasizing the need to consider combustion flue gas temperatures and their impact on existing power plants."

Among the oleaginous yeasts, Yarrowia lipolytica is a highly promising cell factory and microbial oil producer because of its high capacity to accumulate lipids for subsequent biofuel production. Y. lipolytica also stands out for its ability to assimilate various carbon sources, even at low cost, reaching lipid concentrations of at least 30% by weight with non-genetically modified strains, and even much higher values with engineered organisms. Among others, fatty acids have attracted recent interest as substrates for their lower cost and possible production from pollutants compared to sugars. This review pays special attention to some of those emerging carbon sources, i.e., carboxylic acids and even greenhouse gases. Besides, another focus is to provide detailed up to date information on the main characteristics and factors that most influence the fermentation process of this yeast, with the ultimate aim of optimising the bioconversion process and the synthesis of useful metabolites. Besides, the reader will find comprehensive information on the industrial applicability of the synthesised lipids, in addition to the production of biofuels. Apart from lipids, other metabolites of interest that can be synthesised by Y. lipolytica are also discussed."
pub.1166439157,Toward a Real-Fluid Modeling Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels,"A multi-agency effort is underway to decarbonize the aviation industry by 2050 and replace current fossil fuels such as Jet A. Carbon-free hydrogen-based technologies are a long-term opportunity for some markets, but the introduction of new sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is necessary for a fleet-wide transition. These biofuels are synthesized to meet specific aviation fuel requirements; thus, they may be used in current jet engines without major modifications (i.e., drop-in SAF), accelerating the transition to net-zero carbon emissions by focusing on the life cycle of the biofuel (i.e., circular economy). Given the increased costs associated with the SAF certification process, a deeper understanding of the biofuel behavior at relevant operating conditions, ranging from take-off to high-altitude relight, becomes necessary to define the best candidates. This work investigates the performance of a real-fluid model (RFM), built upon cubic equations of state, in predicting the relevant fuel properties that dictate the atomization, evaporation, and combustion processes. The simpler composition spectrum of SAFs compared to current fuels justifies the development of this modeling approach targeting its application to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers as a more detailed alternative to typical surrogate mixing rules and tabulated properties. The study showcases the capabilities of the RFM using National Jet Fuels Combustion Program's (NJFCP) Category C fuels and offers guidelines toward the development of reliable and robust fluid-dynamics models to support the adoption of SAF in a broad range of conditions, including transcritical regimes. Here, the behavior of the mixtures challenges the validity of ideal fluid models and, therefore, the proposed formulation allows for a realistic fuel characterization at high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, and to explore beyond the currently available experimental datasets."
pub.1122581548,16 Agroindustry wastes: biofuels and biomaterials feedstocks for sustainable rural development,"Sustainable rural development requires benign, viable resources of energy. It is vital to the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of nations as well as for poverty eradication. The biorefinery mode operates for converting agroindustrial residues into various products, including biofuels and chemicals through a cascade of modern technologies such as pyrolysis, gasification, Fischer–Tropsch, and other catalytic processes. The development of the agroindustrial waste-based biorefineries can help to stabilize the economy of the rural areas by offering a clean energy service through the replacement of fossil fuel and creating energy security. A great extent of rigorous effort is currently being made for upgrading the existing biorefinery frameworks to fully attain the sustainability standards required to warrant their full-scale implementation. As a consequence of the mandatory inclusion of the sustainability goals into the biorefinery concept and the escalating concern on the “food-fuel conflict,” the biorefineries based on abundant agroindustry wastes are gathering quick popularity. Indian agroindustry wastes display an extraordinary variety of lignocellulosic biomass and round-the-year availability in ample amounts. Unfortunately, due to lack of awareness and poor valorization, these valuable wastes are often destroyed in mass scale for waste management instead of being utilized in a productive way. These residues can be used as an alternate source for the production of different products, such as biogas, biofuel, and as the raw material in various researches and industries. The use of agroindustrial wastes as raw materials can help to reduce the production cost and also reduce the pollution load from the environment. Agroindustrial wastes are used for manufacturing of biofuels, enzymes, vitamins, antioxidants, animal feed, antibiotics, and other chemicals through various processes. The major focus of the present chapter is to present the agroindustry scenario in the world with special reference to India, the adaptability of these wastes to products through cascading of various approaches in a biorefinery mode. The major issues of rural India such as energy security, water purification, and restoration of natural resources such as soil can be partially resolved by using a biorefinery approach. Hence, the implementation of biorefinery unit will help in complete utilization of bio-based resources to produce some value-added end products in an efficient way for sustainable development of rural India."

Developing and commercializing green energy innovations will be an essential component of the transition to a more diversified energy economy. Algal biodiesel is one of the most promising green fuels because of its potential as a renewable and sustainable fuel source without displacing food crops. Algal biodiesel research and development are necessary early steps towards a transition to a green energy economy. The strategic use of strong patent portfolios will drive this by attracting investment, incentivizing innovation and accelerating commercialization. Whereas algal biodiesel research and development is largely still early stage, this will rapidly change as aggressive investments and government subsidies facilitate economically competitive algal biodiesel to enter the energy market. Algal domestication, improvement and industrial utilization for biodiesel production will therefore inevitably create value, leading to increased assertion of property rights, of which intellectual property rights in the form of patents are fundamental. This article provides a summary of representative patents and patent applications in the algal biodiesel technology space and their commercial applications."

pub.1084699930,The Role of Bioenergy in Mitigating Climate Change,"The combustion of fossil fuels drive the steady increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) and global temperatures observed in recent decades. The realization of adverse effects of increase in GHG emissions on the environment, the desire to limit atmospheric CO2 concentration at 450 ppm or lower and limit global temperature increase to ≤2 °C, combined with increasing energy needs have made the quest for sustainable and environmentally benign sources of energy for industrial economies and consumer societies a high priority since 1980s. To limit atmospheric CO2 concentration at 450 ppm, a total CO2 emission reduction of 50–85% is required by 2050. As a result, there are a renewed interests in carbon-neutral or carbon-negative renewable energy sources. Among the renewable energy sources, biofuels are considered as an attractive fuel sources for replacing fossil fuels. Bioenergy is important for many sectors and mitigation perspectives as well as from the perspective of developmental goals such as energy security and rural development. It is argued that increasing the contribution of biofuels will reduce the GHG emission by reducing the carbon intensity of the transport sector and addressing energy security concerns. In addition to global climate change threat, interests in biofuels are enhanced by growing global energy demand and diminishing crude oil supply. However, there is concern about the existing interlink between biomass, bioenergy, land use, food supply, water use, and biodiversity. The first generation biofuels primarily produced from food crops feedstock are unsustainable due to the potential stress their production places on food, feed and fiber production. The second and third generation biofuels produced from abundant biomass and algae respectively are seen as the attractive solution to limitations of the first generation biofuels and also have higher potential for GHG emission mitigation. Yet, the practicalities of deployment of bioenergy at a large scale are mired in controversies over the potential resource conflicts that might occur, particularly over land, water and biodiversity. Additionally, a number of technical huddles must be overcome before their true potential can fully be realized and evaluated. This chapter summarizes the current knowledge of biofuels, the potential role in mitigating GHG emission, societal dilemma in large scale biofuel production, current assumptions on which global bioenergy resource estimates are predicted and future directions of biofuels research with the emphasis on assessments informed by empirical studies."

The agricultural sector of the national economy is vital to such positions. Its further development in the context of leading European practice should consider the organizational and economic principles of constructing and using closed agricultural production cycles. The essence, content, and basic principles of the development of the circular agrarian economy are discussed in the article. The key directions for the further development of circular processes, which correspond to the specifics of the agricultural sector of the national economy and are priorities in the immediate and strategic perspective, are defined here. Among them, the following are outlined: organic production and use of waste, production of biofuel, priority of ecosystem restoration, use of products of new water purification systems, and logistic and marketing products for agro-production based on closed cycles. It was determined that implementing circular principles in global practice has a clearly expressed positive socio-economic effect. The complex of the main advantages of the circular economy in the agricultural sector of Ukraine is justified. It is proposed to include three primary cycles in the system of agro-circular economy, which is based on R-principles: technical-technological, biological, and financial. Based on the research results, several factors and obstacles were identified that are currently holding back the intensification of the development of circular transformations in the agricultural sector of the national economy. Overcoming them requires a systematic approach to motivating the spread of agro-circular processes based on improving organizational and management mechanisms, increasing the social responsibility of rural businesses, and the general level of the corporate culture of agricultural companies and society.

This composition allows us to produce numerous value-added products like livestock feed, bio-preservatives, biofuels, biofertilizers, single-cell proteins, nanoparticles, biodegradable plastic, chitosan, collagen, and antibodies. Additionally, various start-ups leading to new beneficial products from agricultural solid waste should be promoted. This review intends to explore the sources of agricultural solid waste generation and to provide a solution to manage the waste through modern technologies, saving the environment and boosting a country’s economy. The outcome of our study will lead toward a sustainable approach to waste management as we have comprises the most innovative and successful working models in one place. This newly developed technique will help to achieve the greater goal of sustainable development.Graphical abstract"
pub.1144707669,Chapter 12 Feedstock pretreatment for enhanced anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic residues for bioenergy production,"The utilization of low-cost and abundant lignocellulosic residues for sustainable production of bioenergy and biofuels (such as biogas) will play a pivotal role in the future decarbonized circular economy energy supply. Among all of the bioconversion technologies for the production of bioenergy and biofuels, anaerobic digestion (AD) has many advantages such as sustainably managing organic wastes, producing renewable biogas, and providing for nutrient recycling with low energy input, all of which are important in contributing to a low-carbon emission circular economy. However, the inherent rigid polymeric structure of lignocellulose makes the material less accessible to microorganisms during the degradation process in AD, resulting in relatively low feedstock conversion efficiency and subsequent sub-optimal biogas production. Pretreatment may be required to alter the lignocellulosic structure to improve the conversion process and biogas production. This chapter presents recently developed pretreatment methods (including physical, chemical, biological) for enhancement of the digestion performance and biogas/biomethane production yield from lignocellulosic residues. Thermochemical bioenergy technologies such as pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization may be integrated with AD, contributing to synergistic benefits to future negative emission systems. Future work is required to evaluate the economic feasibility and sustainability of novel pretreatments required for enhanced AD of lignocellulosic residues."

A gradual and strategic development of a sustainable bioenergy system is proposed as an opportunity to alleviate the connected energy and economy issues through a cleaner energy-mix. The optimization model presented in this study designs a bioenergy supply chain over multiple periods with the objective to minimize the energy gap under budget and biomass availability constraints. The dynamic elements of the model capture the interplay between population size, energy demand, biomass availability, energy consumption, and the Gross Domestic Product. A salient feature of the model is the consideration of an end-to-end bioenergy supply network from biomass reserves to the electricity demand zones. Besides facility setup and operating costs, the model considers biofuel transportation costs and transmission yield losses. The model is extensively analyzed through a case study. Practical insights about budget allocation and system expansion are discussed based on the case study. The analysis highlights that the cost for the optimum development of a bioenergy system can significantly vary over the planning horizon. The optimum setup starts as a highly centralized system and evolves into a largely decentralized system in which powerplants source biofuel and supply power locally."

As years have gone by and with the continuous rise in population, both the natural resources and the biodiversity of this world are at the brink of exhaustion and collapse. Circular Economy (CE) is one such method that tackles both these problems at the same time. Worldwide energy production focuses on the shift from petroleum derivatives to biomass-based biofuels for the emerging sustainable bio-based economy. However, the concept of the biomass-based bio-refinery is in the early stages of development in many parts of the world. To confront global challenges environmentally and economically, the paradigm shift from biofuel production to bio-refinery is inevitable. This review summarizes various alternative feedstocks’ availability and their chemical potential for bio-refinery, application of recent developments like Big Data, blockchain technology and Internet of Things on bio-refinery framework. Furthermore, an emphasis has been made on the strategies and challenges in the production of the broad spectrum of platform chemicals and their incomparable global market value as it is an intermediate that bridges between the biomass and the value-added bio-based products. Thus, this review is an important key resource for researchers as it is a comprehensive analysis of the vital areas in bio-refinery."

Biomass will play a key role in the challenge of tackling those issues. Sustainable raw materials for the production of food, animal feed, chemicals, and biofuels such as biodiesel, biobutanol, and bioethanol can be obtained from algal biomass. The cultivation and conversion of biomass into products is known as biorefinery. In particular, marine macroalgae (so-called seaweeds) biomass is a promising feedstock for biorefineries because of their high growth rates and its potential cultivation on salt water, avoiding competition for freshwater and arable lands. In addition, dissolved inorganic nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, and carbon are taken up by macroalgae, helping to alleviate eutrophication in seas and oceans. Using biological, chemical, and engineering advances of the past decades, new technologies to provide cost-efficient cultivation, harvesting, extraction, and processing of sustainable biofuels have yet to be elaborated. Pulsed electric field and electroporation technologies can play a key role in that matter as it has been successfully used for biomass processing in various cases.

The economic objective is measured by the total annualized cost, the environmental objective is measured by the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and the social objective is measured by the number of accrued local jobs. A multiobjective mixed‐integer linear programming (mo‐MILP) model is developed that accounts for major characteristics of cellulosic ethanol supply chains, including supply seasonality and geographical diversity, biomass degradation, feedstock density, diverse conversion pathways and byproducts, infrastructure compatibility, demand distribution, regional economy, and government incentives. Aspen Plus models for biorefineries with different feedstocks and conversion pathways are built to provide detailed techno‐economic and emission analysis results for the mo‐MILP model, which simultaneously predicts the optimal network design, facility location, technology selection, capital investment, production planning, inventory control, and logistics management decisions. The mo‐MILP problem is solved with an ε‐constraint method; and the resulting Pareto‐optimal curves reveal the tradeoff between the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of the sustainable biofuel supply chains. The proposed approach is illustrated through two case studies for the state of Illinois. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2012"
pub.1143373374,The Impact of Environmental Tax Administration on the Cost of Thermal Energy on the Example of Organic and Biofuels Boilers in Ukraine,"The article provides an overview of approaches to greenhouse gas emissions taxation and tax rates in European countries. To compare heated boilers with different characteristics, which run on different fuels the average cost of thermal energy for the life cycle LCOH was used. Environmental tax on environmental pollution (as a component of LCOH) is calculated for the three most common types of boilers in Ukrainian boilers with a capacity of 4.65 to 58 MW, burning natural gas, coal, and fuel oil, as well as for low-power boilers (0.5 and 1 MW ), burning fossil fuels and biofuels. The eco-tax for biofuel boilers is calculated under current taxation and subject to the adoption of a European approach to taxation of carbon dioxide emissions. It is established that at the current rates there are almost no economic incentives for the introduction of technologies to reduce the concentration of pollutants in emissions, but increasing the rates of environmental tax may change this situation. However, provided that rates are evenly increased for all types of boilers, the eco-tax for natural gas boilers will remain the lowest, while for biofuel boilers it will increase significantly, which contradicts the stated goal of decarbonizing the economy. It is shown that not only the change of environmental tax rates can be an effective tool for achieving the goals of sustainable development, as the principles of its administration are also important."

Growing oil prices and exhaustion of current fossil fuel assets, together with the incessant increase in greenhouse gas release, have raised the necessity to discover and develop novel renewable bioenergy resources that do not need cultivable land and freshwater. Henceforth, transforming this weed into value-added products and fuels aid in self-sustainability, particularly for emerging nations. Thus, the inexhaustible biomass of invasive WH has gained much consideration in recent years in exploiting them as a potential resource for bioenergy generation. WHs have remarkably high growth rates and contain a high amount of cellulose and hemicellulose with very little lignin, making them effective for next-generation bioenergy crops. The current chapter deliberates the numerous value-added products and biofuels produced from WH, the current research and developmental processes on the WH bioconversion for the biofuel production and value-added products, and its potentials and challenges in commercialization. Furthermore, a comprehensive discussion was conducted on techno-economic and ecological analysis by a mathematical model, techno-economic analysis, life cycle assessment, and circular economy toward sustainable development."

pub.1172305568,Biofuels from Biomass,"Faced with the rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the growth of the global economy, there is a need for energy sources that are not only sustainable but also ecologically viable. In this context, biofuels emerge as a promising alternative, obtained from biomass from different sources, such as agricultural, forest, industrial, and urban residues. Its use can not only complement but also replace traditional fossil fuels, resulting in a significant reduction in carbon emissions and contributing to mitigating dependence on limited resources in the long term. This versatility of biomass makes it a versatile energy source, which can be directly used through combustion or transformed by biochemical, chemical, and thermochemical processes into different types of biofuels. In this sense, the main objective of this chapter is to shed light on the breadth of diversity of terrestrial, aquatic, and residual biomass, the production technologies used to produce biofuels, in addition to the availability of these, classified according to their nature. For that, a descriptive qualitative methodology was used. By tracing a historical overview, it was found that, from ancient times to the present, biomass played a vital role in everyday activities, being used in different contexts, such as heating, cooking food, and locomotion. However, as technology advanced, new techniques emerged, such as transesterification, esterification, pyrolysis, and fermentation, considerably expanding the possibilities of using biomass as a viable and efficient energy source. With the advancement of environmental awareness and the increasing recognition of the negative impacts of fossil fuels, biomass has gained even more prominence as a “green energy,” bringing with it energy security and new economic opportunities for producers and researchers. However, this protagonism challenges the harmony between biomass production and the demand for food, thus arising the need to explore sustainable and balanced approaches for its use. According to this framework, it is necessary to highlight some factors to optimize the full potential of biomass as an energy source, such as the development and improvement of technologies aimed at improving both the quality and efficiency of its production and conversion. Aspects such as chemical composition, harvesting processes, pretreatments, and processing conditions play a crucial role in this context.

pub.1101891399,Algae biofuel: Current status and future applications," An algal feedstock or biomass may contain a very high oil fraction, and thus could be used for the production of advanced biofuels via different conversion processes. Its major advantage apart from its large oil fraction is the ability to convert almost all the energy from the feedstock into different varieties of useful products. In the research to displace fossil fuels, algae feedstock has emerged as a suitable candidate not only because of its renewable and sustainable features but also for its economic credibility based on the potential to match up with the global demand for transportation fuels. Cultivating this feedstock is very easy and could be developed with little or even no supervision, with the aid of wastewater not suitable for human consumption while absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. The overall potential for algae applications generally shows that this feedstock is still an untapped resource, and it could be of huge commercial benefits to the global economy at large because algae exist in millions compared to terrestrial plants. Algae applications are evident for everyday consumption via foods products, non-foods products, fuel, and energy. Biofuels derived from algae have no impact on the environment and the food supply unlike biofuels produced from crops. However, any cultivation method employed could control the operating cost and the technicalities involved, which will also influence the production rate and strain. The scope of this paper is to review the current status of algae as a potential feedstock with diverse benefit for the resolution of the global energy demand, and environmental pollution control of GHG."

The utilization of agro-industrial wastes can lower manufacturing costs as well as lower pollution in the environment. Biofuels, enzymes, vitamins, antioxidants, animal feed, antibiotics, and other compounds are made from agro-industrial waste. It is critical to think of ‘trash' as a precious ‘resource' that may be transformed into a range of useful items. This process of converting garbage into a product that can be used in everyday life might be considered a wealth-generating activity. As a result, the phrase ‘Waste to Wealth' was coined. The concept of waste to wealth has indeed been utilized to address the environmental problem by shifting the traditional perception of garbage as a finished product to be discarded. Raising environmental awareness and converting it into potential profit has been a major source of contention across the world for a circular bioeconomy, and a potential to provide micro-entrepreneurship opportunity."
pub.1026340435,India’s agrofuel policies from a feminist-environmentalist perspective,"India, facing a growing economy on the one hand and enormous poverty of its population on the other, has developed several policies on biofuels since 2002. The Indian state promotes projects on plants such as Jatropha for biodiesel. In these policies, mitigation of climate change is only one aim of the Indian state. Supply with Indian-made fuel is supposed to enhance economic growth, air pollution should be diminished and poor rural women should be given income opportunities. The national policy for biodiesel from 2008 states that till 2017 20% of the diesel used in India should come from plants, grown and transesterized in India. Enormous efforts from the Indian states and private companies will be necessary. The resources needed for this kind of production - land, water and human work - are limited. NGOs as well as state institutions debate whether the production and use of biofuel can ever be sustainable. The contested policies on biofuel in India are therefore one example of debates on sustainability and the underlying values and ideas about a satisfying livelihood for the Indian people. From a feminist-environmentalist perspective the questions to be asked are not only in which ways men and women are effected differently by, for example, Jatropha plantations. Rather it is important to ask in what ways sustainability is conceptualized and how nature as well as gender features in these concepts. The way we think about material resources such as land, water and human resources, e.g. female reproductive work, show some parallels. Both kinds of resources are seldom thought of as valuable just because they sustain human life, but rather, only if and when they can be monetarized as commodity. In order to figure out ways to provide sustainable livelihoods for everyone, we need to change the way nature and gender are conceptualized in strategies to cope with the ecological crisis. This includes a change of ethics towards a focus on what is necessary for the ‘Good Life’. The paper will analyze the concepts of sustainability in Indian biofuel policies from a feminist-environmentalist perspective as well as show an alternative way of thinking about ecology and gender."

Economics of Jatropha biodiesel production is compared with that of fossil diesel. Jatropha seed procurement cost is the most critical component of Jatropha biodiesel accounting. The perspective of green house gas (GHGs) mitigation and the possibility of earning certified emission reductions (CERs) may provide some additional reasons for pushing biofuels as a sustainable energy option. Providing marginal land for its production appears a big constraint. To reduce the impact of highly volatile crude oil pricing on Indian economy, promotion of renewable bio-energy options needs to be integrated with employment in the context of a social frame."

pub.1111102714,Sustainable Production of Biofuels through Membrane-Integrated Systems,"Literature on biodiesel production over the last 10 years (2007–2018) has been critically reviewed directing further research toward membrane-based sustainable and green production. The manuscript discusses how biodiesel production strategies have evolved in the recent years through adoption of better feedstock, better catalysts, more efficient reactor technology, and through incorporation of more efficient downstream separation-purification techniques. The review reveals that though transesterification reaction between alcohol and plant oil/animal fats leading to production of biodiesel is simple, the downstream separation and purification of the final product (fatty acid methyl esters) is quite challenging. This review shows that productivity can be enhanced through new generation catalysts, use of green solvents, and a more efficient reactor technology while the use of tailor-made membrane in appropriate modules holds the promise of low-cost and eco-friendly downstream purification. It is exposed that a membrane-based technology can bring about high degree of process intensification, whereas recovery and reuse of catalysts and alcohol are likely to add to the economy of the process, resulting in sustainable production technology."

The effect of biofuelsBiofuels and of their blends with diesel on engine tribology is not completely understood. Use of biodiesel as replacement fuel may lead to substantial lubricating oil dilution, because biodiesel has higher boiling range than mineral diesel. Since fuel interacts with the lubrication oil in the sump via fuel dilution, it is necessary to understand the impact of biodiesel on the lubricant properties. Oil consumption in heavy-duty diesel engines lies in ranges of 0.1–0.2 % of the total fuel consumption."
pub.1151983536,Techno-economic review assessment of hydrogen utilization in processing the natural gas and biofuels,"The automobile sector dominated by conventional fossil fuels greatly impacted human lives and strengthened the economy of many countries. However, the harmful emissions from the engines have contaminated the environment and induced severe climate changes; hence the emphasis is being laid on low carbon fuels that emit lower emissions and greenhouse gases. In this regard, hydrogen (H2) is considered as a no-carbon fuel; however, safety and storage are the main concerns. Therefore, the H2 can be potentially utilized with compressed natural gas (CNG) to form hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) and processed with biofuels to produce hydrogenated biofuels. HCNG emits 20% lower carbon dioxide, 30% less carbon monoxide and 25% reductions in NOx emissions compared with CNG. The hydrogenated biodiesel fuels exhibit higher cetane number and better storage stability. However, the practical challenge is to render them economically affordable with minimum carbon footprints. Thus, the current review is aimed to provide comprehensive detail on the potential of hydrogen in fuel formulation techniques and their effect on engine performance, emission characteristics and various hydrogen production methods viz. blue and green hydrogen. Further, this review highlights the techno-economic characteristics of hydrogen utilization and economic characteristics of the low carbon fuels (both liquid and gaseous fuels) for sustainable mobility."
pub.1171858270,Biochar-plastic co-conversion as an economic strategy in energy production and enhanced plastic waste transformation from walnut and polystyrene waste,"In Iran, waste management can be improved through strategies of converting wastes into energy. Their exploitation is still abandoned due to oil economy and lack of environmental motivation. In this study, co-conversion of polystyrene waste (PS) with walnut shell (WS) biochar for solid biofuel production was conducted to develop a new sustainable economic waste-to-bioenergy strategy. The co-pyrolysis of PS and WS provided solid biofuel (WPS) with a yield of 43 % and HHV of 32.10 MJ/kg. To increase the HHV, PS was co-pyrolyzed with WS non-activated biochar (non-AC), resulting in a yield of 78 % and HHV of 33.03 MJ/kg. To enhance the yield, it was co-pyrolyzed with WS activated biochar (AC), leading to a yield of 93 % and HHV of 29.79 MJ/kg. The yield was increased because AC entrapped melted PS into its porous structure to avoid its vaporization. Interestingly, it successfully enhanced the PS conversion from 38 % (in pyrolysis alone) to 77 % (in the co-pyrolysis). Ultimate analysis of all three solid biofuels revealed a sulfur-free fuel as a clean energy source. The economic evaluation indicated that the production of non-ACPS could make it suitable for future commercialization by net profit of 0.085 $/kg and payback time of 1.12 year."
pub.1157735868,A resource-based and institutional theory-driven model of large-scale biomass-based bioethanol supply chains: An emerging economy policy perspective,"The wide-spread dependence of transportation sector on the ever-depleting and greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuels when burnt has raised considerable energy security and environmental concerns. Consequently, countries around the world have positioned biofuels as a center stage alternative to fossil fuels in their national policies to provide energy security and carbon emission control. In this regard, the paper conducts a feasibility assessment of setting-up large-scale supply chain of bioethanol (i.e., a biofuel variant) based on the regional availability of agricultural residues. Critical resources and capabilities requirements and governance attributes for bioethanol supply chains are explored using the resource-based view and institutional theory lenses. An agricultural residues (as biomass inputs) based bioethanol supply chain (BESC) model is proposed to incorporate the economic and environmental optimality considerations for an agro-climatic region. A case study of the Punjab State in India is used as an application of the proposed BESC model. Findings suggest that sustainable BESC configurations can be achieved differently for different agricultural residues. Comparative analyses, trade-off scenarios, and sustainability assessments of various agricultural residues-based BESC configurations are conducted. The policy implications of the priority areas are discussed within the bounds of India's biofuel policy."
pub.1148034479,Biodiesel and Green Diesel Fuels: A Techno-Economic Analysis,"Climate change represents a major challenge for our world’s equilibrium and society. Therefore, we need to implement an adaptive energy matrix where fuels like fossil diesel are used wisely in coming years, but where sustainable and renewable biofuels increase its contribution to the transport sector or in electric power generation. Among those renewable biofuels, biodiesel and green diesel may play significant roles through circular economy of biomass, with local and regional production into a biorefinery with minima emissions and waste streams. The assessment of a particular scientific development may be approached by the techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the production process, which may serve to identify scientific and technological limitations and challenges that impact economic and financial parameters. In this work, we present and discuss the advantages and challenges of blending biodiesel or green diesel with fossil diesel, the technological, economic and financial issues that must be approached by TEA and its constrains, and the comparison and discussion of several TEA works dealing with biodiesel and green diesel production. Even if green diesel is just recently available with respect to biodiesel, it represents an important opportunity in co-processing plant oils into a petroleum refinery, access to high volume capacity plants and distribution, which may help to decarbonize the petroleum fuel sector."
pub.1130813134,Microalgae Potential Feedstock for the Production of Biohydrogen and Bioactive Compounds,"Urbanization and industrialization increase the energy demand, and fossil fuels are depleting drastically due to energy consumption by industrial and domestic purposes. There is a need to increase the production of energy by sustainable renewable sources. Marine microalgae are potential sources of biofuels and feedstock for the production of other bioactive compounds. Microalgae can be easily cultured in photobioreactors for the production of several types of biofuels. This chapter describes about the production of biohydrogen through photolysis followed by dark fermentation. Several types of photobioreactors used in the production of biohydrogen, suitability of microalgae as feedstock, and other microorganism used in the dark fermentation are discussed. The end product of biohydrogen after combustion is only water vapor; hence, there is no air pollution. Because of this nature of hydrogen gas, much attention has been paid by several researchers for the production of biohydrogen. Several bioactive compounds produced by microalgae, possibility of scale up, and industrialization have been revealed. Various parameters involved in the process, bioreactor types, and their design has to be discussed. Further the estimated cost of the pilot project for various biofuel products and the impact of circular economy has to be discussed with scientific attention at global scale."
pub.1151445776,Biomass pre-treatment techniques for the production of biofuels using thermal conversion methods – A review,"This review aims to compile and discuss the pre-processing procedures utilized previously to biomass thermal conversion techniques, in order to promote the sustainable production of biofuels and other commodities from biomass. These will ultimately replace fossil-based alternatives under an environment-friendly framework, and contribute to the attainment of circular economy goals. Pre-processing methods account for a significantly improved efficiency, as a more homogeneous, dry, suitable and consistent feedstock is achieved, supporting cleaner and proficient conversion methods. This may prevent the complete depletion of non-renewable resources, alleviating the effects of their overexploitation. Findings concerning the main constrains when using biomass as a feedstock for thermal conversion reveal that size, format, moisture content and heterogeneity are the main encountered issues. Whilst mechanical processes, drying, torrefaction and pelletisation have shown enhanced results for physical aspects as well as moisture; hydrolysis, hydrothermal and microwave-based techniques are seen as the most utilized to solve problems related to morphology, degradability and digestibility. It was also found that the most significant thermal conversion techniques are torrefaction, hydrothermal processing, gasification, combustion, pyrolysis and plasma gasification. Relative to the major types of biomass applied for the production of biofuels, these are wood and woody biomass, followed by herbaceous and agricultural streams."

pub.1017484036,"Crop production and resource use to meet the growing demand for food, feed and fuel: opportunities and constraints","Global food and feed demands have been projected to double in the 21st century, which will further increase the pressure on the use of land, water and nutrients. At the same time, the political decisions to support renewable energy sources are accelerating the use of biomass, including grain, sugar, oilseed, and lignocellulosic crops for biofuel and power generation. Government directives — incited by climate change, high oil prices and geo-political tensions — promote partial replacement of fossil fuel by biofuels. Prices and availability of commodities used as staple food and feed are becoming already affected by the growing demand for bioenergy. Many implications of this demand for biofuel on the resource base (land, water, biodiversity), environment, rural economy, food prices and social impacts are unknown. The present study reviews and discusses the opportunities and limits of crops and resources for food, feed and biofuel production. There are gaps in our knowledge regarding the global capacity for sustainable plant-based bioenergy production, while maintaining food security; commercial biomass production will compete with food crops for arable land and scarce fresh water resources. The rapidly growing demand for food, feed and fuel will require a combination of further increases in crop yields (ca. 2% per annum) and a doubling or tripling of resource-use efficiencies, especially of nitrogen-use efficiency and water productivity in production systems with high external inputs, over the next 20 to 30 years. Adaptation of cropping systems to climate change and a better tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses by genetic improvement and by managing diverse cropping systems in a sustainable way will be of key importance. An integrated assessment of resource-use efficiencies, ecological services and economic profitability may guide the choice of crop species and cultivars to be grown in a target environment and region, depending on the added value for specific purposes: food, feed or fuel. To avoid negative impacts on food security, governments should give high priority to 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation technologies for bioenergy."

Information about biofuel as the most important component in the creation of mixtures of sustainable aviation fuel is summarized. The performance properties of traditional petroleum and main alternative aviation fuels are systematized. Traditional jet fuel produces a considerable amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which has raised concern on a global scale. Biomass is a promising energy source for producing either solid or liquid fuels. Biofuels are alternatives to fossil fuels to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The varieties of bio jet fuel, manufacturing procedures and the effects of bio jet fuels on the environment and the economy are all covered in length in this paper. In order to address the needs of modern aviation, biomass jet fuel has a lot of potential to replace conventional jet fuel in the future. To increase the power and quality of energy, further comprehensive research on optimal feedstocks is necessary. The key factors affecting the prospects for the use of alternative fuels in aviation include: energy characteristics, environmental friendliness in the process of production and use, fuel cost. The reasons that prevent the effective use of alternative fuels for wide implementation are indicated, and the main ways to eliminate them are outlined. The implementation of alternative jet fuel is a pivotal step that will help the sector decarbonize and simultaneously become independent of limited fossil fuel supply. In practice, technologies and feedstocks of the supply chains are heavily dependent on spatial and temporal criteria. In addition, many of the parameters investigated are interlinked to each other and the measures that are effective in greenhouse gases emissions reduction are largely associated with increased cost. That's why policies must be streamlined across the supply chain components that could help in the cost-effective and sustainable deployment of aviation biofuels. Aviation biofuels have already made some progress, and they are gradually being used not only in experimental test flights, but also in commercial aviation."

These three impacts are sometimes referred to as profits, people, and planet. Pursuing sustainability requires these entities to manage products, processes, value chains, and resources in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (Elkington 1997). On the same basis, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations (2015), call for a shared set of goals into the future. At its heart are the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), an urgent call for action by all countries around the world from an interdisciplinary perspective. Consistent with the goals for pursuing sustainability, the purpose of the book is to provide a holistic review of the state-of-the-art OR/MS research confronting and enhancing sustainability as well as to identify future research directions through bridging differences and assimilating similarities among three domains: (1) Design, Innovation, and Technology, (2) Manufacturing, Logistics, and Value Creation, and (3) Sustainable Natural Resource Management."
pub.1141917436,"Promising Sustainable Models Toward Water, Air, and Solid Sustainable Management in the View of SDGs","Abstract
The last decade has been witnessing overwhelming efforts to achieve social sustainability from mitigating the health and environmental effects to innovative new strategies for sustainable energy production. Those efforts have been devoted to exploiting sustainable materials for handling energy shortage and environmental deterioration to fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we engage in those efforts and shed new light on sustainable models applicable to water, air, and solid management from the practical standpoint of SDGs. The first sustainable model is a combination between renewable resources and sustainable materials for the fabrication of biomass/photocatalysts hybrid composites. The green hybrid photocatalysts can be synthesized by electrospinning or 3D techniques. These geometric bio-hybrid photocatalysts are the backbone of the next photocatalytic house model. These houses can significantly participate in the mitigation of climate change via CO2 capture and conversion to renewable energy and fuels. Furthermore, it anticipates that these photocatalytic houses are capable of participating in the alleviation of acid rain through converting toxic gasses such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SOx) into sustainable products. On the other hand, some suggestions have been raised to face and control microplastic pollution and one of these suggestions is introducing artificial intelligence such as tracer-based sorting as a sustainable strategy solution to enhance the plastic circular economy. The last model relies on optimizing the utilization of Jatropha in the landfill post-closure area toward integrated solid waste management and alternative biofuel production. These models will pave new ways of realizing sustainability."
pub.1143519218,Life cycle energy consumption and environmental assessment for utilizing biofuels in the development of a sustainable transportation system in Ethiopia,"Ethiopia’s transportation sector is currently dominated by internal combustion engine vehicles running using imported petroleum oil. Due to shortages in hard currency, a rising economy and population growth, and rapid industrialization, energy security to meet the national demand for transport is a quite severe problem. As a result, Ethiopia is strengthening its effort to look for clean alternative energy sources, such as biofuels and electricity. Ethiopia’s biofuel program relies on cane molasses-based ethanol and jatropha based biodiesel for blending into conventional petroleum fuels. In order to investigate the sustainability of Ethiopian biofuel production and use in transportation fuels in terms of their energy balance and environmental impacts, well-to-wheel (WTW) analysis was conducted. The WTW energy saving, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction benefits and criteria air pollutants of blending different commonly used ratios of ethanol with gasoline, biodiesel with diesel and electricity mix (mostly (90%) from hydropower) were analysed in the Ethiopian situation. It is found that both ethanol and biodiesel production has shown net energy gain and reductions in GHG emissions which indicates sustainability and, therefore, could be good substitutes for petroleum fuels if their production pathways are properly managed and implemented. Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) fuelled with a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline (E85) could save 65% fossil fuels and 29% of GHG emission reductions compared to neat gasoline vehicles. Compared to neat diesel vehicles, a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel (B20) powered vehicles could save 15% fossil energy and could remove 12% of GHG emissions per kilometre driven. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) with biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel), gasoline, and diesel showed higher savings of fossil fuel energy and less GHG emissions in every scenario."

pub.1086143936,"Role of bioenergy, biorefinery and bioeconomy in sustainable development: Strategic pathways for Malaysia"," Malaysia has a plethora of biomass that can be utilized in a sustainable manner to produce bio-products for circular green economy. At the 15th Conference of Parties in Copenhagen, Malaysia stated to voluntarily reduce its emissions intensity of gross domestic product by upto 40% by 2020 from 2005 level. Natural resources e.g. forestry and agricultural resources will attribute in achieving these goals. This paper investigates optimum bio-based systems, such as bioenergy and biorefinery, and their prospects in sustainable development in Malaysia, while analyzing comparable cases globally. Palm oil industry will continue to play a major role in deriving products and contributing to gross national income in Malaysia. Based on the current processing capacity, one tonne of crude palm oil (CPO) production is associated with nine tonnes of biomass generation. Local businesses tend to focus on products with low-risk that enjoy subsidies, e.g. Feed-in-Tariff, such as bioenergy, biogas, etc. CPO biomass is utilized to produce biogas, pellets, dried long fibre and bio-fertilizer and recycle water. It is envisaged that co-production of bio-based products, food and pharmaceutical ingredients, fine, specialty and platform chemicals, polymers, alongside biofuel and bioenergy from biomass is possible to achieve overall sustainability by the replacement of fossil resources. Inception of process integration gives prominent innovative biorefinery configurations, an example demonstrated recently, via extraction of recyclable, metal, high value chemical (levulinic acid), fuel, electricity and bio-fertilizer from municipal solid waste or urban waste. Levulinic acid yield by only 5wt% of waste feedstock gives 1.5 fold increase in profitability and eliminates the need for subsidies such as gate fees paid by local authority to waste processor. Unsustainable practices include consumable food wastage, end-of-pipe cleaning and linear economy that must be replaced by sustainable production and consumption, source segregation and process integration, and product longevity and circular economy."

pub.1151954994,Recent advances in wastewater microalgae-based biofuels production: A state-of-the-art review,"Rapidly expanding industrialization and the depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels have necessitated the discovery of feasible renewable alternatives to meet the rising energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The present global energy strategy is built on cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives; and production of microalgae has the ability to meet these requirements. Microalgae have been found as a promising and sustainable alternative for treating wastewater (WW) concurrently with biofuel production. One potential strategy, which uses microalgae for lowering the level of contamination in WW is called bioremediation. There are substantial gains to be made for both the economy and the environment through the integration of microalgae-based biofuel production with wastewater treatment (WWT). The use of microalgae that have a short life span, a high growth rate, and a high CO2 usage efficiency is one of the promising approaches for producing biomass from WW nutrients that involves the utilization of renewable resources. Microalgae are one of the most promising biomass resources for use in thermochemical conversion processes for the production of liquid and gaseous biofuels due to their advantages over other biomass feedstocks, such as sustainability, renewability, and productivity. Currently, technology and cost are the primary obstacles limiting industrial applicability, which necessitates an optimum downstream process to minimize production costs. Consequently, the concurrent utilization of microalgae for WWT and biofuel production has made these challenges practical and economically viable. This review provides an overview of microalgae and their bioremediation and bioenergy production applications. It also provides insight for future research to investigate additional possible applications of microalgal biomass. These applications could include not only the bioremediation process, but also the generation of revenues from microalgae through the incorporation of clean and green technology, which would provide long-term sustainability and environmental benefits."
pub.1054042025,‘New agriculture’ for sustainable development? Biofuels and agrarian change in post-war Sierra Leone*,"ABSTRACT In sub-Saharan Africa, commercial bioenergy production has been hailed as a new form of ‘green capitalism’ that will deliver ‘win-win’ outcomes and ‘pro poor’ development. Yet in an era of global economic recession and soaring food prices, biofuel ‘sustainability’ has been at the centre of controversy. This paper focuses on the case of post-war Sierra Leone, a country that has over the last decade been consistently ranked as one of the poorest in the world, facing food insecurity, high unemployment and entrenched poverty. Following a recent government strategy to secure foreign direct investment in biofuels production in agriculturally rich regions of the country, the largest foreign investment in Sierra Leone since the end of its civil war has been secured: a Swiss company is to invest US$368 million into a large-scale biofuels project over the course of 3 years, and promises to simultaneously stimulate an enabling environment for investment, provide job opportunities for youth and increase food production. For multiple actors involved in the project, the concept of ‘sustainability’ is crucial but accordingly there are varying interpretations of its meaning. Such differences in interpretation and the complex contradictions within discourses of sustainability are in turn framed by the various scales within which these actors are situated. While attempts have been made to manage these contradictions through global sustainability standards, the unequal power relations between different actors will ultimately determine the ways in which they are likely to be resolved. The paper concludes by reflecting on how these processes may be contributing to a changing governance landscape and wider global political economy within which bioenergy is being produced, processed and consumed."

In this scenario, the development of flexible and integrated biorefineries to produce biofuels and bioproducts from renewable biomass sources represent a key tool to perform the transition from a petroleum-based economy to a novel bioeconomy that looks for a more efficient and sustainable global development. This article analyses: the significance of biomass sources (such as agricultural and woody crops and residues, agro-food and wood processing industries residues and urban wastes) as feedstocks in the biorefinery, the most relevant biorefinering process technologies of the biochemical and thermochemical conversion pathways that are nowadays under development, and the need of further research and innovation effort to eventually achieve the commercialization and application in the market of the different biorefinery products."
pub.1169292554,17 Recovery of resources and circular economy from biomass-derived waste through aerobic and anaerobic digestion-based technique,"The desire for sustainable fuel exploration is triggered due to the thriving energy exhaustion, environmental variability, and CO2 emissions from burning of fossils fuels. In this context, biomass waste appears to be an appropriate alternative to nonrenewable resources to encounter high energy crises and uphold the environmental viability. Numerous kinds of biomass wastes that are biodegradable and largely wasted are generated in massive quantities throughout the world. A number of benefits could be gained from resource recovery of this inexpensive, plenteous, and renewable biomass waste as they have varied chemical components that may serve as beginning factors for production of diverse bio-based products such as chemicals, intermediates, and can also be used to produce bioenergy or biofuels through various conversion techniques. In this chapter, the role of aerobic and anaerobic digestion techniques for biomass “waste-to-energy” conversion such as the production of bio-based products including biogas, biohydrogen, soluble biochemicals, and other biochemicals along with the potential for nutrient recovery is discussed. Biorefinery has come out as a viable passage and accepted favorable conversion platforms for products to attain circular bioeconomy that involves the effective and feasible valorization of biomass, encourages resource reclamation and restoration, and also intensifies the energy security as biorefinery produces bioenergy in a more strategic way. Biobased circular economy remarks the biowaste and residuals as viable resources which can be used to generate biofuels, biochemicals, or nutrients needful to humans. Innovative models for better economies and improving process efficiency were emphasized including co-digestion of wastes, recovery of multiple products, and combined bioprocesses. Recent trends in wastes and their handling are greatly focusing on dealing them as recyclable resource."

This is particularly evident within the biofuels sector where a growing external demand for this good, coming from industrialized economies, has led South American countries to become global biofuels providers even when the socio-economic sustainability of this development model is still at stake. Cooperative interactions between prominent biofuel producing countries such as Argentina, Brazil are framed under regional organizations that reflect a concert of like-minded governments that composed the so-called “new Latin American left”. While an array of uncertainties monopolize the global debates around the sustainability of biofuels, policymakers in the region are turning to expert knowledge to overcome this limitation. Nonetheless, the contributions by experts for the development of sustainable biofuels in South America appears to be functional to specific sectoral biased "

Sustainable agriculture is a discipline that addresses current issues such as climate change, increasing food and fuel prices, poor-nation starvation, rich-nation obesity, water pollution, soil erosion, fertility loss, pest control, and biodiversity depletion. Novel, environmentally-friendly solutions are proposed based on integrated knowledge from sciences as diverse as agronomy, soil science, molecular biology, chemistry, toxicology, ecology, economy, and social sciences. Indeed, sustainable agriculture decipher mechanisms of processes that occur from the molecular level to the farming system to the global level at time scales ranging from seconds to centuries. For that, scientists use the system approach that involves studying components and interactions of a whole system to address scientific, economic and social issues. In that respect, sustainable agriculture is not a classical, narrow science. Instead of solving problems using the classical painkiller approach that treats only negative impacts, sustainable agriculture treats problem sources.

pub.1020709681,"The effect of bioenergy expansion: Food, energy, and environment","The increasing prices and environmental impacts of fossil fuels have made the production of biofuels to reach unprecedented volumes over the last 15 years. Given the increasing land requirement for biofuel production, the assessment of the impacts that extensive biofuel production may cause to food supply and to the environment has considerable importance. Agriculture faces some major inter-connected challenges in delivering food security at a time of increasing pressures from population growth, changing consumption patterns and dietary preferences, and post-harvest losses. At the same time, there are growing opportunities and demands for the use of biomass to provide additional renewables, energy for heat, power and fuel, pharmaceuticals and green chemical feedstocks. Biomass from cellulosic bioenergy crops is expected to play a substantial role in future energy systems. However, the worldwide potential of bioenergy is limited, because all land is multi-functional and land is also needed for food, feed, timber, and fiber production, and for nature conservation and climate protection. Furthermore, the potential of bioenergy for climate change mitigation remains unclear due to large uncertainties about future agricultural yield improvements and land availability for biomass plantations. Large-scale cultivation of dedicated biomass is likely to affect bioenergy potentials, global food prices and water scarcity. Therefore, integrated policies for energy, land use and water management are needed. As biomass contains all the elements found in fossil resources, albeit in different combinations, therefore present and developing technologies can lead to a future based on renewable, sustainable and low carbon economies. This article presents [1] risks to food and energy security [2] estimates of bioenergy potential with regard to biofuel production, and [3] the challenges of the environmental impact."
pub.1164482878,Chapter 14 Green approaches for the valorization of olive mill wastewater,"Every year, significant amounts of money and resources are invested worldwide to clean billions of litres of wastewater, which requires a substantial amount of energy. Olive mill wastewater (OMWW) is a valuable resource that can be valorized by several bioprocesses due to its high concentration of carbon sources, organic compounds and minerals. Therefore it is necessary to extend the use of low-cost biotechniques that reduce organic load and generate capital from value-added products. Since OMWW contains low to moderate amounts of nitrogen, sugar, volatile acid, polyalcohol and fat, it can be used as a feedstock to produce biofuels and other value-added products. However, the OMWW composition and biovalorization potential is influenced by various factors, such as olive variety, fruit ripeness, water use, extraction process (press or centrifuge), etc. OMWW also offers resources that can be used to improve soil fertility and productivity, due to high concentration of organic matter and the availability of numerous minerals, most notably potassium. However, microbial growth suppression by phenolic chemicals, acidic pH, low nitrogen content, etc., are challenging obstacles. Several biological approaches have been explored to reduce the organic load of OMWW and biovalorize it into valuable products such as biofuels and manure. This chapter discusses the sources, composition and biovalorization potential of OMWW for biofuel (bioethanol, biodiesel, biohydrogen, biomethane) and manure production. The focus has been placed on the most recent information available to produce biofuel and manure, as well as the accompanying challenges and their potential sustainable solutions to increase the economic viability of OMWW and green approaches to a circular economy."

pub.1167357135,Technical Implications of the Use of Biofuels in Agricultural and Industrial Compression-Ignition Engines with a Special Focus on the Interactions with (Bio)lubricants,"The environmental sustainability of agricultural and industrial vehicles, as well as of the transportation sector, represents one of the most critical challenges to the sustainable development of a nation. In recent decades, compression-ignition engines have been widely used in on-road and off-road vehicles due to their better fuel economy, autonomy, compactness, and mechanical performance (spec. the high torque values). Due to the consistent environmental impact of fossil fuels, scientists are searching for alternative energy sources while preserving the beneficial features of diesel engines. The utilization of blends of diesel fuel, biodiesel, and bioethanol fuel (referred to as “ternary blends”) is among the most promising solutions for replacing fossil fuels in the near term, allowing, at the same time, us to continue using existing vehicles until new technologies are developed, consolidated and adapted to the agricultural and industrial sector. These ternary blends can lower exhaust emissions without creating major problems for existing fuel-feeding systems, typically designed for low-viscosity fossil fuels. One of the concerns in using liquid biofuels, specifically biodiesel, is the high chemical affinity with conventional and bio-based lubricants, so the main parameters of lubricants can vary significantly after a long operation of the engine. The comprehensive literature review presented in this article delves into the technical challenges, the main research pathways, and the potential solutions associated with the utilization of biofuels. Additionally, it investigates the emerging application of nanoparticles as additives in lubricants and biofuels, highlighting their valuable potential. This study also discusses the potential implementation of bio-ethanol in ternary blends, offering a promising avenue for reducing reliance on fossil fuels while maintaining engine efficiency."
pub.1049494746,Cell Wall Engineering by Heterologous Expression of Cell Wall-Degrading Enzymes for Better Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass into Biofuels,"Huge energy demand with increasing population is addressing renewable and sustainable energy sources. A solution to energy demand problem is to replace our current fossil fuel-based economy with alternative strategies that do not emit carbon dioxide. Plant biomass is one of the best candidates for this issue. Plants use solar power to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars, which can be used in fermentation reactions to produce both energy and materials. However, the desired sugars are trapped in the highly recalcitrant cell wall as building blocks of cellulose chains. Moreover, the complexity of the plant cell wall structure hinders the hydrolysis of cellulose into fermentable sugar monomers. Although pretreatments are used to change the physical and chemical properties of the lignocellulosic biomass and improve hydrolysis rates, these pretreatments often use harsh and polluting chemicals and severely increase the cost of biofuel production. The goal of the review is to summarize recent researches, which describe generating plants with a modified cell wall and improve hydrolysis of cellulose without applying any or less pretreatment methods. Since pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is the most cost effective step in biofuel production, generating autodigestible plants could reduce the production cost of biofuels and bio-based biomaterials. One of the strategies to improve biomass conversion efficiency is the modification of the cell wall by heterologous expression of cell wall-modifying proteins. These cell wall-modifying proteins could alter the cell wall structure and reduce cell wall recalcitrance. The use of such transgenic technologies would consume less energy and chemicals when cellulose is more accessible for enzymatic hydrolysis."

pub.1141950421,"Multi-scale sustainable engineering: Integrated design of reaction networks, life cycles, and economic sectors","Efforts toward sustainable engineering have expanded the system boundary to consider the life cycle along with economic and environmental objectives. Many design problems involve selection of reactions from many alternatives, and systematic methods for choosing reaction pathways have also been developed. To prevent burden shifting, selection of reaction pathways needs to consider activities at larger scales of the life cycle and economy. In this work we develop such a framework. The resulting P2P-RNFA framework combines Reaction Network Flux Analysis (RNFA) and Process-to-Planet (P2P) frameworks by means of a novel multi-scale multi-objective optimization formulation. This framework is capable of designing chemical reaction pathways, life-cycle value-chains, and economic cash flows in an integrated manner from a superstructure network containing alternative solutions. Application to synthesizing industrial biofuel, 3-methyl-tetrahydrofuran, demonstrates the method and its features. The P2P-RNFA framework can design novel chemical pathways while being mindful about shifting impacts to larger scales."
pub.1113052609,The critical contribution of chemical engineering to a pathway to sustainability,"The vision of a pathway to a sustainable society is based on the three-pillar conception of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) that is expected to result in a significant improvement in the reliability, security, and affordability of energy, materials, water, and food. This pathway should include launching a multidisciplinary and least-cost strategy to move from today’s carbon-based economy toward a sustainable economy and, at the same time, to provide the needed energy, water, food, and materials for present and future generations. It is imperative that chemical engineers do not relinquish their leadership role in research and development as global energy systems continue to evolve in a historical cycle from primary reliance on wood to coal and oil, to current reliance on natural gas as a transitional fuel in contributing to a pathway to sustainable global energy systems. Although multidisciplinary research and development is needed to move forward on a pathway to sustainability, in this paper, specific areas of research and development are discussed in which chemical engineers should assume a leadership role or become major contributors in this critical initiative. These areas include, but are not limited to: carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration; process intensification; material recycling; water management and desalination; biofuel; natural gas production and conversion; energy storage; and renewable energy, including concentrated solar energy use in chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological processes, and advanced materials for photovoltaics."
pub.1175173287,"A review on generation, composition, and valorization of dairy processing sludge: A circular economy-based sustainable approach","This dairy industry has grown considerably in the last decade to meet the increasing requirements of the ever-rising human population. Large volumes of solid waste are generated during the processing of dairy wastewater, known as dairy processing sludge (DPS). Organic and inorganic chemicals, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorides, sulfides, fats, oils, and grease comprise most of the DPS. Discharging untreated DPS into surrounding water sources harms the environment because of its elevated organic contents. Alternatively, the DPS can potentially be transformed into struvite, char, and ash with some fertilizer equivalence values. DPS contains heavy metals, pathogens, and synthetic organic compounds (hormones and pesticides) and requires pretreatment before its direct application as a fertilizer equivalent. DPS can be effectively treated by non-conventional methods, such as earthworms converting it into nutrient-rich fertilizer. Moreover, circular economy principles can be fulfilled by recycling DPS into value-added products, such as bacterial growth media for rhizobia, stabilizing contaminated soil for growing biofuel plants (e.g., Jatropha), and further used as a potential substrate for biodiesel production. This review elucidates the generation, composition, treatments, and opportunities for reusing DPS in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner that minimizes environmental pollution and identifies important future research prospects."

pub.1181413695,An overview of xylose valorization through its conversion into high-value chemicals by yeast,"The valorization of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) holds critical importance within the circular economy framework. Xylose, a five-carbon monosaccharide and the second most abundant sugar in LCB, represents a versatile building block for industrial applications. However, its use in fermentation processes is less efficient compared to hexoses like glucose, primarily due to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae inability to metabolize this pentose. As a result, current industrial processes for xylose often rely on chemical catalysis methods, such as reduction and hydrogenation, which can have significant environmental impacts. Transitioning to sustainable processes requires both effective xylose recovery from LCB and enhanced fermentation efficiency. This review highlights LCB deconstruction techniques that yield high xylose concentrations and explores the potential of various yeast species to produce biofuels and value-added biomolecules from this pentose. This review summarizes recent advancements and highlights the potential for developing highly efficient xylose bioprocessing methodologies for sustainable biomass utilization."
pub.1157807528,Bioprocessing of Waste for Renewable Chemicals and Fuels to Promote Bioeconomy,"The world’s rising energy needs, and the depletion of fossil resources demand a shift from fossil-based feedstocks to organic waste to develop a competitive, resource-efficient, and low-carbon sustainable economy in the long run. It is well known that the production of fuels and chemicals via chemical routes is advantageous because it is a well-established technology with low production costs. However, the use of toxic/environmentally harmful and expensive catalysts generates toxic intermediates, making the process unsustainable. Alternatively, utilization of renewable resources for bioprocessing with a multi-product approach that aligns novel integration improves resource utilization and contributes to the “green economy”. The present review discusses organic waste bioprocessing through the anaerobic fermentation (AF) process to produce biohydrogen (H2), biomethane (CH4), volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and medium chain fatty acids (MCFA). Furthermore, the roles of photosynthetic bacteria and microalgae for biofuel production are discussed. In addition, a roadmap to create a fermentative biorefinery approach in the framework of an AF-integrated bioprocessing format is deliberated, along with limitations and future scope. This novel bioprocessing approach significantly contributes to promoting the circular bioeconomy by launching complete carbon turnover practices in accordance with sustainable development goals."

pub.1165262327,Chapter 4 Cash/valuable crop production on polluted land,"Earth's land degradation and contamination occur by releasing metal(loid)s and organic pollutants (benzene, asbestos, paints, plastics, crude oil, pesticides, herbicides, etc.) due to rapid industrialization, urbanization, mining, waste disposal, and agricultural practice. All these lead to loss, deterioration, and fragmentation of habitat, deforestation, and desertification of lands and pose a serious threat to human health. Sustainable land management addresses phytoremediation and efficient bioeconomy of valuable crops on polluted lands. Cash crops are plant species that are planted to make a profit and they are used for biofuel, fibers, dye, essential oils, timber/firewood, and floriculture. Cash crops can be used for phytoremediation of polluted lands because they tolerate drought/extreme temperatures/salinity/toxicity and achieve ecosystem stability, resilience, and economic benefit. Phytomanagement of cash crops on polluted lands includes phytoremediation and revitalization of contaminated sites, high yield harvest and efficient use of biomass, increase in biodiversity, an increase of organic carbon, low production cost, cooperation between science, government, and farmers with public transparency, market certification, and high ethical standards. Industrially driven agriculture can be changed through the “restoration economy” and “regenerative agriculture practice” presenting a new challenge and alternative platforms for advance practice and a sustainable bio-economy of degraded lands worldwide."

Therefore, utilization of bio-products, such as bio-oil and biofuels, is expected to increase in the near future due to environmental pressures. The overarching goal is to balance the primary dimensions of sustainability using both distributed and centralized conversion technologies. To this end, this research proposes a conceptual decision making framework to examine biomass-derived energy production system infrastructures and process-level operations.

The last two decades have witnessed a fast industrialization and the surge in the energy demands that has compelled the energy sector to think beyond fossil fuels. The energy crisis and the need for a sustainable environment development shifted the energy spectrum toward biomass‐based renewable energy generation. Alternate fuels like lignocellulosic ethanol can be produced and used for blending in gasoline and other applications for sustainable development. Saccharomyces sp. has been a fascinating yeast for fermentation processes since Ancient Greece, where it was used for wine making. There are several technical challenges with commonly used Saccharomyces sp. including: (i) does not convert pentose sugars; (ii) has low tolerance to alcohols, acids, and solvents; (iii) is very sensitive to inhibitors (e.g., furfural, 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural, aromatics, etc.) generated during hydrolysis of agrowastes; and (iv) has fermentative stresses (e.g., pH). These limitations obstruct the process when agro‐waste is used as a feedstock for biofuel production.

Endurance with the biobased products is leading to the development of a biobased economy (BBE). Assessment of environmental sustainability achieved by the production of biobased products is important to understand their decarbonization potential, and all associated impacts with their life cycle and can be measured with life cycle assessment (LCA) tool. Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) combines LCA with life cycle costing (LCC) and social life cycle assessment (sLCA). The framework of this paper is thus designed to provide an insight into biobased products with an overview of LCA as critical tools to measure sustainability. LCA methodology and its importance in determining sustainability for biobased products with associated limitations and probable solutions are also discussed. Circular economy (CE) integrating cradle-to-cradle (C2C) approach is also discussed as a promising endeavor to achieve LCE.Graphical abstract"
pub.1135914117,Sustainable Manufacturing and Technology: The Development and Evaluation,"The industrial sector, which has been criticised as a major source of pollution and environmental degradation, is now moving towards facing the challenges to cope with pressures from society. Manufacturers and their internal stakeholders have realised that considering cost, quality and productivity only is no longer sufficient to maintain their competitiveness. Customers nowadays are more intensively concerned about green products and environmentally friendly production. There is shortage of natural resources and costs are increasing, while in the labour market workers need safe and secure workplaces for their health and well-being. Government regulations and the requirements of business practices are also stricter. Faced with these pressures, manufacturers have been driven to take environmental and social issues seriously in order to ensure their licences to operate in the long run. This leads to the topic of sustainability, which has been widely considered by modern industrialised societies and academics. As the world is moving towards meeting the demands of sustainability, this chapter provides an understanding of and guidelines for how a manufacturing company can develop and evaluate its sustainability in a practical manner."
pub.1064580239,Post Copenhagen Summit Scenario: Attainment of Sustainable Energy Regime in India by Jatropha Biodiesel,"India has set a GDP growth target of 8–9% in order to transform itself from a developing into a developed world. This level of growth will most likely lead to an increased demand on crude oil imports. It is expected that India will need to increase its imports from 80% to around 90% by 2020 to meet its targeted growth objectives. High crude oil imports make Indian economy vulnerable to volatility in crude oil prices. Another key concern associated with increased crude oil demand is the increase in the green house gases (GHGs) emissions and its negative impact on the climate. At the Copenhagen Summit, participating nations have failed to reach a legally binding agreement. However, India has declared that even with its social and economic development it will not allow per capita GHGs emissions to be more than that of the developed countries (most probably Annex I non-economies in transition countries representing industrialized nations). Jatropha biodiesel is an alternative fuel that can be a potential source of energy for rural and remote areas in India. It can also be viable replacement for diesel, the largest consumed fossil fuel in India. India's National Biofuel Policy targets 20% blending of Jatropha based biodiesel with fossil-fuel based diesel by 2017. There are other significant benefits of Jatropha afforestation apart from the reduction of GHGs such as employment generation, waste land reclamation and additional earnings under clean development mechanism (CDM). Major constraints in meeting National Biofuel Policy targets are land availability without threatening food security and its cost competitiveness as compared to the fossil fuels. The objective of this study is to draw attention on the possible use of Jatropha biodiesel for attaining a sustainable energy regime in post Copenhagen Summit scenario."
pub.1164913252,Pre-Treated Crude Glycerol a Valuable Green Energy Source in the Era of Circular Bioeconomy—a Review,"Circular economy is a key factor in promoting sustainable development. It is an economic system that seeks to eliminate waste and create a closed-loop system where resources are kept in use for as long as possible. It helps to reduce the environmental impact of production and consumption. In addition to reducing waste and emissions, the circular economy also has the potential to create new economic opportunities. Crude glycerol is a low-value by-product of the biodiesel production process. It is a mixture of glycerol and impurities such as alcohols, fatty acids, salts, soaps, and water. Crude glycerol has potential use as a carbon source for biofuel production through bioconversion processes, but its impurities are a challenge to the process and affect the energy output. The article highlights the negative impact of impurities in crude glycerol on the bioconversion process and the various pre-treatment techniques that have been developed to remove the impurities and improve energy production. Furthermore, the energy balance for pre-treatment, green energy from crude/pre-treated glycerol towards circular economy and environmental sustainability are also discussed."
pub.1175692106,Agro-industrial waste to energy - Sustainable management,"To prevent the continuously growing harmful impacts of industrial biomass, a clean and green waste management method is needed that can efficiently and cost-effectively convert this biomass into valuable products and by-products. Diverse biomasses are treated to unique processes in different industries to add value to various waste products from the agricultural, and food-processing industries. Various renewable organic elements, such as agricultural waste, can be turned into bioenergy. The majority of garbage may be managed such that only artificial materials are disposed of, allowing for proper physical or biological recycling. Utilizing clean technologies can help reduce waste, boost productivity, and lower the cost per unit of the final product. In addition to enabling waste recycling in an environment-friendly way, the valorization followed by the proper usage of biomass has an effective social and economic impact. This opens the door for a circular economy model for the different industries. The stress on energy resources is caused by the needs of the constantly growing population. It is conceivable that valuing biomass can lay a beneficial outcome in the form of bioenergy. A positive development for environmental preservation is the decrease in biowaste deposition and the substitution of conventional fuel with biofuels. These techniques control the accumulation of garbage on the planet and present a source of sustainable energy available to each living being. The economics of producing biofuels may be enhanced by co-producing them with other valuable byproducts. An Iranian study found that combining agricultural waste and animal fats can produce 527.55 million L of bioethanol and 58,945.95 tons of biodiesel each year. This review demonstrates an overview of how biomass can be used productively as a renewable energy source globally. Among all the agro-waste, lignocellulose waste has the highest potential to be used as a renewable source on a large scale in the form of biofuel."
pub.1072432563,Fluoroelastomer Compatibility with Bioalcohol Fuels,"Global acceptance and use of biofuels is growing rapidly in the transportation sector. Diminishing reserves of limited and costly fossil fuel resources and a growing realization that world peak oil production will most likely occur within the next decade is driving significant investment in sustainable biofuels. Legislative, regulatory and market forces are driving developments which seek to reduce vehicle emissions, improve fuel efficiency, lower environmental greenhouse gases and strengthen the economy. The use of alternate, sustainable, renewable fuels, preferably of domestic origin, is fostering considerable investment in new technologies. One promising technology is the addition of aliphatic alcohols to gasoline and diesel fuels. The compatibility of seal and hose materials commonly used in automotive fuel systems with conventional hydrocarbon fuels is well known. Over the past forty-five years fluorohydrocarbon elastomers have been successfully used in passenger car and truck and off-highway gasoline and petrodiesel fuel delivery and metering systems. More recently, biofuels such as ethanol have become technically and economically attractive blending constituents for gasoline and diesel fuels. These biomass fuels present their own set of material compatibility challenges to automotive fuel storage, delivery, and metering system component hardware. In this presentation the compatibility of selected fluoroelastomers with ethanol and butanol, and their respective alcohol-based blend fuels, will be reviewed. Fluoroelastomers that have historically been used for petroleum based fuels will be compared to several new types that display improved compatibility and sealing functionality with alcohol-based fuels. Accelerated long term testing results will be presented that characterize physical properties and property retention in bioalcohols through 1008 hours at 40°C. Properties relevant to sealing applications and hose will also be discussed and best in class elastomers will be highlighted, so that, in gaining a better understanding of the respective capabilities of high performance fluorohydrocarbon elastomers, the engineer may design more robust sealing systems for bioalcohol service."
pub.1145749703,Circular agri-food economies: business models and practices in the potato industry,"Circular economies are an important pillar of sustainable production and consumption. This particularly applies to the agri-food industry, which is characterised by large amounts of organic waste and by-product streams posing a serious challenge for many food producers. Therefore, respective firms increasingly adopt circular economy business models (CEBMs) to manage these resource flows effectively. However, there is only little knowledge on the functioning of CEBMs in bio-based industries, especially from a socio-economic perspective. We address this gap by exploring enablers and motivations behind such business models as well as the institutional contexts they are embedded in. In methodological terms, we adopt a case study approach using the example of potato production in Lower Saxony (northwest Germany). The core of the paper is a qualitative in-depth analysis of four potato processors, adopting varying business models to valorise their by-product streams (e.g. peels, scraps, pulp) either ‘in-house’ or in partnerships with external partners. The findings show that the implementation of CEBMs results from a complex interplay of internal and external enablers, with economic considerations as the main impetus for the management of biological reverse cycles. Thereby, we found a shifting economic logic in the assessment of potato by-products from disposable waste to valuable resources for other sectors (e.g. livestock farming, bioenergy, biofuels). While being encouraged by targeted policies, the companies studied feel increasingly affected by emerging sustainability discourses, prompting them to (re)design and (re)frame their CEBMs in view of environmental and societal issues."
pub.1139157705,De-carbonized energy initiative with bio-cell-distributed stations using GIS geodesic tools towards circular economy,"De-carbonized energy implementation involves experts to integrate inter-connected strategic objectives. Pragmatic sustainable development requires substitution of fossil-fuel energy with cleaner energy. Simultaneously, demonstrating circular economy through waste-to-energy concept is another perspective to foster renewable energy resources. Biomass energy has the highest share in the renewable energy plan of most countries. UNDP (United Nation Development Program) has established a project to provide rural areas with bio cells that intake only animal waste. In the light of rural sustainable development, as part of this research proposal, bio cells can be upgraded by local manufacturers to be fuelled with crop residue, which will reduce crop residue burn. Instead of crop residue burn in open areas, polluting the Cairo skies with a black cloud or smog and endangering urban environmental health through escalating urban heat island phenomenon, agriculture waste can be utilized as an energy source of biofuels, bio-power or even bio-by-products to substitute liquefied petroleum gas or integrated within UNDP project upgrade. The novelty of this research is demonstrating bio cells in distributed stations at fire-hotspot location to supply decarbonized energy resources for communities rehabilitated within the GIS geodesic buffer. These distributed stations support LEED-ND rating system criteria of on-site energy generation. Such demonstration at fire spots through developing brownfield zones is a sustainable opportunity for misused zones. Numerical calibration of Orduz energy potential equation developed in 2011 shows that the generated bioenergy is 531.59 PJ, equivalent to 1.48E + 11 kWh annually. Such feasible sustainable development strategy through energy resources convergence promotes self-sufficient clusters."

pub.1152888751,ACTUAL PROBLEMS OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY: FAMINE AND MALNUTRITION,"Introduction. At the end of 2019, almost 690 million people or 8.9% of the world population experienced physical and moral sufferings as a result of the deficit of edible food with a proper nutritious value. The lack of food became lethal for many people. On 20 August, 2020, 
7134 thousand people died of starvation. The most deplorable fact is that the third part of those who died of starvation is children. Besides chronic famine, more and more people are facing the problem of temporary famine or malnutrition, i.e. forced decrease of food consumed and its quality. Two billion people or 25.9% of the world population didn’t have regular access to a sufficient amount of nutritious food in 2019. Deficit of nutritious calories, low quality of food and its imbalance result in physical and mental development delay of people. Losses of labor productivity because of famine can cause GDP decrease per capita by 6-10%.
The Purpose is the advancement of urgent problems of famine and lack of delivery for the implementation of the concept of stable development in the framework of the global economy.
Results. The main reasons of the current scale of famine and malnutrition could be the following: 1) reduction of land areas suitable for agricultural production; 2) increase of food raw materials for biofuel production; 3) increase of the fresh water deficit; 4) change of the climate causing the frequency and the scale of devastating floods, droughts, fires, hurricanes, etc.; 5) poverty; 6) pandemic COVID-19; 7) military conflicts. Solution of the global problem of famine and malnutrition requires a complex approach. Analysis of the factors causing this problem shows that the application of the previous approaches is not sufficient under current conditions. We think that the top-priority task in the task list of UNO aimed at the achievement of zero hunger is the prevention of further climate changes, immediate adaptation of local systems of agricultural production to new conditions, preservation and extensive restoration of the resource potential of rural territories. Mentioned tasks correspond to the fulfillment of the conditions of sustainable development. It means that the implementation of the concept of sustainable development within the global economy is a powerful tool to solve the global issue of famine and malnutrition.

pub.1174475141,Bottlenecks and Opportunities in Applications of Irradiation-Based Technologies for Industrial Scale Waste Biomass Valorization,"In light of the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and growing concerns regarding harm to the environment, it is imperative to shift towards a bioenergy-centric economy, which is more sustainable. As a feasible alternative to fuels and chemicals, biomass has been identified as a viable solution for it. Conversion of biomass to biofuels is done through various conventional heating techniques. Among these, irradiation-based technologies (gamma-ray radiation, electric field, microwave, and ultrasonication) lately attracted more attention on a global scale. In the context of mass production of the desired product (such as biofuels and value-added chemicals) is challenging because technology transfer from lab scale to industrial level is in the initial phases. Adopting these technologies requires consideration of many other aspects, such as economic and environmental sustainability. However, there are still several challenges for irradiation-based biorefineries. Silent characteristics such as rapid reaction, increased productivity, faster heating rates, better efficiency, and environmental friendliness make irradiation a more reliable technology. Acceptance of irradiation-based industry in the fossil-based industry is also challenging because of the feedstock supply, product composition, efficiency of resource recovery, quantity and cost of the product needed in the market demand, and techno-economic viability. This study thoroughly explains the techniques and concepts of these technologies, their current scenarios, bottlenecks, and future opportunities."
pub.1154681040,Chapter 29 Conversion of waste materials into different by-products of economic value,"The world is pitching with a massive amount of waste that will soon amount to billions of tons. The management of this waste presents a significant challenge. The circular economy is emerging as a new rational waste management approach in which wastes generated in one process are up-cycled into value-added products. This chapter lists the biotechnological conversion of organic waste materials into various by-products with economic value. Bio-organic fertilizers, enzymes, organic acids, biofuels, biomaterials, polysaccharides, flavors and fragrance, biomass for bioremediation, adsorbent for bioremediation, dietary fiber, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, pH indicator films, pigments, single-cell protein, and natural colorant are all economically valuable products. Bio-organic fertilizers made from organic wastes can be used to support long-term agricultural production. Enzymes secreted by microorganisms during organic waste biodegradation can be harvested and used in a variety of biochemical activities and industries. Organic waste fermentation can yield biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, and hydrogen. The use of biofuels for energy production has the potential to significantly reduce environmental pollution. Through various biotechnological processes, biomaterials such as biopolymers, bio-plastics, and adsorbents for a variety of applications can be synthesized from organic wastes. It can be seen that utilizing waste materials to create products with economic value is both economical and sustainable. It has the potential to create a clean and green environment while also providing economic benefits."

The growing awareness of the necessity to enhance agricultural production is gaining attention, primarily driven by the imperative to adequately nourish the continuously expanding global population. Diverse agricultural practices are causing harmful environmental consequences, posing a significant risk to ecological stability through issues such as soil degradation, water pollution, habitat loss, and biodiversity decline. Timely and effective agricultural waste management has become essential for preventing adverse environmental and health impacts. Biomass from rice crop harvesting and processing has been found in abundance around the world. Because of the abundance of this biomass in nature, researchers are harnessing it for various objectives, including global energy requirements, while supporting environmental sustainability. Due to this rationale, within the frameworks of emerging sustainable and circular models, the prioritization of agricultural waste valorization has gained prominence as a pivotal strategy aimed at advancing sustainable management and circular economy. This review mainly emphasizes on the rice bio-waste, its environmental and health-related issues, policies to control stubble burning, reduce pollution in the air, and sustainable management of the bio-waste into wealth using different approaches worldwide. We also investigated the potential contribution of rice-by-products wastes to bioenergy production (bioethanol, biogas, and biofuel), enzymes, nanoparticles, construction materials, animal husbandry, bioplastics, and other value-added products. We recommend that proper management of rice by-products may produce innovative bio-ingredients and biodegradable materials, and enhance green growth and a circular bioeconomy."
pub.1145533324,Application of Microalgae for Removal of Pharmaceuticals from Aqueous Matrices,"The population growth associated with increasing urbanization and industrialization led to water contamination by a complex mixture of emerging pollutants. Some of them are not efficiently removed by the conventional processes used in wastewater treatment plants and may enter and persist in the aquatic environment, contaminating surface and underground waters. One of the classes of emerging contaminants of increasing concern is pharmaceuticals, due to their high and continuous consumption. The search for effective and sustainable tertiary treatments is needed, such as biological treatments, which are considered eco-friendly, economically viable, and sustainable. This chapter covers the use of microalgae for the removal of emerging pollutants removal from water matrices, focusing special attention on the removal of pharmaceuticals. The use of microalgae in wastewater treatment has aroused the interest of the scientific community at the international level, as a promising technology to improve treatment efficiency, constituting a more sustainable alternative to advanced treatment processes. Besides microalgae's ability to remove nutrients, after use they can also be valorized through biofuels production, which follows the principles of circular economy, generates sufficient revenues, and contributes to the economic viability of the treatment."
pub.1124678677,Valorization of Agricultural Wastes and Biorefineries: A Way of Heading to Circular Economy,"In a circular economy, one tries to encompass closed loops between different value chains introducing changes in the production and consumption patterns. Design for the environment, extended producer responsibility, critical consumption, cleaner production, biomimicry, degrowth, etc. are some of the strategies that will help to foster a circular economy. Industrial symbiosis is another effective strategy to achieve such a goal. Agro-industrial wastes provide an enormous potential to generate sustainable products and bioenergy. An integrated biorefinery is turning into a promising solution with multiple outputs (biofuel, bioactive compounds, and biomaterials). In this paper a couple of biorefineries are described as a way to contribute to circular economy: a biorefinery based in seeds and vegetable wastes and a biorefinery based in a cactus’ fruit, Opuntia Joconostle. Also, the possible valorizations of different agricultural wastes in Mexican systems and the symbiotic systems are described. The combination of several of these synergies in the same system will lead to an industrial symbiosis system. The use of these symbiotic systems on a large scale could give a significant contribution towards a circular economy in the agricultural sector. Most of the valorizations described have been tested or proposed by the authors in real examples in Spain and Mexico. Barriers and lessons learned in the implementation of both biorefinery and symbiotic systems are discussed."

Food cannot be substituted by other products and can only be expanded through agronomic technology development, while energy can be generated from various sources, including by converting food into biofuels. Food and energy can be developed in Indonesia that has potential on the local endowment to produce food, generate primary energy (solar, wind, and water), and utilise new source renewable energy. In Indonesia, food and energy can be improved with enormous potency on local endowment to mount food production, produce primary energy (solar, wind, and water), as well as finding a new platform of renewable energy sources. Local or native food and the provision of alternative energy sources can encourage economic activity in local communities and promote bargaining positions in the global economy. Development on local food and alternative energy can be done by paying attention the use of local resource, function and role of community development and local organizations to support rural economic development and sustainable agriculture."

Although such lands would be less productive and subject to higher risks, their use for bioenergy plantations could have secondary benefits, such as restoration of degraded vegetation, carbon sequestration and local environmental services. In most countries, however, the suitability of this land for sustainable biofuel production is poorly documented. We summarized and defined the marginal land and then applied the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis to diagnose and identify the economic, environmental and social impacts from bioenergy production on marginal land. The results show the strengths include land available, energy crop adaptability and rural economy development, while the weaknesses include economic viability, environmental impacts, and equity and gender concerns. The renewable energy planning target, consideration of food security, biofuel policies and technology development will create the external environment to promote bioenergy production on marginal land, but also rise in fuel price and higher labour cost, natural hazards as well as crisis on financial market will be the threats."
pub.1137127935,Biomass Conversion and Green Chemistry,"Chemicals and biofuels can be obtained from biological systems (biomass). Currently, biomass expenditures should be decreased by planning alternate methods and catalytic arrangements, because those used for hydrocarbons have not been efficiently adapted for the molecular structures of biological compounds. To avoid competitiveness with food sources, lignocellulosic feedstocks must to be used differently for expected yields, mostly in the biological production of fuel. A valuation of the life-cycle of feedstocks should be completed to determine environmental impacts and can be used as a exploratory tool for the development of products. Reasonable and modern advance needs nearing destruction, practical incomes of life. For the development of sustainable, low-cost, natural, basic materials, novel approaches in research, manufacturing, and the economy are crucial. This chapter focuses on cost-efficient tools and processes to convert biomass into valuable biological fuels and bioproducts, with particular emphasis on biorefinery concepts to create the diverse feedstocks that are used to manufacture high-value products. This chapter also explores the biological characteristics of developments, because the use of renewables as raw materials does not exempt them from green chemistry principles."
pub.1175267103,Sustainable management and valorization of antibiotic waste,"Global excessive antibiotic use has created widespread multi-drug resistance and increased antibiotic waste. Research mitigating antibiotic resistance is growing, but less attention has been shown towards sustainable antibiotic waste management. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of antibiotic waste management by incorporating environmental, economic, and societal sustainability practices compounded with innovative valorization techniques and machine learning tool. Findings established the importance of pre-treating antibiotic waste prior to disposal by adding pharmaceutical processing residues (PPRs) and antibiotic fermentation residues (AFRs) to value-added products like PPR derived biofuel, β-lactam waste-based chlorhexidine GUMBOS, and AFR- & wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)-based biofertilizers and biochar, and also explored the trending topics of antibiotic waste valorization towards circular economy by machine learning technique. The transformation of antibiotic waste through various valorization techniques holds potential to address disposal issues by eliminating the entry of hazardous antibiotic compounds into the environment and simultaneously creating new value-added products. This contributes to environmental sustainability and generates employment opportunities. Current challenges to valorization techniques include improved sustainable and cleaner production technologies to add antibiotic waste value-added products to energy and agricultural sectors."
pub.1146669250,How to Properly Account for Sustainable Production and Supply Chains in Modern Tariff Schedules and Trade Rules," A recent Resolution adopted by the European Parliament on ‘palm oil and deforestation of rainforests’ included, among its Recommendations, a call to reform the tariff classifications maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO), so as to recognize sustainable versus unsustainable palm oil. Furthermore, the Resolution called for such a differentiation, at least for products imported into the EU, to be based on yet-to-be-developed sustainability criteria, which the Resolution also outlined and called for. This article explores the potential feasibility of distinguishing tariff classifications based on process-characteristics rather than product-characteristics, while contrasting such approach to non-tariff related measures implemented by major economies (e.g., tying biofuel subsidies to ‘renewability’ in the United States, or to ‘sustainability’ in the European Union). The article also discusses the sustainability criteria outlined and proposed by the European Parliament, as well as their relation to other sustainability criteria present on the world stage, trying to identify the scope, tools and legal ambits through which tariff advantages could be provided to sustainable products in a WTO consistent and non-discriminatory manner.

pub.1170818494,Advances in Enzymatic Hydrolysis and Saccharification Technology,"Bioconversion of biomass and production of value-added products is the most appropriate pathway for a sustainable economy. Lignocellulosic biomass is a plentiful available natural resource and a promising raw material for valorization. Enzymatic hydrolysis is a central process for generating fermentable sugars, which can be utilized to produce biofuels. The process must have low energy input and the highest conversion rate for economic viability. For complete hydrolysis of complex lignocellulosic wastes, several types of enzymes, i.e., cellulase, xylanase, ligninase, β- glucosidase, etc., are employed, but their effectiveness is constrained without pretreatment. Factors like solid loading rate, temperature, enzyme concentration, and inhibitors affect saccharification. Successful process modeling can solve problems like feedback inhibition of enzymes, mixing, and heat-mass transfer, ultimately making the process economically viable. A potential multi-activity enzyme cocktail, impartial SSF, the addition of supplements, and enzyme engineering technologies can be applied to enhance the saccharification yield. It can be anticipated that current research in the field of enzymatic saccharification will lead to promising technologies for large-scale operation in industries for various lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis, which can be further used for biofuel production."

Although the high-quality olive oil is usually destined for human consumption, lower oil grades or waste materials from the olive mill can be used to produce a plethora of valuable products, such as biofuel, soil fertilisers, medicines, enzymes, food packaging biopolymers and even building materials and textile dyes. Furthermore, compounds from olive mill wastewater have been found to stimulate plant growth by affecting their metabolism and also have potent antimicrobial properties, helping the biocontrol of hazardous plant pathogens. All these applications of olive products and by-products can help establish a sustainable circular economy through recycling of waste and resources."
pub.1128631446,Mapping of research lines on circular economy practices in agriculture: From waste to energy," Agriculture is one of the sectors that strongly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions on the planet. In this sense, circular economy practices can be advantageous when using bioenergy in the agro-industrial sector. Although only about 9% of the world's economy is circular, global initiatives have acted to change that scenario. Unlike the linear economy (take-make-use-dispose), the circular economy (grow-make-use-restore) aims to influence material and energy flows to increase environmental gains and avoid costs. Based on that, this study aims to map bioenergy boosters through circular economy practices in agriculture. To that end, a systematic literature review was conducted to present what is being developed in this field. To identify the most relevant, high impact, studies in the area, the systematic literature review was performed in three databases, covering all available literature up to date. The main research themes, applications, research topics, area of activity, countries, journals, publisher, and history of publication were identified. Therewith, some trends and perspectives could be drawn. To date, no solidly established authors have been identified in the area. The theme is recent and the vast majority of documents have been published over the last four years. European countries have been pioneering and are the most prominent in terms of publications. The electricity generation and biofuel produced from biogas have shown representativeness and are sustainable opportunities to advance the theme. Therefore, this study can contribute to encouraging the agricultural sector in implementing or increasing the use of circular economy practices."

            This entry reviews the technological and scientific developments generated by the Green Revolution and how their intensive and extensive implementation have been decisive factors in the sustainability of the world’s production of crops for food, feed, fiber, and biofuels. It also discusses their impact on the landscape, water resources, environment, economy, culture, socioeconomic development, and the attitude and worldview of producers in developing countries towards agrochemicals, agricultural practices, and management and monoculture productivity. To date, the Green Revolution has focused on the global issue of sustainable development by concentrating exclusively on crop production; that is, by assessing only productivity per hectare or yields derived from technological breakthroughs, improved seeds, irrigation systems, and the suitability of the land to make it viable and sustainable to cultivate a given crop in a region. However, to achieve sustainable development it is necessary to incorporate aspects such as: organic agriculture, precision agriculture tools, life cycle analysis, soil and plant health, environmental impacts, water quality, post-harvest technology, by-product uses, and peasant and farmer perceptions of new paradigms such as globalization, value chains, competitiveness, bioeconomics, biorefineries, etc. Therefore, strategies for technical advice; training; skills development; transfer and adoption of technologies and knowledge; experiences and innovations with a multi-, trans-, and interdisciplinary approach; and the participation of higher education with all actors and decision-makers are essential to achieve the transition to an evergreen revolution and sustainable development."

pub.1126628784,The circular economy concept application to livestock systems: an agroecological approach,"Abstract  Over the last century, livestock systems  have undergone a progressive intensification process, which brought to light many environmental and agronomical issues, mainly related to manure management. An agroecological approach has also been advocated to develop more sustainable systems and ensure a balanced relationship between environmental, social and economic goals. The circular economy (CE) concept was placed next to that of agroecology, and its application to manure management was finalized to reduce the input and use of natural resources, increase sharing of energy and natural resources and reduce pollution. This review comprehensively reports the more interesting opportunities for European Cattle breeding, considering that its waste management plays an important role from the agroecological point of view. Many technologies based on biological and/or thermochemical processes are currently available and different studies on how to improve their efficiency are under way. The biorefinery concept concerns the lignocellulosic fraction exploitation for biofuels, by-products and biochar/hydrochar production. The enhancement of farm nutrient utilization could restore the balance between input and output. The knowledge of the fertilizing/amendment properties of the manure and its by-products could create a synergistic development at landscape scale considering other agricultural production (crops, orchards, vineyards, etc.). Some ecological services such as soil fertility, biological regulations, soil erosion and biological diversity provided by animal farming could be a product of the transition towards circular economy. By adopting an agroecological approach, the enhancement of the energetic, agronomic and biochemical exploitation of manure will be sustainable. "

Developing a viable system for sustainable management of agro-industrial waste is imperative. Efficient and cost-effective technologies for turning biowaste into value-added products, as well as an assessment of soil quality and productivity, are needed in this approach. The biomass of agro-waste produced while sugarcane processing, sugarcane bagasse (SCB), is abundant worldwide. The abundance of this biomass in nature harnesses researchers to fulfill its various objectives, including energy and environmental sustainability. To scale this up for industrial applications, thorough research, scale-up studies, and evaluations of both techno-economic and ecological feasibility are critical. Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is a biomass with great potential to help meet global energy needs, particularly in producing biofuels such as bioethanol and biogas, while contributing to environmental sustainability. Microorganisms, acting as bio-factories, are highly valuable due to their ability to produce various essential metabolites, including alcohols, enzymes, antibiotics, and other compounds. Fermenting SCB with microorganisms yields several industrially relevant enzymes, such as amylases, chitinases, and phytases, and demonstrates bioactive properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-ageing, and anti-inflammatory effects. This review focuses on recovering value-added products from the SCB using various microbes, their short- and long-term impacts on the environment (air, water, and soil), living creatures, and their potential for sustainable bio-economy."
pub.1169395410,Transforming the potential of renewable food waste biomass towards food security and supply sustainability,"Food loss and waste arise at every single phase of the food supply chain. The waste fraction produced through the supply system pretenses substantial dares to food sustainability and security worldwide. Nevertheless, this renewable waste biomass also possesses enormous potential to be converted into a value-added resource through emerging sustainable tools and practices. Converting renewable food waste fractions into useful products is a robust tool to report the demanding challenges of the food supply system and sustainability. With the aid of employing emerging technologies namely bioconversion, enzymatic hydrolysis, microbial digestion and so forth food loss and waste could be transformed into bioactive compounds, biofuels, bio-energy, single-cell protein source fertilizers, and various other high-end products. Furthermore, in this review, the associative investigation of prevailing literature and scientific studies related to renewable food waste fraction has been encompassed. The review also elucidates the present-day status of food waste production, associated ecological impact, as well as the potential of transforming the waste fraction into value-added products. The opportunity ranges from numerous scientific, technological, and policy mediations intended at increasing food safety and distribution sustainability. Fascinatingly, these practices not only proved to decrease leftover and its related ecological impression but also donate to circular economy development. By promoting circular economy tactics and embracing sustainable approaches, it’s evident to decrease food waste, and environmental effects, and build a better robust and sustainable food supply for the existing and upcoming population."
pub.1150607267,Functional Metagenomics for Bioprospecting Novel Glycosyl Hydrolases in 2G Biofuel Production from Lignocellulosics,"Due to the rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves, 2G biofuel production from lignocellulosics is considered as an alternative and sustainable energy source. Lack of economically viable and feasible bioprocess for lignocellulosic valorization hampers commercialization of 2G biofuels. For reducing carbon trade, countries like India are in the quest of replacing petroleum-based fuels to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to boost circular economy (reduce and recycle). The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose by glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) highlights the importance of cellulases and xylanases in the whole saccharification process. Currently, biorefineries demand robust biocatalysts (cellulases, hemicellulases) that can perform under extreme conditions of temperature, pH, or cations. A large number of GHs from different microorganisms have been explored. Still, there exists a huge gap between the available GHs and what is required by bioprocessing industries. Genetic and protein engineering techniques are not able to deliver industry-compatible extremophilic GHs. Considering the limitations of culture-dependent techniques, the combination of omics approaches with metagenomics is being explored for unraveling novel robust GHs from diverse environments. The chapter provides comprehensive insight to GHs and their structural and catalytic properties, expression patterns, and sequence identities. Furthermore, the chapter also summarizes the recent trends in metagenomics and its unleashing potential for unraveling GHs from extreme environments, which open new avenues in modern lignocellulosic-based biorefineries. Due to the rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves, 2G biofuel production from lignocellulosics is considered as an alternative and sustainable energy source. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose by glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) highlights the importance of cellulases and xylanases in the whole saccharification process.

It summarizes the recent trends in metagenomics and its unleashing potential for unraveling GHs from extreme environments, which open new avenues in modern lignocellulosic-based biorefineries. The β-glucosidase enzyme mediates glycosyl moiety transfer among nucleophilic oxygens. This enzyme hydrolyzes cellobiose, which is one of the rate-limiting steps defining the rate of reaction. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) or cellulose-binding domains are generally a polypeptide chain next to some GHs and fold independently. CBMs are predominantly associated with cellulose binding, which directs enzymes towards catalytic fragments."
pub.1032910374,Catalytic Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Value-Added Organic Acids in Aqueous Media,"The transition from today’s fossil-based economy to a sustainable economy based on renewable biomass is driven by the concern of climate change and anticipation of dwindling fossil resources. Although biofuels are the central theme of the transition, biomass resources cannot completely replace petroleum. It is projected that biofuels can only supply up to 30 % of today’s transportation fuel market even if all available domestic biomass resources are used for the production of liquid fuels. Therefore, transformation of biomass into high-value-added chemicals is advantageous to secure optimal use of the abundant, but limited, biomass resources from the economical and ecological perspective. Industry is increasingly considering bio-based chemical production as an attractive area for investment. The potential for chemical and polymer production from biomass is substantial. The US Department of Energy recently issued a report which listed 12 chemical building blocks considered as potential building blocks for the future. Organic acids (e.g., succinic, lactic, levulinic acid, etc.) are among the widely spread “platform-molecules,” which may be further converted into possibly derivable high-value-added chemicals. The transition from a fossil chemical industry to a renewable chemical industry will likewise depend on our ability to focus research and development efforts on the most promising alternatives. In this chapter, we review the emerging technologies on catalytic conversion of biomass to value-added organic acids in aqueous media."
pub.1163088952,An overview of the integrated biogas production through agro‐industrial and livestock residues in the Brazilian São Paulo state,"Abstract Recently, new solutions have arisen to promote bioenergy expansion, some of which meet the requirements of reliability, sustainability, and governance. In Brazil, the Sao Paulo state (SPS) is characterized by strong agro‐industrial and livestock activities, which generates increasing residues in the last years with the potential to produce bioenergy and offer environmental and economic benefits. The Brazilian National Biofuel Policy (Renovabio) has been enhanced to seek sustainable development, encouraging new agribusiness research. Studies have shown that the sugarcane sector, a conventional ethanol and bioelectricity producer, has the greatest potential to produce biogas/biomethane, which can be maximized with the introduction of co‐substrates regionally generated from corn, soy, orange, coffee, poultry, and swine. This overview, based on the main SPS agro‐industrial and livestock residues, shows innovative alternatives for integrating anaerobic co‐digestion (co‐AD) processes through a regional strategy, by providing long‐term revenues and greenhouse gas mitigation, which would also spread the discussion for National and International prospects. This study discusses logistical, political, and financial aspects, revealing a promising business model supported by public policies. However, its feasibility requires a real economic assessment with the inclusion of decarbonization credits, and political subsidies for biomethane as a biofuel under the Renovabio, which will facilitate its insertion into the agro‐industry in the coming years.

It first recalls the main conclusions of the June 2010 Global Change Research II, Porquerolles Conference (environmental degradation related to energy production, links between energy and human needs, energy and environment, interface among technologies, science, and society). It explains the architecture of the book, which fairly faithfully follows the conference plan, including new contributions that were not presented at the conference. It brings some particular comments about climate change and exhaustion of resources, the relationship between basic science and the development of sustainable energy technologies, between global and local environmental policies: technologies, economy, law. The conclusions emphasize five technological keys (and their main issues) to the solution of the energy/environmental crisis: improvement of energy efficiency and savings, green electricity production (if new storage technologies are available), nuclear energy (if its sustainability is increased), carbon management, energy vector use optimization (biofuels if the planet alimentation is not threatened, emergence of the hydrogen society, smartgrids). Finally, last but not least, a sixth key is to be found in the domain of humanities and social sciences, law, politics (negotiations at international level, financial rules, etc.). It also emphasizes the need for basic science research for providing breakthroughs in the field of energy."

A transition to a more sustainable economic system driven by biological resources is vital. Thus, this study was carried out to assess the role agroforestry can play in the transition to a sustainable economic system in Cameroon—the bioeconomy. A mixed methods data collection approach was used. Findings revealed the existence of a plethora of agroforestry systems/practices provides a multitude of biological resources/ecosystem services notably biomass, which can be used as biofuel, reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Moreover, trees/shrubs in agroforestry systems contribute toward carbon sequestration, thereby mitigating climate change. The monetary value of products from agroforestry systems/practices is substantial, with extrapolations from our study showing that agroforestry alone could inject several billions of franc of Financial Cooperation in Central Africa (FCFA) (several millions of $ US) annually into the economy if well developed, which can drive a thriving bioeconomy. The biological resources provided by different agroforestry systems/practices can therefore play a great role in the transition to a bioeconomy in Cameroon, reducing dependence on the fossil fuel-based economy, which is environmentally malign."

But to be effective and utilizable at an industrial scale, certain issues from economically and environmentally sustainable production point of view still needs clarification. Species range from photosynthetic fermentative bacteria to green microalgae and cyanobacteria have the capacity to produce hydrogen. Producing hydrogen biologically represents a possible channel for the sustainable generation of hydrogen over a large scale, required to fuel a hydrogen economy in near future. Biological processes compared to conventional or physical production methods manifest various edges while conducting at ambient pressure and temperature conditions, without using precious metals for catalyzing reactions. Producing hydrogen biologically is a promising route from an environmental friendly viewpoint. Photobiological hydrogen production is examined as one of the promising technology and started to become a mature technology with significant advances in substituting energy derived from fossil fuels. Withal, the chief bottleneck while developing a practical approach is the low yield associated with it, approximately around 25%, which is comparatively well below from the production of other biofuels with the use of same feedstocks. This chapter introduces the microorganisms for the biohydrogen production, production processes, and types of photobioreactors for the production of hydrogen following certain challenges that exist in this very particular area along with the environmental and economic analysis of the same."
pub.1138864996,Lignocellulosic biomass based biorefinery: A successful platform towards circular bioeconomy,"Biorefining of second-generation feedstock gains more attention to improve the living standards and promote circular bioeconomy. The biorefinery concept made an effort to make the environmentally sustainable and economical products. Lignocellulosic biomass is widely available and extensively tested feedstock to produce biofuels, bioenergy and different value- products. By the integration of process to fractionate the lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose can add more values in the process chain that required integration and optimized technologies followed by life cycle analysis and economic assessment. The life cycle and economic analysis together assess the impacts on environment, economic and all the impacts which are involved indirectly throughout the product stages from cradle to grave. The improvement and integration of the current biorefinery process recommends the newer and sustainable bio-economy and will replace the fossil fuels with the renewable reserve. In techno-economic perspective, the optimization of integrated technologies for the production of biofuels and other bioproducts have still to be optimized for efficient production. The proper adoption of pretreatment methods increases the economic value in biorefinery process. The main aim of this review is to summarize the three key research areas that required more attentions, they are; (a) valorization of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose into value added products, (b) integrated biorefinery approach and process optimization; and (c) circular bioeconomy and its future perspective. This review concludes that the lignocellulosic integrated biorefinery approach is feasible to support the circular bioeconomy, through which number of value products could be derived."
pub.1157992139,Chapter 12 Biotechnological interventions in the valorization of the organic waste,"The enormous amount of organic waste generation results in problems associated with its management and disposal. In addition, tighter disposal regulations and the need for renewable and biofuels motivate researchers and manufacturers toward sustainable waste degradation to improve cost and fulfil people's demands. Food waste, agriculture waste, oil waste, and animal waste are generally composted or incinerated; however, these conventional methods are not adequate as these processes generate toxic gases, bad odor, have slow kinetics, and require high energy for reactions to take place. Many researchers have focused on modern technologies to degrade and decompose waste. Biotechnology-based processing of waste not only circumvents the problem of their disposal but also facilitates the production of value-added products in the most economical way. Organic waste is rich in nutrients and can be used as feedstocks for enzymatic and microbial degradation. Recent research is oriented toward utilizing their nutritional values to generate the best out of waste such as biofuels, pharmaceuticals, enzymes, organic acids, fertilizers, etc. This approach paves pathways to develop an economy based on green technology and an effective valorization strategy for producing biochemicals and biomaterials. In particular, establishing environmentally sound and innovative approaches to process organic waste is urgent for our society. It is of great importance in view of sustainable development. In this chapter, the biotechnological processing of organic waste is discussed. The focus is on value-added products that have been generated by biotechnological processes."
pub.1152932608,Novel hybrid technology for the sustainable development of the circular economy in urban agriculture,"Climate change and environmental pollution are just some of the main challenges to be addressed. A number of actions have been taken, in particular the circular economy has proved to be among the most effective in overcoming the traditional approach of the linear economy. Circular economy means not only minimizing the waste produced by giving it a new life, but also preserving the use of resources such as energy and water.
Among the different technologies developed by a circular economy approach, the use of photobioreactors and aquaponics systems are growing. They are closed systems of cultivation and growth of microalgae, which are the most important microorganisms in aquatic ecosystems for the global carbon balance and are fundamental for the capture and bioconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into energy, are widely used.
The aim of this study is to highlight the synergistic action that could be provided by the combinated action between a photobioreactor microalgae and an aquaponic system.
Specifically, the algal biomass obtained, after being dehydrated, could be partly used to feed the fish species in aquaculture, while the remaining part is treated in order to produce biofuels and biopolymers that are produced with high added value.
The aquaculture system, in turn, thanks to the metabolism of the fish species involved and specific treatment, i.e. disinfection with UV + ozone, and biological treatment with self forming dynamic membrane, provides a source of nutrients indispensable for algal and vegetables growth."

The transition to sustainable development is a process of changing the value orientations of many people. The internationally recognized fundamental values of development are freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. It was determined that the national goals of sustainable development are based on political, economic, social, ecological, moral and cultural values inherent in Ukrainian society. They determine the focus of the strategy on caring for the common good and protecting the national interests of Ukraine. Radical changes related to today’s problems and the course towards European integration make it possible to build a new Ukraine based on the principles of sustainable development, rule of law, protection of human rights, democracy, solidarity, and proper governance. It was emphasized that the strategic vision of sustainable development of Ukraine is based on ensuring national interests and fulfilling Ukraine’s international obligations regarding the transition to sustainable development. Such development involves: overcoming imbalances in the economic, social and environmental spheres; building a peaceful and safe, socially cohesive society with good governance and inclusive institutions; transformation of economic activity, transition to the principles of «green economy», etc. A «green economy» can be defined as one that increases people’s well-being and ensures social justice, while significantly reducing risks to the environment and increasing poverty. Attention was drawn to the Recovery Plan of Ukraine (2022) and the main priorities were determined, namely the acceleration of the implementation of the European Green Agreement thanks to the development of low-carbon energy and the existing energy infrastructure and the possibility of green exports; availability of electricity at a price below the European price with a significant share of «green» energy; support for the transition to energy with zero carbon emissions: development of carbon-free energy (nuclear), increase in gas and biofuel production, development of the ecosystem; regulation of green tariffs; promoting the transition of the agro-food sector to «green» growth; removal of technical barriers to the integration of Ukrainian manufacturers into the Single European Green Market, in particular, by spreading the necessary certification procedures and confirmation of compliance, increasing the level of awareness of manufacturers in this area, supporting manufacturers of ecologically better products, expanding the capacity of Ukrainian manufacturers to participate in «green» (energy­efficient, sustainable) public procurement, etc."
pub.1149898314,Optimization of Biofuel and Kerosene Fuel Blends to Support Sustainable Aviation,"The aviation industry supports the world economy, contributing US$ 2.7 trillion to global the gross domestic product. However, aviation raises environmental concerns, where the industry has a 12% share of CO2 emissions within the transportation sector. Therefore, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) suggested the implementation of Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as a market-based measure to mitigate CO2. The CORSIA scheme may increase the operational costs by setting a carbon price on every extra tonne of CO2 beyond the baseline limits. In order to reduce operators' obligations, the integration of reduction measures such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) may reduce the cost associated with offsetting requirements. As such, a multi-objective optimization model is presented in this study to identify optimal blending ratios of jet biofuels with conventional kerosene fuel for multiple aircrafts and destinations. The model considers the operators fuel cost, carbon price and renewable credit under CORSIA; aiming to minimize the total fuels’ associated costs. In addition, the model is implemented in a case study considering three fuel categories. The results indicate that Jatropha-based jet fuel, within the current tested data, is a preferable synthetic fuel to be blended with Jet-A at a maximum margin of 50%. Fuel prices highly influenced the results of the model. Whereas other factors including carbon prices, fuels’ lifecycle emissions, and supplied fuel quantity may directly or indirectly impact the process of incorporating SAF as an integrated mitigation tool under CORSIA."
pub.1150562078,"Energy Transition, Economic, Social and Environmental Dimensions","This book opens up a critical dimension of energy transition taking in account multidimensional challenges on economic, social and environmental fields. The book discusses the trends in the field of energy transition and evolving practices adopted by public authorities and companies for betterment of environment and society. The editors (4) identify directions and challenges involved in the energy transition. The novelty of this book is the multidisciplinary approach, being presented the economic, social and environmental challenges involved in the energy transition. The energy transition is accompanied by a complex process of changing attitudes and behaviors of energy consumers and producers. The consequences are profound not only economically and environmentally but also socially, renewable energy being a solution for energy poverty reduction and development of rural communities. Therefore, certain social and environmental problems generated by energy poverty are solved by using renewable energy. Moreover, the complexity of the phenomenon is presented not only in terms of the analysis of the main sources of renewable energy but also the ethical aspects involved in the use of sources such as biofuels. In the case of this source, the main problem is whether the use of certain agricultural products for the production of biofuels threatens food security, especially in rural areas. All categories of stakeholders must show responsibility and get involved in this complex process which requires a remarkable technical and financial effort. The energy transition can offer innovative solutions through which the impact of economic activity on the environment is minimized, and in this way, industrial ecology achieves its objectives to support sustainable development. The demands imposed by industrial ecology must shape not only the behavior of oil and gas companies but also of entities involved in the production and consumption of renewable energy. Given the negative externalities generated, companies in the fossil fuel sector have become increasingly socially responsible, their social and environmental performance (non-financial) being presented in detail in the annual sustainability reports to inform stakeholders. Therefore, this book is an important read not only for scholars, but also for those who are interested in ensuring an environmentally sustainable future taking in account energy transition challenges."
pub.1034793530,The role of CuO in promoting photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2," Low cost semiconductor photocatalysts that can efficiently harvest solar energy to generate H2 from water or biofuels will be critical to future hydrogen economies. In this study, low cost CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts (CuO loadings 0–15 wt.%) were prepared, characterized and evaluated for H2 production from ethanol–water mixtures (80 vol.% ethanol, 20 vol.% H2O) under UV excitation. TEM, XRF, EDAX, EPR, Raman, TGA, XPS and Cu L-edge NEXAFS data showed that at CuO loadings <5 wt.%, Cu(II) was highly dispersed over the TiO2 support, possibly as a sub-monolayer CuO species. At higher loadings, CuO crystallites of diameter 1–2 nm were identified. The photocatalytic activity of CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts was highly dependent on the CuO loading, with 1.25 wt.% CuO being optimal (H2 production rate = 20.3 mmol g−1 h−1). Results suggest that sub-monolayer coverages of Cu(II) or CuO on TiO2 are highly beneficial for H2 generation from ethanol–water mixtures and support the development of a sustainable H2 economy."

In the paper it has been pointed out that investments in research, development and innovation would supply the means to equally convert existing industries, by replacement of fossil resources with renewable ones."
pub.1169378123,Advances and Perspectives in Biohydrogen Production from Palm Oil Mill Effluent,"Palm oil, the main vegetable oil produced globally, serves diverse purposes, ranging from cooking to the production of processed foods, cosmetics, and biodiesel. Despite contributing significantly to the economies of major producing nations, the escalating production of palm oil raises serious environmental concerns, including deforestation, biodiversity loss, and various forms of pollution. Palm oil mill effluent (POME), a byproduct of palm oil extraction, poses a severe environmental threat when left untreated. As an eco-friendly alternative, anaerobic digestion in controlled bioreactors has emerged, offering simultaneous POME treatment and biofuel generation, particularly hydrogen, with high energy efficiency. This review explores the challenges and opportunities associated with biohydrogen production from POME. Key considerations involve optimizing parameters through pretreatments, nanoparticle incorporation, defining optimal bioreactor conditions, determining hydraulic retention times, and integrating multi-stage processes like dark fermentation followed by photofermentation. This review also emphasizes the significance of sustainable practices and economic analyses in shaping the future of hydrogen production from POME, positioning it as a pivotal player in the palm oil industry’s circular economy and the global energy transition."

The non-degradability of plastics and petrochemical-based polymers is a huge environmental crisis despite being an industry with billions of dollars share in global economy. Water pollution due to synthetic plastics and related products is evident from the fact that 7 million tons of land based plastic debris enters oceans and water bodies annually endangering the sea life which is not only a concern for the aquatic environment but also for the sea food industry and eventually to human health. Eco-friendly and sustainable polymers from a number of living organisms can be used as an alternative to synthetic polymers. Biopolymers such as starch, cellulose, pectin, keratin, chitin, gelatin and polyhydroxyalkanoates can be obtained from natural biomass sources. All these biopolymers exhibit suitable physiochemical, thermal and mechanical properties that make them suitable for the production of bioplastics that are biobased and biodegradable in nature. Use of biopolymers is not limited to bioplastics but ranges from sustainable production of other products such as bio-implants, biofuels, and medicinal products. In this review, we have discussed comprehensively about the sources of biopolymers, their extraction and purification methods and the reasons that make them efficient biopolymers for the environment."

pub.1175300219,Microbial Production of Oleochemicals,"The current depletion of fossil fuels and the negative environmental impacts related to their vast use have created an urgent need to find alternative energy sources and sustainable bioproducts. Under this scenario, oleochemicals have emerged as an option for replacing petroderivatives in different productive sectors. Traditional sources of oleochemicals (vegetable and animal oils) have in some cases limited availability and competition with the food chain. The use of oleaginous microorganisms as source of lipids (i.e., microbial oils) avoids these constraints and represents a sustainable alternative. Furthermore, some oleaginous microorganisms are able to accumulate high amounts of lipids from different carbon sources, including those present in waste streams which will be crucial in the transition toward a circular economy. This chapter aims at disclosing the main developments in the production of microbial oils from different carbon sources by oleaginous microorganisms (yeast, fungi, bacteria, and microalgae), considering the downstream technologies and the industrial applications of the produced lipidic fraction."
pub.1092950348,Distributed Marine Biorefineries for Developing Economies,"In the coming decades, developing countries will be responsible for significant increases in liquid fuel demand. There is an urgent need to develop alternative, preferably carbon-neutral, transportation fuels to supplement limited fossil fuel resources and minimize undesirable climatic change. While biofuels present a promising alternative to fossil fuels, sustainable biorefinery process design remains challenging. Efficiencies of scale realized by large centralized facilities are offset by increased feedstock collection and fuel distribution logistical costs. In this work, we use a thermodynamic balance approach to derive the optimal serviced territory size for a single biorefinery. We find that the optimal size decreases with increasing population density and per capita fuel consumption. We propose a modular, scalable, and sustainable biorefinery design based on the marine macro algae Ulva sp. To demonstrate the design principal, we provide an example marine biorefinery design for a coastal town of 20,000 inhabitants in rural India. Beyond basic biorefinery design, we consider biorefinery integration into distributed power sources and environmental impacts.Copyright © 2012 by ASME"

pub.1167853222,The Green Mirage: The EU’s Complex Relationship with Palm Oil Biodiesel in the Context of Environmental Narratives and Global Trade Dynamics,"In the early 2000s, biofuels like biodiesel and bioethanol were seen as renewable alternatives to petroleum, driven by rising crude oil prices and environmental concerns. Palm oil became a key biodiesel raw material, turning the European Union (EU) into a major importer. However, sustainable palm oil concerns emerged in the EU in 2014, leading to trade disputes and import restrictions, with a goal to phase out palm oil biodiesel by 2030. This research explores the EU’s palm oil biodiesel policy impact, focusing on key producers, EU imports (crude and refined palm oil, biodiesel), the EU’s role in the global biodiesel network, and alignment with a green narrative. Analyzing trade data, we find that, despite concerns, the EU has not significantly reduced palm oil-related imports, highlighting the market’s complex relationship to policy. This suggests that the EU’s commitment to environmentally sustainable economic development may not align with market stakeholders’ preferences, emphasizing the complex interdependencies between the global biodiesel market and policy areas like sustainability, economy, energy, and environment."

One of the potential biomass resources to be developed into biofuels is tobacco stalks. Production of tobacco plants in East Java Province was 84,100 t, with the highest production from Pamekasan Regency at 13,520 t, followed by Jember Regency at 13,110 t. This shows that Jember Regency has the potential to develop tobacco stalks to produce biofuels because their availability is relatively abundant. One of the biofuels that can be produced from tobacco stalks is bioethanol. Bioethanol production has increased every year along with the increasing demand for bioethanol, so the bioethanol market opportunity is wide open and can strengthen the nation’s economy. Besides being used as a source of energy fulfilment, bioethanol is also needed as a raw material for production in the fields of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The increasing need for hand sanitizers during the Covid-19 pandemic has caused the need for bioethanol to increase. Pretreatment in this study was carried out using alkaline, namely NaOH, by varying the temperature and concentration. The purpose of this study was to find the optimum conditions for the pretreatment processes during the production of bioethanol. The optimum conditions in this study were a NaOH concentration of 6%, a temperature of 140 ℃, and a rotational speed of 150 rpm with the yield of lignin 12.463%, cellulose 31.194%, and hemicellulose 3.172%."

pub.1164041698,A strategy for commercialization of macroalga biorefineries,"The transportation sector significantly contributes to global warming due to the extensive use of fossil fuels. Biofuels have the potential to eliminate inherent problems associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. However, large-scale deployment of biorefineries is limited because of high capital and operating costs as well as the low market value of biofuels that make such plants economically unfavorable. Additionally, using sustainable feedstock (algae, cyanobacteria, etc.), i.e., with no social, environmental, or technological challenges, is another major bottleneck for biorefineries. Considering these challenges, this study presents a strategy for the commercialization of macroalga-derived bioethanol via a circular economy-based integrated biorefinery concept. A standalone (conventional) process was designed for bioethanol production at 50.0 million gallons (189.3 million liters) per year capacity in Aspen Plus V12.2. Economic and environmental indicators were assessed through discounted cash flow and cradle-to-grave (SimaPro V9.4.0.7) analyses, respectively. Once the potential targets are identified, a novel integrated process was designed for biofuel and biochemical production, which is not only economically favorable in the current market but also has a better life cycle profile compared to that of a standalone process. The results showed that the integrated design has a minimum ethanol selling price of USD 0.35/L and a global warming potential of 0.35 kg CO2 eq/L of ethanol, which is 45% and 82.7% lower than that of the standalone design. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Bio-SA selling price, total capital investment, and seaweed price are the most critical economic parameters for the economic feasibility of the process."

pub.1017289167,Biomass Resources for Biofuel Production in Northeast India,"India’s overwhelming economic growth rate of 8 % on an average creates a huge demand for energy inputs. The swelling energy consumption has resulted in growing dependence on fossil fuels, which has in turn raised a gamut of concerns like energy security, environmental degradation, and pressure on national exchequer. Energy conservation and clean and C-neutral fuels in this regard offer the greatest opportunities. Biomass-based renewable energy has the proven potential in this direction. Since India has an agricultural-based economy, therefore, biomass– including wood, agricultural residues, animal dung, etc. – is available in enormous quantities. In India, about 40 % of the total energy requirement comes from burning of biomass, and more than 70 % of the population depends on it for energy requirements. The northeast region of India where traditional biomass is a predominant source of energy is no exception to this. However, burning of biomass has been associated with energy inefficiency and environmental hazards including health problems and deforestation. Therefore, a sustainable approach toward this end is adoption of custom-made technological intervention to use the enormous biomass resource and generate power in an environment-friendly and cost-effective scheme. Biomass-based energy and power production can provide distributed power for rural applications and could effectively make up for the absence of grid electricity supply in many remote areas. Besides, tail-end grid-connected power projects are also currently highly encouraged to support the Renewable Energy Purchase Obligation and its compliance under the Electricity Act, 2003. This chapter reviews the biomass availability, conversion technologies, and its biofuel production potential in the northeastern region of India which is known for its high biological biodiversity with numerous tropical rainforests, revering grasslands, bamboo, orchards and wetland ecosystems."
pub.1129989533,Biomass feedstock transport using fuel cell and battery electric trucks improves lifecycle metrics of biofuel sustainability and economy,"The use of new vehicle technologies such as fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric powertrains for biomass feedstock supply is an unexplored solution to reducing biofuel production cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and health impacts. These technologies have found success in light-duty vehicle applications and are in development for heavy-duty trucks. This study presents the first detailed stochastic techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of biomass feedstock supply systems with diesel, fuel cell hybrid electric, and fully electric trucks and determines their impacts on biofuel production considering butanol as a representative biofuel. This study finds that fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric trucks consume less energy relative to the diesel-powered truck regardless of the evaluated circumstances, including payloads of truck (loaded and empty), pavement types (gravel and paved), road conditions (normal and damaged), and road networks (local and highways). The use of fuel cell hybrid and fully electric trucks powered by H2-fuel and renewable sources of electricity, respectively, results in a large reduction in cost and carbon footprint, specifically for a long-distance hauling, and minimize other economic and environmental impacts. While the economic advantage of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle is dependent on the price of H2-fuel and road conditions, use reduces the GHG emissions of biobutanol per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.98–10.9 gCO2e/MJ. Results show that converting to fully electric truck transport decreases the biobutanol production cost and GHG emissions per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.4–7.3 cents/L and 0.78 to 9.1 gCO2e/MJ, respectively. This study establishes the foundation for future investigations that will guide the development of economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable biomass feedstock supply system for cellulosic biorefineries or other goods transportation systems."

pub.1110489096,Еколого-економічні підходи до енергетичного використання деревної біомаси з відходів виробництва в Україні,"Wood biomass is the main source of energy among renewable sources in Ukraine. The issues of wood residuals use for bioenergy purposes are considered in the context of close to nature forestry practices implementation and sustainable management of forest resources. The main indicators of wood biomass use in Ukraine are analyzed. The authors have proved the importance of using wood biomass residuals both from timber harvesting and wood processing in the context of sustainable forest management principles taking into account the economic, ecological and social components of this process. In Ukraine, there are no specialized enterprises supplying biomass to companies producing biofuels. Fuel wood is supplied directly by state forestry enterprises, and wood processing enterprises that can supply wood processing residual. Wood resources and residuals of wood processing industry, in particular, should be used in accordance with the cascade principle – primarily for the production of multiple goods with the highest added value and recycled to maximize the carbon absorption and accumulation, and only later for energy production. The urgent task is to develop integrated forestry enterprises, which will include the wood biomass use for energy purpose into the whole production cycle. Consideration of social and environmental constraints in determining the amount of biomass that can be removed from forest, providing ecological and economic substantiation of the whole process of collecting, sorting and processing wood biomass is an important component of achieving the concept of sustainable forest sector development. Forestry and lumber waste has a high bioenergy potential and, consequently, the formation of an efficient management method (economy) on a bioeconomic basis. The use of wood pulp for energy purposes is extremely eco-efficient, since it involves the replacement of non-renewable natural resources with renewable and minimizes the level of pollution of the environment. In order to stimulate the use of wood waste as an energy resource, market mechanisms are necessary to intensify cooperation between producers of solid biofuels and forestry enterprises."

Currently, various types of bioplastics are produced industrially, competing in performance and price with the conventional fossil-oil based plastics. However, there is also a major interest in utilizing non-food crops, such as lignocellulosics, for production of drop-in polymers or new dedicated bioplastics. Lignocellulosic resources have a potential to replace plastics and materials, which have been traditionally based on fossil resources. This is important, as the development of high performance bio-based and renewable materials is one important factor for sustainable growth of the bio-based industry. However, production of bioplastics from forestry biomass requires a dedicated fractionation into the major components, i.e. cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, effective purification processes and cost-effective routes for conversion into monomers and platform molecules, utilized as a basis for bioplastics production. These processes are now technologically demanding and not profitable. The intention of this work was thus to review the current advances that have been made during the years within fractionation and purification of lignocelluloses and the processes that may feasible for production of bioplastics, based on wood components."

pub.1171682894,Decarbonization strategies and achieving net-zero by 2050 in Taiwan: A study of independent power grid region,"Taiwan's 2050 net-zero commitment aligns with global trends, impacting technology forecasting and society. Hence, defined emissions reduction pathways encompass all sectors of the economy, along with a proposed net-zero roadmap. This work relies on the Taiwan 2050 calculator which is a stocks and flows database allowing to tailor emission reduction scenarios involving economic, demographic growth, and technological levers on the supply and demand side. As an independent power grid region heavily reliant on energy imports, Taiwan's transition experiences provide valuable insights for other nations/regions. Decarbonizing the electricity sector and implementing negative emission technologies are key for reaching net-zero. Emission reduction in the industrial sector can be enhanced further when co-firing with biofuels and hydrogen on top of carbon capture and storage and energy efficiency reforms. Massive electrification and biofuel blends will nearly decarbonize the transport sector. However, only a consequent carbon tax can incentivize the reforms and justify the increased production costs. A renewables dominant electricity generation mix will significantly raise electricity prices, but it will simultaneously increase energy security and create local employment opportunities. Lessons from Taiwan's transition can guide other nations/regions in decarbonization, energy security, sustainable growth, and understanding the social implications of these policies."

pub.1100679007,Renewable Energy Sources: A Sustainable Strategy for Biodiesel Productions,"Nowadays, the world energetic scenario is moving toward a search for renewable energy matrices, allowing energy sources to be enlarged to produce diesel and/or biodiesel. Biodiesel is a renewable and clean-burning biofuel that is gradually being incorporated into conventional diesel as a means of limiting the production of fossil fuels to motivate the productivity of “ecologic friendly” biofuel. However, some oilseed species used as raw materials, even those with lower operational cost for the production of the vegetable oil, are still a great challenge for the petrochemical industry, given the economic competitiveness of biodiesel against the diesel obtained from fossil fuels. The use of alternative oilseed species to produce biodiesel may increase costs, which may exceed the price of the barrel of diesel, leading to non-viable biodiesel production. On the other hand, the high taxes on petroleum products can reduce the difference between them, allowing biodiesel production to become economically viable. This situation makes the exploration of economical alternative non-food feedstocks (e.g., Jatropha curcas) an important research topic. Biodiesel is made from diverse feedstocks including soybean, rapeseed/canola, sunflower, safflower, palm, Jatropha curcas, Raphanus sativus, cottonseed, corn, peanut, coconut, recycled cooking oil, animal fats, and also algae. In the context of renewable sources for biodiesel energy, the great biodiversity of alternative oilseeds and others oily biomass makes Brazil, the USA, Canada, and some countries in Europe and Asia greater potential markets to produce biofuels from these alternative sources. The incentives for using renewable species for biodiesel production rather than conventional petroleum diesel fuel are the absence of sulfur or aromatic compounds, high content of oil, low cost of crop maintenance, improvement of the environment, creation of new jobs, and a significant contribution to the domestic economy."

In addition, algal waste can be further transformed into biofuel, biogas, and biochar using different thermochemical processes such as microwave pyrolysis, pyrolysis, torrefaction, and hydrothermal conversion. Due to its high specific surface area, rapid electron transport, and graphitic carbon structure, algal biochar carbonized at high temperatures has shown outstanding performance for applications as CO2 adsorbents, supercapacitors, and persulfate activation. Due to the combination of various functional groups and porous structures, the algae biomass pyrolysis at a moderate temperature produced high-quality biochar that shows high performance in terms of pollutant removal, while low-temperature pyrolysis produces coal fuel from algae via torrefaction. Over time, there have been exponentially more petroleum-based polymers created that have harmful impacts on both humans and the environment. As a result, researchers are becoming more interested in algae-based biopolymers as a potential alternative strategy for establishing a sustainable circular economy globally.

pub.1008886069,Energy innovation potential of oleaginous microalgae,"Algae have contributed greatly to the creation of the Earth’s environment and the development of human civilization. Currently, microalgae are considered to be among the most promising sources for biofuel. Most microalgae accumulate triacylglycerols; however, fatty acid methyl esters produced from triacylglycerols by transesterification have critical end-use issues. Hydrocarbons produced by Botryococcus and Aurantiochytrium are the most suitable algal oils for replacing existing transportation fuels and are highly compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure. Over the years, many technologies have been investigated for achieving sustainable biofuel production using oleaginous microalgae; however, existing techniques of algal fuel production are suitable mainly for small-scale procedures or for the recovery or removal of high-value products. This situation strongly influences life cycle assessment studies for algal fuel production, and published life cycle assessments show different and discrepant results – reliable data on inputs and outputs from industrial-scale experiments are needed for solving these problems. The estimated cost of algal fuel production is still high compared with that of fossil crude oils. The integration of water treatment and algal biomass production, in a coupled hybrid production system comprising of phototrophic and heterotrophic algae, has tremendous potential for improving the economy of future algal fuels."

pub.1164008954,Sustainability in Frac Operation: Reduced CO2 Emission by Implementing Biofuel and Pump Idling Reduction Intelligent System,"Abstract Hydraulic fracturing operations are known to have a significant impact on the environment due to high energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and gas industry is seeking sustainable alternatives to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to global efforts towards a low-carbon future. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using a biodiesel blend (B05 and higher) in frac equipment engines along with pump idling reduction intelligent system (PIRIS) to improve sustainability and reduce emissions. The B05 biodiesel blend is partially produced from renewable resources, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, or waste cooking oil, which reduces the dependence on fossil fuels and promotes the circular economy. We conducted field trial tests using a Caterpillar 3512C engine and other types to measure the fuel consumption, engine performance, and emissions under different operating conditions. The results showed that the B05 biodiesel blend can be a viable alternative to diesel fuel, with similar engine performance and emissions characteristics. Moreover, using biofuels in frac operations has additional benefits, such as reducing the emission of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. The B05 blend was found to reduce carbon emissions by up to 5%, depending on the operating conditions. PIRIS automatically stops the frac pump after 10 minutes of idling. When the pump is needed, the remote starter enables rapid restarting from the control van. As the result, PIRIS reduces pump idling by up to 75%, which cuts carbon emissions by approximately 7%. These reductions are significant and can contribute to the industry's efforts to achieve net-zero emissions. Our study highlights the potential for the oil and gas industry to adopt sustainable practices into frac operations. The use of B05 and reducing idle time with frac pumps can improve sustainability and reduce carbon emissions, leading to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future. Our study provides insight into the applicability of sustainable practices in the oil and gas industry and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change."

The process of manufacture does not have any adverse environmental impact. LCB is an abundant and promising renewable resource for long term biofuel supply. Bioethanol derived from LCB has the potential to meet the current energy demand, reduces greenhouse gases and supports rural economy. Cellulosic ethanol is one of the viable energy sources and therefore, it is considered as an alternative fuel. A lot of efforts have been made in the last decades on production of ethanol from cellulosic source as cost competitive with conventional fossil fuel. The production of bioethanol involves three steps: pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation. Pretreatment of LCB is usually done following physical, chemical or physicochemical process. Hydrolysis is carried out either chemically or enzymatically followed by microbial fermentation.  However, involvement of costly equipment, high energy consumption and generation of toxic substances need to be evaluated. This drives the attention of scholars in the field towards alternative option for the development and optimization of biological methods of pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation. In this review we focus on recent developments of biological methods of pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation with respect to their advantages and limitations."
pub.1154046296,Bamboo as a Cost-Effective Source of Renewable Carbon for Sustainable Economic Development in Low- and Middle-Income Economies,"Low- and middle-income countries have tremendous potential for renewable energy production, including production of renewable carbon from locally prolific crops. In this work, bamboo endemic to West Africa (Bambusa vulgaris) was studied as a feedstock for the production of renewable sugars as the gateway to the local production of biofuels and bio-based chemical products. The effectiveness of delignification and amorphization pretreatments was evaluated, with the observation that quantitative (97 ± 4%) sugar yields could be obtained with a rapid initial hydrolysis rate (82 ± 4 mg g−1 h−1) but only when amorphization was performed following delignification. Experimental measurements and further characterization using 13C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) helped establish the importance of amorphization and delignification and explained why the order of these treatments determined their effectiveness. The economics of the bamboo-based process were compared with those projected for corn stover, selected as a well-studied benchmark crop. Because of the higher bamboo growth rate compared with corn stover and the effectiveness of the pretreatment, the projected net present value (NPV) of the bamboo biorefinery was positive ($190 MM, U.S.), whereas the corn biorefinery projected to negative NPV (−$430 MM, U.S.). A socially sustainable framework for deployment of a bamboo biorefinery in a low- or middle-income economy was then proposed, guided by the principle of local ownership and stakeholder buy-in. The findings presented here motivate further investment in development of bamboo cultivation and conversion to sugars as a rapid route to decarbonization of low- and middle-income economies."
pub.1169333249,A Circular Economy Approach to Valorisation of Lignocellulosic Biomass-Biochar and Bioethanol Production,"A circular economy is a systematic approach to economic development designed to benefit businesses, society, and environment. It is a system where both the materials and products are used in a loop, or the materials are used so effectively that promote multiple uses to generate value in many different forms. The increasing energy demand and less availability of fossil fuels grab attention towards the serious need for an alternative and sustainable energy source. However, in recent times, the world is looking at the valorisation of renewable bioresources as a solution to the exponential increase of waste generation, resource wastage, climate change, and the need for a clean energy source simultaneously. Agricultural waste, agro-industrial residues, wood, grasses, municipal solid wastes, lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) can be used for the valorisation on a large scale. There are several conversion methods for the valorisation of biowaste into biochar, biofuels, and other value-added products. Hence, the potential of LCB for the production of sustainable bioenergy leads a pathway into bioeconomy. Biochar is a carbonaceous material with a very high surface area, rich in macro-nutrients and minute micro-nutrients, has high metal accumulating capacity and acts as a suitable carrier for the immobilization of microbes. Biochar can be produced from LCB by pyrolysis. However, hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose in the biomass gives way to the production of bioethanol. So, this chapter gives an insight into the combined production of biochar and bioethanol from LCB in a single circular economy system. It presents the challenges and opportunities associated with it and finally, the future research perspectives are also discussed."

pub.1173162266,Fueling circularity: A thorough review of circular practices in the aviation sector with sustainable fuel solutions,"Aviation plays a crucial role in global economic growth and can be influenced by events like COVID-19 and climate change. The aviation sector has a significant carbon footprint that can be correlated with extreme weather conditions, outlining challenges faced by airports and proposing strategies such as environmental management, advanced fuels, and retirement of older aircraft. This review analyzes 107 scientific papers and reports to explore the opportunities to integrate a circular economy (CE) within the aviation sector, emphasizing on waste management and circular aviation practices. It highlights the sector's initiatives on in-cabin waste reduction, waste tracking systems, and plastic-free flights. Moreover, it covers the industry's efforts to adopt circular economy principles to convert waste (in-cabin and end-of-use) into Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). It outlines diverse biofuel production methods, including alcohol upgrading, fermentation, gasification-Fischer Tropsch, and thermochemical processes. It also discusses innovative technologies such as microbial and enzymatic approaches and power-to-liquid (PtL). The review examines the global challenges and policies surrounding sustainable waste management in airports, emphasizing the disconnect between sustainability goals and rising waste output accompanying the need for more effective policies and research on emissions quotas and consumption patterns. Additionally, it addresses the need for collaboration and innovative technologies regarding waste-to-energy (WtE) conversion to achieve comprehensive and efficient airport waste management strategies. The integration of CE within airport vicinities is vital to mitigate the environmental impacts by emphasizing the importance of waste management strategies and utilizing aviation waste such as cabin waste and end-of-use waste as a valuable resource for SAFs production, which continues to face several challenges related to scalability, technological readiness, and economic viability."
pub.1181827639,Lignocellulosic biomass conversion into platform chemicals and biofuels using tetrahydrofuran-assisted pretreatment: A future for sustainable and bio-circular economy,"Organosolv pretreatment is an important strategy currently employed in biorefineries as an initial step for efficient lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) conversion into value-added products. The synthesis of different platform chemicals from LCB develops a bio-circular economy with reduced environmental hazards. Though various solvents have been employed in bioconversions, current research updates the application of Tetrahydrofuran (THF), a polar aprotic solvent. THF is an emerging solvent aiming at high-purity lignin retrieval with the successful separation of cellulose and hemicellulose fractions. The planar geometry of THF molecules provides a unique advantage for interactions with flat, nonpolar cellulose surfaces, thereby promoting LCB deconstruction and delignification. The CELF process, which leverages the use of THF and water co-solvent in the vicinity of a dilute acid environment, is a promising strategy for enhanced LCB fractionation that breaks down the lignin-carbohydrate matrix that enhances the yields of various fuel precursors directly from LCB, including furfural, HMF, LA, and glucose. Thus, the use of THF as an individual solvent or as a cosolvent in other pretreatment methods has been observed to significantly impact LCB breakdown and hence, is necessary to unlock the mystery behind the conversion efficiencies. The current review discusses the mechanism behind the properties of THF as a lignin-friendly solvent, as well as the strategies for using THF with other cosolvents. Further, the caveats during the use of the THF-assisted method are discussed, and insights into its sustainable management are considered an eco-friendly, effective solvent for the organosolv process in biorefineries to develop a bio-circular economy."
pub.1110842304,Harvesting sunlight with cyanobacteria and algae for sustainable production in a bio-based economy,"In a sustainable society, the major part of transport energy and of the materials will have to be derived directly from oxygenic photosynthesis. Various ways to achieve this, via the use of mass cultures of either cyanobacteria or eukaryotic algae, are currently under development. Most of these initiatives are classified as second-, third-, or fourth-generation biofuel approaches, but another significant difference is whether one initially aims at the formation of biomass or on an intracellular or extracellular product. Nevertheless, the most stringent constraint in all these developments is the energetic efficiency of product formation. In most processes, one makes use of dense suspension cultures in advanced photobioreactors. Light harvesting efficiency is therefore a key element in the overall efficiency of biomass and/or product formation in these processes. This efficiency is not only subject to various endogenous mechanisms of regulation but can also be modulated through genetic engineering, particularly of the antenna content and antenna composition of the production organisms. Here, we will describe how cyanobacteria and microalgae may be used to contribute to increased sustainability of society and review how modulation of their antenna size may contribute to this. Light harvesting efficiency is a key element in the overall efficiency of biomass and/or product formation in these processes. This chapter summarizes multiple ways in which photosynthetic organisms can be genetically adjusted to increase photosynthetic efficiency. It describes how cyanobacteria and microalgae may be used to contribute to increased sustainability of society and review how modulation of their antenna size may contribute to this. Efficient product formation in large-scale culturing facilities for cyanobacteria and microalgae generally requires dense cultures with very efficient light harvesting. Direct exploitation of the free energy from sunlight through natural oxygenic photosynthesis for use in a bio-based economy requires the use of large shallow PBRs. Oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants provides directly or indirectly the vast majority of the energy for the living world. Use of cyanobacteria for the production of biofuel and chemical commodities has primarily been focused on Synechocystis and Synechococcus, with smaller efforts directed toward Anabaena and Cyanothece."
pub.1144618993,Perspectives of Agro-Waste Biorefineries for Sustainable Biofuels,"The agriculture plays a significant role in a nation’s economy and efforts to feed one and all of the global population. The harvesting and processing of crops generate agro-wastes. The proper management and discard of agricultural residues and agro-industrial wastes is of concern due to environmental problems like emission of greenhouse gases, air pollution and organic waste accumulation. The agro-wastes are abundant and cheap feedstocks for second generation lignocellulosic biorefinery that overcome the criticisms and short comings faced by biorefinery based on food crops. The huge prospects are present in conversion and recovery of eco-friendly products from agro-wastes by safeguarding pressure on arable land, savings on fossil fuel consumption and also leading to global food security. The biorefineries based on agro-wastes are well studied for residues like straw from rice, maize, wheat, maize cobs and agro- processing wastes such as rice husks, vegetable and fruit peels, sugarcane bagasse and oil cakes. These resources are rich in carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and other biocompounds. The carbohydrates are recovered from agro-wastes by pre-treatment methods and helps in production of the bioethanol and biobutanol by fermentation. The lipid content in agro-wastes is used for biodiesel production by transesterification. The bio-oils and syngas from the agricultural residues are produced by thermochemical treatments namely pyrolysis and gasification respectively. The biohydrogen and methane are produced from agro-wastes by anaerobic digestion are also products of biorefinery. The valorization of agro-wastes produce volatile fatty acids, citric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, glutamic acid, acetic acid, xylitol, arabitol and furfural. The processes such as torrefaction, steam explosion and hydrothermal carbonization improves the fuel efficiency of pellets from agro-residues. The agro-waste biorefinery results in zero waste from the full utilization of crop residues or agro-industrial by products. The agro-waste based biorefineries are viable and sustainable approach for conversion to biofuels and biochemicals especially in developing countries."
pub.1096956536,Climate Change Strategy Project: The Bridge to Sustainability,"Abstract The fossil fuels are pillars to the global economy; however, they are a major contributor to Greenhouse Gas emissions. In light of this, the oil industry can contribute to GHG emissions reduction efforts worldwide, as well as to the sustainable economic growth. This paper intends to present the Company Climate Change Strategic Project activities, the first results and actions implemented to manage GHG emissions. The Company commitment to the climate change mitigation effort is evident in the strategic plan statement through the pledges to boost our share in the biofuel market, lead domestic biodiesel production and increase our participation in the ethanol fuel trade. The Company's efforts also include an energy efficiency corporate program, an action plan to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions, and a portfolio of investments related to R&D. As a result of the Company's proactive commitment, the Climate Change Strategic Project was set to keep the Company on the sustainability road. A set of indicators appraises the evolution of environmental performance in order to pursue environmental standards of excellence and among those indicators, voluntary avoided GHG emission goal was set to upstream and downstream operations. In order to monitor air pollutants and GHG emissions a system named SIGEA® accounts for more than thirty-thousand sources. Besides, the Company Research Center created a Technological Project - Proclima to support technology developments on energy efficiency, renewable energy and biofuels, and Carbon Capture and Geological Sequestration. Regarding biofuels, the Company has been playing a key role on the logistics to support the Brazilian sugar cane alcohol project named Proalcool since the nineteen's seventies. This project has prevented hundreds of millions of tons of carbon emissions. In addition three Company´s industrial plants are operating in Brazil to produce biodiesel. The project will allow a company-wide integration of GHG mitigation actions to reduce the emissions intensity of the operations and the products, granting the commitment with the sustainable development. It also supports the Company operations with integrated growth, profitability and both environmental and social responsibility."
pub.1169144074,Biofuel from agro-industrial residues as sustainable strategy for CO2 mitigation: Statistical optimization of pequi seeds torrefaction,"Food loss and waste, about 30% of human-consumable food production, pose challenges to safety, the economy, and the environment. A significant portion includes discarded fruit parts, notably seeds. Pequi fruit seeds contribute to agro-industrial waste due to their intricate structure and thorns, raising environmental concerns. Prior research shows promise in utilizing pequi seeds (PS) for bioenergy through pyrolysis and gasification, but comprehensive torrefaction optimization investigation is lacking. Furthermore, PS contains 40–50% extractives, constituting a potential feedstock for biodiesel and enhanced biorefinery value. Despite literature on extractive valuation, studies often neglect residual biomass and biorefinery integration. This study fills the gap by evaluating the torrefaction of post-extraction residual biomass (PSW) and comparing it to PS. Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), torrefaction conditions are optimized, evaluating Soxhlet extraction impact on raw (PS) and de-oiled pequi seeds (PSW) across scenarios: prioritizing biochar quality (S1) and simultaneously evaluating biochar quality, energy requirements, and potential CO2 retention (S2). Biochar parameters include solid yield, bulk density, proximate, ultimate, and energetic properties. Torrefied pequi seeds show superior biofuel properties, with up to 21% HHV enhancement for PSW, including increased energy content and substantial CO2 emission reductions compared to fossil fuels. RSM provides statistically significant models (reduced quadratic, reduced cubic, and reduced 2FI), with R2 > 0.9762 for the assessed biochar outcomes. The study identifies PS torrefaction at 274 °C and 42 min as optimum in S1, resulting in biochar (CH1.30O0.33) with a 76.18% energy yield and HHV of 24.11 MJ kg−1. In S2, PS is also optimal, with ideal torrefaction at 265 °C and 31 min, providing biochar (CH1.39O0.36) with an 82.11% energy yield, HHV of 23.83 MJ kg−1, and a 188.65 kg CO2eq (by substituting diesel as fuel). The results allowed the development of a pioneering stoichiometry diagram that provides a thorough understanding of the biofuels derived from pequi seed residues. This contribution significantly advances the insights of thermochemical conversion pathways, aimed at maximizing bioenergy yield and fostering environmental benefits within the context of a circular economy framework."
pub.1166533941,Opening the Algal Gateway,"Microalgae and seaweeds have been discussed as a promise of bolstering the blue economy and green technologies, potentially emerging as a primary future source for food, animal feed, and biofuel. Additionally, they are seen as a naturally sustainable reservoir of bioactive compounds, described for the first time in this book as “phycochemicals”, possessing a wide array of applications for the betterment of humanity. Despite these hopeful prospects, the reality presents a different picture, where many of the established production facilities, particularly in Europe, remain modest in scale, and the sector as a whole is still in its developmental stages. The question arises, why this is still the case considering the vast amount of research conducted over decades? Extraction of valuable compounds from algae through integrated biorefinery approach could offer a solution to this quandary, creating a resource-efficient economy. Algae exhibit the capacity to yield high-value phycochemicals including pigments, polysaccharides, essential amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and can be used as feedstock for biofuels. This piece of work serves as a compendium of the most recent research, primarily centered around the realm of value-added compounds derived from algae. The overarching aim is to champion an integrated biorefinery system that could make algal production economically viable in the future. A worldwide multidisciplinary research is needed in order to cover the research on this topic from algae cultivation to different phycochemicals production and commercialization. This could allow decision makers, stakeholders, and producers to enhance the legislations and production system. The primary objective of this chapter is to wrap up and summarize the information that has been discussed throughout the 17 additional chapters of this book."
pub.1171063522,Design and development of a continuous harvesting system using solid-liquid cyclone separator for harvesting of Dunaliella salina for mass production of biomass: Part-1: Performance in single-stage,"Microalgae is a viable alternative to depleting conventional fuel sources, a solution to the industrial requirement of organic consumables, and an option for a green and sustainable economy for biofuels, pigments, and nutrient production. Dunaliella salina is an efficient choice among various species due to its high lipid/carotenoid content and growth in extreme saline conditions. Existing batch-production harvesting methods, such as centrifugation and flocculation, are neither inexpensive nor environmentally benign. This paper presents the experimental studies on three different Rietema-type solid-liquid cyclone separators (RSLCS) for continuous harvesting of microalgae as a concentrated trap for mass biomass production to achieve an economy for biofuels and other desirable by-products if required. Two of these RSLCS were modified and had two inlets (orthogonal RSLCS and parallel RSLCS) when compared with conventional RSLCS. The experiments were performed to calculate the growth of microalgae culture on different days (Day-7, 14, 21, and 28), and concentrations of outflows on day-28 were used as feed for all the RSLCS. The recorded separation efficiency for conventional, orthogonal, and parallel RSLCS are 61.66 %, 67.95 %, and 60.14 % respectively. CFD simulations were also done to validate the results, and CellProfiler was used to measure the size of Dunaliella salina for hydrodynamic analysis. The CFD simulations showed separation efficiency of 60.72 %, 67.04 %, and 59.52 % for conventional, orthogonal, and parallel RSLCS. Thus, the use of orthogonal RSLCS is proposed as a simple, cheap, and eco-friendly solution to the industry-level requirement of continuous harvesting for microalgae in replacement of existing batch-production techniques."
pub.1035712946,"A Biomass Future for the North American Great Plains, Toward Sustainable Land Use and Mitigation of Greenhouse Warming","The Great Plains of North America is a major global breadbasket but its agriculture is stressed by drought, heat spells, damaging winds, soil erosion and declining ground water resources. The great inter-annual variability in crop production and declining rural populations weaken an economy already highly dependent upon government support. The region’s ecological fragility and economic weakness is attributed by many to removal of its original grass cover. Abandonment of agricultural cropping and restoration of the grass cover is one proposed solution to the region’s problems. Simulation models suggest that the agriculture and water resources of the Plains may be stressed even further as its climate changes because of global warming, which is due primarily to the emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion. This book explores the possibility that the ecology and economy of the Plains region (and similar regions) would benefit from the introduction of perennial biomass crops. Biomass production and processing on the Plains (possibly aided by genetic engineering) would partially restore a perennial vegetative cover and create new employment opportunities. Biomass also offers a means of reducing fossil fuel use, providing fuel to local power plants and a feedstock for production of cellulosic ethanol, a gasoline substitute. Interest in biofuels is growing rapidly in public, political and business circles with rising fossil fuel prices and because of a growing recognition of the need for energy independence in petroleum importing countries."
pub.1174260901,Integrated Microalgae-Based Biorefineries for Green Processes,"In this era when the world has been depleted of the non-renewable fossil fuel reserves, the exploitation of renewable feedstock for energy and bioproducts has become the need of the hour. Microalgal biorefineries integrated with various production processes, targeting their biochemical diversity, enables them to meet the demands of the current economy. Microalgal biorefinery is a perfect example of biotechnology that offers the utilization of renewable and affordable microalgal biomass as feedstock for the combined production of biofuels and value-added chemicals. Although the microalgal biorefinery concept was introduced aiming at the industrial production of biofuels as an alternative to the conventional fuels, it was not sustainable economically and hence required an integration with other processes for the maximum exploitation of its products. With the emergence of integrated microalgal biorefineries, the overall processing of microalgae has been restructured into a cascade of processes that yield multiple bioproducts at various steps, thus increasing the profits and reducing the deleterious effects on the environment. This chapter discusses the recent trends in the functioning of the microalgal biorefineries, the various processes that have been integrated, the novel techniques involved, the challenges faced while implementing and maintaining a microalgal biorefinery, and the future prospects in this field. The latest trend is the incorporation of genetic and metabolic engineering techniques in improving the strains of economically important microalgae with the potential as a biorefinery feedstock. The use of techno-economic analysis tools to predict the feasibility of these biorefineries is a new advancement. Amidst these developments, there exist certain challenges which must be addressed before fully commercializing the microalgal biorefineries for the larger benefit of the world. If designed and implemented well, these biorefineries will be cost-effective, environment-friendly, sustainable, and green."
pub.1029295636,Stress-adapted extremophiles provide energy without interference with food production,"How to wean humanity off the use of fossil fuels continues to receive much attention but how to replace these fuels with renewable sources of energy has become a contentious field of debate as well as research, which often reflects economic and political factors rather than scientific good sense. It is clear that not every advertized energy source can lead to a sustainable, humane and environment-friendly path out of a future energy crisis. Our proposal is based on two assertions: that the use of food crops for biofuels is immoral, and that for this purpose using land suitable for growing crops productively is to be avoided. We advocate a focus on new “extremophile” crops. These would either be wild species adapted to extreme environments which express genes, developmental processes and metabolic pathways that distinguish them from traditional crops or existing crops genetically modified to withstand extreme environments. Such extremophile energy crops (EECs), will be less susceptible to stresses in a changing global environment and provide higher yields than existing crops. Moreover, they will grow on land that has never been valuable for agriculture or is no longer so, owing to centuries or millennia of imprudent exploitation. Such a policy will contribute to striking a balance between ecosystem protection and human resource management. Beyond that, rather than bulk liquid fuel generation, combustion of various biomass sources including extremophiles for generating electrical energy, and photovoltaics-based capture of solar energy, are superbly suitable candidates for powering the world in the future. Generating electricity and efficient storage capacity is quite possibly the only way for a sustainable post-fossil and, indeed, post-biofuel fuel economy."

The theoretical aspects of the formation of a green nature management are considered. It is noted that the foundations for the formation of the concept of a green nature management were laid within the framework of the concept of sustainable development back in the late 80s of the last century. According to the definition of scientists, sustainable development includes three dimensions - economic, social and environmental. Only by observing the requirements of sustainability in relation to each of these dimensions can sustainable development as a whole be achieved. Confirmation that the issues of formation and development of the “green nature management” concern, among other things, Tajikistan, is the active sup-port of international cooperation and a constant participant in processes in the field of water problems, ecology and sustainable development at the global, regional and national levels. ... The article notes that in the republic, 98% of electricity production is accounted for by hydropower, which is considered “green” energy and is a valuable contribution of Tajikistan in solving global environmental problems. The article studies the world experience in the development of the “green nature management” and it shows that at present in various countries of the world efforts are being made to develop the “green nature management” and the introduction of its constituent elements, such as: increasing the share of environmentally friendly and renewable energy sources: hydropower, wind, solar, biogas and biofuels. In general, analyzing the ways of formation and development trends of the “green nature management”, the article proposes the main priority sectors of the national economy, in which in the future it will be possible to attract investment both from internal sources (from the budget of the republic) and foreign investments (foreign investments): energy, industrial production, transport, tourism, agriculture and urban economy."
pub.1038190163,"The biorefining opportunities in Wales: Understanding the scope for building a sustainable, biorenewable economy using plant biomass","There are many factors influencing the current global interest in the biorefining of biomass feedstocks to produce a wide variety of extracts, fuels and chemicals. Identifying renewable sources of target molecules currently produced from fossil fuels is one of these, which will ultimately have a positive impact on climate change. Another driver is identifying potential uses for land masses, where a low GDP is affecting communities in those areas. From a UK perspective, a decline in total income generated from farming in Wales has had a detrimental impact on many communities right across the Principality.There is a considerable body of data to argue that with effective land use and the use of a range of enzymic and chemical processing technologies, the utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock for a biorefining industry would result in both social and economic regeneration of these rural communities.In order to create a sustainable biorefining in Wales, alongside regeneration of the rural economy there is a requirement for expansion of the high technology skill base, in areas such as chemistry, biotechnology and engineering.The key to developing this sustainable and economically viable biorefining industry within Wales and ultimately in the UK is based on several technical issues which need to be addressed. These include ensuring that the feedstocks can be grown on marginal land which will not therefore compete with traditional food crops, the need to create local supply chains linking regions together, but which can also feed into the rapidly expanding networks of biomass-based industrial activity in other areas of the UK, and ensuring that the existing transport infrastructure can absorb this increase in activity.This paper will consider the options for large scale biorefining of high sugar perennial ryegrasses in Wales, as a model for producing sustainable, bulk quantities of chemicals, including biofuels."

The purpose of this special issue is to increase public awareness and to stimulate exchange of information among actors expected to play important roles in making hydrogen available for the sustainable energy system of the future.Hydrogen as a biofuel, that is, hydrogen produced from biomass in a sustainable way is recognised as an important component of the fuel market for the future low or non-carbon based energy systems. In this special issue, the main focus is on hydrogen produced from vegetable biomass by fermentation. The development of a two-stage bioprocess for the cost-effective and environmentally friendly production of pure hydrogen from multiple biomass feedstocks is elucidated by a collection of papers presenting preliminary results of Integrated Research Project HYVOLUTION supported by the 6th Framework Programme of the European Union. The attention is turned to:- the over-all concept and characteristics of the two-stage hydrogen fermentation process,- key technological issues of fermentative hydrogen production,- the availability of vegetable feedstocks including agricultural byproducts that suitable for fermentative processing,- prospects of societal integration and sustainability of the fermentative hydrogen production technology.Other papers included in this special issue are devoted to:- simultaneous production of hydrogen and methane by fermentation of lactose-containing feedstocks derived from byproducts of milk processing,- hydrogen gas generation from organic material by electrohydrogenesis, that is, a bioelectrochemical process performed in reactors known as a microbial electrolysis cells,- the ideas for Europe-wide effort on education of hydrogen users and training of skilled staff needed for facilitating the transition to the future hydrogen economy."
pub.1154226090,Sustainable production of biofuels and bioderivatives from aquaculture and marine waste,"The annual global fish production reached a record 178 million tonnes in 2020, which continues to increase. Today, 49% of the total fish is harvested from aquaculture, which is forecasted to reach 60% of the total fish produced by 2030. Considering that the wastes of fishing industries represent up to 75% of the whole organisms, the fish industry is generating a large amount of waste which is being neglected in most parts of the world. This negligence can be traced to the ridicule of the value of this resource as well as the many difficulties related to its valorisation. In addition, the massive expansion of the aquaculture industry is generating significant environmental consequences, including chemical and biological pollution, disease outbreaks that increase the fish mortality rate, unsustainable feeds, competition for coastal space, and an increase in the macroalgal blooms due to anthropogenic stressors, leading to a negative socio-economic and environmental impact. The establishment of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) has received increasing attention due to the environmental benefits of using waste products and transforming them into valuable products. There is a need to integrate and implement new technologies able to valorise the waste generated from the fish and aquaculture industry making the aquaculture sector and the fish industry more sustainable through the development of a circular economy scheme. This review wants to provide an overview of several approaches to valorise marine waste (e.g., dead fish, algae waste from marine and aquaculture, fish waste), by their transformation into biofuels (biomethane, biohydrogen, biodiesel, green diesel, bioethanol, or biomethanol) and recovering biomolecules such as proteins (collagen, fish hydrolysate protein), polysaccharides (chitosan, chitin, carrageenan, ulvan, alginate, fucoidan, and laminarin) and biosurfactants."
pub.1146534284,The potential of biodiesel in mitigating the energy crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa energy sectors,"As a result of the damaging effects they have on the climate, recent campaigns against fossil fuels, constantly emphasize the need to completely eliminate their use. To this effect, is a pressing need to source for other sources of energy that have the ability to decrease the level of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. These alternatives have to be easily accessible and should contribute to the industrial expansion of developing regions, especially Sub-saharan Africa. Poor access to electricity is a major challenge that contributes to the retarded state of development of some countries in Sub-saharan Africa, and renewable energy alternatives, such as biofuels, can perfectly solve this oddity. Biofuels possess unique attributes that can help the world attain a state of energy security and energy balance. The depletion of fossil fuels and other factors like technological advancement and current industrial expansion occurring in most countries in Sub-saharan Africa poses a threat to the availability of energy in the region and it is a major setback to the achievement of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 7. Narrowing down to the use of biodiesels, implementing their use can save the continent from a lot of damage and build up a more sustainable energy sector. Massive deployment of Biodiesels into the energy sector of Sub-saharan Africa will not only ease the difficulty in accessing energy, it will also boost the agricultural sector and economy of the countries that constitute the region. This paper reviews the current state of biodiesel in the African sub-saharan region."
pub.1157418821,On the Conversion of Paper Waste and Rejects into High-Value Materials and Energy,"The pulp and paper industry (PPI) is a major contributor to the global economy, but it also poses a challenge for waste disposal, as it generates large amounts of several waste streams. Among these, paper rejects are generated during the papermaking process and could account for up to 25% of the produced paper. Moreover, hundreds of millions of tons of paper are produced annually that end up in landfills if not burnt or recycled. Furthermore, the PPI significantly contributes to climate change and global warming in the form of deforestation and water and air pollution. Therefore, the impact of this industry on the sustainability of natural resources and its adverse environmental health effects requires special attention. This review focuses on discussing the sustainable routes to utilize paper waste and rejects from the PPI towards a circular economy. At first, it discusses the industry itself and its environmental impact, followed by the possible sustainable approaches that can be implemented to improve papermaking processes as well as waste management systems, including paper recycling. The literature indicates that paper recycling is crucial because, if appropriately designed, it significantly lowers greenhouse gas emissions, water and resources consumption, and manufacturing costs. However, several concerns have surfaced about the different chemicals that are used to improve recycling efficiency and recycled paper quality. Furthermore, paper recycling is limited to up to seven times. This review, therefore, goes on to highlight several sustainable waste management routes for paper waste utilization other than recycling by emphasizing the concept of converting paper waste and rejects into energy and high-value materials, including biofuels, biohydrogen, biomethane, heat, nanocellulose, hydrochar, construction materials, and soil amendments. Both the benefits and shortcomings of these waste management routes and their applications are discussed. It becomes clear from this review that sustainable management solutions for paper waste and rejects are implementable, but further research and development are still needed."

Energy is also important to augmenting the living standards of the population. Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) can be considered as pivotal to the rest of the SDGs. However, the gap between the demand and supply of energy is ever widening, and there is a severe discrepancy among the energy consumers at the regional and global levels. A few giant economies consume a large chunk of the total energy produced, while many other countries are striving for hundred percent household electrification. A large fraction of the global population still relies on firewood for its basic energy needs such as cooking and heating. Fossil fuels have been the backbone of the energy sector ever since the first industrial revolution. Multidimensional (environmental, social, economic, political, etc.) adverse consequences of extraction, transportation and consumption of fossil fuels are not new to the world. Ensuring energy security (availability and accessibility) without violating the 1.5 ºC (or 2 ºC) target is the real challenge before the global community. Transformation of the energy sector (from conventional to clean energy) is the only means by which these dual targets can be achieved. Energy generation at the local or regional level using renewable energy sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels, etc.) should be promoted and incentivized. Many regions and economies around the globe are encouraging the production and consumption of biofuels, especially in the automobile sector (and civil aviation is no exception). However, while focusing on energy transformation, we should not overlook and must be prepared for various unpredictable threats like extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks like COVID-19, cyber threats, etc. A green and clean energy sector can be achieved only by using a holistic approach, with international cooperation and promotion. Availability and access to energy are indispensable for the existence and development of mankind around the world. Energy is also important to augmenting the living standards of the population. A few giant economies consume a large chunk of the total energy produced, while many other countries are striving for hundred percent household electrification. Many regions and economies around the globe are encouraging the production and consumption of biofuels, especially in the automobile sector. A green and clean energy sector can be achieved only by using a holistic approach, with international cooperation and promotion. The demands for energy and energy sources have continued to increase with the inception of the first industrial revolution. Globally, India has emerged as one of the largest consumers of energy and hence, it is relevant to throw some light on India’s energy sector."

Wood waste from the construction industry (WCW) is a biomass source with economic value applications and can be used in the market as fuel. One of the bottlenecks of implementing WCW in urban centers is the continuous availability of materials to meet the demand, which is allied with the WCW contaminations and promotes high ash content. Therefore, blend formation has emerged as a solution to maximize the use of this waste and minimize the ash content, addressing issues such as machinery corrosion and slag formation during combustion. This study forwards improving the use of WCW as a biofuel via torrefaction by proposing an original blend of 50:50 WCW and Eucalyptus sp., torrefied at 200 (B200), 250 (B250), and 300 °C (B300) for 50 min. A comprehensive analysis assessed torrefaction process performance (kinetics and indexes), evaluating ultimate, proximate, physical (bulk density and SEM), bioenergy density, and energetic properties, examining combustion behavior and related emissions of the biofuel. Results highlight the most efficient treatment, B250, with 1.24 % ash, 20.76 MJ kg−1 heating value, 86.88 % mass yield, 91.25 % energy yield, and 6.38 bioenergy density. Replacing 1 m3 of oil, diesel, fuel oil, gasoline or 1 ton of coal with B250 could reduce CO2eq emissions by 590.88, 620.85, 469.68, 770.49, and 1894.4 kg, respectively. The study aligns with SDGs 7, 11, 12, and 13, promoting sustainable cities, responsible waste management, and climate action."

Creating an environmentally safe, energy-efficient economy is a prerequisite for sustainable development of each country. The above-mentioned factors determine the relevance of the study of the problems of the functioning and development of energy, which is mainly due to the economic expediency of renewable energy and the requirements of the country's energy independence. The objective of the article is to determine the features of ensuring the energy efficiency of the Ukrainian economy using alternative energy sources. Research shows that the development of alternative energy will allow us to move away from the use of traditional fuels and create the prerequisites for the energy independence of countries.

pub.1144321881,Biogas as a Sustainable and Renewable Energy Source,"The generation of waste is an inseparable element of human functioning. Among all produced waste, biodegradable waste plays a specific role. This is because waste is formed in every area, every day. One of the methods of biodegradable waste management is the anaerobic digestion process. The product of the discussed process is biogas, which is a source of sustainable and renewable energy. Anaerobic digestion is a biochemical process consisting of four phases: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. As a result of numerous changes, biogas is produced from various substrates rich in organic matter. The advantage of biogas is its many possible uses. The biogas can be used to produce electricity and heat in cogeneration and it can be used as fuel for vehicles or pump to the natural gas grid after purification to biomethane. The paper will include, among others, such information as: construction and operation of biogas plant, biogas production process, substrates and product of anaerobic digestion process, the use of biogas taking into account the possible use in sustainable mobility. Special attention has been targeted at environmental aspects of biogas production and management. The production of renewable energy following sustainable development is one of the tools in the fight against global warming. The effect of rational biodegradable waste management will be energy production, directly related to reducing of the amount of waste intended for landfills. Biogas is a renewable energy source with many advantages. Its production fits perfectly into the activities of sustainable development.

There is a need for valorization of such waste algal biomass which is otherwise disposed of as solid waste in land filling or incinerated. The algal blooms which are problematic can be processed technically to value-added products, and this in turn will also provide a sustainable solution to eutrophication hassles. Valorization techniques involve industrial processing of algal waste which can be converted or recycled into useful products or serve as a source of energy thereby increasing the value of the original material. This technology is the most promising solution to achieve low carbon economy. This review outlines the valorization techniques which can be adopted to convert the waste algal biomass which can be used in industries like energy, agriculture, and wastewater treatment plants."
pub.1083830569,EliteTree™: an advanced biomass tree crop technology that features greater wood density and accelerated stem growth,"Abstract Due to wood's potential for large‐scale commercial production of biofuels, a rapid increase in the use of wood as a source of energy is expected as policies promoting greater use of renewable energy are adopted globally. However, the economics of purpose‐grown tree feedstocks for energy show that these production systems are not financially viable without improvement in the base growth rate. Conventional breeding programs have produced willow and poplar clones that show potential for rapid growth, but current top‐performing clones do not grow fast enough for profitable biofuel production. Genetic manipulation of secondary wall biosynthesis is the most direct path to resolving this growth barrier. To that end, we developed an innovative biomass tree crop technology, EliteTree™, that results in greater wood density and accelerated growth of stems. This technology is built on overexpression of Gibberellin 20‐oxidase to increase plant stem growth in both height and diameter and increase lignocellulosic biomass accumulation through overexpression of the transcription factor MYB46, which is a master regulator for secondary wall biosynthesis. EliteTree™ technology uses 2A‐mediated bicistronic gene expression, with our proprietary utility promoter DX15, such that the genetic manipulation is limited to wood tissue, yielding transgenic poplars with xylem‐specific co‐expression of MYB46 and PdGA20ox1. The development of faster growing elite tree genotypes with increased wood density and growth rates will pave the way for truly sustainable and economically viable bioenergy/biofuel production using short rotation tree plantations, and ultimately will lessen carbon emissions and has the potential to revitalize rural economies. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"
pub.1114220648,Manure Treatment for Biofuel,"Animal excrements, such as manure, are by far the largest organic waste stream in the European Union. It is particularly large in the Netherlands where millions of animals per year are raised for meat, milk, eggs, gel, leather and many other products for daily consumption. As long as people consume such animal products, this production causes an unavoidable (wet) stream of organic matter containing various minerals. The question is, whether the material content of manure can be recycled, meaning all its main components reused as valuable products. In this chapter, we address the possibilities of separating and reusing these components. The focus is on cattle and pigs because most of the dry manure of chickens is already largely reused (mainly for energy production), and the manure volume of other animals is insignificant."

pub.1146613105,Carbon sequestration potential of Miscanthus application as biofuel source in Sweden,"<p>Abstract</p><p>Sweden aims to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2045. To do this, one strategy could be increasing the biomass contribution in energy sector as approximately 75% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are related to energy consumption. Therefore, it is beneficial to explore efficient ways to upgrade biomass materials into high value-added bioenergy. This study considers the potential of <em>Miscanthus </em>cultivation and its application as biofuel materials in Sweden in terms of carbon sequestration and contribution in climate impact mitigation. <em>Miscanthus</em>, as an energy crop with relatively low maintenance requirements and a high dry matter yield and energy content, can play a major role in the sustainable development of biofuels. Using <em>Miscanthus</em> for energy, results in avoiding fossil fuel combustion and the corresponding GHG emissions. The results of this assessment demonstrated that the <em>Miscanthus cultivation </em>contributes in soil organic carbon sequestration by over one tonne carbon ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> which results in mitigating a significant amount of soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes. Therefore, the adaption of <em>Miscanthus biomass,</em> would directly contribute in UN Goal 7, affordable and clean energy, and Goal 13, climate action due to a significant reduction in GHG emissions. The integration of <em>Miscanthus</em> plant into the landscape may stimulate the economy of rural areas in the country and offer more profit than afforestation and reforestation on abandoned and marginal croplands.</p><p>Keywords: Energy crops, Climate change, Bioenergy, Soil organic carbon, Ecosystem services</p>"
pub.1146600148,Bioeconomy and Food Security,"To limit global warming to well below 2 °C, as agreed upon in the Paris Agreement, a fundamental transformation of all central areas of our societies is necessary. Such a transformation includes energy supply, industry, digital infrastructure, buildings, transport, land use and our general lifestyles. The most important part of such a transformation, however, is a near-term phase-out of fossil fuels. Bioeconomy—an economy based on renewable resources and circulation—suggests a possible solution to the question of how such a transformation can be realised. Using biofuels to produce energy is expected to become a key element of every bioeconomy. Yet, using (food) crops to produce biofuels might conflict with food security—particularly in regard of climate change and population growth. In this essay, I question whether the implementation of a bioeconomy will cause moral conflicts concerning food security in regards of climate change and population growth. Based on a literature review of recent articles, I argue that due to climate change and the anticipated population growth, moral conflicts will very likely arise regarding food security by implementing a bioeconomy based on biofuels. To succeed in transforming our societies and to limit global warming to well below 2 °C, the implementation of a bioeconomy is not enough—even though the idea behind is basically right. What it takes, however, is also a change in our personal behaviour. We need to live and consume in a far more sustainable manner since our consumption patterns are the key drivers of climate change."
pub.1114517568,Simulation of the Operation of a Spark Ignition Engine Fueled with Various Biofuels and Its Contribution to Technology Management,"Economic progress, development of transport, production of new cars, production of more and more energy, and the combustion of fossil fuels are causing huge changes that are currently occurring in the environment. Ecological problems of the contemporary economy combined with perspectives of resources exhaustion, as well as the need to follow sustainable rules of living, require the search for new fuels. Fuels which can assure their availability and good environmental performance are needed for maintaining sustainable transportation. Knowledge about the behavior of various fuels is necessary for realistic methods of technology management in transportation means and the fuel industry. This paper describes biofuels that can be an addition to petrol or can exist as standalone fuels. A simulation was carried out on an urban vehicle and the tested fuels were petrol 95, ethanol, methanol, and dimethyl ether. For the selected engine a simulation corresponding to that of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test was created using the Scilab package. Based on this simulation, values of carbon dioxide and water vapor emission were determined. The fuel demand for each fuel mixture and the amount of air for the fuels used were also calculated (and verified on the basis of laboratory tests). It was demonstrated that addition of biofuel decreases emission of carbon dioxide, simultaneously increasing emission of water vapor. Biofuel additive also caused an increase in fuel consumption. Unfortunately, in the New European Driving Cycle test being investigated, carbon dioxide emissions in all cases exceeded the permissible level of 130 g CO2/km, which is bad news in the context of the further tightening of norms and standards. The simulation tests confirmed that when using the start/stop system and applying specific additives, the carbon dioxide emission decreases and the consumption of mixtures with the activated start/stop system is smaller. The analyzed problems and results of this analysis become more important in light of the Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) standard, which became binding from September 2018 and applies to the sale of cars that had been approved prior (in accordance with the New European Driving Cycle standard). Although the NEDC standard appears obsolete the computer model simulating this type of test will be necessary in many cases. It is, however, needed and possible to develop a similar simulation procedure for WLTP tests."

Latest policy actions such as the Green Deal or the Circular Economy Action Plan encourage maximising the biomass-to-products value chain through the use of all valuable compounds available in side-streams to the full extent. Side-streams from corn and rapeseed-based biofuels industries represent excellent sources of bioactive compounds and proteins, mainly under-utilised as animal feed without uncovering their full potential at industrial sectors such as food supplement, speciality chemicals, cosmetics, and household products. The main objective of the research conducted is to pave the way for side-streams valorisation technologies upgrading and market penetration by assessing current availability and future production rates of corn oil, thin stillage, rapeseed meal and other biodiesel and bioethanol production side-streams. Through a bibliographic analysis of peer-reviewed articles and grey literature, key information and valuable data are presented. It is possible to conclude that trends in biofuel markets (supported by regional regulations) lead to increased biofuel production, as well as increased availability of the specified side-streams. Corn oil is produced at a rate of 60 million L/year on average in Europe, a total of 1.6 billion L of thin stillage is produced each year, and rapeseed meal is generated at a global rate of 68 million tons per year. Future research to trigger further developments and investments could dive into the types and regional availability of relevant active compounds found in the selected side-streams."

pub.1021419568,Monitoring sustainable biomass flows: General methodology development,"Abstract  Transition to a bio‐based economy will create new demand for biomass, e.g. the increasing use of bioenergy, but the impacts on existing markets are unclear. Furthermore, there is a growing public concern on the sustainability of biomass. This study proposes a methodological framework for mapping national biomass flows based on domestic production‐consumption and cross‐border trade, and respective share of sustainably‐certified biomass. A case study was performed on the Netherlands for 2010‐2011, focusing on three categories: (i) woody biomass, (ii) oils and fats, and (iii) carbohydrates. Between 2010‐2011 few major shifts were found, besides the increasing biofuel production. The share of sustainably‐certified feedstock is growing in many categories. Woody biomass used for energy amounted to 3.45 MT , including 1.3 MT imported wood pellets ( >85% certified). About 0.6 MT of oils and fats and 1.2 MT (estimation) of carbohydrates were used for biofuel production. It is assumed that only certified materials were used for biofuel production. For non‐energy purpose, more than 50% of woody biomass used was either certified or derived from recycled streams. Certified oils has entered the Dutch food sector since 2011, accounted for 7% of total vegetable oils consumption. It is expected that carbohydrates will also be certified in the near future. Methodological challenges encountered are: inconsistency in data definitions, lack of coherent cross‐sectorial reporting systems, low reliability of bilateral trade statistics, lack of transparency in biomass supply chains, and disparity in sustainability requirements. The methodology may be expanded for future projection in different scenarios. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd "
pub.1169284231,"14 Production of volatile fatty acids from biomass, their recovery and applications in fuel and other valued products formation","The production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from biomass has gained significant attention as a sustainable and renewable approach for generating valuable chemical compounds. VFAs are versatile building blocks that can be recovered and utilized in various applications, including fuel and the formation of other valued products. The process of producing VFAs involves the anaerobic fermentation of biomass feedstocks such as agricultural residues, food waste, and lignocellulosic materials. This fermentation process utilizes microbial consortia or specific strains of bacteria to convert the biomass into VFAs, primarily acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. Factors such as substrate composition, pH, temperature, and reactor design significantly influence the VFA production efficiency. To recover VFAs from the fermentation broth several separation techniques such as liquid–liquid extraction, adsorption, and membrane filtration are employed. These techniques aim to isolate and concentrate VFAs, ensuring high purity and yield. Recovered VFAs can then be utilized in various applications, including the production of biofuels, bioplastics, and other chemicals. In the fuel sector, VFAs can be converted into biofuels through processes including catalytic upgrading, esterification, and hydrodeoxygenation. These biofuels serve as renewable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability. The recovery and utilization of VFAs in fuel and other valued products formation not only provide environmental benefits but also foster a transition toward a more resource-efficient and circular economy. Further research and technological advancements in this field hold great potential for unlocking the full potential of biomass-derived VFAs and expanding their applications in various industries."

Coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels make up the lion's share of today's energy supply. The environment and human life are seriously threatened by these non-renewable energy sources, which also contribute to air and water pollution and global warming. A fundamental component of energy, biomass can be used to generate renewable energy and create biofuels for use in transportation and electricity. Biofuels can be created utilizing a variety of methods and procedures and are obtained from biological carbon fixation. It is possible to transform biomass into useful products and energy in a renewable way using a range of techniques and procedures, a variety of methods and processes can be used to convert biomass into useful products and energy in a renewable way, both thermochemical and biochemical processes can convert biomass into fuels, chemicals, or electric energy. Heat and catalysts are used in thermochemical processes, whereas enzymes and microorganisms are used in biochemical processes. The use of nanotechnology and nanomaterials as instruments for biomass conversion has shown promise. Due to their small size, distinctive characteristics, and durability, nanoparticles (NPs) have many benefits over other sources for the synthesis of biofuels. The accurate chemical characterization of feedstocks employing tools like FT-ICR MS, GPC, and NMR can improve performance in biomass conversion reactions. Biomass conversion approaches for renewable energy production encounter hurdles. In order to increase reaction rates, selectivity, stability, and raw material solubility, it is important to develop more active, selective, and stable catalysts. Impurities in biomass-derived feedstocks can also impair catalyst activity, so it becomes necessary to design more active, stable, and selective catalysts."

In this respect, biomass generation from aquatic plants in enriched aquatic environments like wastewater has received considerable. Therefore, this review article provides comprehensive information on recent accounts on applications of microalgae in wastewater treatment using different technologies and their potentials in feedstock generation for biofuels applications. However, in the course of this study, high rate algal ponds (HRAP) and photobioreactors were found to be a reliable system for the cultivation of microalgae and wastewater treatment. Hence, the two-step method of dewatering methods is found to be the most effective approach for microalgae cultivation for wastewater treatment and generation of algal-based feedstock, taking into account high yield potentials and economic factors such as cost of operation and energy required for large scale algal biomass processing for biofuel generations."
pub.1166528007,Comprehensive treatment and disposal of logistics waste in China: Prospects of biomass resource conversion,"The exponential growth of China’s economy, coupled with the surge in online commerce, has led to a significant expansion of the logistics industry. In 2022, China’s express delivery industry generated approximately 9 million tons of waste paper and 1.8 million tons of plastic. This study analyzed the current composition and utilization of logistics waste in China, with suggestions for recycling. Logistics waste can be defined as the packaging waste generated in the logistics industry. Corrugated paper and plastic waste were chosen as the objects for utilization. Due to its high cellulose content, corrugated paper can be utilized along with other paper waste for biomass resourcing. Biodegradable plastics can also be converted into biomass resources through the action of specific microorganisms. These polymers can be enzymatically depolymerized by certain bacteria and fungi, yielding valuable organic products. In general, logistics wastes all have potential for biomass resource recovery. By adopting appropriate recovery and conversion technologies, these waste streams can be transformed into high-value bio-based products, such as biofuels, biochemicals, and biopolymers, thus contributing to the development of a circular and sustainable economy."
pub.1132782639,Food Processing Industry Waste and Circular Economy,"The continuous rise in world human population increases the demand for food supply thereby increasing food wastage throughout the supply chain which results in environmental pollution and scarcity of natural resources. In addition, food processing industries produce huge quantity of inedible food waste. Land filling and incineration are not the promising approaches of food waste management system for environmental sustainability and economic viability. Recycle and reuse are the major principles of circular economy which focus on the energy and resource recovery from food waste for sustainable environment. Food wastes are mostly rich in organic matters such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids which can be used as a feed stock for production and/or recovery of bio fertilizers, biofuels, bio gas, valuable bioactive compounds, natural nutrients and industrial enzymes by adapting suitable technologies including composting, anaerobic digestion, and fermentation. In addition, an integrated biological approach for recovery of energy and resources from food waste with the concept of zero solid discharge is found to be economically viable. This review highlights the technological advances in management of food waste including processing methods and product recovery."

An examination of the challenges and potential solutions associated with treating OPW using microalgae is provided, emphasizing the feasibility of microalgae biorefineries to recover resources. Due to the complex composition of OPW, nutrient supplementation and pretreatment are required for microalgae cultivation in OPW. It is difficult for microalgae to grow in salty waters, toxic compounds, and low nutrient ratios. There needs to be more certainty regarding the overall effectiveness of microalgae for removing contaminants and producing biomass in OPW. A circular economy approach is also applied to microalgae, which can be used to produce biofuels and biobased chemicals. Bioproducts can be produced from microalgae, contributing to the sustainability of the environment. There is a discussion of the socioeconomic and environmental aspects, with a particular focus on the creation of jobs and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. OPW treatment and resource recovery are potential benefits of microalgae biorefineries. The full potential of these technologies for a sustainable future will, however, require further research and development."

Studying Zakynthos Island in Greece,"Nowadays, energy demand is considered a notable world problem. The purpose of this study is to define, document and finally select an option of only one renewable energy source system, as to which is considered the most suitable solution from an environmental, social and economic point of view, for the energy independence of Zakynthos Island in Greece. This study examines the following alternatives; Biofuels Production Station, Geothermal Power Station, Hydroelectric Power Station, Solar Power Station and Wind Power Station. In order to determine the optimal renewable energy source, a multi-criteria decision-making approach is followed. The three pillars of sustainability, namely, the environment, the economy and the society, were used as the primary criteria in the context of the under determination goal. A significant number of environmental, economic and social sub-criteria were also developed and were subject to weight evaluation using both pairwise comparison and evaluation through structured interviews. Results, with regard to the delimitations set for the scope of the current study, indicate that solar energy source system is the optimal sustainable alternative."

This theme of analysis exploits key aspects of how the conversion of waste to energy can significantly decarbonize society. Various types of waste are converted into valuable energy sources such as electricity, heat, and biofuels in the form of urban solid waste, biomass, and industrial waste. This study discusses the benefits of waste-to-energy, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, utilization of renewable energy sources, better waste management practices, replacement of fossil fuels, and recovery of energy from nonrecyclable waste. This research also acknowledges the potential concerns about waste-to-energy, such as air emissions, and the potential negative impact on recycling and waste reduction efforts. The results showed that when applied in conjunction with appropriate emission control technologies and a comprehensive waste management strategy, waste-to-energy technologies can contribute significantly to the decarbonization of energy systems and pave the way for a sustainable circular economy."
pub.1162892358,Forestry Biomass as Carbon Neutral Source for the Production of Biofuels and Aromatics,"The production of a wide range of value-added products is heavily dependent on conventional fuels. With an annual growth rate of around 7%, the waste to energy sector in India could reach 14 billion USD by 2025. Despite continuous increase in energy demands, several types of underutilized wastes are generated from energy crops, anthropogenic, forestry, and municipal, agricultural, and industrial activities in huge quantities to maintain the country’s growth. It is estimated that nearly 560 billion tons of biomass is available on Earth, while the total primary production is ~100 billion tons/year. There is a surplus of agricultural and forest land in India, which produces about 500 million metric tons of biomass every year. In the last 50 years, agricultural production has increased by more than three times due to the expansion of agricultural soil. As agricultural products become more popular, this demand is expected to increase. Agricultural wastes include crop waste, livestock waste, food processing wastes, and animal wastes. Also, in agriculture farm, 5.3 kg of manure is generated per 100 kg of live weight (wet weight) each day. Biofuels and aromatics can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass, which is an economical, renewable, and abundant alternative to fossil fuels. As part of a bio-based economy and a biorefinery, there is a significant opportunity for the development of biodegradable building blocks (monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, biofuels, and polymers) and materials (fiber products, cellulose nanofibers, starch derivatives, and furfurals). Bioenergy needs to be modernized to fit into a sustainable, environmentally friendly, economically viable, and socially responsible development pathway. Various conversion technologies and pathways are capable of solubilizing diverse chemical constituents and are used for the production of a wide range of bio-derived intermediates and end products. The efficiency of conversion technologies differs greatly and depends on the type of biomass used as raw material, which may contain different fractions and compositions of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. With the rising demand, high cost, and emerging environmental concerns of fossil fuels, the monetization of biomass waste can provide significant benefits. This chapter explores the potential of waste biomass as a promising source for commercially viable industrial chemicals such as monosaccharides, biofuels, and oligosaccharides."

<p> In line with society's growing need for a more sustainable fuel economy, various biofuels and alternative fuel formulations are being proposed. In this work, the ignition quality of a novel tricomponent advanced biofuel is examined. Ethyl levulinate, diethyl ether and ethanol (EL/DEE/EtOH) result from the acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in ethanol. In this paper, derived cetane numbers are established for a wide variety of blend fractions, using Ignition Quality Tester measurements. EL/DEE/EtOH mixtures of ignition quality equivalent to market diesel and gasoline are identified. One mixture of Motor Octane Number (MON) 88.3 and Research Octane Number (RON) 95 is selected for detailed analysis in comparison to a FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) gasoline, as a representative of petroleum-derived gasoline, with a similar MON of 88.8 and RON of 94.4. Ignition delay times for the EL/DEE/EtOH gasoline fuel are measured using a rapid compression machine at equivalence ratios of 0.5 and 1.0, at 20 and 40 bar over a temperature range of 600–900 K. The data shows that at temperatures &gt;800 K, the EL/DEE/EtOH fuel behaves quite similar to the petroleum derived gasoline, FACE-F. However, the tri-component biofuel shows a dramatically truncated extent of ignition reactivity at lower temperatures, with a total absence of low-temperature chemistry or negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region; in this respect this biofuel blend is very different to conventional gasoline. To understand this differing behaviour, a detailed chemical kinetic model is developed. Analysis of this model shows that ignition of the EL/DEE/EtOH blend is inhibited by the dominance of alkyl radical elimination pathways, which leads to a heightened rate of production of HO <sub>2</sub> radicals. At high temperatures, while both fuels maintain a similar ignition delay time, the sensitivity analysis and the radical pool population shows that a different combustion mechanism is occurring for the EL/DEE/EtOH fuel, where ethyl and methyl radicals play a much more prominent role in the ignition process. </p>"

Because of its heavy reliance on fossil fuels for increased efficiencies over the 20th century, the chemical industry has been particularly motivated to harness alternative raw materials, such as biomass, that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Biorefineries have provided stable, large-scale means of converting biomass into base chemicals, but until recently the main focus has been on the conversion of the mainly cellulosic fraction of edible plants into biofuels. Second- and third-generation biorefineries are striving to be more economically integrated and sustainable by utilizing raw material fractions to a greater extent and by not competing with the agriculture and food sector. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of kiln-dry condensate as a source for production of bio-based chemicals. The condensates of three typical European wood species were analyzed. Part 1 evaluated the volatile extractives; Part 2 concentrates on semi- and non-volatile extractives of kiln-dry condensates."
pub.1157992433,Chapter 4 Sustainable conversion of agricultural waste to energy and high-value chemicals,"The agricultural sector has the utmost significance in human life and economic advancement. The day-by-day increase in the human population has led to the rise in the agricultural sector as well as its awareness. Due to increasing agricultural activities to fulfill the demands, the waste produced by the agricultural activities and the pollution also increases substantially. Unfortunately, the waste produced by agricultural activities may cause high economic losses, environmental pollution, and danger to human health. People find difficulties in disposing of agricultural waste as they are not completely aware of the threats and advantages of agricultural waste. These challenges are being faced all across the world. Therefore, there is a need for the development of effective management of the waste generated from agricultural activities. This chapter analyzes the ways for utilization of agricultural waste into bioenergy and high-value chemicals that will result in improving the economy. The development in the conversion of agricultural waste will provide new sustainable production for bioenergy, biofuels, and chemicals, leading toward a new era of the green market."

In order to measure the ‘greenness’ of chemical processes, it is necessary to have meaningful metrics and the most widely accepted metrics are the E factor and atom economy. These and other green metrics which address the amount of waste formed are discussed, as are metrics addressing the environmental impact of waste such as life cycle assessment. The pivotal role of catalysis in reducing waste is discussed. Solvent losses are a major source of waste in chemical processes and the use of alternative solvents and multiphase catalysis is discussed. White biotechnology constitutes the industrial application of biocatalysis, and biocatalytic processes fit very well with the principles of green chemistry. Biocatalytic processes are conducted using isolated enzymes or with whole microbial cells (fermentations), and the merits of both types of transformation are discussed. Enzymatic production of the pharmaceuticals, pregabalin, atorvastatin and sitagliptin, and the cosmetic ingredient, myristyl myristate, are presented as examples of green and sustainable processes involving white biotechnology. Finally, green chemistry and white biotechnology in the context of the utilisation of renewable biomass for sustainable production of biofuels and chemicals are discussed."
pub.1023911802,The Bioeconomy in Europe: An Overview,"A bioeconomy can be defined as an economy where the basic building blocks for materials, chemicals and energy are derived from renewable biological resources. This paper provides an overview of the bioeconomy in Europe, examining it from a policy framework and concept perspective. The role of bioenergy in the bioeconomy is discussed particularly through biofuels for transport and biorefineries. The study finds that the definitions of the bioeconomy are evolving and vary depending on the actor, but display similarities such as the emphasis on economic output and a broad, cross-sectoral focus. While there is great optimism about the benefits and opportunities associated with developing an advanced bioeconomy in Europe, significant risks and trade-offs are also expressed. Furthermore, the bioeconomy concept has been criticised for presenting a technical fix and pre-empting alternative visions. To advance a competitive and sustainable bioeconomy, this paper calls for attention on two important themes: participatory governance that engages the general public and key stakeholders in an open and informed dialogue as well as a commitment by government and industry to innovation that drives concerted efforts on sustainable development of the bioeconomy."

A paradigm shift from fossil fuel resources to sustainable energy sources is therefore inevitable. The production of biofuel, such as biochar, from biomass has been receiving increased research attention due to its benefits, which address several environmental issues while advancing the circular economy and sustainable development. This manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of the conversion of coconut biomass residue into biochar, focusing on production methods, physicochemical properties, and versatile applications. Various techniques that have been used for coconut biochar production, including pyrolysis, gasification, torrefaction, and hydrothermal carbonization, are examined in detail, considering their potential for sustainable resource utilization. The interplay between production parameters and resultant biochar characteristics is underscored, elucidating the influence of feedstock composition, pyrolysis conditions, and activation procedures. The findings revealed that the produced biochar has been employed in wastewater treatment, soil amendment, and carbon sequestration, among others. This vast application is a result of the biochar’s distinct physicochemical properties, including high porosity, substantial surface area, the presence of several surface functional groups, and thermal stability. Notwithstanding, biochar production from coconut residues faces several challenges. These challenges were addressed in this review, and relevant recommendations were proposed."
pub.1112917834,Potential of Microalgae Biomass for the Sustainable Production of Bio-commodities,"Human activities are causing major negative environmental impacts, and the development of sustainable processes for production of commodities is a major urgency. Plant biomass represents a valuable alternative to produce energy and materials, but exploiting present crops for commodities production would however require massive resources (i.e. land, water and nutrients), raising serious sustainability concerns. In addition to efforts to improve plant, land and resource use efficiency, it is thus fundamental to look for alternative sources of biomass to complement crops. Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic organisms that show a huge, yet untapped, potential in this context.Microalgae metabolism is powered by photosynthesis and thus uses sunlight, a renewable energy source, and the exploitation of microalgae-based products has the potential to provide a beneficial environmental impact. These microorganisms have the ability to synthesize a wide spectrum of bioactive compounds, with many different potential applications (e.g. nutraceutics/pharmaceutics and biofuels). Several, still unresolved, challenges are however present such as the lack of cost-effective cultivation platforms and biomass-harvesting technologies. Moreover, the natural metabolic plasticity of microalgae is not optimized for a production at scale, and low biomass productivity and product yields affect competitiveness. Tuning microalgae metabolism to maximize productivity thus represents an unavoidable challenge to reach the theoretical potential of such organisms."
pub.1158315931,The (Un)Feasibility of Inclusive Rural Development in Brazil,"This chapter extracts the main lessons about the process of contemporary agrarian development in Brazil. In the 1970s, a strong state-supported modernization was launched, leading to the emergence of an economy moved almost exclusively by productivity and profit-seeking. The Brazilian agricultural sector is now considered as one of the most successful global agro-food producers. The chapter comments on two related topics. The first highlights the difficulties to overcome the dichotomy of “agricultural production” versus “the environment.” Widespread deforestation, for example, continues to take place, especially in vulnerable biomes such as the savanna-type Cerrado and the Amazon. Still, and more problematic, a good proportion of this environmental impact is protected by law, and one cannot envisage a political decision aimed at stopping deforestation in those regions. The second objective concerns the (un)feasibility of attempts (concrete or discursive) to implement projects of “inclusive rural development” in the country. Many reasons sustain this proposition, but perhaps the main one is the actual vanishing of the old “agrarian question.” This is due to an empirical fact; the former rural poor have now become the urban poor, and thus the question “rural development for whom?” remains unanswered."
pub.1158315939,The Shanghai Connection: Governing the Sustainability Impacts of Brazilian Agri-exports to China,"Since the turn of the millennium, Brazilian agricultural exports to China have undergone an exponential growth trend. As the two countries have become closely interlocked in a transborder vegetable and animal protein complex, Brazil has become key to Chinese food security, while export revenues from China now play an important role within the Brazilian economy. However, beyond substantial the flows of money and goods between the two countries, Brazilian agricultural agri-exports have also come to embody significant socio-environmental impacts, in the form of deforestation and biodiversity loss. This is not least the case in Brazilian agricultural frontier regions, where land conflicts often also have been associated with agricultural expansion. This situation has led to a need for robust governance solutions to confront the socio-environmental challenges arising from this interdependence. In this chapter, we scrutinize existing governance mechanisms at both the domestic, bilateral, and transnational levels in order to assess how current regulatory arrangements address these issues. We conclude by identifying a clear sustainability governance deficit for trade flows of soy and beef from Brazil to China and by delineating potential pathways for solutions within this field."

The biofuel industry and engineering provide scientific solutions in the pursuit of eco-friendly and renewable energy sources and a circular economy. The present study engrossed in cleaner production of biodiesel from a novel feedstock of Chamaerops humilis with a high non-edible seed oil content of 30% (w/w). Cheaper and recyclable cobalt oxide nanoparticles were synthesized with leaf extract of Galium boreale to catalyzed transesterification. Characterization of cobalt oxide nanoparticles revealed their pure and nano nature with size of 40 nm. The highest methyl ester yield of 92% was achieved at optimal reaction conditions of methanol to oil ratio 6:1, catalyst loading of 0.54 (wt.%), temperature 60 °C and reaction time 3 h. Cobalt oxide nanoparticles were reusable up to five consecutive cycles. The 5, 8-octadecenoic acid was found as the leading fatty acid methyl ester in the sample of biodiesel. The fuel properties of biodiesel were in accord with international requirements. The minimum sulfur content of 0.0002% % indicated the clean and ecofriendly nature of biodiesel which is not only sustainable but economical too."
pub.1135910544,Inventory Management in Multi-echelon After-Sales Service Networks,"The rapid improvement in production technology over the last two decades has reduced the difference in quality of products produced by competitors. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the outlook of firms from a product-centric view to a more customer-centric view. Consequently, after-sales service or warranty is high on the agenda of firms in a service supply chain. In general, firms offer service contracts that guarantee a quick turnaround time for repair of faulty components, while ensuring full functionality of their returned product. In this chapter, we focus on such contracts from an inventory management perspective in a multi-echelon service supply chain. The customer returns arrive at various service centers spread over a region. The repair activity essentially involves identifying the faulty component, and replacing it with a repaired component (if available) or with a new component. The faulty components are then collected and sent to a common repair center. The repaired components are then returned to the service centers, where they shall be used to satisfy demand generated by future returns. The problem is modeled using M/M/1/K queueing system, and we derive properties of the total cost function."

The wider use of biofuels can be a method for reducing oil dependence and reducing CO2 emission. Opportunities to reduce emissions and meet international requirements in the field of environmental protection are seen, among others, in the development of the production and greater use of biocomponents, including bioethanol. This article presents the current state of development in the area of bioethanol production in Poland. An outline of legal regulations in the examined area and statistical data, as well as the largest producers and their production capacity, are presented. The basic time range of analyses covered the years 2015–2019. According to the analyses, liquid biofuels in Poland are used on a small scale, although over 2015–2019, the production of bioethanol as a biocomponent in motor fuels increased by 43,537 tonnes. However, production potential is still underused. In recent years, there have been major changes in the structure of the use of raw materials for bioethanol production. The share of maize has significantly decreased (although it is still dominant in the consumption structure) in favour of waste raw materials."

Moreover, the fast depletion of fossil fuel resources has also caused an energy crisis, therefore affecting the economy across the world. These serious issues have instigated a search for alternative sustainable energy sources, and biofuels are one such promising alternative that shows great potential as a future transportation or cooking fuel. Among all biofuels, hydrogen (H2) seems to be an attractive alternative due to its high energy content as compared to other hydrocarbon fuels. It is regarded as the cleanest fuel and is efficient for generating electricity as well as a transportation fuel. H2 is currently produced mostly from fossil fuels and biomass through energy-intensive chemical processes, which require high operating temperatures and pressures. On the contrary, the biological route of H2 production involves microbial bioprocesses that operate at ambient conditions and require modest reactor designs. This chapter discusses the advantages and limitations of various methods of microbial H2 production and the effects of different carbon sources used for its production. The major hurdle with the biological route is the lower yield of H2, and therefore this chapter also highlights various strategies to improve biological H2 production and its future perspectives."

Industrial exploitation generates by-products, including leaves, bagasse, and fibers, that can be re-valorized. Agave is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, fructans, and pectin, as well as simple carbohydrates. Regarding functional properties, fructans content makes agave a potential source of prebiotics with the capability to lower blood glucose and enhance lipid homeostasis when it is incorporated as a prebiotic ingredient in cookies and granola bars. Agave also has phytochemicals, such as saponins and flavonoids, conferring anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties, among other benefits. Agave fibers are used for polymer-based composite reinforcement and elaboration, due to their thermo-mechanical properties. Agave bagasse is considered a promising biofuel feedstock, attributed to its high-water efficiency and biomass productivity, as well as its high carbohydrate content. The optimization of physical and chemical pretreatments, enzymatic saccharification and fermentation are key for biofuel production. Emerging technologies, such as ultrasound, can provide an alternative to current pretreatment processes. In conclusion, agaves are a rich source of by-products with a wide range of potential industrial applications, therefore novel processing methods are being explored for a sustainable re-valorization of these residues."
pub.1136845802,Valorization of Wastewater Resources Into Biofuel and Value-Added Products Using Microalgal System,"Wastewater is not a liability, instead considered as a resource for microbial fermentation and value-added products. Most of the wastewater contains various nutrients like nitrates and phosphates apart from the organic constituents that favor microbial growth. Microalgae are unicellular aquatic organisms and are widely used for wastewater treatment. Various cultivation methods such as open, closed, and integrated have been reported for microalgal cultivation to treat wastewater and resource recovery simultaneously. Microalgal growth is affected by various factors such as sunlight, temperature, pH, and nutrients that affect the growth rate of microalgae. Microalgae can consume urea, phosphates, and metals such as magnesium, zinc, lead, cadmium, arsenic, etc. for their growth and reduces the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The microalgal biomass produced during the wastewater treatment can be further used to produce carbon-neutral products such as biofuel, feed, bio-fertilizer, bioplastic, and exopolysaccharides. Integration of wastewater treatment with microalgal bio-refinery not only solves the wastewater treatment problem but also generates revenue and supports a sustainable and circular bio-economy. The present review will highlight the current and advanced methods used to integrate microalgae for the complete reclamation of nutrients from industrial wastewater sources and their utilization for value-added compound production. Furthermore, pertaining challenges are briefly discussed along with the techno-economic analysis of current pilot-scale projects worldwide."
pub.1147148025,Chapter 11 Integrated biopolymer and bioenergy production from organic wastes: Recent advances and future outlook,"Effective waste management has attracted attention as one of the advanced biotechnologies for a sustainable and clean environment. Sustainability can be achieved by transforming organic waste substances into bioenergy and biomaterials. Consequently, a considerable decline in the consumption of fossil fuel can be observed which in turn leads to a healthier environment. Various industrial attempts have been made for synthesis of biopolymers and biofuels. However, the traditional production strategies include economically unfavorable processes such as commercially available carbon sources, separation, and purification of biopolymers from microbial strains. In contrast, the advanced biotechnologies involve the consumption of inexpensive and widely available organic wastes as starting materials. These organic wastes can be obtained from the activities of various sectors such as agriculture, food, and industries as well as municipal wastes. Moreover, the concept of integrated systems (simultaneous production of bioenergy and biopolymers from a single substrate composed of microbial strains, organic by-products, and waste substances) have further improved the economy as well as the ecological prospects of advanced biorefineries. This chapter provides useful insights into organic wastes for simultaneous production of high quality bioenergy and biopolymers. The broad spectrum of chemical composition of organic wastes, chemical insights into biopolymer, traditional synthesis of biofuel and bioenergy, and features of integrated technologies are discussed systematically."

In recent years there has been growing interest in using plants for decontamination. On the other hand, water, soil and air are increasingly contaminated. Large amounts of toxic waste have been dispersed in thousands of contaminated sites spread all over the globe. These pollutants belong to two main classes: inorganic and organic. The challenge is to develop innovative and cost-effective solutions to decontaminate polluted environment. Phytoremediation is emerging as an invaluable tool for environmental cleanup. Various strategies are being applied to reduce the accumulation of toxic metals in plants. Cultivation of edible crops in contaminated soils is a subject of human health concern if the contaminant concentration in the edible parts of crops plant exceed the permissible level. In such cases non-food crop production viz. value chain and value additions appears profitable. In this review: (1) the contamination due to industrial effluents in peri urban region of greater Hyderabad, and (2) the strategies to use contaminated soil and water for raising phytoremediation crops, and generation of value products.

Wheat straw, wheat bran, rice bran, corncob, and sugarcane bagasse are among the cheapest agricultural wastes present in abundance and can be utilized to produce microbial enzymes via fermentation strategies. Fruit processing waste has recently been considered a versatile source for the extraction of enzymes such as bromelain, papain, and others. The utilization of these substrates to produce enzymes leads to an overall decrease in biobased chemicals and biofuels' production cost. Significant research has been conducted to reduce the cost of production of biofuels, such as ethanol using low-cost agricultural wastes as substrates and in-house produced enzymes. Such an approach eventually follows the concept of a circular economy to achieve sustainable development. The current chapter focuses upon the production of industrially important enzymes from agricultural wastes via different routes. Furthermore, the recent studies on genetic modification and protein bioengineering for enhanced production of microbial enzymes from agricultural wastes are discussed. In addition, the techno-economic feasibility of the enzyme production process has also been reviewed."

In last few decades, fossil fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission have been increased due to more economic growth and growing population. Moreover, the objective of this research is to assess the consequence of biofuel including natural gas, environmentally friendly power projects (renewable-energy), and thermal power utilization on financial turn of events including GDP and CO2 in ten top countries. Multivariate climate countries with ubiquitous CO2 emission during the period of 1990–2018 were selected to examine the long-run flexibility as well as the path of causality between different variables, the panel co-integration test, panel heterogonous Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality evaluation and panel completely modified ordinary least squares were employed. The panel co-reconciliation test verify that variables have a long-run equilibrium correlation in their relationships. Long haul versatility and causality tests show that natural gas doesn't add to financial development or CO2 decreases. According to this present study, results can help to develop conservative policies regarding long-run and sustainable energy and design in energy development."

In 2010, the country became the second world producer of biodiesel with a production of 2.4 million of m3 in that year, only behind Germany. In 2011, both the United States and Argentina increased production and now Brazil is the fourth world producer of biodiesel. The Brazilian biodiesel production federal program has been designed so that small family farmers, as well as large agribusiness operations, are encouraged to produce vegetable oil crops for biodiesel production. Brazil is the second largest world producer of soybeans, currently the main feedstock used for biodiesel production in the country. Due to the increasing demand for biodiesel and low oil productivity from soybean, Brazil is searching for alternative oilseed crops from which biodiesel can be produced. In this review, the current scenario for biodiesel production in Brazil is discussed, as well as vegetable oil crops that are being considered as potential biodiesel feedstocks in addition to soybeans. Brazil's biodiesel industry is currently operating only at 47% of its capacity. Therefore, it is expected that biodiesel production in Brazil will further increase. Due to the size of the country's bioethanol and biodiesel industries, Brazil can already be considered one of the world powers in sustainable biofuel production, an strategic area of the world's emerging bio-based economy."

In this work, crude glycerol was evaluated as biofuel for fuel cells applications on PdBi nanomaterials synthesized by a green chemical method involving protic ionic liquids. Bismuth at different concentrations (15, 55, 70 and 83%) promoted electronic and morphological shifts. Atomically-dispersed Pd catalyst was found in the Pd85Bi15/C material. While, the increase of Bi content formed hemispherical nanoparticles and then, in a composition of Pd17Bi83/C, 2D materials were found. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that bismuth was in form of Bi2O3 and Bi(OH)3. Pd30Bi70/C and Pd17Bi83/C were the two electrocatalysts with the highest activity for the crude glycerol electro-oxidation reaction, achieving current densities of 244.17 and 237.67 mA mg−1 Pd. These two current densities values represented 207 and 88% of that obtained for pure glycerol oxidation. Additionally, these current densities were higher than those values reported for Pd-based materials, and Pd17Bi83/C was the most stable material retaining the activity during 500 cycles, being most stable than other materials found in literature based on Pt-group metals. The results herein presented reveal that bismuth is a strong candidate as an economically viable and functional co-catalyst."
pub.1135912477,Exercise Your Rs! You Never Know When You May Need Them: Revisiting and Extending Modes of Product Life for the Future,"Do you remember the slogans regarding the 3 Rs; well, there is actually 12. Each R can provide opportunity, but can also create peril if a management team is unacquainted with it at an inopportune time. Hence, we revisit the urgent need for companies—and society in general—to rethink supply chain strategy with respect to Rs. The expansion of the 3 Rs to 12 is inherent with the view that consumers and markets are focusing on product life extension—not product obsolescence. In an obsolescence economy, there are only three Rs and the R most revered and reported is Recycling. However, if the focus is on product life extension—getting all the value possible from a product and the by-products that result from the production, use and disposal of the product—recycling is considered the least attractive of the Rs. This is increasingly important as we face millennial challenges associated to greater glocal sustainability. The pandemic of 2020 shows us that even with tremendous shuttering of the world economy, greenhouse gas emissions and other measures of pollution are still substantial. In fact, the level of economic activity during the height of global lockdowns is described as being consistent with what is needed to keep the global average temperature to the target of 1.5 °C above baseline. Consequently, marshalling and extending our technical knowledge and related managerial skills is needed to meet the challenges of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring sustainability more broadly. Firms that are unaware of their position and that of their supply chains in relation to the 12 Rs, will have difficulties at multiple points in the future. Supply chains that engage the 12 Rs in an appropriate manner not only can avoid future difficulties but reduce their cost basis at a time when the growth in many markets is flat at best."
pub.1169325172,"Assessment of EU Bio-Based Economy Sectors Based on Environmental, Socioeconomic, and Technical Indicators","The development of a resilient and circular bio-based economy is of paramount importance, notably in the EU, where current climate policies and evolving regulations strongly demand more sustainable practices, impacting monitoring and reporting, as well as the deployment of novel valorization routes for byproducts and waste streams. In this context, with the aim of assessing the current state of the European bio-based economy, a comprehensive analysis based on socio-environmental, socioeconomic, and technical indicators was carried out on major sectors, namely textiles, woodworking, pulp and paper, bio-based chemicals and materials, liquid biofuels, and bio-based electricity. Each sector was evaluated with respect to its main biological raw materials, and a methodology is proposed to link their geographical origin (inside or outside the EU), import shares, and internal production with socio-environmental impacts, based on official databases and indexes. Socioeconomic data (turnover and employment) and technical data (average bio-based content within the main products of the sector) were also considered for the analyses, allowing a multi-angle comparison between sectors and the identification of barriers and opportunities for future developments. Finally, a quantitative and qualitative overview of non-hazardous biogenic waste streams generated in the EU is presented, and opportunities for their valorization and reintegration into the EU bio-based economy are discussed. As a result of this analysis, beyond enabling the assessment of each sector within the bio-based economy, along with the assignment of values for comparison, the implementation of this evaluation facilitated the identification of improvement pathways, which were consolidated into a set of proposals."

pub.1153524029,Creating Wealth from Agrowaste,"India is among the significant agricultural economies of the world. The Green Revolution of the 1970s facilitated this overpopulated country to overcome the imminent threats of food insecurity while ensuring optimal crop production. India's economy is majorly agricultural, with more than 70% of its population directly or indirectly dependent on farm‐based livelihoods and their associated options. Agricultural production has increased manifold over the last few decades due to land use cover changes, conversion of forest lands into agricultural lands, technological improvement influencing productivity, quality inputs, intensive farm policies, and exponential population growth. This fast‐paced growth, however, has detrimentally impacted India's natural resources. Agriculture accounts for 18% of India's total greenhouse gas emissions, as communicated to UNFCCC. We need to mitigate climate change and increase the production of food and energy for a nation projected to exceed a population of 10 billion people by 2050. Meeting the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), which aims for holistic and inclusive growth, can help us overcome this challenge. Many countries have adopted and implemented national policies based on efficient resource management by ensuring maximum resource generation and minimal waste production. Agriculture is one of the bulkiest socio‐economic sectors with total biomass production. India is, in fact, among the top rice cultivating countries in the world. Agricultural waste management, however, is a severe problem. Farmers often dispose of the vast amounts of rice straw generated as the main crop leftover by resorting to environmentally harmful approaches such as stubble burning. Many recent efforts have successfully converted stubble to biogas, different biofuels, fertilizers, and growth medium. Proper, sustainable, and scientific agricultural waste management can diversify livelihood options and contribute significantly to new emerging markets. This discussion summarizes agro‐residue management strategies such as bioconversion of stubble into organic manure, electricity, and biogas. The chapter would further document such success stories practised by Indian farmers on the field, which has heavily reduced agrowaste generation and open new vistas of opportunities while ensuring sustainable development and facilitation of green growth of Indian economy."
pub.1132506426,Rural Resources (including Forestry) in the Local Development of Low Carbon Economy: A Case Study of Poland,"Due to the significant share in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sensitivity to climate change, agriculture and rural areas should be an important area of activity in the local development of a low carbon economy. However, this is rarely the case in Poland and other European countries. The paper evaluates the role and importance of rural resources (including forestry) for the local development of a low carbon economy. Based on a SWOT analysis the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the opportunities and threats in the two key elements such as maintenance or increase of the ability to absorb CO2 and reduction of GHG emissions from agricultural and forest lands are shown. Specific attention was paid to the potential of agriculture and rural areas in terms of the possible use of their resources in order to increase the C sequestration in biomass and soil and reduce GHG emissions, as well as the use of agricultural, agroforestry and agro-food processing with biomass for renewable energy development, including the production of biogas and biofuels. The information obtained from the SWOT analysis shows that this potential is based on considerable resources of agricultural and forest land in Poland. The goal of local governments and agricultural producers should be to identify and eliminate identified weaknesses and potential risks while implementing the relevant principles of a low carbon economy and low carbon development directions of rural areas."
pub.1172005660,Metagenomics- Paving the Path for Sustainable Circular Bioeconomy,"The concept of circular bioeconomy is embraced now-a-days as an integrated approach for sustainable production of renewable materials having minimum energy demand, maximum utility, and recycling capacity, minimizing the production waste with complete degradation. This bio-circularity needs cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to promote economic growth and are responsible for solving various environmental complications. Among various technologies, metagenomics is proving its mettle that can lead to sustainability. The identification and characterization of diverse microbial communities present in various environments such as water, soil, and waste streams help in sustainable resource utilization. The power of the unseen majority is enormous and unfolds the genetic information and functions of the microbes that can be applied in various avenues of combating societal problems. The discovery of novel catalysts and genes responsible for waste utilization and their valorization leads to the closed-loop system in which biological resources are reused and recycled. The production of biofuels, bioplastics, and other value-added biobased chemicals from various waste materials is aligning with the principles of circular bioeconomy. Moreover, optimization of microbial consortia for specific applications by understanding the interactions between different microorganisms and their metabolic functions by metagenomics is facilitating the efficient utilization of bioresources for the production of desired bioproducts. Therefore, the present review highlighted the synergy between the development of metagenomics and circular bioeconomy transforming the role of metagenomics in the development of circular bioeconomy by facilitating various paradigms of societal needs such as bioenergy, health, agriculture, and environment and has the potential to fulfill sustainable development goals."
pub.1163730042,Cultivation of Diatoms for Wastewater Remediation,"Rampant environmental pollution of the aquatic ecosystems worldwide has been posing a severe threat to the marine biota, as is evident from the sharp decline in aquatic ecosystem productivity and species diversity. The challenge faced by all growing economies worldwide is the management of wastewater containing a mix of domestic and industrial sources. Handling such mixed wastewaters and their treatment for reuse through conventional technologies is economically prohibitive. In this regard, growing diatoms in wastewater renders multiple benefits, including economical remediation, with the prospects of biofuel and value-added bioproducts. Diatoms are emerging as excellent phyco-remediation tools to bioremediate wastewaters due to their extraordinary remediation capability and unique cellular machinery. Oxygen released by diatoms during photosynthesis acts as a stimulant in bacterial proliferation, thus enhancing the organic pollutant and heavy metals degradation of wastewater. Diatom biomass produced through assimilation of wastewater nutrients is being sourced as feedstocks for a range of value-added products such as aquaculture feed, omega-3 fatty acids, immunomodulatory essential oils in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products in addition to biofuels. This chapter discusses the advantages of integrating diatom cultivation technology with wastewater resource recovery while growing diatoms in wastewater, and comprehensively reviews various feasible downstream processing technologies for converting diatom biomass into valuable bioproducts. Diatoms absorb heavy metals from wastewater and undergo morphological alterations with the enhanced production of stress-responsive secondary metabolites. Higher nutrient storing capacity, faster doubling rates, ability to grow in light-limiting and more turbulent water flow conditions make diatoms superior to other microalgae for remediation of wastewaters. The recent ventures of biofuel production from oleaginous diatoms include a year-long outdoor mass cultivation of Mayamaea sp. Hence, integrating diatom cultivation with wastewater would provide various products and cumulative benefits, proving microalgal biofuel generation to be economically viable and sustainable. Different species of diatoms belonging to the genera Chaetoceros and Skeletonema are commonly used in intensive Penaeid shrimp cultivation systems. The potential of diatoms to transform waste into wealth would aid in the economical treatment of wastewater, lowering the carbon footprint, and enhancing the quality of the aquatic ecosystem has recently gained significant research attention."
pub.1136988430,Caffeinating the biofuels market: Effect of the processing conditions during the production of biofuels and high-value chemicals by hydrothermal treatment of residual coffee pulp,"The manufacturing of coffee, one of the most popular beverages globally, renders enormous amounts of by-products and wastes, which may trigger severe environmental issues if not treated appropriately. The coffee pulp, resulting from the wet processing of coffee, is the predominant by-product, with around 10 Mt annually produced worldwide. For the first time, this work addresses the hydrothermal treatment of coffee pulp to produce biofuels and platform molecules, scrutinising the influence of the processing conditions (temperature, pressure, reaction time and solid/water ratio) on the process. This strategy allowed the transformation of coffee pulp into bio-crude and hydrochar in different yields (10–26% and 10–42%, respectively), depending on the conditions. The bio-crude included a pool of alkanes, carboxylic acids, ketones, phenols and nitrogen species, with varying quantities of C (54–71 wt%), H (6–7 wt%), O (18–34 wt%) and N (3–5 wt%) and a calorific value shifting from 23 to 32 MJ/kg. The hydrochar contained different proportions of C (57–72 wt%), H (4–6 wt%), O (20–35 wt%) and N (2–3 wt%) and had a calorific value between 22 and 29 MJ/kg. Process optimisation showed that up to 45% of the coffee pulp could be simultaneously converted into energy-rich (29 MJ/kg), merchantable liquid (20% bio-crude) and solid (24% hydrochar) biofuels during the treatment of a 15 wt% coffee pulp suspension at 320 °C and 162 bar for 1 h. At the same time, a bio-crude with a high proportion of profitable phenolic derivatives (42%) can be attained in high yield (25%) when a 5 wt% suspension is treated at 280 °C and 120 bar for 2 h. These promising results, along with the bespoke nature of this hydrothermal treatment, are a landmark achievement for the economy and sustainability of coffee producer countries, thus representing a pioneering step change towards the sustainable management of early-stage coffee leftovers."
pub.1175925102,Production and optimization of biofuels from locally isolated algal biomass: Strategies for circular economy integration,"In the present study, we investigated the potential of locally isolated algal strains as alternative energy sources for sustainable biofuel production. The focus of this study was to identify algal strains that are capable of accumulating oils rich in essential fatty acids. Algal samples were collected from different areas and 14 isolates were obtained. Among the various pretreatment methods tested, hydrothermal pretreatment using sulfuric acid at 95 °C yielded the best results, with sample IIB-14 containing more than 2% reducing sugars. These sugars were then used for fermentation with the S. cerevisiae strain, resulting in an ethanol concentration of 3.52% ± 0.2%. This holistic approach contributes to the development of low-cost and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional energy sources. While algal biofuels offer a promising substitute for fossil fuels, further advancements are needed before they can be widely adopted in the fuel market. Among these, isolates IIB-8 and IIB-9 showed the highest oil yields of 22.84% and 24.69% (w/w), respectively. The specific environmental settings for optimal growth of these strains were determined, and the physicochemical parameters of the oils, including iodine value, viscosity, density, acid value, saponification value, unsaponifiable mass, and peroxide value, were analyzed. The transesterification of oils into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) revealed the presence of significant amounts of fatty acids, including EPA, DHA, and linoleic acid. Moreover, the study also explored the potential of algal biomass for bioethanol production, addressing the sustainability concerns of renewable energy supplies. Hydrothermal pretreatment using sulfuric acid at 95 °C yielded the highest concentration of reducing sugars (>2%) in IIB-14. Sugar extracted from algal biomass was used for fermentation. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain used for the fermentation process yielded an ethanol concentration of 3.52% ± 0.2%. This holistic approach contributes to the development of low-cost and environment-friendly alternatives to renewable energy sources. Algal biofuels may offer a practical substitute for fossil fuels, but there is still a long way to go before they can enter the fuel market and are widely used."
pub.1147530646,Recent progress in Biomass-derived nanoelectrocatalysts for the sustainable energy development,"The changing global approach for protecting the planet and turning to a low-carbon economy has made the growing demand for biomasses at the core of biochemistry. Biomass contains all the substances in nature that in the recent past were living things, made from living organisms or their wastes. Biomass is carbon-based and is a mixture of organic molecules, including hydrogen, usually oxygen, and often nitrogen, and small amounts of other atoms such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and heavy metals. Production and consumption of biomasses grew in sustainable procedures do not cause a net change in the CO2 content of the atmosphere. So, the biomasses can be regarded as carbon neutral due to the mentioned net carbon cycle they involve. Energy production from biomass sources is utilized to generate electricity and heat. These sources are renewable sources and CO2 production of these sources is natural and does not produce greenhouse gases. The development of practical techniques for sustainable energy generation from biomass is one of novel strategy to overcome air pollution and move towards the sustainable bioeconomy. This study reviews recent progress in Biomass-derived nanoelectrocatalysts for the sustainable energy development that includes biomass-based electrocatalyst synthesis, biomass-based nanoelectrocatalysts for water splitting, and biomass-based nanoelectrocatalysts for fuel cells. Finally provides future perspectives to motivate future research such as the necessity to increase agricultural and so food production while reducing inputs to balance biomass valorization for energy production versus biomass upgrading, and to develop practical techniques for cheap pretreatment and metabolic engineering of lignocellulosic and efficient strategies for the commercial-scale production of lignocellulosic based-biofuels."

Agri-food chains are key to ensuring the transition to a sustainable development model in line with the principles of CE. This study sought to implement the concepts of circular economy at the Ecuador's banana production chain, through the design of prospective from the exhaustive diagnosis of the main processes of the chain. The research was conducted from 2020 to 2022. The studied checklist included 91 items grouped into nine dimensions: source or supply of materials, design, manufacturing, economic circle, distribution and sales, consumption and use, 4R, re-manufacturing, and sustainability. A medium circular economy level (CEL) was evaluated (2.69 points out of 5). Two machine learning techniques (MLTs) were also applied support vector machine (SVM), (with three types of kernel: radial, linear and polynomial) and a neural network (NN). In relation to the Spearman correlation coefficients of the application of the techniques to the study cases, they were higher than 0.90. The most reliable was the SVM Regression-Linear Kernel, which had a coefficient close to 1. Finally, various value-adding options are proposed in order to take advantage of the large amount of waste generated in the banana production system. The proposed options include value-augmentation processes, ranging from organic fertilizers, biofuels, materials for wastewater treatment, and the production of bioplastics and nanoparticles, which can be implemented using the CE approach."
pub.1174590679,Blending biomass-based liquid biofuels for a circular economy: Measuring and predicting density for biodiesel and hydrocarbon mixtures at high pressures and temperatures by machine learning approach,"Circular economy is an efficient approach to deal with the rapidly increasing demand for energy and its environmental impact. It involves switching to renewable and sustainable energy sources. By providing an alternative to traditional energy resources, biodiesel promotes a circular economy paradigm that embraces renewable energies rather than fossil fuels. As an alternative to fossil fuels, liquid biodiesel helps to improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution. Furthermore, blending biodiesel has proven to be economically and environmentally viable. Knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of biodiesel, such as densities and coefficients of expansivity and compressibility, plays an important role in understanding and determining the behavior of the fuel under different operating conditions. The blend densities of Soybean Oil Biodiesel (SOB) with hexane and Waste Cooking Oil Biodiesel (WCOB) with heptane in four volume ratios were experimentally studied. An Anton Paar vibrating tube densimeter HPM DMA has been used for accurate measurements of densities of the biofuels and their blends. Density measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from 298.15 K to 393.15 K, and pressures between 0.1 MPa and 140 MPa. This work also aims to develop accurate prediction models of the properties of biodiesel blends under various conditions, such as changes in temperature and pressure, which are essential for optimizing energy production processes and engine performance. In this context, the dataset was first investigated with Tait Equation of State (Eos) to determine thermodynamic parameters which including isothermal compressibility and isobaric expansivity. It showed generally low standard deviations. Furthermore, these new experimental densities were also modeled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a machine learning method. This paper models proved that the machine learning method is a suitable tool to model the thermo-physical characteristics of liquid fuels. The findings of this study have the potential to provide valuable guidance to engine engineering applications developers regarding operating conditions and the selection of suitable biodiesel for their system."
pub.1167536675,Animal manure in the context of renewable energy and value-added products: A review,"Animal manure has a complex structure and can be considered a lignocellulosic material. Manure management generates greenhouse emissions, mainly N2O and CH4. Currently, efforts are being made for the sustainable use of animal manure to obtain bioenergy and value-added products. This work shows thermochemical and biochemical methods for manure valorization and proposes strategies to mitigate the inherent environmental problems, thus helping to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), particularly SDGs 7, 9, 12, and 13. The physicochemical properties and high heating values (HHV) of different types of manure are presented and discussed. The HHV follows the order of cow ≈ horse > sheep > poultry > pig manure . Thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion were studied. The operating conditions of anaerobic digestion were also studied. Physical, chemical, thermochemical, and biochemical (e.g., with microbial consortia and enzymes) pre-treatments were analyzed to improve the performance of the above processes. Limitations and obstacles in technological applications were identified, such as manure distribution, lack of government incentives, or the presence of antibiotics in manure. Animal manure has a clear potential to produce organic acids, biomaterials, biofuels, and bioenergy. So, bioprocesses or biorefineries using this biomass as a feedstock may be promising in the near future in the context of the bio-economy, helping to increase the production of renewable energy, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, fostering innovation that adds value to the main livestock activities that generate manure, and guaranteeing sustainable consumption and production modalities that allow mitigating the effects caused by the current treatment of manure."

A collaborative project for development of Sustainable Advanced Lignocellulosic Biofuel Systems was launched in 2012 between USA and India emphasizing high biomass bamboo, sorghum and pearl millet feedstock cultivation at marginal ecologies in 9 villages of 3 districts of Gujarat state in India. A baseline survey was conducted by interviewing 415 households followed by focus group discussion to understand socioeconomic profile of the targeted region, agricultural practices, awareness and inclination of local growers toward commercialization of biofuels crops. Survey data were analyzed using SPSS statistical tool. The survey showed that land holding of 2.5–5 acres and 5–10 acres was prevalent, with rain-fed and borewell irrigation and average soil quality having medium to shallow deep soil structure. Annual income from farm showed positive association with soil quality, while lower productivity from bad-quality soil. Households were interested to grow biofuel crops only if they give better net profit as compared to current crops. Good land quality, larger cultivated area and joint family had relatively less risk of bioenergy crop production than the counterpart. Household having above poverty line (77.8%) signified annual income of more than 10,000 INR. Lower literacy rate showed that 5–15% of the members migrated out of village for temporary seasonal livelihood. The districts were well connected with roads with enough frequency of state and private vehicles, railways, government postal services, mobile phone network and round the time electricity for household entitled the districts to penetrate bioenergy market. Leveraging available infrastructure and adopting large-scale co-operative mechanized farming, crop rotation within agro-forestry system, diversification of food, fiber and energy crops through policy support would bring economic and environmental benefits along with new market, job creation and bioenergy industries at surveyed ecology."

pub.1169302471,How Did the Covid-19 Pandemic Affect the Structure of Energy Final Consumption of the Households Across EU Countries? Findings from Eurostat Data,"Access to energy is a key element in the functioning of the state, as it enables various economic, social and political activities. Without it, many sectors of the economy would have no chance to develop, and ordinary people would find it difficult to function on a day-to-day basis. Ensuring accessible, affordable and clean energy for citizens is deeply reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG7). This is closely linked to climate action (SDG13), responsible consumption and production (SDG12) and action against poverty (e.g. by eliminating energy poverty). Households are a key consumer of energy, and their efficient and sustainable use of energy can contribute to reducing energy costs and its impact on the environment. The aim of the presented study was to assess the changes that have occurred in the structure of households’ final energy consumption (FEC) in EU countries between 2019 and 2021. This is an important period for the functioning of economies, as the massive lockdowns resulting from the Covid-19 had a significant impact not only on the amount of energy consumed, but also on the structure of that consumption. The data used in the analysis came from publicly available Eurostat databases. A k-means is used as an analytical tool. The findings reveal that there were no notable alterations in the household sector's energy consumption structure during the period under analysis. This sector of the energy market is considerably less responsive to economic fluctuations compared to prices and relies more on the EU's energy policy."

pub.1123483972,Current Issues with a Sustainable Approach in the Industrial-Scale Operations of Microalgae,"With severe environmental degradation in the last half-century, decrease in reserves of fossil fuels, significant rise in air pollution levels and dire need for an alternative renewable and sustainable energy alternative, microalgae-based biofuels have emerged as one of the most promising third-generation biofuel technologies. With all the feel-good factors it brings and all the promise it holds for the reversal of environmental degradation, it must be stated that there is very slow progress towards commercialization. Even now no biofuel company in the world is operating commercial-size algae cultivation farms, processing algae to make bio-crude fuel, refining and finally selling the various cuts as either algae-based transportation fuel or as other algae-based petrochemicals. With so much buzz around algal biofuels, how is that there is almost no commercialization? The answer to this situation is that various unit operations that make up the typical algae biofuels process flow may not be fully optimized at scales that are commercially relevant. With a long list of benefits propagated by various research groups and policymakers about algae-based biofuels, biorefinery and bio-economy, how is the technology still not commercially deployable? The answer to this is that very few research groups have actually conducted an integrated end-to-end mass and energy conservation balance and in-depth life cycle analysis to understand overall process economics and energy dynamics. Even when attempts have been made, sufficient data are neither generated nor available to cover the entire gamut of possibilities because this field is so new. This has resulted in inadequate assessment of sustainability of industrial-scale operation of algae. To have the full complement of data, it is very important to have a serious investment of funds and R&D efforts to understand the various facets of the algae industry, including but not limited to strain selection, genetic modification (strain improvement), media optimization, cultivation, vessel design, light, CO2 and nutrient management, contamination control, algae harvesting, concentrating, dewatering, drying, conversion of algae biomass to fuel and fuel upgradation. Although significant advances have been made recently, with several research groups making path-breaking claims in algal technology, not all of these achievements are translatable to field scenarios or are robust under outdoor conditions. This chapter thus focusses on a discussion of the current state of technical feasibility and economic viability of different processes in industrial-scale operation of microalgae and hopefully illustrate to the reader avenues where opportunity exists for further improvement to make the operation practically and industrially applicable at large scale under the realistic environmental scenarios expected to be encountered at actual plant sites. This chapter provides a review of the state of the art of industrial-scale operations "

Even though they are frequently vewed as waste, agricultural residues can be rethought and repurposed through creative methods to produce valuable goods like biofuels, organic fertilisers, and biodegradable rmaten'als. It examines the various uses of agrtuttural waste, an asset that is often disregarded, across a range of industries, with an emphass on the generation of bioelectrt ity, medicinal uses, and the extraction of anti-oxidant and anti-cancer substances. Using cutting-edge technologies to generate bioelectricity from agricultural waste not only solves environmental issues but also provides a sustainable energy source. Concurrently the pharmaceutical industry gains from the separation of bioactive elements from agricultural waste, whch acts as a replenshable supply of antioxidants and possible antitumor agents. This multidisciplinary strategy promotes improvements in pharmaceutical research while both reducing waste and demonstrating the adaptability of agricultural waste in fulfilling energy requrrements. By addressing the issues of waste management, this paradigm shift towards the use of agrowaste also advances the creation of a circular economy. In order to fully reaiise the potenta l of agrowaste and promote a more resourceefficient and sustainable agriculture industry while opening up new opportunities for economic growth that hold promise for major positive ej ects on the environment and human health, the abstract emphasises the significance of continued research, technological advancements, and cooperative initiatives."
pub.1168400812,Sargassum-to-energy: A review of bioethanol production and its significance in Ghana,"Macroalgal biomass (seaweed) is one of the most abundant and valuable renewable resources globally. Lately, the conversion of this into biofuels has gained considerable attention as an alternative to fossil fuels. In addition, the success in exploiting this feedstock hinges on its distinctive characteristics and the method employed to isolate its specific active components. Within the framework of a circular economy, invasive Sargassum species present themselves as promising candidates for bioethanol production. Ghana’s bioethanol production feedstocks are mostly from edible crops in competition for human consumption or lignocellulosic biomass with high lignin content. This suggests utilisation of this invasive and valuable bioresource is still not recognised in the country. The present communication reviews Sargassum invasiveness (availability), chemical composition, processes and opportunities in bioethanol production in a potential country, Ghana. This aligns with the clean and sustainable energy fulfillment as outlined in Ghana’s energy transition framework policy and SDG 7."

As Europe, the United States and the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa continue to promote development models that rely on economic growth, which is often driven by over-consumption. The “green” credentials of some renewable energy technologies are under fire as evidence of environmental degradation and human rights abuses, associated with the raw materials that fuel them, continue to multiply. The electricity or heating generated from their use then branded as renewable and sustainable energy was sold to European consumers. The crude palm oil both companies produce is a major ingredient for biofuel, which is also promoted as renewable energy. The biomass producer Buchanan Renewables entered into an agreement with the Government of Liberia to build and power an electricity plant using wood chips from unproductive rubber trees."

pub.1181436569,Chapter 21 Approaches in biorefinery,"Biorefinery no doubt holds much fortune for developing economies in sustainable waste management and the protection of environmental integrity. Current and emerging research trends have clearly shown the massive potential of wastes and lignocellulosic biomass as excellent feedstocks for the biotechnological production of several value-added products ranging from biofuels (bioethanol, biomethane, biohydrogen, bio-oil, and syngas), organic acids, and platform chemicals, as well as other organic preparations such as biofertilizer, compost, biochar, and enzymes, among others. It is therefore imperative to choose the appropriate technological approach to treat each biomass, considering its inherent properties/compositions and nutrient recovery potentials. To this end, biorefinery presents two broad technological routes, which are biochemical and thermochemical conversions. This chapter discusses in full the different approaches under these two broad categories, which include methods such as composting, vermitechnology, anaerobic digestion, alcoholic fermentation, dark and photofermentation, pyrolysis, gasification, incineration, and hydrothermal carbonization."
pub.1028509740,16 Water Scarcity Global Challenges for Agriculture,"Exponential population growth in a world with uneven freshwater distribution will sharply increase water demands. Rising global temperatures exacerbate violent storms and prolonged drought. Salinization occurs at coastal deltas from rising sea levels and in groundwater from overpumping. The World Bank estimates that 25–30% freshwater is wasted, costing the global economy $14billion annually. This paper highlights recent technologies developed to augment finite freshwater systems and presents potential remediation to relieve agricultural stress. Improving water management in agriculture rests on implementing sustainable irrigation techniques, developing crop modifications that help tolerate water stress, and promoting cooperation among stakeholders. Innovative techniques permit desalination that is less energy intensive and preserves membranes. Recycling highly purified sewage water is a powerful tool for replenishing groundwater. Although growing crops for biofuels is incompatible with global demands for freshwater and food, recent studies on cellulosic biomass and microalgae cultivation hold promise as economically viable energy sources."
pub.1174141959,Energy and nutrient recovery from anaerobic co-digestion of malting wastewater and microalgae biomass,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of the ratio of Spirulina maxima biomass to inoculum on the anaerobic co-digestion of malting wastewater using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket pilot-scale reactors. The AD process occurred in mesophilic conditions, lasting for 369 h. The experimental conditions included three groups: (1) malting wastewater (control); (2) malting wastewater with an 80:20 inoculum/Spirulina maxima ratio; (3) malting wastewater with a 60:40 inoculum/Spirulina maxima ratio. The 60:40 inoculum/Spirulina maxima ratio demonstrated superior performance, generating 6.7 times more biomethane compared to both the control and the 80:20 inoculum/Spirulina maxima ratio. This condition achieved a chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 76%. Furthermore, the digestate generated did not exhibit phytotoxicity towards lettuce and barley. Therefore, co-digestion digestates can be effectively utilized in agriculture. Co-digestion was also found to be efficient in simultaneously treating co-digestion, generating biomethane, and producing biofertilizer. This work emphasizes a promising and sustainable approach to valorizing waste and effluents, which has positive impacts on bioenergy generation and food production. It promotes the principles of the circular economy and sustainability in agriculture."
pub.1128005103,"Digestate: The Coproduct of Biofuel Production in a Circular Economy, and New Results for Cassava Peeling Residue Digestate","Circular economic paradigm applies residue from one process as input material for another, fostering sustainable benefits for humanity. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an attractive technology for biogas production in a circular economy. Digestate is the residual organic matter generated as coproduct of biogas. Because digestate is nutrient rich and largely stabilized, it has varied management options. Digestate is suitable for direct use as bio-fertilizer and is a good amendment material to improve soil physical properties. However, the quality, safety, and utility of digestate are dependent upon the characteristics of feedstock, digester process, pre- and post- digestion treatments. Digestates emanating from AD of animal manure, energy crops, food processing residues, and other feedstocks have been reported in published literature. On the other hand, there is dearth of reports on digestate emanating from AD process that utilized cassava peeling residue (CPR) as sole feedstock. This chapter presents relevant information on digestates including production, feedstock, quality and safety requirements, processing and treatment technologies, regulatory aspects, applications management options, cost implications, as well as challenges and opportunities. In addition, new results of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) compositions of liquid fraction of CPR digestate are reported."

This commensurate with the increase in industrialization, urbanization, and population growth is leading to production of enormous quantities of industrial waste biomass that may cause environmental and health hazards. However, the increased awareness and desire for a healthy environment among people leads to the need for better ways of waste minimization and pollution prevention and better use of resources in achieving the required industrial and environmental standards. The present book deals specifically with the valorization of waste biomass to small-volume high-value biochemicals only. The products which are produced in bulk quantities, such as biofuels, some organic acids, hydrolytic enzymes, biogas, and other traditional products from waste biomass, are not discussed. In this context, the current chapter discusses the different sources, types, and nature of waste biomass. The chapter also provides overview of the different management strategies applied for the value addition of different types of waste biomass. The chapter will provide insights into the role of waste biomass resources for developing bio-based economy/processes for industrial biotechnology and renewable energy in supporting sustainable development and economic competitiveness."

It is mostly used in food preparations to enhance the organoleptic quality of cooked foods. While processing onions, a large amount of waste, mostly in the form of peels, fleshy scales, roots, bulbs, etc., are left behind, which are rich sources of bioactive compounds that can be extracted through suitable technologies for the development of value-added products. Onion waste can also be fermented for the production of bioethanol and, therefore, holds great value to the industrial bioprocessing sector.

pub.1169055781,Valorizing Waste Streams to Enhance Sustainability and Enable Competitive Biofermentation Economics,"Driven by demand for more sustainable products, research and capital investment has been committed to developing microbially produced oils. While researchers have shown oligeanous yeasts and other microbes can produce low-carbon footprint oils by leveraging waste streams as energy sources, previous analyses have not fully explored the quantity of available waste streams and in turn economy-of-scale enabled on capital operating expenses. This paper makes parallels to 2G ethanol facilities, enabling a data-driven understanding of large-scale production economics. Production costs are broken down for a variety of scenarios. The analysis finds that reaching price parity with large-scale commodity oils (e.g., palm oil, high-oleic cooking oils, biofuels feedstock oils, lauric acid) is not possible today and unlikely even under aggressive future assumptions about strain productivity. Instead, commercial production must be targeted at end markets where sustainability-conscious consumers are willing to pay the price premiums identified in this paper."

After harvest, the leftover substrate, referred to as a spent mushroom substrate (SMS), largely remains biochemically unaltered. In light of the global rise in the number of edible mushroom production facilities, it is pertinent to sustainably manage the by‐products of the mushroom production process, particularly SMS. Following the principles of the circular economy, SMS has shown potential for a variety of applications: SMS can be used as substrate for a new cycle of mushroom cultivation or as animal feed, fertilizer, soil amendment, bioremediation agent or a substrate for renewable energy production such as biogas, bioethanol, biohydrogen, solid biofuel, bio‐crude and bio‐oil. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge in various applications, highlights recent developments in the field, discusses potential barriers and offers suggestions for the long‐term growth of the mushroom industry worldwide."

Many countries, including Italy, have introduced important incentive schemes to support the use of biomass for electricity, heat and transportation. This has raised considerable interest towards the use of biomass for energy generation purposes. Nonetheless, the design and installation of biomass-fuelled power plants present several critical issues, such as choice and availability of biomass, choice of technology, power plant localization and logistics. The case study tackled in this paper evaluates the economies originated by a 1MWel Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine coupled with a biomass fuelled boiler, installed in an area close to Palermo (Italy). A Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to localize the power plant and to optimize logistics. The thermodynamics of the plant as a whole were also analyzed.

pub.1137409409,Patterns of European bioeconomy policy. Insights from a cross-case study of three policy areas,"The concept of the bioeconomy has risen to great popularity with governments around the world as a new paradigm for a sustainable economy. However, it is still highly contentious what the bioeconomy actually is or should be, which results in a certain vagueness of bioeconomy policy strategies. European bioeconomy policy is a prime example of this. Despite two dedicated bioeconomy strategies, it appears to be highly fragmented and heterogeneous when it comes to concrete political processes and measures. Against this backdrop, we aim to find patterns of European bioeconomy policy by applying the political process-inherent dynamics approach (PIDA) to the three sub-areas of bioplastics, biofuels and bioenergy. Aggregating the respective results, the overarching pattern of European bioeconomy policy is rather shaped by the interplay of specific problem structures, institutional frameworks and actor constellations in its policy sub-areas than by the ambiguous umbrella concept of the bioeconomy."
pub.1164173074,Review of potential and prospective strategies for the valorization of coffee grounds within the framework of a sustainable and circular bioeconomy,"Moving from the linear production model to the circular economy approach is the main concern of the EU Circular Economy Action Plan. Population growth coupled with high demand for goods has led to a significant increase in solid waste, especially food waste, triggering the depletion of natural resources and the environmental burdens associated to their disposal. However, their physical, chemical and biological characteristics make them by-products with a high potential to be valorized and therefore used as resources for other industrial production models. This is the case of spent coffee grounds (SCGs), which are produced in large quantities on a daily basis. Therefore, valorization models under the approach of the biorefinery concept can be envisaged with the aims of recovering potential bioactive compounds and renewable energy. This has been the approach developed in this critical review, in which SCG recovery alternatives have been studied to obtain lignin, lipids, biofuels and phenolic compounds. In addition, a critical analysis of the outcomes of techno-economic and environmental evaluations available in the literature is included, in order to identify those indicators that provide information on the feasibility of their valorization."

pub.1012697155,Managing technological and social uncertainties of innovation: The evolution of Brazilian energy and agriculture,"This paper explores how technological, commercial and social uncertainties shaped the development of Brazilian biofuels. Technological innovation allowed the country to emerge as a global leader, but Brazil continues to struggle with major social uncertainties due to poverty and environmental concerns common in many emerging economies. Contemporary approaches to development within the innovation literature focus primarily on overcoming technological and commercial uncertainties, but only peripherally explore social uncertainties. To fill this void, we draw on Martin and Hall's framework for managing innovative uncertainties, which is based on Kuhn and Popper's approaches to the evolution and methodology of science, and extend it with Aldrich and Fiol's concept of cognitive versus socio-political legitimacy. Based on qualitative data collected in Brazil, we outline the evolution of automotive fuel ethanol and flex-fuel technology, the development of Brazilian soybean production, and castor for socially inclusive biodiesel production. We show how innovation solved some technological and commercial uncertainties and generated new opportunities, but also created additional social uncertainties that are now being addressed. Through this process, Brazil has acquired capabilities in alternative energy technologies and more sustainable agriculture, becoming an exemplar for other emerging economies. We conclude with implications for policy and industry."

The sustainable bio-fixation of the extracted CO2 by employing various algal strains for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) along with the culture conditions has been discussed. The comparative analyses highlight that the integrated biorefinery approach does not involve harmful chemicals, high energy utilization and high operating expenses. The post-treatment and consumption of biogas-separated CO2 by algae make the process carbon neutral. The potential algal strains, their CO2 utilization capacity, and subsequent formation of high algal biomass along with several significant value-added products such as biofuels, biochemicals and biofertilizers in different types of photobioreactors and other process parameters, are also elaborated. The emerging role of efficient algal species in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing the climate change issue has been illustrated for making it an eco-friendly strategy. The systematic valorization of algal biomass contributes to promising resource regeneration and promotes a circular economy in the sector of bioenergy industries to sustainably fulfill the global energy demand."

The results of the AHP showed that the cardboard pulp binder was the preferred material to use. Cardboard pulp binder, palm kernel decanter cake, and charred palm kernel shells in a ratio of 10: 20:70 was the used to manufacture composite briquettes. The values obtained for calorific value, specific fuel consumption, and average burning rate were 22.72 MJ/kg, 2.21 kg/L, and 4.87 g/min respectively for the optimal choice. The briquettes produced in this study promotes circular economy and provides a novel framework to address cooking energy poverty issues through the manufacturing of waste-based biofuels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in sub-Saharan Africa to use these waste resources to create composite briquettes."

Incorporation of sustainable production methods in the industry can reduce costs in the areas of energy consumption and waste disposal and lessen environmental impacts via reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Circular economy opportunities for waste valorisation are possible also, such as anaerobic digestion of process effluents with high organic loads to produce high quality biogas for use in generation of thermal energy, electricity and transport biofuel. In this study lab-scale anaerobic digestion of whiskey distillery waste streams was trialled at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures. Biogas production was assessed while monitoring process parameters and the microbial communities at different stages of reactor operation were described. Syntrophic acetate-oxidation appeared to be a significant process at mesophilic temperatures but not at thermophilic operation.

pub.1175608780,Advances in thermochemical valorization of biomass towards carbon neutrality,"In the context of carbon neutrality, the push for sustainable and low-carbon development in both economy and society have accelerated the large-scale utilization of biomass as a partial replacement for fossil fuels. As the only carbon-containing renewable resource, biomass valorization shows great potential in the production of value-added products including carbon-negative biofuels, chemicals, and carbon materials. In this review, we highlight the key aspects of thermochemical upgrading, including the thermal deconstruction of biomass feedstock, selective production of high-value chemicals, and the preparation and application of carbon-based materials. Particularly, the application of sustainable and economical pretreatments is vital for promoting efficiency in the follow-up thermochemical transformation. The introduction of catalytic materials greatly contributes to the selective production of a series of building blocks and high-value chemicals. Furthermore, it is clear that the future application of porous biochar strongly depends on the modification methods. Last but not least, the challenges and future research directions for the large-scale utilization of biomass are proposed, where effective coupling of thermal deconstruction with further upgrading into a wide range of derivatives should be given significant emphasis. This review aims to provide strong support for the realization of carbon neutrality through high-value transformation of biomass resources."

pub.1057948165,Renewable energy and low carbon economy transition in India,"Cooperation of large developing countries such as India would be important in achieving a low carbon future, which can help in restricting the global temperature rise to 2 °C. Global modeling studies of such low carbon scenarios point to a prominent role for renewable energy. This paper reports scenarios for a low carbon future in India. An integrated modeling framework is used for assessing the alternate development pathways having equal cumulative CO2 emissions. The modeling period ranges from 2005 to 2050. The first pathway assumes a conventional development pattern together with a carbon price that aligns India’s emissions to an optimal 450 ppmv CO2-eq. stabilization global response. The second emissions pathway assumes an underlying sustainable development pattern. A low carbon future will be good for renewable energy under both the development pathways, though the share of renewable energy will be higher under a sustainable pathway. Renewable energy faces competition from low carbon technologies like nuclear and carbon capture and storage in the electricity sector. Solar, wind, biomass, and biofuels emerge as the four competitive renewable energy choices for India. Renewable development however depends critically on the reduction in the costs and in the ability to integrate the intermittent renewables within the existing systems for which technology transfer and capacity building hold the key."

Since the production of agri-food waste highly correlates to the country's economy, the conversion and utilization of the same is in high demand. This chapter delivers a vision into different residues of beverage crops and explains the role of micro-organisms in effective management of waste and its valorization for balanced economy."

The effective use of surplus energy from wind plants appears as a promising method to produce hydrogen. Accumulating surplus energy through hydrogen production and storage can solve the problem of energy excess, making energy available on-demand. This article explored the potential of hydrogen production from wind energy in three distinct scenarios of surplus energy, and the amount of electricity generation for Brazil and its regions. To a scenario of 6-h of energy excess, the potential for hydrogen production from wind energy was equal to 1.48E + 07 Nm3.d−1. The state of Rio Grande do Sul reached a potential of 1.10E+06 MWh.month-1 of electricity generation using H2. Taking into account a payback-time of 3.5 years, the cost of hydrogen production was 0.402 US$.kWh−1. Hydrogen ensures greater energy security in times of energy shortages through biofuel storage. The main goal was to show the possibilities of diversifying the national electrical matrix and the wind resources contribution to the Circular and H2 Economy in the country."

Considering all the consequences of using such conventional energy sources like CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions, and at the same time questioning the sustainability factor of the energy transition, there is a dire need to transition to cleaner energy fuels. To inculcate the conventional energy sources, a lot of renewable energy sources like biogas, biofuels, hydrogen, solar energy etc. have been researched. The primary success towards biogas production is due to the affordability of the available feedstock, the ease and availability of biofuels, low production costs, and the applications of biogases which involves heating, electricity, fuel, refrigeration and power generation. Some of the criticalities and challenges discussed in the study includes a gigantic gap between biotechnology research and development, commercialization and analysis of the future of biogas in the circular economy. Many lignocellulosic sources, such as manure, fruit, and vegetable wastes, can be used to generate biowaste, and anaerobic digestion can be used on a local or large scale. In this study, MATLAB/Simulink environment is used to carry out a multitude of models and simulations that take into account speculative objectives and potential energy futures (calculating the number of functioning plants in 2030, 2050, etc.) which include Input–output models, the Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 (ADM1), and other models. There are a lot of predictions, points of view, and conclusions that are discussed that claim the outcomes of simulations of such models can cause significant changes in the economic systems, as the use of biogas and biofuel will lead to the recovery of a lot of fossil phosphorous, to the tune of 100–150 billion euros, and that also proved the effectiveness and applications of biogas and biofuels.Graphical AbstractA cycle diagram of modeling and simulation models for biogas production from biowaste has 5 segments.

However, the invasion and widespread infestation of Spodoptera frugiperda result in significant maize yield losses, leading to a lower standard of living and a weakened economy for maize producers. This study builds differentiable equations to simulate the behavior of the Spodoptera frugiperda-maize biomass model, incorporating predators and best farming practices. The model exhibits six points of equilibrium, all of which are locally asymptotically stable if the necessary requirements are met. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and PRCC multivariate analysis were employed to identify the sensitive parameters affecting the pest. Numerical simulations suggest that, in the early stages, integrating natural enemies with best farming practices proves to be an effective intervention as it directly reduces the pest population and promotes sustainable pest control."
pub.1163850831,Biomass waste pyrolysis in the context of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry: an overview,"The study detailed environmental issues associated with the use of fossil fuels, which would necessitate a shift to alternative energy in Nigeria. It outlined energy-related physicochemical parameters of phytomas and their pyrolytic products that make them preferred alternative energy sources using established standard methods and instrumental analysis procedures. The review identified methods of improving the utilisation of waste biomass and its pyrolytic product. Biomass pyrolysis between 350 and 550°C serves as waste conversion to wealth and as a reliable source of cheap energy generation, which brings about a drastic reduction in fossil fuel reliance. The study proffered low-cost solutions for energy generation and served as an eye opener to an assessment of biofuel using instruments (TG/DTG, XRD, Bomb Calorimeter, XRF, SEM, BET, FTIR, GC-MS, and 1H NMR) for physicochemical properties related to stored chemical energy.

Hence, researchers have been attracted by the biomass, especially sugarcane, as a source of renewable energy to produce bioethanol and biofuel. This research is aimed to formulate a three-phase robust supply chain network design optimization model to produce bioethanol from sugarcane using the fuzzy integrated data envelopment analysis method to select suitable cultivation lands as potential points. Since the objectives are to maximize the profit, minimize environmental effects, and maximize the social performance, and some parameters are naturally uncertain, use has been made of a robust possibilistic programming model to deal with them considering the possibility of transportation disruptions. The model performance has been illustrated through a case study in Iran and it has been validated using the realization method."
pub.1024469098,Catalytic Transformations of Biomass-Derived Acids into Advanced Biofuels,"Fossil fuels are the primary source of energy, chemicals and materials for our modern society. Petroleum, natural gas and coal supply most of the energy consumed worldwide and their massive utilization has allowed our society to reach high levels of development in the past century. However, these natural resources are highly contaminant, unevenly distributed around the world and they are in diminishing supply. These important concerns have stimulated the search for new well-distributed and non-contaminant renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind, hydroelectric power, geothermal activity, and biomass. This shift toward a renewable-based economy is currently spurred by governments which have established ambitious targets to replace an important fraction of fossil fuels with renewable sources within next 20 years [1] and [2]. In this sense, biomass is considered the only sustainable source of organic carbon currently available on earth and, consequently, it is the ideal substitute for petroleum in the production of fuels, chemicals and carbon-based materials [3]."
pub.1172125977,Sustainable Solid Biofuel Production: Transforming Sewage Sludge and Pinus sp. Sawdust into Resources for the Circular Economy,"The lack of adequate sanitation in Brazil overloads the health system and causes deaths. The utilization of sewage sludge hinders advancements in water treatment. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of producing briquettes by blending sewage sludge with Pinus sp. sawdust. The sewage sludge was sourced from a water treatment facility, while the Pinus sp. sawdust was obtained from a sawmill. Elemental analysis, proximate analysis, and calorific value were evaluated for both biomasses. Briquettes were manufactured using a hydraulic press, varying the proportion of sewage sludge from 0% to 95%, followed by thermogravimetric analysis. Pinus sp. sawdust exhibited higher carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen content, whereas sewage sludge contained more nitrogen and sulfur. The sawdust had greater fixed carbon content, volatile matter, and calorific value, while the sewage sludge had higher ash content. Samples with higher sewage sludge content showed better thermal resistance, with 100% sewage sludge retaining 63.3% mass after exposure to 950 °C. Briquettes with higher sewage sludge content had increased energy density. Considering the elevated nitrogen, sulfur, and ash content, sewage sludge should be limited to 5% in briquette production with Pinus sp. sawdust. This research underscores a significant avenue for sewage sludge utilization and sustainable bioenergy production."
pub.1147384491,A Hybrid Strategy for the Efficient Biosynthesis of Fufuryl Alcohol from Corncob in Formic Acid–Water,"The implementation of efficient and sustainable biorefineries to substitute the petroleum-based economy is dependent on coupling the manufacturing of high-value biobased chemicals. Furfuryl alcohol (FFA) is a versatile and valuable intermediate for the manufacturing of vitamin C, fruit acids, lysine, plasticizers, dispersing agents, lubricants, resins, additives and biofuels. This work provided a cascade catalysis of biomass to FFA via a hybrid approach. Co-catalysis of corncob (75.0 g/L) with formic acid (1.0 wt%) and solid acid Sn-MMT (2.0 wt%) could produce 77.8 mM furfural at 180 ℃ for 10 min under microwave (600 W), and then the formed furfural was biologically transformed into FFA with recombinant E. coli CF harboring formate dehydrogenase and aldehyde reductase in the furfural liquor containing formate as cosubstrate at pH 6.5 and 35 ℃. This established hybrid strategy could efficiently valorize corncob into FFA in the presence of formate, with the productivity of 0.296 g FFA/(g xylan in corncob). Consequently, one-pot cascade reaction that combines non-enzymatic and biocatalytic conversion provides a sustainable way to effectively valorize the biomass into high-value chemicals.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1131310083,Valorization of Cynara Cardunculus L. Oil as the Basis of a Biorefinery for Biodiesel and Biolubricant Production,"The production of sustainable and biodegradable products, for energy or material use, is becoming important for local economies. Thus, biorefineries can play an important role in sustainable development at regional levels and therefore the search for feedstocks with multiple uses is vital. The goal of this research was to assess the implementation of Cynara Cardunculus L. oil as the basis of a biorefinery for biodiesel and biolubricant production, proposing the main steps for this purpose. The chemical reaction selected for biodiesel and biolubricant production was transesterification, using methanol and other more complex alcohols. The optimization of each step was carried out, assessing the yield by gas chromatography. Once the optimum conditions were selected, the main characteristics of the biofuel or biolubricant were measured, paying attention to viscosity and oxidative stability. As a result, Cynara Cardunculus L. oil could be a suitable feedstock for a biorefinery, as long as some antioxidants are added in final products, especially to increase its oxidative stability in biodiesel (whose value was 1.35 h). Concerning biolubricant production, the yields were acceptable (exceeding 92%) and the products showed variable viscosity values (from 8.6 to 18.85 cSt), implying a desirable diversification of production depending on demand."

pub.1107164022,Sustainable Production of Bioenergy from Agriculture and Forestry in the Nordic Countries,"There is an increasing awareness that climate change is caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases that mainly originate from the use of fossil fuels. In the EU member states as well as in other parts of the world, energy policies are being developed that discriminate fossil fuels and /or promote the use of renewable energy sources. Together with increasing oil prices, the result is a steady increase in the demand for renewable energy sources, both for heat and power production and to a varying degree also for vehicle fuels. A transition to an economy that is more based on use of renewable biomass than on fossil fuels is initiated. As a consequence, conflicts between economic production of food, fodder and fuels and various ecosystem services (biodiversity, social and cultural values, etc) that are provided by forest and farmland are increasing as well. Hence, a developed thinking on how to balance between these services is desirable. This report summarizes the conclusions from two workshops on sustainability criteria in relation to tried and/or existing implemented production systems and describes general principles for a sustainable production of biofuels from agriculture and forestry in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden."
pub.1050092012,"The Role of Bioenergy in Enhancing Energy, Food and Ecosystem Sustainability Based on Societal Perceptions and Preferences in Asia","This paper discussed the analysis of the survey on sustainability of bioenergy conducted in the Philippines, India and China. It acquired general perceptions of the people by asking them (a) specific questions about their level of familiarity with bioenergy; (b) relationship of their work to bioenergy; and (c) their opinion on contribution of various feedstock on the economy and impact of bioenergy production on food security. In addition to these questions, we estimated preference weights of various feedstock based on the conjoint choices on bioenergy’s contribution to social stability, social welfare and ecological balance. The estimates revealed significant trade-offs not only among these three dimensions of sustainability but also the relative importance of energy security, food security and ecosystem capacity to other economic, social and environmental objectives. The types of first generation feedstock that are currently used for biofuel production in the respective countries and those that offer alternative household use are perceived as important to the economy and preferred bioenergy feedstock. Based on the results of the study, the preferred role of bioenergy for sustainable development reflects the social and economic concerns in the respective Asian countries, e.g., energy security in China, food security in India, and ecosystem degradation in the Philippines."
pub.1175729310,Seaweeds from an Italian Coastal Lagoon: From ‘Waste Material’ to Commercially Valuable Marine Resources,"Marine seaweeds, characterised by high-valued bioactive compounds, are used worldwide for several applications, including human food, animal feed, pharmaceutics and cosmetics, bioplastics, agricultural fertilisers, biofuels, and others. Seaweed production can be carried out through different approaches, from on-land or sea-based cultivation to the harvesting of wild stocks. The latter can be of particular importance in the case of seasonal algal over-proliferations, often caused by eutrophic conditions associated with intensive human industrial activities, and which wreak havoc with ecosystem functioning and hinder economic activities. In Europe, Italy experiences seaweed blooms in several coastal basins, such as the Lagoon of Venice and the Lagoon of Orbetello (Tuscany). Here, the proliferating seaweed represents a disturbance to the natural ecosystem and to local business and touristic activities. These biomasses hold no economic value in the country and are systemically removed and disposed of. Re-purposing the biomass to produce seaweed-derived commercial goods would provide benefits for the environment and local economic activities while promoting a sustainable business within a Circular Economy framework and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals number 12 (‘Responsible consumption and production’), and number 14 (‘Life under water’), among others."
pub.1134760632,An Overview of Biomass Conversion Technologies in Nigeria,"In Nigeria, maintaining steady power supply to the teeming population of over 200 million people has become a challenge. The country stands to be the most populous and yet having the highest economy in the African region. The present electricity generation capacity of 12,552 MW is not enough to cater for the rural and urban dwellers, and this constitutes a great challenge to the country’s development. As such there is a need for sustainable and clean energy to cater for the ever increasing energy demand. In this regard, this chapter looks into the available biomass conversion techniques in the country, their technology levels and the benefits of adopting biofuel technology. It further dwells on the challenges impeding their implementation which include lack of workable policies, research funding, public awareness and loan and incentive schemes. The chapter provides recommendations to address the issues through proper policy and framework, research, training and development, public enlightenment and award of loans. The study identifies anaerobic digestion as the most promising conversion technology in the Nigerian scenario for a clean and sustainable energy although other processes like gasification and pyrolysis are also promising."
pub.1172677726,Innovative biorefinery approaches for upcycling of post-consumer food waste in a circular bioeconomy context,"Owing to the significant amounts produced each year, food waste is a critical issue that affects the economy, society, and environment. An estimated US$ 1 trillion food is wasted annually because of the supply chain and harvesting processes, which lose around one-third of the net production. This significant loss has sparked global concern, there is an urgent need for sustainable approaches to reduce food waste or to propose an economical route for its utilization. Major concerns associated with its improper management include environmental degradation and the exacerbation of greenhouse gases. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the recent advances in measures to minimize food waste (FW) and its chemical and biotransformation into valuable products. Food waste comprises mainly carbohydrates, proteins, and oils; the former two components are commonly used as microbial feedstock, leaving behind the residual oil fraction which poses a greater environmental risk. Microbial transformation of these hydrophobic materials present in food waste into value-added products proves to be a sustainable and economical strategy. Thus, this study proposes an integrated biorefinery strategy for holistic valorization of FW, whereby all its components were used to produce value-added compounds such as biofuels, bioplastics, nutraceuticals, and biomaterials using microbial biocatalysis. Compared to conventional methods, an integrated biorefinery will be more sustainable and uplift the microbial processes by switching from ‘pure’ to food waste-derived substrates and thereby pave ways to achieve ‘green’ transition."
pub.1150355553,Marine microalgae as sustainable feedstock for multi-product biorefineries,"Marine microalgae accumulate numerous compounds with commercial value including carotenoids, proteins, biopolymers, and lipids, making them attractive feedstocks to produce diverse bioproducts including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, animal feed, and biofuel. With the emerging concepts of “Blue Economy” and “Blue Biotechnology”, marine microalgae can be employed to achieve sustainability in numerous industries. Nonetheless, microalgae-based production processes are still not considered economically feasible owing to the high costs associated with cultivation and biomass processing. To mitigate the costs associated with the production process, the concept of marine microalgae-based biorefining has emerged where a single feedstock is employed to produce several distinct bioproducts, each with commercial value. Marine microalgae-based biorefineries could be made economically feasible by incorporating both high-value and low-value bio-compounds in the production line, whereas utilization of wastewater and flue gases as alternative nutrient sources for the cultivation can make the process more sustainable. Nonetheless, several challenges are associated with marine microalgae-based biorefinery, which necessitate the attention of future researchers to make this concept a reality. Hence, the present review provides a comprehensive discussion on the biorefinery of marine microalgae in view of producing diverse metabolites using a single feedstock while providing valuable insight into the directions of future research."
pub.1035536419,Supply Chain Optimisation of Nipa-based bioethanol industry in Thailand,"Environmental concerns on greenhouse gases (GHG) and energy security are two of the main drivers of Thailand’s national energy policy mandating the bioenergy roles within their national energy portfolio. Currently approximately 60% of the oil consumption in Thailand is dependent on imports which is projected to rise to 95% by 2035 (IEA, 2013). Being one of the most GHG-intensive economies in South East Asia (IEA, 2013), the Thai authorities have announced in 2012 their Alternative Energy Development Plan including biofuel directive (Haema, 2012), setting ambitious energy and biofuel targets (9ML bioethanol/day by 2021). This study presents a multi-objective optimization modelling framework configured to account for the economic and environmental impacts of a supply chain (SC) based on a mangrove-type feedstock, the Nipa palm. Nipa plantations are very demanding with respect to cultivation conditions thus constrained to coastline locations which need to be taken into account in SC design. To tackle this issue, a spatially-explicit multi-period mixed integer linear programming model was developed from scratch using the AIMMS platform in order to achieve optimal design of the biofuel SC at the cultivation, infrastructure, operation and transportation stages. The Nipa plantation, bioethanol production data was derived from the past and on-going research projects carried out at PSU as well as the primary inventory collected from field investigations. The model is capable of providing optimal configurations for a given bioenergy SC design, as well as providing an adjustable framework to address policy impacts at a large scale. The model functionality is demonstrated via a Thai Nipa-derived biofuel case study with a current national bioethanol demand and 2021 production target of 1.2 ML/day and 9 ML/day respectively. The Nipa feedstock is chosen to fulfil a fraction of this target demand. The carbon prices assumed in the case study for the 2010s, 2020s, 2030s are 20 £/tCO2, 25 £/tCO2 then 30 £/tCO2 respectively. The total area allocated to Nipa plantation for 2010-2030 varies between 1200 and 8800ha. The total decadal SC costs are dominated by bioethanol production (79%). Nipa plantation, infrastructure, and transport stages overall contribute to 21% of total SC costs. It gives valuable insights on the implementation of the SC of a new alternative crop, which is required to support the development of advanced biofuels towards a more sustainable energy market."
pub.1045492544,Sustainable green solvents and techniques for lipid extraction from microalgae: A review,"Energy security is a serious concern for a sustainable economy where it has necessitated alternative renewable energy that can have the potential to meet the futuristic needs. Among renewable energies, carbon neutral biofuels from microalgae appear to be a promising move towards sustainability and cleaner fuels owing to its attributes of high CO2-sequestering capability, high lipid productivity and being easily cultivable in an open pond and waste/marine/brackish water. However, the commercial viability of algae-based fuels suffers mainly from the cost incurred during the process. Among the steps involved in the biodiesel production from microalgae, lipid extraction in particular consumes not only a significant amount of energy and time but also causes environmental contamination by usage of toxic solvents. Conventional solvents used in lipid extraction process may further aggravate the quality of the product by dissolving other compounds like chlorophyll that may lead to erroneous results of lipid content. To circumvent the problem, green solvents and process intensification methods/techniques (green extraction technologies) potentially improve the characteristics of energy reduction, eco-friendliness, non-toxicity and efficient lipid extraction. Hence, this review focuses on the prospects of green solvents and extraction techniques that could improve the commercial viability of biodiesel production."
pub.1014038382,Response of switchgrass yield to future climate change,"A climate envelope approach was used to model the response of switchgrass, a model bioenergy species in the United States, to future climate change. The model was built using general additive models (GAMs), and switchgrass yields collected at 45 field trial locations as the response variable. The model incorporated variables previously shown to be the main determinants of switchgrass yield, and utilized current and predicted 1 km climate data from WorldClim. The models were run with current WorldClim data and compared with results of predicted yield obtained using two climate change scenarios across three global change models for three time steps. Results did not predict an increase in maximum switchgrass yield but showed an overall shift in areas of high switchgrass productivity for both cytotypes. For upland cytotypes, the shift in high yields was concentrated in northern and north-eastern areas where there were increases in average growing season temperature, whereas for lowland cultivars the areas where yields were projected to increase were associated with increases in average early growing season precipitation. These results highlight the fact that the influences of climate change on switchgrass yield are spatially heterogeneous and vary depending on cytotype. Knowledge of spatial distribution of suitable areas for switchgrass production under climate change should be incorporated into planning of current and future biofuel production. Understanding how switchgrass yields will be affected by future changes in climate is important for achieving a sustainable biofuels economy."

Recent studies report that anaerobic digestion (AD) is an efficient alternative technology that combines biofuel production with sustainable waste management, and various technological trends exist in the biogas industry that enhance the production and quality of biogas. Further investments in AD are expected to meet with increasing success due to the low cost of available feedstocks and the wide range of uses for biogas (i.e., for heating, electricity, and fuel).

Thereby, aiming to contribute to sustainable processes capable of mitigating the effects resulting from this process, biofuels have been intensively researched, produced and used in recent years. Among the possibilities, dimethyl ether (DME) stands out with great prospects replacing liquefied petroleum gas and diesel due to its potential as clean fuel. This work aims to conjoin the production of DME, a biofuel with great prospects for technical performance, safety, and economy, with a favorable destination for vinasse, the most worrying residue of ethanol production, due to its high polluting potential and large production volume in several countries. A rigorous and robust simulation of direct synthesis of DME from vinasse-derived syngas is performed using Aspen Hysys and its supplements, evaluating the technical and economic aspects of its production in ethanol distilleries. Results of the proposed scenario point that the process is technically feasible, reaching a purity of 99.9%, respecting the minimum required by standard norms. In addition, the designed process achieved yields of 1 kg of DME for each 1.6 kg of syngas. The simulated process presented a total capital cost of 47.1 millions of dollars, operating costs of 14.1 millions of dollars per year, and utilities cost of 11.2 millions of dollars per year. Considering energy cogeneration, an economy of 9.2% was reached, resulting in a production cost of simulated stage of 98.36 US$/tonne of DME and, considering a complete scenario, an accumulated cost of 233.48 US$/tonne of DME. It demonstrates an economic competitiveness for the DME price and ensures a considerable profit margin for the process. Consequently, the investigated DME production scenario emerges as a promising diesel substitute in a realistic scenario.Graphical Abstract."
pub.1122597241,22 Bioconversion of marine waste biomass for biofuel and value-added products recovery,"The use of fossil fuels could soon go beyond its rapid decline as researchers found that bioproducts such as bioenergy and biorefinery can be made from waste biomass extracted from seaweed and fishery used in the marine environment. Various biomass of marine waste over its usage could be turned into bio-based products (bioenergy, edible, nonedible products), as an alternative source of fossil fuel, which emit huge quantities of greenhouse gases which then contribute to the carbon footprint. Many researchers and policy makers are focusing on biotransformation of marine waste into high-valued feed stocks such as ethanol, biomethane, which are used in products such as biofuels. The seaweed waste typically contains alginate, and fishery waste comprises high protein. These raw materials are used in many industries—alginate in the production of cosmetics, proteins for making foodstuffs. These bio-based processes are sustainable and create zero waste as the solid by-product can be useful too in other (e.g., fertilizer production) processes, which is cheap and environmentally friendly which in turn reduce the circular economy gap. This present chapter will provide deeper knowledge on biotransformation of marine waste into various bio-based products. In connection to these, the future perspective of the biorefinery concept using marine waste will be discussed for identifying a promising way to overcome the practical difficulty."
pub.1166581123,Sustainable valorization of waste glycerol into bioethanol and biodiesel through biocircular approaches: a review,"Liquid biofuels like biodiesel and bioethanol are crucial in the transition to low-carbon and high-energy alternatives to fossil fuels. One significant by-product of biodiesel production is glycerol, which accounts for about 10% of the total conversion output. While waste glycerol poses challenges due to its impurities and contaminants, it also holds potential as a metabolic resource for essential cellular components in microorganisms. Crude glycerol production is reviewed, highlighting relevance in current biodiesel technologies and its biochemical composition. To efficiently utilize waste glycerol, co-valorization with low-cost substrates through biocircular platforms using various microorganisms or insects for second and third-generation oxy-biofuels has been explored. Among these, the black soldier fly larvae have demonstrated higher competitiveness for lipid contents (35–43%), making them a promising organism for recycling waste glycerol into biodiesel production, alongside microalgae and oleaginous yeast. The microbial biodiesel productivity from oleaginous yeast is notably higher (3546 kg ha−1 y−1) than soybean biodiesel (562 kg ha−1 y−1), while microalgal biodiesel productivity surpasses palm biodiesel by more than 25 times. Remarkably, black soldier fly larvae biodiesel productivity was reported to be ~ 1.7 times higher than microalgae and an impressive ~ 43 times higher than palm biodiesel. Despite their potential for biodiesel production, waste glycerol from biodiesel industry still represents a challenge because of high impurities, high viscosity, and limited direct applications in existing processes. To further enhance energy sustainability and address the challenge of waste glycerol, biocircular platforms are discussed for waste glycerol utilization with domestic wastewater sludge, lignocellulosic biomass, and protein-rich wastes. These platforms offer opportunities to create other sustainable agricultural products while minimizing their environmental footprint."
pub.1008662834,Biosecurity and sustainability within the growing global bioeconomy,"Crop-based biofuel production has grown exponentially, driven by government policy interventions to achieve national targets and venture capital investments. This urgency may compromise the biosecurity of these and future agricultural production systems such as the development of new bioindustry-focused GM crops for high value industrial and pharmaceutical compounds. Energy security and prospects of a future emission-constrained economy are driving these developments of novel non-food crops and varieties in new areas, coupled with domestic agricultural and innovation policies and responses to recent and potential future crude oil pricing. New species and varieties are now being commercially fostered around the world also because of their potential to reinvigorate the global agro-forestry industries. The vanguard of the first, second and third generation biofuel solutions are in various stages of production. Their true dollar and carbon-based economic viability is unclear due to government subsidies along the value chain, and some crop-production systems are failing commercially and environmentally due to limited consideration of associated agronomic biosecurity problems. Novel crops in current production systems and new regions can also pose significant invasion threats to human health, agriculture, biodiversity and natural ecosystem services through firstly, uncontrolled allergen and toxicity-associated impacts on human well-being; secondly, abandoned trial plantings of uneconomic varieties; and thirdly, feral individuals (or invasive species) from economically viable plantations invading agricultural and natural landscapes. Novel crops will also have suites of pests, weeds and diseases that will impact pest management systems in neighbouring crops. To avoid this we need landscape scale sustainable integrated pest management systems that ensure the triple-bottom-line production viability requirements of the 21st century. This introductory paper summarises the new global bioeconomy and the international policy opportunities and challenges for sustainable development that it encompasses. We then introduce the biosecurity issues covered by this issue of Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability from a research, policy and industrial perspective."

The estimated theoretical energy potential of biochar and bio-oil were 208,107,180 MJ and 190,205,438 MJ, equivalent to 3,729,518.4 tons of coconut husks. Thus, this study brings as a novelty a new feedstock associated with bioprocess technological models that will pave sustainable avenues for the development of biorefineries, offering a sustainable green option to produce bioproducts and bioenergy. In the proposed model, the wastes are valorized using various processes addressing economy."
pub.1144518553,"Plasma-electrolytic liquefaction of human waste for biofuels production and recovery of ammonium, chlorine and metals","Sustainable production of value-added fuels and chemicals from biomass faces enormous challenges for integration in zero-carbon-emissions technologies and circular economy. In this work, green and renewable solvents, polyethylene glycol 200 and glycerol, were used in a plasma-electrolytic liquefaction (PEL) system to electrically liquefy human feces in the absence of a catalyst. It is demonstrated that the plasma ignition during the liquefaction accelerated the conversion of feces (85.67% liquefaction yield within 12 min), and the intrinsic heating features of the PEL greatly reduced the energy consumption. The obtained biocrude oil at the optimized conditions contained 10.53% aldehydes, 5.39% ketones, 18.48% cyclic oxygen-containing compounds and others, with a high heating value of 28.10 MJ/kg. Further analysis of the PEL-converted products reveals that most of the chlorine in the feces was gasified, the metals were extracted into the solid residue, while ammonia was released. An evaluation of the developed plasma electrolytic feces liquefaction process was carried out and favorably compared with common liquefaction methods.Overall, the proposed approach may provide a new avenue for clean chemical production and sustainable resource recovery from human waste under benign process conditions."

pub.1139799611,Land use change: the barrier for sugarcane sustainability,"Abstract Bioethanol production in Brazil gained momentum in the 1970s and 1980s as an energy security and energy sufficiency measure due to the well‐known world oil crisis. However, the increase in bioethanol production and consumption in the past couple of decades has been backed by the country's efforts and measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transport sector. Brazil is the second largest producer of biofuels, and its production continues to increase because of the commitments made in the Paris Agreement in 2015. This study reviews several key policies designed to develop Brazilian bioethanol production and to protect the environment. It is argued that many of these policies do not consider land use change or encourage land protection to achieve sustainable land use and agricultural production. Thus, this work aims to understand the importance and impacts of public policies in expanding sugarcane in Brazil in the past 34 years, with regard to land use and native vegetation. The discussion in this paper addresses the inadequacy of current policies to avoid direct and indirect land use change caused by sugarcane expansion, despite incentives such as 17 Sustainable Development Goals from the United Nations and certification schemes. The data presented indicate an indirect effect caused by the expansion of sugarcane over pasture areas, which leads to further clearing of natural vegetation to establish new pasture areas. Ultimately, this study addresses the importance of zero deforestation in Brazil, regardless of the crop that causes the conversion. Without conjoint efforts by all sectors of the economy to curtail deforestation, the sustainability of producing biofuels is not guaranteed, as the emissions caused by deforestation will not be offset by the lower GHG emissions obtained by using ethanol as a transport fuel. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"

Via respiration, acetic acid bacteria can oxidize biomass ethanol into acetic acid using membrane-bound alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ADH and AlDH, respectively). Focusing on the ability of these enzymes to interact directly and electrically with electrode materials, we constructed a mediatorless bioanode for ethanol oxidation based on a direct electron transfer (DET)-type bienzymatic cascade by ADH and AlDH. The three-dimensional structural data of ADH and AlDH elucidated by cryo-electron microscopy were valuable for effectively designing electrode platforms with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and pyrene (Py) derivatives. DET-type bioelectrocatalysis by ADH and AlDH was improved by using 1-pyrene carboxylic acid-functionalized MWCNTs. The catalytic current densities for bienzymatic ethanol oxidation were recorded at the bioanodes modified by various ADH/AlDH ratios. The reaction model was constructed by focusing on the competitive adsorption of two enzymes on the electrode surface and the collection efficiency of the intermediately produced acetaldehyde. The power output of an ethanol/air biofuel cell using the bienzymatic bioanode reached 0.48 ± 0.01 mW cm–2, which is the highest value reported for ethanol biofuel cells. In addition, the Faraday efficiency of acetate production by the cell reached 100 ± 4%. This study will lead to efficient conversion of biomass fuels based on a multi-catalytic cascade system."

Present energy demand is mainly fulfilled via the limited fossil resources, which has a perilous influence on the environment, and therefore, there is an urgent necessity for carbon-neutral energy resources. Owing to the metabolic flexibility, microalgae have gained significant consideration for the biorefinery concept. Microalgal-derived resources have a vast and propitious implementation in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, renewable energy, and cosmetics. Microalgal cultivation has an extensive opportunity conversed in this communiqué. With the incipient progressions in current biotechnology, the prime emphasis is to develop microalgae to produce cost-effective high-value-added bio-renewables (HVABs). Microalgae have received substantial attention in emerging supportable substitutions. Microalgae belong to varied families and are utilized to generate biofuel feedstocks.

It is believed that there are 100,000,000 times more microbial cells on Earth than stars in the observable universe! They are involved in various ecological activities, such as production, decomposition, and fixation. Through symbiotic connections with other creatures, they can indirectly affect the environment. Furthermore, microbial activities can be co-opted for biodegradation or bioremediation of residential, agricultural, and industrial wastes, making microbial ecology research especially significant for biotechnological and environmental applications.An increasing wave of global environmentalism is pressuring us to make greener products using green technologies. Going green in technology with the help of microorganisms, as a whole, can cause transformation at nearly every stage of the value chain.In this chapter, we will be discussing the microbial role in preserving ecology. Working together, industries and governments have developed solutions such as the Green New Deal, the use of bio-based products such as biosensors, biopesticides, biofertilizers, biorefinery, biopharmaceuticals, green building materials, bio-based membrane filters for removing pollutants, bioenergy, and biofuels, which are critical for the green recovery of world economies."

Therefore, technologies are demanded by the society for a sustainable and environmental friendly economy. The biotechnological use of sugar-based feedstocks to produce valuable products are in conflict with, for example, food production. In order to overcome this issue, waste products such as syngas (H2, CO and CO2) or CO2 taken from the atmosphere are of increasing interest for biotechnological applications. Acetogenic bacteria are already used at industrial scale to produce sustainable and environmentally friendly biofuels from syngas. A promising candidate due to its physiological flexibility is the thermophilic acetogen Moorella thermoacetica. In contrast to most acetogens M. thermoacetica is not restricted to one energy conserving system. In addition to the Ech complex, cytochromes and quinones maybe involved in energy conservation by, for example, DMSO respiration. The extra energy conserved can be used to form highly valuable but energy demanding products.

pub.1135468038,Biorefinery: Potential and Prospects for Utilisation of Biogenic Waste,"The biorefinery is considered as a sustainable way of converting different feedstocks into energy-rich products, chemicals and value-added products through a well-established conversion technology. The biorefinery concept emerged with the purpose of efficient utilisation of biomass, waste biovalorization and at the same time to minimise the environmental impacts of waste management. Biorefinery technology enables the production of biomass-derived bioenergy, biofuels and development of circular bioeconomy. The bio-based economy has the potential to mitigate climate change and to achieve sustainable development goals. Biorefining technology refers to the conversion of biomass through processes such as pre-treatment, conversion and processing of products. Biorefinery technology enables thermochemical or biochemical conversion of biomass into bioenergy, biofuels and value-added products. Biorefineries generate low-volume but high-value products and high-volume but low-value products. The biorefineries are classified based on the feedstocks used, conversion processes, platforms or key intermediate products and target products. The feedstocks utilised in the biorefinery are diverse and the sustainability of the biorefinery system depends on (a) availability and characteristics of feedstocks, (b) environmental impacts of feedstock production, (c) amenability and suitability of feedstock for bioconversion and (d) feedstock bioconversion and its contribution to greenhouse gases intensity and energy balance. The feedstocks include “lignocellulosic biomass”, “food wastes”, “algal biomass”, “municipal solid waste”, etc. Based on the feedstocks used, the biorefineries are called as lignocellulosic biorefinery, waste biorefinery, algal biorefinery, etc. However, lignocellulosic waste biorefineries are well studied for its potential and prospects. It gained prominence on account of (a) availability of lignocellulosic waste feedstocks; (b) sustainability of the feedstocks; and (c) diverse value-added chemicals generated from the bioconversion of lignocellulosic waste biomass. The success of biorefineries and development of bio-based industries requires positive intervention from the government in the form of proactive bioeconomy policy."
pub.1136326407,Socio-Economic Determinants of Household Continued Use of Solid Biofuels (Fuelwood and Charcoal) for Cooking Purposes in Sub-Saharan Africa- Kenya’s Situation,"Solid biofuels (fuelwood and charcoal) remain the primary source of household cooking energy in Kenya. This has negatively impacted forest resources, people’s health, local climate patterns, and the country’s economy. Understanding the determinants of household use of these traditional energy resources is useful in the designing of policies and strategies aimed at facilitating energy transitions towards clean options. The current study evaluated the role of socio-economic factors in the determination of household use of fuelwood and charcoal for cooking purposes in Kenya. A desk study was conducted using the 2015/2016 Kenya Integrated household budget survey data published by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). Stepwise multiple regression using SPSS was run to determine how household size, female household headship, lack of education among household heads, ownership of housing unit, modern housing, access to credit, access to cash transfers, shock to household welfare, and household level of expenditure affect household utilisation of fuelwood and charcoal for cooking purposes. Results of the regression show that household ownership of a housing unit has a significant positive influence on household utilisation of fuelwood for cooking purposes. Access to credit has a significant negative influence on household charcoal utilisation, while both household expenditure beyond $71 and lack of education among household heads have a significant negative influence on household utilisation of fuelwood and a significant positive influence on household utilisation of charcoal. Therefore, the government of Kenya through its relevant authorities and agencies has a crucial role to play in ensuring that these socio-economic determinants of household use of solid biofuels are addressed. This is achievable through re-strategising, re-designing and designing policies aimed at facilitating households’ transition to clean energy alternatives and sustainable development."
pub.1050367095,Sustainable Bioenergy Production - An Integrated Approach,"This book focuses primarily on the advantages and implications of sustainable bioenergy production in terms of ensuring a more sustainable world despite its growing energy demands. It addresses a new concept that focuses on the interactions between different uses of agricultural land (for example, agriculture for food, forage or energy and nature conservation) and their ecological, economic and societal impacts. This research concept provides new insights into the competition for resources and the synergies between different land uses. Until recently, the transition towards renewable energy has been generally misunderstood as only an economic demand, rather than as a means to gain various social and ecological advantages. Today biomass can be produced to generate energy and renewable raw materials, while simultaneously benefitting soil resources, water resources and biodiversity. The transition to a ‘greener’ economy is an important precondition in order to achieve the sustainable development of societies. To develop a modern, forward-looking energy supply from biomass, such as biomass for heat and power generation, and liquid biofuels for transport, there should be a balance between the amount of biomass required for food production and for material purposes. Crop types, production methods and conversion technologies need to be matched with local conditions within the different landscapes to establish a national transformation plan, and to reduce the i ncreasing land-use competition between food/fodder versus energy crop production, as well as the use of forests for energy. Rethinking the linkages between bioenergy, climate change, land use and water requires an integrated assessment of the energy, land and water nexus. This book highlights research aimed at providing an integrated approach to sustainable bioenergy development and seeks to improve people’s understanding of bioenergy’s potentials for the future. It will be of interest not only to those involved in sustainable energy, but also to environmental planners, agriculture and soil specialists, and environmental policy-makers."
pub.1107827699,The Greening of the Pulp and Paper Industry: Sweden in Comparative Perspective,"Since the 1960s, the pulp and paper industry (PPI) has developed from being considered one of the greatest polluters of the twentieth century to an industry that is in the lead in the transition towards a more sustainable, bio-based economy. This chapter covers the environmentally driven transformation of the PPI by focusing on the transition in one country, namely Sweden, which has pioneered parts of this transition. The chapter illustrates that the overall transition towards cleaner and more energy efficient production technologies is the result of long-term and incremental processes, starting in the early twentieth century. The development gained momentum with the environmental awaking in the 1960s followed by stricter environmental regulations, while the oil crisis in the 1970s pushed for energy substitution of oil with biofuels. Unlike the PPI in countries like Finland and the US, the Swedish PPI aimed at in-plant process changes rather than end-of-pipe technologies to control pollution from the start. This strategy, along with extensive industry wide R&D collaborations, enabled Swedish firms to take the lead in developing elemental chlorine free (ECF) and total chlorine free (TCF) pulp from the late 1980s. Furthermore, from the mid-1980s green consumerism came to function as an additional driver, while the issue of climate change was an impetus to the development of cellulose based biofuels in the twenty-first century."
pub.1151299633,Environmental and economic issues for renewable production of bio-jet fuel: A global prospective,"Given how quickly the aviation sector is growing, it is crucial to find sustainable ways to supply the demand. Modern technological developments and the creation of alternative jet fuels are crucial elements that could help eliminate greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO2 emissions. Traditional jet fuel produces a sizable amount of GHG emissions, which has raised concern on a global scale. Compared to conventional jet fuel, biofuel is thought to be more renewable and less polluting. Biojet fuels might work as an effective substitute. The varieties of bio jet fuel, manufacturing procedures (including alcohol-to-jet, oil-to-jet, syngas-to-jet, and sugar-to-jet ways), existing regulations, and the effects of bio jet fuels on the environment and the economy are all covered in length in this overview. These are the techniques that are most frequently used to create bio-jet fuel from both edible and inedible feedstock. The main conclusions of this review indicate that the most popular method for producing biofuel is hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA). The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) approaches cost more to install even though they produce fewer GHGs. Environmentally beneficial and technologically advanced, second-generation biofuels are a great choice. It has been revealed that jatropha is a crop that produces a lot of energy. The price of feedstock and the lack of bio-jet fuel are the two biggest obstacles to substituting conventional fuel. To increase the power and quality of energy, further in-depth research on optimal feedstocks is necessary. In order to address the needs of both commercial and military aircraft, biomass jet fuel has a lot of potential to replace conventional jet fuel. High yield should be one of the properties of the feedstock without affecting food production."

In this study, a Fish Waste-based Eco-Industrial Park (FWEIP) model is developed in an attempt to convert the linear economy in existing fish waste management into a circular economy model. Process Graph (P-graph) is used for combinatorial optimization to synthesize optimal FWEIP with the consideration of economic and environmental aspects. The model favors the production of biofuel using the gasification process (Rank 1) with a promising economic benefit of $2.28 million/y without proposing circular synergy within the FWEIP ecosystem. On the other hand, suboptimal solutions—suboptimal 1 (black soldier fly (BSF)) and suboptimal 2 (pyrolysis and gasification) solutions—exhibit gross profit of 17.98% and 24.12% lower than that of the optimal solution. Both suboptimal solutions offer greater circularity with self-sustaining resources (e.g., fish feed, chitosan, and energy). The sensitivity analysis indicates the potential debottlenecking of suboptimal 2 with the use of a catalyst to improve the conversion of bio-oil in the pyrolysis pathway and exhibits a gross profit of 22.54% higher than that of the optimal solution. Following the Shapley-Shubik power index analysis, the hydroponics facility is identified as the pivotal player for both optimal and suboptimal 2 cases with the exception of suboptimal 1 indicating both BSF and hydroponics as a pivotal player. In brief, this research provides the fish waste-based industry with insights and strategies for the implementation of a circular economy as a step toward sustainable development."

Therefore, waste is a cheaper renewable source for bioproduct production to reduce the externalities of the commodities market and achieve economic development and well-being without depending on fossil or mineral sources. Hence, the valorization of food waste in the circular economy as a feedstock would reduce the use of conventional food commodities such as cane, cereals, soybean, beet, and oilseeds for human consumption and animal feed, in addition to reducing the deforestation for new farmland, energy, water, and environmental impacts on air, water, soil, and ecosystems derived from the production, pretreatment, handling, transportation and transformation, and the cost of achieving feasible production processes also solve the issue of waste disposal. Because the landfill disposal of this organic waste can be difficult, it is a primary concern for environmental pollution due to degradation. This chapter reviews the state of the art of technological frameworks with regard to the physicochemical properties of food waste and use with conventional treatments, use in biorefineries to produce food, feed, biofertilizers, fiber, biofuel, bioproducts, and the value chain, and socio-economic and environmental impacts according to the circular bioeconomy with the life cycle assessment approach toward sustainable production.

pub.1154631292,"Water reclamation from palm oil mill effluent (POME): Recent technologies, by-product recovery, and challenges","Water scarcity will continue to be a global challenge in the coming years as long as sustainable solutions remain far-fetched. It has become necessary to improve the efficiency of water circulation to reduce the net demand in high water consumption sectors such as agriculture. In palm oil industry, the extraction of crude palm oil from oil palm fruit bunch requires a large amount of water, half of which is discharged as palm oil mill effluent (POME) that is considered a high strength wastewater. The current trend of POME research focuses on moving from conventional open-ponding treatment to an integrated zero-discharge system for better effluent management. In this review, the attempts taken by researchers in laboratory and pilot scale were highlighted to achieve an effluent of high-quality water from POME that can be used as drinking water or recycled as boiler water in the palm oil production process. Membrane technology has recently emerged as one of the most promising separation techniques having a broad spectrum of applications including POME treatment. Furthermore, water reclamation technique involving evaporation can split POME solids and recover clean water in a more sustainable and space-saving manner. Additionally, recovery of by-product, such as biofertilizer and biofuels, is necessary to overcome the cost of the treatment. As a whole, in spite of several challenges, water reclamation from POME can be considered economically feasible system from techno-economic analysis perspective and it can feasibly shift the adopted industrial method from a linear take-use-discharge economy approach to a circular economy by keeping water in circulation."

pub.1114029413,国際食料需給の現状と環境問題,"In recent years, the global economies have been faced with steeply rising prices. The members of World Bank and the United Nations including WFP (World Food Program) appeal to the world for necessary food emergency aid programs so that people in poverty might be prevented from being troubled by food shortages. Developed countries, such as Japan, the EU and the United States, comply with the world demand. One of the causes of the steeply rising price of food are the money inflow into the commodity futures market from the oil market and the investment market for housing at the United States. The changing food demand of BRICs, in which Brazil, Russia, India and China are involved, and emerging economies is the biggest factor of steep rising price of food. This will bring the structural change into the world food market.  The fourth report of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) indicates the possibility of drought, temporary flooding, water shortage and transition of suitable land on agricultural production in the future. Agricultural production is not only carried through under these global environmental problems but also the effects of agricultural production on the global environment have to be minimized.  The aim of this paper is to consider the possibility of attaining the sustainable agricultural production, which may minimize the influence of agricultural production on the global environment and which may keep pace with changing food demand and population increase by reviewing present studies, especially those focusing on biofuels and water issues. The sustainability science perspective is appropriated in order to consider the shape of sustainable agricultural production."
pub.1148300607,Redefining the role of microalgae in industrial wastewater remediation,"The use of microalgae for wastewater treatment is neither very new, nor a novel concept, but is understood to play a defining role in all industrial, agricultural and municipal wastewater disposal and treatment. The major advantage of phycoremediation stems from the fact that microalgae strains are capable of withstanding extremely harsh environments, which present-day industrial and municipal wastes tend to possess. The changing global outlook towards a circular bio-economy relying more on resource diversification has also led the traditional wastewater treatment processes to restructure to a low-carbon, integrated bio-refinery concept, to accommodate several waste streams. It has been well accepted among researchers regarding microalgal wastewater remediation that the meteoric rise in the interest for this area of application can be understood from the altered face of treatment. Alternatively, since the major bottlenecks of simultaneous effective nutrient assimilation and high microalgae population have been mitigated to a certain extent, microalgal wastewater treatment is now a serious contender to conventional wastewater treatment. The development in comprehensively and elaboratively characterizing effective microalgal strains for sustainable remediation has been focused, besides drawing comparisons with traditional tertiary wastewater treatment approaches. It deals more with the capability of microalgal strains to work on the toxic waste products from industrial applications in addition to assimilating non-optimum nutrient bases and conditions. Henceforth, the article dwells on the prospect of using the microalgal biomass generated to produce biofuels, bio-fertilizers, and other bio-products integral to the biorefinery concept. An important part of this work is therefore to understand the importance of microalgae in the circular bio-economy strategy with the future outlook microalgae-based waste-water remediation holds for the sustainable energy portfolio."

pub.1129604215,Chapter 29 The bioeconomy of microalgae-based processes and products,"Algae and seaweed products have great potential to contribute significantly to a number of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, such as food security, good health, clean energy, industry innovation, and responsible production. This chapter is structured in four main sections and takes a macroeconomics perspective to explore the contribution of algae and seaweeds to sustainable economic growth. In the first section, the concepts and definitions of bioeconomy, blue economy, and circular economy are introduced. These concepts particularly fit the context in which algae and seaweed products are developed, as they are sustainably sourced and they enter varied industrial processes as intermediate inputs or by-products. The second section presents the complex portfolio of current and future applications of algae and seaweeds across and between main industrial sectors. The majority of the current products obtained from algae and seaweeds consist of high-value compounds for food, feed, pharmaceuticals, and cosmeceuticals, but innovative applications for biofuels, biofertilizers, and green chemicals are rapidly evolving. The third section discusses the supply chain characteristics, the vertical integration, and the market context in which producers of algae biomass and products operate. The fourth section presents macroeconomic data and indicators of production, trade, and comparative advantage of algae products and biomass. The availability of public data is quite limited. The EU is currently the main provider of data due to its bioeconomy strategy, RD investments, and comparative advantage in producing algae and seaweed products. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the current technological and policy challenges to foster the role of algae in the bioeconomy, and highlights the need for more accurate data for thorough economic analyses and policy evaluation."
pub.1174347649,Challenges and opportunities toward a sustainable bio‐based chemical sector in Europe,"Abstract The chemical sector is the fourth largest industry in the European Union (EU) and the second largest chemical producer globally. However, its global share in chemicals sales has declined from 25% two decades ago to around 14% now. The sector, which accounts for 22% of the EU industry's energy demands, faces significant challenges in mitigating climate change, reducing pollution and toxicity, and improving circularity. Biomass, a promising renewable feedstock, currently represents only 3% of the sector's feedstocks. This review explores the opportunities and challenges for a bio‐based chemical sector in the EU, particularly plastics, to improve circularity and contribute to climate neutrality, reduction of pollution and toxicity. It provides an overview of current fossil‐based feedstocks, production processes, country‐specific trends, bio‐based production, and sustainability initiatives. Exploring new feedstocks such as lignin, organic residues, and algae can increase biomass availability toward a circular bioeconomy. Integrating chemicals and plastics production into commercial pulp and power factories, biofuel plants, and the sustainable hydrogen economy could boost the sector. Hydrogen is crucial for reducing biomass's oxygen content. These can ultimately contribute to reduce climate change impacts. Designing novel chemicals and plastics to accommodate biomass's higher oxygen content, reduce toxicity, and enhance biodegradability is essential. However, plastic waste mismanagement cannot be solved by merely replacing fossil feedstocks with biomass. Sustainability initiatives can strengthen and develop a circular bio‐based chemical sector, but better management of bio‐based plastic waste and transparent labeling of bio‐based products are needed. This calls for collaborative efforts among citizens, academia, policymakers, and industry.

pub.1154578444,Techno-economic Study of Microbial Green Fuels vs Plant Fuels,"Energy transition requires the definition of an adaptable energy matrix where fossil resources are wisely used in following years, but where sustainable and renewable energy increases its contribution to the generation of electric and thermal power and also in fuels for the transport sector. Among those renewable energies, bioenergy may play a significant role through circular economy of biomass, with local and regional production of biofuels, power and bio-based chemicals and materials into a biorefinery with minimal emissions and waste streams. In order to assess the technical and economic standing of a particular scientific development and move it forward into application, the techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the production process may serve to identify scientific and technological limitations and challenges that have impact on economic and financial parameters. In this work, the advantages and challenges of biofuels from 1st to 4th generation including plant-based and microbial oils and intermediate compounds are presented and discussed as well as the technological, economic and financial issues that must be approached by TEA and its constrains. Finally, several works are presented which deal with microbial and yeast oils, the production of farnesene as an intermediate compound and finally plant-based oils. Even if microbial green fuels are less technically and economically developed than their plant source counterparts, they might represent an important opportunity to reduce dependence on agricultural and forest land, organic carbon sources, use of agrochemicals, their implications in the food-feed-water-energy nexus as well as environmental impacts and climate change. 3rd generation biofuels dealing with native microbial and yeast oils compete well with plant-based biofuels in terms of oil titer, minor need of organic carbon sources thanks to their mixotrophic or autotrophic metabolism, but scaling-up issues still remain to be solved, and TEA may help to guide such development. A systematic approach to determine and evolve the scientific and technical issues is through the techno-economic analysis, where the technical data are analyzed, customary in an engineering process scheme and the mass and energy balances are done according to the involved chemical reactions, kinetic and thermodynamic data. The present work deals with the techno-economic analysis of microbial green fuels and its comparison with plant-based biofuels. The techno-economic analysis of biomass sowing and harvesting must also be considered but this subject is out of the scope of present work. In order to assess the feasibility of microbial and plan-based fuels, techno-economic analysis is usually undertaken and will be further discussed. In order to address such studies, we will present the fundamentals of techno-economic analysis and application to literature-based cases representing microbial vs. plant-based biofuels.

pub.1173799504,Circular Economy for Biodiesel Production by Managing Wastewater Using Microalgae,"A circular economy is an economic concept that aims to reduce waste and pollution while maximizing the use of resources through sustainable cycles of production, consumption, and recycling. In biodiesel production, a circular economy can be applied by managing liquid waste (wastewater) produced from the production process through microalgal metabolic activities. A circular economy begins with utilizing wastewater generated from biodiesel production, which contains nutrients and other organic matter for microalgae growth. Microalgae can be cultured in closed (such as photobioreactors) or open (such as ponds) systems filled with wastewater. Naturally, microalgae will absorb nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon in wastewater. This process not only cleans the wastewater, but also reduces the risk of eutrophication and algal bloom, particularly if the wastewater is discharged without treatment. By absorbing nutrients from wastewater, microalgae will grow and reproduce, producing energy-rich biomass. This biomass can then be collected and further processed to produce high-value products such as biodiesel. Microalgae biomass contains lipids (fats) that can be converted into biodiesel through extraction, transesterification, and purification. The extracted lipids are then converted into methyl esters (biodiesel) with the help of a catalyst and alcohol. After lipid extraction, the remaining biomass rich in protein and carbohydrates can be used as animal feed, fertilizer, or feedstock for biogas production, thereby reducing the wastage of resources. Water treated with microalgae can be further processed to reduce the remaining pollutant content, if necessary, before being discharged into the environment or reused in industrial processes. A more efficient and environmentally friendly system can be created by implementing a microalgae-based circular economy at the production and waste treatment level. This can help reduce the negative impact of biodiesel production on the environment while creating added value from the waste generated."
pub.1176249729,Food Safety and Waste-to-Wealth Through Blue Economy,"Food safety is used as a scientific method/discipline describing handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent foodborne illnesses. These illnesses can occur as a result of hazards, whether chronic or acute, that may make food injurious to the health of the consumer. Safe, easily accessible food promotes sustainable development, food and nutrition security, trade, and tourism in any nation. The three significant sources of food are crops, livestock, and seafood. Foods from the ocean, lakes, and rivers are referred to as blue foods/seafoods, and they are crucial for attaining food security, eradicating malnutrition, and creating robust, resilient, and healthy food systems. However, reports have shown that a third of all fish that are caught are usually unused because they are thrown out due to being low value and spoiled or storage problems. Others are discarded as leftovers and by-products. Numerous as-yet-unidentified bioactive compounds found in seafood have the potential to be novel elements in commercial functional meals and pharmaceuticals. Regrettably, 50–80% of the waste or discards produced by commercial processing setups are wasted or underutilized. Bioactive peptides, collagen and gelatin, oligosaccharides, fatty acids, enzymes, calcium, water-soluble minerals, vitamins, carotenoids, chitin, chitosan, and biopolymers are just a few of the unique and useful biomolecules found in these by-products. These seafood wastes could be used in food, cosmetics, medicines, the environment, biomedicine, and biofuel. Some challenges such as pollution, infrastructure, capacity building, as well as climate change militate against blue economy. There is also need for continuous rebuilding of the marine ecosystem to ensure sustainability of the blue economy. This study reported the prospects of blue economy in converting waste to wealth."
pub.1174615087,12 Biorefinery development feedstocks derived and possible solutions for a sustainable environment,"Bio-based materials and biorefinery technologies are in high demand due to the worldwide development towards sustainability and the need to diminish reliance on fossil energies. In addition to having many positive environmental effects, sustainable bio-based materials are potential substitutes for conventional petroleum-derived goods. They also support the circular economy. This ecosystem depends on biorefineries, which economically transform renewable biomass into a variety of products with added value. An extensive analysis of the most recent developments in sustainable bio-based materials intended for use in biorefineries is provided in this chapter. First of all, it outlines the wide range of biomass feedstocks that are used in biorefineries, from algae and specialized energy crops to forestry byproducts and agricultural waste. From these substrates, biorefineries extract useful components, including sugars, lipids, lignin, and proteins, using an array of conversion methods, including biochemical, thermochemical, and hybrid processes. The use of these bio-based intermediates in the synthesis of sustainable materials thus becomes the main emphasis. Biopolymers are becoming popular options for packaging, textiles, and biomedical applications. Examples of these include polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and cellulose derivatives. In addition, lignin and its derivatives are employed in composites, adhesives, and coatings as a renewable substitute for petroleum-based counterparts. Lipid-derived chemicals also have a role in lowering dependence on non-renewable resources and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by acting as precursors for biofuels, lubricants, and surfactants. This abstract also emphasizes the importance of techno-economic analyses and process optimization to improving the sustainability and commercial feasibility of biobased materials and biorefinery operations. Using cutting-edge technologies, such as fermentation, enzymatic catalysis, and bioprocess engineering, renders the ability to use biomass resources effectively to produce high-performing bioproducts. To sum it up, sustainable bio-based materials are an essential part of the emerging bioeconomy since they provide a sustainable and ecologically responsible substitute for traditional materials. When integrated with developments in biorefinery technology, these materials have enormous potential to accelerate the shift to a future that is more resource-efficient and sustainable, characterized by a lower carbon footprint and enhanced material circularity."
pub.1163529183,Bibliometric analysis and text mining to reveal research trends on fruit by-products under circular economy strategies,"Fruit processing generates large amounts of by-products (BPs) that play a key role in the economic, social and environmental crisis. Although these residues are not usually used, they have better nutritional and bioactive value than the edible part. Considering that the circular economy is a sustainable approach to promote a zero waste processing system, the objective of this study was to use bibliometric analysis and data mining to provide a body of knowledge on trends in the field of research on fruit BPs under circular economy strategies. The publication of the SDGs has stimulated the adoption of circular economy strategies to use fruit BPs, which was reflected in the growth of scientific production since 2015. Although it is suggested that the field of study is at an exponential stage, development is limited by the lack of regulatory instruments to regulate the use of fruit BPs. The authorship analysis showed that over time a large number of authors have participated in scientific production and several research groups were formed, but temporarily. However, it is expected that the rise of this field will attract the attention and permanence of the authors. At the country level, the European Union leads in scientific production with outstanding socioeconomic and cultural benefits, which is slowly being replicated in developing countries. Keyword analysis showed that the main trend is the green recovery of high-value compounds. To meet other needs, other trends include the use of fruit BPs to develop functional ingredients, compost, biofuel, packaging materials and for water treatment. Information on the challenges of using these residues was also included. The results will serve as a basis for researchers, entrepreneurs and policy makers in the transition to the circular economy to contribute to sustainability."
pub.1164749713,Chapter 20 Water hyacinth biomass valorization: fostering biodiversity and sustainable development in the bioeconomy,"A shift towards using sustainable energy resources in the form of bioenergy, generated using biomass, has been currently the main focus of developing economies around the globe. Biomass is the main resource of the bioeconomy, yet the current biomass supply chain for different green initiatives is frequently unsustainable, not economically viable in the long run, or simply unavailable and non-diverse. An ideal component of bioeconomy should be present all across the globe all year round to facilitate a viable supply-demand cycle with high biodiversity and availability. One such resource is a unique floating invasive aquatic weed, Water Hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes). It is one of the most invasive aquatic weeds having a global presence due to its high proliferation rate and high adaptability to different environmental conditions across the globe. Water hyacinth biomass is nutrient-rich and can be a great source of lignocellulosic biomass to be used as feed material for biofuel and/or bioenergy production, as a major component of bioeconomy, among other applications. The problem, at present, is there is a lack of sustainable use options for the water hyacinth biomass, and it is often seen as an infestation more than a potential solution, frequently dumped near the infested water bodies after extraction or controlled using chemical methods. The rapid release of ammonia and other foul-smelling substances from this rotting biomass causes local nuisance. This rich source of biomass is thus presently highly under-utilized and under-managed. Biochemical, thermochemical, and physio-chemical conversion of water hyacinth biomass could solve multi-dimensional problems of current bioeconomic challenges. Encompassing the biodiversity and availability of such a resource is critically important through successful collection, treatment, and sustainable utilization. Water hyacinths can provide answers to the growing biomass demand for bioenergy production. Such waste-to-wealth initiatives foster a green bioeconomy and substantially contribute to sustainable development goals."

pub.1181962401,Circularity of Biomass Feedstock to Produce Ethanol and Feasibility of Ethanol-Gasoline Fuel Blends in Engine,"To address the growing gap between energy demand and availability, the need for biofuels has become increasingly urgent. Biofuels offer a renewable energy source while significantly reducing or even eliminating net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Ethanol, commonly produced through biomass fermentation, has emerged as a promising alternative to gasoline due to its advantageous combustion properties, including a high octane rating and inherent oxygen content. Despite its expanding use, a key research gap exists in evaluating the compatibility of internal combustion engines with ethanol or ethanol-gasoline blends, particularly regarding performance and emission outcomes. This study seeks to bridge that gap by examining engine performance and emissions using various ethanol-gasoline blends (E0, E5, E10, E15, and E20), while adhering to circular economy principles by utilizing food waste for bioethanol production. The research questions center on how these different ethanol blends impact engine power, thermal efficiency, and emissions. The goal is to identify the optimal ethanol blend that enhances engine performance while reducing harmful emissions. The results demonstrate that adding ethanol improves combustion efficiency, leading to increased brake power and brake thermal efficiency. Peak performance was recorded with a 15% ethanol blend (E15), after which a decline was observed. Additionally, a notable decrease in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions occurred with higher ethanol concentrations, attributed to more complete combustion. This research offers novel insights by providing a detailed performance and emission analysis of ethanol-gasoline blends, contributing to the development of more environmentally sustainable fuel options."
pub.1103623221,"‘Food from Nowhere’: Food, Fuel and the Fantastical","Science fiction (sf) has repeatedly explored the social and environmental consequences of technological developments in food and energy production. Never before have these explorations been of more importance and significance; recent shifts in resource extraction and processing (by both fossil fuel and ‘biofuel’ companies) have dramatically increased the reach and destructiveness of industrial food and energy production, as well as the extent of their entanglement. This article will begin by giving an indication of the reach and impacts of modern biofuel production, followed by a brief examination of the ‘food sovereignty’ movement and the theoretical frameworks and practical strategies that underpin it.Through the lens of the ‘food sovereignty’ movement, the article examines the ways in which sf writing and culture has explored the entanglement of food and energy regimes. Taking three aspects developed from the ‘six pillars’ of food sovereignty – political power, ecological integration and the fantastical – I examine three sf texts which place at their centre concerns over the entanglement of food and energy regimes. As I go on to demonstrate, all three texts – Robert A. Heinlein’s The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966), the British post-apocalyptic TV show Survivors (1975–7), and Paolo Bacigalupi’s The Windup Girl (2009) – use elements of the fantastical to explore and make visible effects which are rarely seen or only understood in the abstract language of international political economy. I then conclude by reflecting on the urgent need apply these insights in the struggle for a fairer and more sustainable food system."
pub.1169699464,"Sustainable, Decentralized Sanitation and Reuse Using Hybrid Systems","Shifting toward circular economy requires redesigning the water infrastructure that can lead to overexploitation of water resources and water scarcity. Decentralized wastewater treatment systems can provide reclaimed water close to the source of wastewater generation. Nature-based technologies are attractive solutions to implement decentralized sanitation. In nature-based treatment technologies such as constructed wetlands (CW), lagoons, algae ponds and buffer zones, light and CO2 are utilized in addition to the organic compounds. Algae-based systems can efficiently treat wastewater and offer energetic advantages (biofuel production) compared to traditional treatment systems. Bioelectrical systems such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can simultaneously be used for water and wastewater treatment with production of electricity and can be combined with nature-based technologies for higher treatment efficiency and energy production. The most probable outcome of these hybrid technologies will be the on-site treatment of wastewater for small, decentralized treatment plants. However, their application in real-scale treatment plants has not been assessed yet; these hybrid technologies are still in their infancy stage. This chapter focusses on current practices of nature-based technologies (algae-CW) and their integration with MFCs such as CW-MFC and algae-MFC systems for increasing the recovery possibilities and contributing toward circular economy. The various case studies with hybrid treatment systems have also been discussed. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives in the hybrid systems are outlined."
pub.1156067656,Valorization of Agricultural Lignocellulosic Plant Byproducts Following Biorefinery Approach Toward Circular Bioeconomy,"During the last decade, an increased attention has emerged on circular economy focused to improve simultaneously the environment, economy, and society for a sustainable development. In this context, biorefinery systems act as tactical mechanisms for the transition of a circular bioeconomy, since these systems can produce multiple high-value products, among biofuels, including food and feed products, biochemicals, and biomaterials, coming from diverse biomasses through the integration of useful conversion technologies. Agricultural activities are responsible for the overaccumulation and overproduction of lignocellulosic waste (e.g., bagasse, branch, leaves, wheat stover, fruit and vegetable seeds and peels). Such waste biomasses are abundant and could be considered as versatile natural resources for the obtention of this kind of products with high industrial demand. Thus, exploiting these lignocellulosic materials for the obtention of bioenergy and biochemicals, among other products, under biorefinery approach is a key objective for the transition of a well-succeeded circular bioeconomy. In this chapter, we focus on the principal constituents such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin present in the lignocellulosic biomasses. Each component has its unique characteristics, and their valorization depends on effective biomass treatment. This chapter presents traditional and novel treatment methods for agricultural lignocellulosic biomass valorization and their potential applications."

pub.1148598208,"Biorefinery of anaerobic digestate in a circular bioeconomy: Opportunities, challenges and perspectives","With the ever-increasing size of anaerobic digesters (AD), the management and disposal of digestate have become a challenging task for AD operators. Anaerobic digestate is rich in nutrients and contaminants; thus, a suitable treatment is required to meet environmental legislation and protect the receiving environment. There has been a thrust among the research efforts in anaerobic digestate management in the last decade. Volarization of digestate into high-value products is necessary to make the AD process more cost-effective. Moreover, digestate utilization helps in recycling the already mined resources. Efforts have been made to use digestate as a feedstock to recover energy and value-added products such as nutrients (N, P), biochar, biofuels, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), and algal cultivation, which can arguably help to enable the circular economy in modern communities. This communication thoroughly examines the anaerobic digestate-based biorefinery concept and its linkages with the circular bio-economy. This review comprehensively summarized digestate management practices; recovery of renewable fuels and other value-added products from digestate, including bottlenecks and perspectives altogether in digestate management and treatment. The state-of-the-art of commercialization of anaerobic digestate valorization technologies has also been provided. Overall, this review could support decision-makers in identifying environmentally sound and sustainable solutions ahead of time."
pub.1139759251,Prospects for decarbonizing the world economy in the process of formation and evolutionary development of innovative and industrial belts of trade routes of the XXI century,"The research is aimed at identifying the prospects for decarbonizing the world economy in the process of formation and evolutionary development of innovative and industrial belts of trade routes of the XXI century. Goal. Analyze, develop and propose the main directions for the development of economic (innovation-industrial) belts of trade routes of the XXI century in order to decarbonize the world economy. Tasks. To identify the directions of decarbonization of the transportation process by rail. To determine the prospects for the use of automatic (unmanned) mobile equipment when moving along international transport corridors and the possibility of reducing energy consumption in transport. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of expanding the use of hydrogen-cell and biofuel vehicles in the development of transport and transit systems. Develop recommendations for ensuring the sustainable development of cargo transportation along the Northern Sea Route (NSR). To show the organizational and institutional preconditions for the decarbonization of the world economy. Methodology. The research uses the methods of evolutionary and institutional theory, the theory of production and technological balance of the economy and technical and economic structures, world system analysis, expert and analytical assessments. Results. A system of arguments has been developed to prove that the high-tech transformation of global transport and logistics processes based on the principles of inter-state and corporate partnership (ICP), the development of the transit economy (TE) and the innovation and industrial belts of trade routes of the XXI century, which contribute to the wide spread of environmentally friendly industries, will make a decisive contribution to the de-carbonization of the world economy and ensuring sustainable economic development. It is determined that the decarbonization of the world economy in general and transport and transit systems in particular fits organically and forms an integral part of the Belt and Road Initiative of the People's Republic of China (BRI) put forward in 2013, and is closely correlated with such important components of the BRI as the Digital Silk Road and the Silk Road of Health. Conclusions. The development of the economic (innovation-industrial) belts of trade routes of the XXI century has a significant impact on the decarbonization of the world economy. The development of hydropower and long-distance transmission of generated electricity, as well as the construction and modernization of global, regional and transit energy transport systems will contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. When creating and operating the Norman-Aryan trade route of the XXI century, it is necessary to set the task of supplying electricity to transport communications and rolling stock exclusively from renewable energy sources (RES), and for the countries of Central Asia – through the use of hydropower, solar and wind sources.

pub.1134926039,The challenge of forecasting the role of biofuel in EU transport decarbonisation at 2050: A meta-analysis review of published scenarios,"The European New Green Deal and the REDII set ambitious targets, aiming to achieve a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. The transport sector is the most critical area to decarbonize, given the rigidity of both infrastructure and end-use technologies, as well as the challenge of reaching cost-effective production of sustainable advanced renewable fuels. Several researchers, stakeholders and groups of interest, such as international and governmental organisations, NGOs, business analysists, scientists and other actors elaborated scenarios on biofuels market penetration by 2050. These studies are largely used by policy makers, even if not necessarily were subject to a rigid peer review and verification process. This work presents an extensive literature review of the main published investigations, to assess and quantify the authors' different visions. These forecasts intend to evaluate the possible future development of the sector based on current and foreseeable policies, as well as industry and investors’ business plans; at the same time, these estimates should also provide policy makers with a sound base for policy development towards achieving climate goals. Through preliminary screening, based on a methodology of a set of ex-ante conditions, this work identified the most relevant publications and structured the analysis of the collected data. A total of 18 publications were selected from the literature review, resulting in 56 scenarios to be examined. This work allowed to achieve a comprehensive and quantification of the selected scenarios, all of which focus on biofuel contribution to transport decarbonisation in the period 2030–2050. Given the occurrence of several factors, as the ongoing and future technological development, the adoption of more efficient mobility models, the hybridization and electrification of transports, the Total Fuel Consumption for the transport sector is expected to reduce in Europe: averaged projections from the analyzed scenarios account for 312.8 Mtoe in 2030 and 274.2 Mtoe in 2050. Biofuels are expected to significantly contribute to achieve the EU targets, with a progressive shift towards advanced feedstock: on average, their total contribution is expected to account for 24.5 Mtoe in 2030, and for 48.3 Mtoe in 2050, while advanced biofuels are projected for an average contribution of 8.7 Mtoe in 2030 and 36.5 Mtoe in 2050. This work analysed pre-pandemic published scenarios: the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global as well as EU economies are uncertain, but there is a serious risk of hampering and postponing investment decisions in the whole energy area, making the achievement of RED and EU Green Deal targets even more challenging in this historical moment."
pub.1172949629,Innovative Membrane Bioreactors for Advanced and Sustainable Wastewater Treatment,"In the context of the circular economy and sustainability goals, there is a pressing need to recover valuable resources, such as clean water, biofuels, and biofertilizers, from wastewater. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology has emerged as a leading solution for advanced wastewater treatment, ensuring high removal efficiency for both conventional and emerging contaminants while also enhancing resource recovery. Despite the considerable advantages of MBRs over conventional treatment technologies, membrane fouling remains a significant challenge. This phenomena leads to increased energy consumption and the frequent need for physical and chemical cleanings, resulting in increased operating costs and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, enhancing membrane fouling mitigation strategies can yield substantial benefits for efficient, sustainable, and carbon-neutral wastewater treatment. To tackle these challenges, the next-generation of MBRs must integrate advanced technologies. This study evaluates the performance of both conventional and novel MBRs in municipal wastewater treatment, focusing on the removal efficiency of both conventional and emerging contaminants, including microplastics, as well as membrane fouling propensity. Experimental activities utilized both conventional membranes alongside self-forming dynamic membranes (SFDMs), including the innovative Living Membrane® (LM®) technology. The findings demonstrate that the use of LM® effectively mitigate membrane fouling while maintaining comparable efficiency in contaminant removal to that of conventional membranes."

A review on pure and mixed microbial cultures for butanol production,"Over the past decades, biotechnological processes have significantly improved and enabled societies to move closer to a bio-based economy, no longer dependent on liquid fossil fuels. Among sustainable biofuels, biobutanol is considered the best alternative due to its high energetic content and capability of acting as a drop-in fuel for gasoline. Together with new advances in resource recovery technology, biobutanol production is now poised to become even more sustainable. This paper summarizes the research done over the past decade on biobutanol production from low-value and waste residues. Different feedstock alternatives are discussed, and the predominant biological pathways for butanol production in ABE fermentation and syngas fermentation are revisited. Particular attention is given to single and mixed culture fermentation, and how far both technologies have come to reach butanol titers close to and above the microbial toxicity level of butanol. By comparing current titers, productivities and yields of single and mixed microbial cultures, this review shows to which extent the mixed microbial culture approach can compete with pure cultures, delving further on the advantages and obstacles of each of the technologies. Based on low-value and waste residue feedstocks, clear incentives exist to use mixed microbial fermentation as the predominant production platform for butanol and to focus future research on this promising technology."

It could be further employed in the sector of agro-waste management. Waste management in the agricultural sector is a humongous problem with no overnight solution or immediate prescription. Landfill disposal and open dumping of agricultural wastes are common practices in developing and agrarian economies such as India. These unscientific practices may create serious health and environmental problems, primarily due to groundwater contamination. Sustainable agricultural practices based on industrial innovation and latest technological developments ensure new and better approaches for the recovery of agricultural wastes. These approaches have immensely contributed to guaranteeing sustainable production and its consumption, resource efficiency, the conversion of these wastes into valuable products, and the reduction of negative environmental impacts. Agro-waste management may include biosynthesis of nanoparticles, biotechnological products, composting, and biofuel production. A lot of bioactive compounds could be produced from agro-wastes, which have many application possibilities such as functional food and pharmaceutical and cosmetic approaches. The nanomanagement of agro-wastes may include the use of nanotechnology to convert the agro-wastes into a valuable product. This technology can be a potential solution to a global problem in the future."
pub.1166203075,An Overview of Lignocellulose and Its Biotechnological Importance in High-Value Product Production,"Lignocellulose consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin and is a sustainable feedstock for a biorefinery to generate marketable biomaterials like biofuels and platform chemicals. Enormous tons of lignocellulose are obtained from agricultural waste, but a few tons are utilized due to a lack of awareness of the biotechnological importance of lignocellulose. Underutilizing lignocellulose could also be linked to the incomplete use of cellulose and hemicellulose in biotransformation into new products. Utilizing lignocellulose in producing value-added products alleviates agricultural waste disposal management challenges. It also reduces the emission of toxic substances into the environment, which promotes a sustainable development goal and contributes to circular economy development and economic growth. This review broadly focused on lignocellulose in the production of high-value products. The aspects that were discussed included: (i) sources of lignocellulosic biomass; (ii) conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into value-added products; and (iii) various bio-based products obtained from lignocellulose. Additionally, several challenges in upcycling lignocellulose and alleviation strategies were discussed. This review also suggested prospects using lignocellulose to replace polystyrene packaging with lignin-based packaging products, the production of crafts and interior decorations using lignin, nanolignin in producing environmental biosensors and biomimetic sensors, and processing cellulose and hemicellulose with the addition of nutritional supplements to meet dietary requirements in animal feeding."
pub.1045594259,Assessing Sustainable Bioenergy Feedstock Production Potential by Integrated Geospatial Analysis of Land Use and Land Quality,"Development of viable bioenergy economies will require large increases in biomass feedstock production. Improved methods are needed to quantify production potential based on land availability, land suitability, biomass yield, and cost. We developed such a method and applied it throughout New York State. While maintaining existing forest and agricultural production, we quantified additional sustainable biomass production potential using geospatial and yield modeling that integrates remotely sensed and survey data for land cover, soil type, climate patterns, and crop yields and then applied multiple sustainability constraints. Nearly 680,000 ha with varying quality was found to be available and suitable for new biomass production. Predicted yields ranged from 7.8 to 18.3 Mg/ha for short-rotation willow and 6.9–16.3 Mg/ha for perennial grasses for a total production potential of 8.2 Tg/year. Increased forest harvest could produce an additional 4.3 Tg/year of hardwood and 1.6 Tg/year of softwood. In total, an additional 14.2 Tg/year of biomass for bioenergy could be produced while maintaining existing agricultural and forest production. This new biomass, before processing, would contain energy equivalent to 7.4 % of 2012 New York energy use (3.4 % if converted to ethanol)."

The Case for New Powering of Automobiles,"A portfolio of new energy technologies has emerged in the first decade of the 21st Century, and many of them could be used for re-structuring the energy sector towards Sustainable Development. A key subject in this quest is the future of automobile, with possibilities on powering ranging from biofuels to Hydrogen Cars (HC), to Electric Vehicles (EV). In turn, the latter is closely connected with the need to deploy Renewable Energies (RE) for electricity generation. Within such new situation, countries and governments are aware that there are new tools for fighting Global Warming (GW), and new policies could be established for winning this battle against CO2. All these initiatives will affect the future of energy corporations, notably hydrocarbon companies; and it should be noted that it will be difficult for the companies to define long-term strategies if energy policies convey upheavals, sudden changes in promoting alternatives and interruptions on activities. Hence, it is very important to adopt energy policies allowing a smooth evolution of the companies’ activities to the new energy model. After analyzing the alternatives with a forecasting-backcasting methodology, an “eclectic approach” is proposed, with the Plug-in Hybrid car with Flexible Fuel (PiHFF) as the central paradigm in the coming promoting policies."
pub.1170671764,Valorisation of macroalgae for biofuels in Indonesia: an integrated biorefinery approach,"Globally, bioenergy development depends on the efficacy and affordability of conversion technologies and the availability of renewable biomass sources. As a tropical country, Indonesia has a wide range of biomass sources, either from land or marine biomass (i.e. macroalgae). The current estimation of macroalgae potential in Indonesia is estimated at approximately 9.96 million tonnes or about 26.86% share of world production in 2021. Specifically, marine macroalgae (wild or cultivated) have received attention for their potential as renewable resources for the sustainable bioenergy production, supporting a move towards a circular economy. However, as a developing country, Indonesia still needs to evolve and further advances its technology and skill capacity to address research, development, and innovation challenges in this area. Thus, this paper examines the potential biorefinery approach for application and commercialisation in Indonesia. It discusses cultivation practices and the future direction of the most sustainable and feasible routes for bioenergy production from macroalgae, exploring recent developments, opportunities, and challenges towards circular processes. The study proposed that the biorefining of macroalgae into bioethanol, biogas, compost, and solid fuels, either as mono – or co-production, are potential. Therefore, this paper may offer to narrowing the literature’s gap and adding a new perspective on the adoption of macroalgae-based bioenergy with integrated biorefinery and closed-loop systems approaches."
pub.1155386227,Advances in limitations and opportunities of clean biofuel production to promote decarbonization,"Factors such as higher fuel prices, limited and geologically posited fossil fuel resources along with the impact of fossil fuels on global warming are highly unsustainable for growing economies around the globe. For this reason, an unconventional sustainable energy root is desired. In recent years, biodiesel has gained much consideration because of its similar combustion properties like fossil fuels and its synthesis from edible and non-edible oils via a catalytic process. Various catalysts (homogeneous and heterogeneous in nature) have been investigated for sustainable and green production of biodiesel. The heterogeneous catalyst calcium oxide is an abundant, cheap and has a high activity for transesterification reaction. The review provides that there is strong need to focus on exploring the continuous heterogeneous nanoscale calcium oxide catalyst to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness biodiesel production technology. Calcium oxide catalytic activity can be improved by nanotechnology approach. This approach helps in the production of suitable catalyst at a low cost, minimizes the waste, and results in higher activity and selectivity for desired reaction. This study provides an overview on the literature existing on the preparation of nanosized-Calcium oxide (CaO), utilization for conversion of ester into biodiesel along, advantages over other heterogeneous catalysts and importance as a future catalyst for the production of biodiesel."

pub.1150237236,Recent developments in oleaginous yeast feedstock based biorefinery for production and life cycle assessment of biofuels and value-added products,"Oleaginous yeasts, capable of accumulating a substantial amount of triglycerides, have immense potential to serve as a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. However, the techno-economic challenges currently associated with the commercialization of the biodiesel production process prompt for a significant improvement in the cultivation methods of yeasts and the subsequent energy-intensive downstream processing steps. Alternatively, a bio-refinery model targeting for inclusive production of value-added products would be an attractive proposition to bolster the economy of the mainstream biodiesel production process. The current review attempts to bridge the existing knowledge- gap on biodiesel production from oleaginous yeasts by essentially capturing the recent research advancements made for sustainable biodiesel production while emphasizing the possibilities for producing multiple products. It also critically analyses the bioprocess optimization strategies for improving lipid yield from oleaginous yeasts strains and discusses the importance of environmental impact analysis through life cycle assessment in improving the overall environmental footprint of the yeast-based biodiesel production process. However, it can be drawn that the environmental benefits of biodiesel alone will not suffice for its industrial application as long as it is not competitive with petro-diesel in terms of price, and arduous research must be put into to achieve this global priority."
pub.1139116507,Economic and Environmental Assessment of Plastic Waste Pyrolysis Products and Biofuels as Substitutes for Fossil-Based Fuels,"The global economy is shifting toward more sustainable sources of energy. The transportation sector is a remarkable example of this fact, where biofuels have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. This work presents a techno-economic and environmental assessment of existing liquid fuels in hard-to-decarbonize sectors and their emerging renewable substitutes. The comparison focuses on fossil-based, biomass-derived, and plastic waste-sourced fuel alternatives that can be used in spark-ignition (gasoline) and compression-ignition (diesel) engines. Results for diesel substitutes prove the superior performance of plastic waste pyrolysis oil in terms of production cost reduction (−25% compared to diesel) and “well-to-tank” life cycle impact reduction (−54% human health, −40% ecosystems, −98% resources). Consequently, research and development toward the conversion of plastic waste into fuels should be extended to make the technology more accessible and robust in terms of fuel quality. On the contrary, the results for gasoline alternatives are not as conclusive: bioethanol and ethanol from plastic pyrolysis have a considerably lower impact on resource scarcity than gasoline (−80% and −35% respectively) and higher on the other two life cycle endpoint categories, but they have higher production costs compared to gasoline (+57% and +130% respectively). While blends of gasoline with pyrolysis-sourced ethanol can reduce the impact on human health and ecosystems, blends with bioethanol have a lower impact on resource scarcity and increase economic profitability. This allows fuel providers to offer tradeoff solutions in the form of blends based on their priorities."

This review discusses the potential of seaweed as a blue carbon sink and a renewable and sustainable energy source in the biogenic carbon cycle in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Data were collected from more than 100 scientific articles, reliable organizations, and industry resources to a concise explanation and novel perspective on how seaweed can contribute considerably to the newly emerging blue carbon economy and revolutionary tools to combat climate change in the long term. According to the findings, seaweed has all the features required to be classified as a blue carbon habitat and a massive carbon sink. Besides its function in climate change adaptation and mitigation, seaweed is also a prelude to attaining a bioeconomy by lowering the reliance on fossil fuel. Documented evidence supports various applications in sectors as diverse as human meals, livestock feed, biofuels, and renewable feedstocks. However, the literature also identifies barriers to the implementation of seaweed farming operations. This review provides evidence that seaweed farming and industries are potential alternatives for future energy, decarbonization, and food security, mitigating global climate change and attaining economic growth and sustainable livelihoods."

Biofuels generated by microorganisms, such as biodiesel deals with both the optimal conditions for modified oleaginous microorganisms in addition to the biofuel quality. In addition, a biorefinery concept can be used as it optimized the use of biomass for materials, chemicals, fuels, and energy applications. Oleaginous organisms currently represent an important contribution to the research of new energy alternatives obtained through the metabolic transformation of structurally simple compounds. This group of microorganisms is mainly composed of bacteria, fungi, yeasts and algae. Today oleaginous plants are considered a renewable source of oils and fats since they can accumulate 20% or more of their biomass in the form of lipids, generally triglycerides (TAGs), which are used in the manufacture of biodiesel. The versatility and biological diversity of these microorganisms make it possible to generate cultures in different suitable monosaccharides, such as glucose, maltose, fructose, lignocellulose resources, and even waste from sewage. These are fast-growing microorganisms that do not require large cultivation areas and are easy to scale up. Therefore, the use of biological tools as energy alternatives promises a new source of available and abundant resources that do not imply the generation of recalcitrant waste that can generate environmental pollution processes. Oleaginous microorganisms have demonstrated their ability to treat wastewater biologically. This method represents an alternative to traditional biotechnological digestion processes, which require high-end equipment. These microorganisms can effectively clean wastewater in a short period and generate high value-added products such as biofuels.

In detail, agro-industrial by-products represent a cheap, renewable, and abundant feedstock useful for several new products, including biochemical, biomaterials, and above all biogas, which are taking on an ever-increasing role in Italy. In this context, the tomato chain was analysed aiming at estimating the amount of processed tomato and the related waste production as a new suitable resource for producing biofuel as a new frontier within the context of a circular economy. Due the importance of the tomato industry, this research aims at filling gaps in the knowledge of the production and yield of the by-products that are useful as biomass for energy use in those territorial areas where the biomethane sector is still developing. This aim could be relevant for planning the sustainable development of the biomethane sector by reducing both soil consumption for dedicated energy crops and GHG emissions coming from the biomass logistic supply. The achieved results show the localization of territorial areas highly characterized by this kind of biomass. Therefore, it would be desirable that the future policies of development in the biomethane sector consider the availability and the distribution of these suitable biomasses within the territory."

The main objective of this work was to obtain SCOs suitable for biodiesel production from the oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula glutinis R4 using sugarcane vinasse from a local sugar-derived alcohol industry as the substrate. Additionally, crude glycerol from the local biodiesel industry was evaluated as a low-cost carbon source to replace expensive glucose and as a strategy for integrating the bioethanol and biodiesel industries for the valorization of both agro-industrial wastes. R4 achieved a high lipid accumulation of 88% and 60% (w/w) in vinasse-based culture media, containing 10% and 25% vinasse with glucose (40 g L−1), respectively. When glucose was replaced with crude glycerol, R4 showed remarkable lipid accumulation (40%) and growth (12.58 g L−1). The fatty acids profile of SCOs showed a prevalence of oleic acid (C18:1), making them suitable for biodiesel synthesis. Biodiesel derived from R4 oils exhibits favorable characteristics, including a high cetane number (CN = 55) and high oxidative stability (OS = 13 h), meeting international biodiesel standards (ASTMD6751 and EN14214) and ensuring its compatibility with diesel engines. R. glutinis R4 produces SCOs from vinasse and crude glycerol, contributing to the circular economy for sustainable biodiesel production."
pub.1148839565,Harnessing the power of cellulolytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria for biovalorization of lignocellulosic biomass,"Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is produced in large quantities throughout the world every year and represents a major sink for photosynthetically fixed carbon. However, in some countries, lignocellulosic materials are viewed as agricultural by-products and are often burned to quickly prepare the land for the next cropping season. This environmentally unfriendly practice contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the loss of renewable carbon-based resources. When used properly, LCB can be an inexhaustible source of renewable energy, soil conditioners, and other sustainable materials. To this end, leveraging microbial power to unlock the multifunctional value of LCB is presented as one of the very promising pathways toward sustainable development. However, LCB, despite its high carbon content, has a low nitrogen concentration, which may limit its microbial degradation in environments with little or no additional nitrogen. Fortunately, some cellulolytic bacteria can produce bioavailable nitrogen through nitrogen fixation and play a key role in LCB digestion in wood-boring organisms. In this review, we discuss how cellulolytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (CNFB) can enhance the conversion of LCB into various bioproducts (e.g., biofuels and soil conditioners). Based on the knowledge of the biotechnological potential of CNFB disseminated in this review, there are prospects for further research to biovalorize LCB towards a carbon-neutral circular economy."

As the United States strives to maintain its competitive edge and secure its supply chains, addressing the increasing dominance of China in the biomanufacturing industry is crucial. This white paper proposes implementing targeted tariffs on Biomanufactured products imported from China to protect the U.S. biomanufacturing industry, safeguard national security interests, and promote domestic innovation, and competitiveness for a secure bioeconomy. Significant federal investments through the Inflation Reduction Act and the President’s Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy highlight the renewable chemicals sector as the next critical frontier. The Biden Administration has extended the Trump Administration’s policies, garnering bipartisan support for tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 100% on various industrial products from China. Despite these tariffs, the government must do more to protect biomanufacturing sector to safeguarding U.S. businesses from unfair competition and mitigating supply chain risks, especially where no domestic producers exist for certain bio ingredients crucial in manufacturing biofuels includes sustainable aviation fuels, food, beverage, biomaterials, and pharmaceutical products. Therefore, AFCC and its member companies propose a range of 60% to 100% tariff on biomanufactured products from China."

This solves two main issues: first, it decreases the environmental pollution as burning of fossil resources leads to the emanation of harmful pollutants to the atmosphere and second, it preserves the fossil resources for future generation. Biofuel is part of such kind of development. In this study, Neem oil is selected for biodiesel preparation. Neem biodiesel is prepared from Neem seed oil using sodium hydroxide as base catalyst. The molar ratio of oil to alcohol, catalyst amount, reaction speed, temperature and time has been optimized and finally, the fuel properties are also evaluated as per ASTM standards. With optimal settings maximum yield found to be 96%. The acid value contained within 0.09 mg KOH/g and cetane number found to be 52, which is more than diesel cetane index."
pub.1015905140,Rural Biotechnology in Transforming Agriculture and Rural Livelihood,"The twenty-first century human society is dealing with many difficulties besides climate challenge, and most of them are though diverse but highly interconnected. Transformation in agriculture and rural development are demanding urgent attention in this scenario. Human civilization is basically an agrarian one, and rural people who practice agriculture are literally the real bread earners. Neglecting agriculture and these endogenous people has visibly started to affect our ecosystem, environment, economy, and civilization. Sustainable solutions to most of these problems can be created only by combining endogenous knowledge reserve and the modern biotechnological know-how. In order to successfully carry forward this process, we first need to ensure endogenous development. Rural development is inevitably connected to several key endeavors having global impacts like food security, protection of environment, and conservation of natural resource base including local landraces, germplasm, and biodiversity. Successful application of rurally relevant biotechnology will be a necessity in transforming agriculture besides enhancing and protecting rural livelihoods as well as rural integrity."
pub.1110337580,Waste-to-Fuel Technology in Albania—How to Implement a Renewable Energy System in Europe’s Largest Onshore Oilfield,"Albania has historically been known to have an active but challenging drilling activity that demands the most innovative technology to develop, predominantly, medium-heavy oil reservoirs. Although recent efforts have been made by the government to stimulate and expand the largest onshore European oilfield, technical and economical obstacles are prevalent. These obstacles make it difficult to fully develop reliable and profitable hydrocarbon bearing zones in a downturn economy, especially since Albanian oil can be costly to produce and refine. Due to these typical issues that affect many local energy sectors, many developed countries diversify their energy production to avoid strict dependency on crude oil. An emblematic and modern option that is extensively gaining popularity in Europe focuses on renewable energy from sophisticated recycling programs. Although Albania is a relatively “green” country when it pertains to its electricity production (97% hydropower and 3% fossil fuels), it has yet to develop energy-recycling programs that it can salvage for self-sustainable energy sources. The past years have seen a conscious revitalization and stimulation in the mentality of green economy in Albania. But, in comparison to the rest of “western Europe” that are leading world examples in efficient recycling, it is significantly lagging with initial strides just now focusing on aligning national legislations with current EU models. Furthermore, two crucial reasons that should motivate Albania to investigate new applications for energy recycling are: (1) alternatives to crude oil and petroleum products that can be supplemental and provide stable access to fossil fuels; (2) industrial and municipal recycling via waste management to reprocess waste and produce industrial raw material-spawning the emergence of a “circular economy” to develop the backbone needed to strengthen the industrial and manufacturing markets for a self-sustaining economy. Accordingly, in this paper, the topic that will be addressed, given the recent decrease in oil & gas prices, focuses on the Albanian energy sector’s capability to sustain and develop a supplementary recycling program via “waste-to-fuel” (WTF) technology (biofuels and/or inorganic waste). With the intent that it could function cooperatively with Albania’s active drilling program to mitigate dependency on a single fuel source and produce enough fossil fuel in an effective and sustainable manner."
pub.1159800893,Valorization of biomass using deep eutectic solvent: a short review,"The current rise in global energy demand has led to environmental concerns such as resource depletion and pollution. This has steered researchers towards exploring different renewable sources to achieve a sustainable circular bio-economy. Interestingly, the abundant nature of lignocellulose biomass (LCB) has attracted a lot of attention in the production of various specialty chemicals and fuels. The valorization of LCB requires that the recalcitrant structure of the biomass be broken down. However, the high capital cost, operating temperature, and several constraints that accompanythe pretreatment process make most of the pretreatment process economically unviable. Therefore, the quest for an environmentally benign pretreatment process led to the discovery of deep eutectic solvents (DES). They are classified as green solvents due to their biodegradable properties, lowcosts, eco-friendliness, enzyme compatibility, facile methods of synthesis, and recyclability. This review aims at giving information on LCB, Ionic liquids (ILs), and DES, the valorization of biomass to produce biofuel, and the recyclability of DES."
pub.1152956680,Agrofuels Can Beat the Heat for a Sustainable Environment,"Agrofuels or biofuels are organic fuels that are derived from agriculture wastes. Agrofuels are being seriously viewed from the multidimensional perspective of depleting fossil fuel resources, environmental health, energy security, agrarian economy and new avenues of gainful employment. Agrofuels are gaining importance in the light of increasing energy demand, especially as fossil fuels are non-renewable. Agrofuels are renewable, biodegradable, non-hazardous and safer for air, water and soil, and their use reduces the emission of greenhouse gases. Biodiesel is an important agrofuel made from vegetable oil that runs in any conventional and unmodified diesel engine. Biodiesel can be made from any vegetable oil, including oils pressed straight from the seed, such as soybean, sunflower, canola, coconut and hemp. Various other sources of lipids, such as animal fats and cooking oils, are also used for production of biodiesel. Agrofuels are being given genuine consideration as likely sources of energy later on. In this chapter we focus on the social, economic and environmental impact of agrofuels."

However, traditional petrochemical technologies are not designed to operate using biomass raw materials. Thus, the development of new hydrocarbon processing methods is essential. This paper deals with the study of the hybrid plasma-catalytic reforming of liquid hydrocarbons. The system for the reforming of liquid hydrocarbons, which used low-power rotating gliding discharge as a plasma generator, was studied. Sunflower oil (C17H33COOH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) have been used as model oxygen-containing hydrocarbons and diesel fuel (C16H34) has been used as a model hydrocarbon without oxygen. Reforming products have been analyzed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography, and the combustion of produced syngas was studied. The values of the reforming efficiency, the ratio between the chemical energy of the produced syngas and the electric energy spent on the plasma generation, and the efficiency of the produced syngas combustion in the standard water heaters were obtained."

However, insufficient utilization of carbon sources caused by inhibitors, especially acetic acid, hinders the economic bioconversion. Here, we demonstrated the acetate metabolic pathway via glyoxylate shunt in nonconventional yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus. Acetate metabolism increased to 122.7 % at 40 °C after overexpressing ICL1 and MLS1, key genes of glyoxylate shunt revealed by transcriptomic data. Strengthening GPD2 and FDH1 further enhanced the robustness of the K. marxianus, acetate metabolism was significantly increased. Finally, the modified K. marxianus 1727–5-ICL1-MLS1-GPD2-FDH1 boosted the efficiency for xylose uptake up to 1.3 folds in non-detoxified lignocellulosic hydrolysate, benefiting from a 3.9-fold increase in acetate consumption. Our results propose a novel strategy for xylose assimilation by coupling acetate metabolism, contributing the bioconversion of sustainable lignocellulosic biomass. It also provides a new scheme for the total carbon utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, including carbon dioxide (CO2) released from the biofuel production to achieve a circular economy."

Biodiesel is a sustainable liquid fuel used for partial or full replacement of standard diesel fuel, and its production generates valuable by-products. The use of ultrasound in biodiesel production has a growing interest due to several advantages; it significantly reduces the reaction time and avoids the use of heating, reaching similar or higher FAME yield. The application of ultrasounds in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis processes is reported to be technically feasible, but several issues are to be considered such as the corrosion effect on sonotrodes, and the effect of ultrasounds waves on solid catalyst surface and pores. Combining it with microwave irradiation might be an effective procedure for the intensification of biodiesel production, especially with heterogeneous catalysis. Technical challenges are associated with the design of large-scale reactors in which both types of energy could be applied concurrently with cost reduction. This chapter explores the basis of ultrasounds and their use in the production of biodiesel, its main features, and challenges. <br>"
pub.1111836462,Glycosylation Is Vital for Industrial Performance of Hyperactive Cellulases,"In the terrestrial biosphere, biomass deconstruction is conducted by microbes employing a variety of complementary strategies, many of which remain to be discovered. Moreover, the biofuels industry seeks more efficient (and less costly) cellulase formulations upon which to launch the nascent sustainable bioenergy economy. The glycan decoration of fungal cellulases has been shown to protect these enzymes from protease action and to enhance binding to cellulose. We show here that thermal tolerant bacterial cellulases are glycosylated as well, although the types and extents of decoration differ from their Eukaryotic counterparts. Our major findings are that glycosylation of CelA is uniform across its three linker peptides and composed of mainly galactose disaccharides (which is unique) and that this glycosylation dramatically impacts the hydrolysis of insoluble substrates, proteolytic and thermal stability, and substrate binding and changes the dynamics of the enzyme. This study suggests that the glycosylation of CelA is crucial for its exceptionally high cellulolytic activity on biomass and provides the robustness needed for this enzyme to function in harsh environments including industrial settings."

pub.1149503047,Chapter 12 Microbial lipids production using renewable agro-industrial liquid effluent as feedstock,"The ever-increasing energy demand has necessitated the identification of alternative renewable sources of energy. To this effect, oleaginous microorganisms provide an attractive sustainable alternative. The microbial lipids derived from these microorganisms can be utilized as biofuel or as a nutrition supplement. One of the roadblocks for the commercial production of microbial lipids is the identification of suitable substrates. Hence, renewable effluents produced as a result of human activities can be utilized, thereby allowing for the sequestration of carbon and other nutrients that otherwise would have been released to the environment. The use of wastewater as feedstock for microbial lipid production, especially microalgal, is discussed in this chapter. The use of microalgae allows for the operation of the wastewater treatment in photoautotrophic or heterotrophic mode as well as in combination. The sequestration of nutrients in the wastewater to produce lipids allows for achieving the goal of circular economy as well as prevents the detrimental environmental impact associated with release of untreated wastewater."

pub.1131886998,Biorefinery Approach for Bioethanol Production,"The growth in population and condition of the economy has increased the dependency on fossil fuels to meet energy demands. Extensive use of fossil fuels has led to increased emissions of CO2, rising atmospheric temperatures, deteriorating air quality, thus ultimately leading to climate change. This has led countries and governments to seek out more renewable and sustainable alternatives that can replace fossil fuels. Bioethanol is one of the most promising biofuels to have successfully become one of the best alternatives to fossil fuels. Ethanol can be produced both from agri crops like barley, oats, rice, wheat, etc., as well as from lignocellulosic biomass feedstock and other wastes. All the different kinds of biomass constitute sugars in high concentrations which when fermented produce bioethanol. The quantity and quality are determined through different types of methods like pre‐treatment, hydrolysis, fermentation, and distillation.

The first case study, “the Vermont biomass energy co-op” presents a business plan to produce local wood pellets in the state via formation of an energy co-op based on a local survey. Significant savings are projected for the local economy through the proposed sustainable business by providing both steady jobs and long-term stewardship of the environment all across the state. The second case study, “assessment of 130 acre property for on-site biomass resources to meet the energy needs of the community” as the title suggests provides an assessment that was made of the potential for on-site biomass resources to meet the energy needs of a community living on a 130-acre property consisting of forested, grassy, and wetland areas. This assessment identified wood, grass, and food waste as potential on-site biomass energy resources, and among these resources, grass, which could be harvested and pelletized on-site and burned in modified space heating equipment, was judged to be able to make the greatest contribution to current energy use for the community. The third case study, “exploration of the Jean Pain composting method for greenhouse heating,” explored Pain's method (a French farmer, forester, researcher, and inventor) used for composting forest residues while also capturing and using the heat produced from the biological activity within the pile.

Similar projects can be undertaken in any location in partnership with the local solid biofuel-based businesses, farms, and communities."
pub.1034812134,Chapter 6 Wood and Grass Energy Service Learning Projects and Case Studies,"This chapter presents the solid biofuel-related service learning projects undertaken by students in a northeastern region of United States over many years as part of the Bioenergy Program1. The student's experiences are described, and particularly three different case studies are presented authored by the respective students who successfully completed their projects.The first case study, “the Vermont biomass energy co-op” presents a business plan to produce local wood pellets in the state via formation of an energy co-op based on a local survey. Significant savings are projected for the local economy through the proposed sustainable business by providing both steady jobs and long-term stewardship of the environment all across the state.The second case study, “assessment of 130 acre property for on-site biomass resources to meet the energy needs of the community” as the title suggests provides an assessment that was made of the potential for on-site biomass resources to meet the energy needs of a community living on a 130 acre property consisting of forested, grassy, and wetland areas. This assessment identified wood, grass, and food waste as potential on-site biomass energy resources, and among these resources, grass, which could be harvested and pelletized on-site and burned in modified space heating equipment, was judged to be able to make the greatest contribution to current energy use for the community.The third case study, “exploration of the Jean Pain composting method for greenhouse heating”, explored the Pain's method (a French farmer, forester, researcher, and inventor) used for composting forest residues while also capturing and using the heat produced from the biological activity within the pile. In the colder regions, worldwide, it is desirable that we find affordable, sustainable, and local resources that can displace our reliance on fossil fuels for food production.Similar projects can be undertaken in any location in partnership with the local solid biofuel-based businesses, farms and communities."
pub.1160705555,Chapter 14 Distillery coproduct in fish nutrition: strategies for transforming waste into wealth,"The most expensive parts of aquafeed are the protein components. Due to a dwindling supply and increasing feed costs, fishmeal has started to impede the expansion of aquaculture. Protein meals with these ingredients are necessary, including fish meal, cotton meal, mustard oil cake, soybean meal, and groundnut oil cake. Rice bran, oilcakes, fish meal, and soybean meal are prohibited because of competition. The future of the company and the cost of fish feed have both increased as a result of these factors. For growth, feed conversion, economic viability, and local accessibility, a variety of protein sources are essential. Alternative protein sources are needed for sustainable aquaculture, particularly in inland open water fisheries. Alternatives that are of the highest quality, least expensive, and most accessible are needed for fish feed, such as agroindustrial waste and byproducts. The significant depletion of resources of rival animal- and plant-based proteins in the human and animal diets has led to the use of agroindustrial wastes and byproducts in animal feed. In terms of the quantity of land and water needed (2.4–33 times), greenhouse gas emissions (up to 100 times), and expenses associated with producing a comparable amount of animal-based proteins for the human diet through intensive farming, a plant-based diet is far healthier. Animals must be fed agroindustrial waste and byproducts to reduce the worldwide cost of production. Changing energy demands requires a biorefinery research plan. This is sustainable energy-wise. Researchers hope to improve corn-to-ethanol economics by using cellulosic technology. To attain these goals, new technologies, higher-quality hybrids, rapid plant domestication, enhanced management practices, and enough research funding are needed. Future biorefineries will require more high-quality biomass, which will spur agricultural development. Because corn ethanol has more energy and environmental implications than other biofuels, these techniques can result in a biofuel economy that meets the need for fuel-efficient automobiles while simultaneously addressing energy security and climate change. To win, researchers must reduce humanity’s reliance on nonrenewable energy sources. This chapter discusses brewery waste’s aquaculture potential and its future prospects."
pub.1146119411,Utilization of Different Carbon Sources by Nordic Microalgae Grown Under Mixotrophic Conditions,"Microalgae are promising candidates for sustainable wastewater treatment coupled to the production of biofuel, bioplastic and/or bio-fertilizers. In Nordic countries, however, light is a limiting factor for photosynthesis and biomass production during the winter season. Compared to municipal wastewater, industrial wastewater streams from the pulp and paper industry contain lower amounts of nitrogen, but high concentrations of carbon sources, which could be utilized by microalgae to enhance biomass production in limiting light. This study focused on the utilization of methanol, glycerol and xylose by five different Nordic microalgae [Chlorella vulgaris (13–1), Coelastrella sp. (3–4), Desmodesmus sp. (2–6), Chlorococcum sp. (MC1) and Scotiellopsis reticulata (UFA-2)] grown under mixotrophic conditions. Two of these strains, i.e., Chlorococcum sp. (MC1) and Scotiellopsis reticulata (UFA-2) were able to grow in the presence of xylose or methanol at concentrations of 6 g L–1, or 3%, respectively, in a 12/12 h day/night cycle. HPLC analysis confirmed the consumption of those substrates. Glycerol (2.3 g L–1) was tolerated by all strains and increased growth for Chlorella vulgaris (13–1), while higher concentrations (20 g L–1) were only tolerated by Chlorococcum sp. (MC-1). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, performed after growth in presence of the dedicated carbon source, indicated an increase in the fingerprint region of the carbohydrate fraction. This was particularly the case for Chlorococcum sp. (MC1), when grown in presence of glycerol, and Scotiellopsis reticulata (UFA-2), when grown in presence of xylose. Therefore, these strains could be potential candidates for the production of biofuels, e.g., bioethanol or biogas. We could show that Nordic microalgae are able to grow on various carbon sources; the actual uptake rates are low during a 12/12 h day/night cycle requesting additional optimization of the cultivation conditions. Nonetheless, their potential to use pulp and paper waste-streams for cheap and sustainable biomass production is high and will support the development of new technologies, turning waste-streams into resources in a circular economy concept."
pub.1173935996,"Chapter 6 Vinasse, a byproduct of the bioethanol industry—A valuable resource for sustainable agriculture and renewable energy production","Vinasse is a byproduct of ethanol production, with large quantities generated by distilleries and biofuel plants. This abundant supply makes it readily accessible for various uses. Since it is a byproduct, it is often considered a waste material and can be obtained at a lower cost than other chemical products. Its composition is predominantly 93% water and 7% solids. For each liter of bioethanol produced in the sugarcane industry, 10–18L of vinasse may be generated. This effluent has a favorable chemical composition containing organic matter, nutrients, and trace elements that can benefit agricultural purposes. When used as a fertilizer or soil conditioner, vinasse can improve soil fertility and enhance crop growth. Moreover, its high organic content makes it suitable for anaerobic digestion, where microorganisms break down the organic matter to produce biogas, a renewable energy source. Vinasse can also be applied as a source of nutrients for the growth and bioaugmentation of microorganisms of agricultural interest, acting in the biological control of phytopathogenic organisms. This effluent also grows microorganisms in biotechnological processes to produce chemical compounds of industrial interest. Owing to the large quantities of vinasse produced and its discharge over a long period altering chemical, physical-chemical, and biological properties of soils and water bodies, alternative treatments and uses have been proposed, such as recycling of vinasse in fermentation, fertirrigation at rates controlled by regulatory frameworks, concentration by evaporation, and yeast and energy production. Furthermore, the resource potential of vinasse contributes to sustainable agriculture, renewable energy production, and the development of value-added products. Its utilization can promote circular economy practices, reduce waste, and support a more sustainable and efficient bioethanol industry."
pub.1145741257,Kitchen waste: sustainable bioconversion to value-added product and economic challenges,"Growing volumes of solid wastes such as wastes from industries, commercial sites, agricultural lands, and households are mostly diverted to improper land fillings in developing countries, thus causing major public health and environmental issues. Sustainable approaches are necessary for the safe management of solid wastes. Kitchen waste (KW) like leftover organic matter from household kitchens, restaurants, etc. and food waste (FW), also termed as plate waste, that is the food which has been served but has not been eaten completely, stale food, etc. are ubiquitous in all communities. They contain a high amount of organic matter and hence should be considered a major source for producing value-added products. Biogas generation for harnessing energy and bioconversion for producing fertilizers are specific examples of value-added products. They are faced with issues including the heterogeneous nature of waste and an increased level of moisture, which are essential to be addressed. There is a dire urge to convert KW into products of significant importance intending to reduce the adverse effects of waste on land with less contagion in the atmosphere, water, and soil, respectively. In this review paper, we precisely deal with the conversion of KW into useful value-added products such as biofuels, biocomposites, nutraceuticals, antioxidants, bioenergy, and industrial enzymes, and thus sustainable management of waste. Importantly, the paper also explains numerous instances to provide better knowledge and idea about the bioconversion of KW into useful products with a notion of food security, costs associated with the waste, environmental hazards, etc. following economic policies and opportunities."
pub.1135906384,Economic Management of Electric Power Systems,"The theory of dynamic optimization and optimal automatic control is rich and continues its development in different areas including engineering, mathematics, and the focus of this chapter, economics. The objective of this chapter is to introduce these concepts for early graduate students, as a toolset in their graduate studies and beyond. Due to space limitations by the editors, in this synthesis we present introductory theory, and the applications we include are focused on electric power systems. For further and more in depth presentation of the theory, we refer the reader to sources along the text. We start with a review of the Lagrangean Method, the intuition behind the formulation, and a sketch of the economic applications as shadow prices. I then review the basic dynamic optimization problem in Sect. 12.1, starting with Deterministic formulations of the discrete and the continuous problem and present an example applied to the replacement of an energy storage system (ESS). Section 12.2 presents the stochastic formulation based on geometric Brownian motion (GBM), and presents an example of an agent optimizing the use of an ESS. In Sect. 12.3 I introduce the formulation of stochastic programs and decision making under uncertainty. The reader familiar with research in electricity systems with uncertainty can easily recognize the underlying generalization presented. I present an example of a unit commitment problem and potential ways to deal with the curse of dimensionality. The author is particularly indebted to Yihsu Chen, Jon Conrad and Tim Mount for their inputs and feedback."

With the Industry 4.0 concept of the knowledge-based economy in the central focus, the research objective was to examine both the supply and demand sides for developing a practical knowledge-based cow shoe business model.   Methods: This qualitative research adopted the concepts of knowledge-based entrepreneurship (KBE) and Osterwalder's business model canvas to guide the investigative design. It used documentary analysis, in-depth interviews, and a focus group discussion as the data collection instruments. The data analysis technique was a generic interpretive approach allowing the researchers to analyze the data by constructing codes, categories, and result conceptualization based on the underpinning conceptions of KBE and the business model canvas.   Results: This study confirmed cow shoe production as a potential downstream business for rubber production in Thailand with the possibility of KBE characterization of innovation, growth, and competitive advantage. Cow shoes could be sold throughout the year for cattle nourishing routines to ease the pain from hoof and claw trimming. Critical success factors for KBE development in this business included creating production technology transfer networks, promoting financial and knowledge support from rubber promotional authorities and regional universities, and developing a sustainable ecosystem for rubber production to be linked in the value chain with rubber biofuel and cattle farming industries.   Conclusion: Considering that innovative rubber production was often suggested at the policymaking level, this paper has filled the knowledge gap by delivering a novel practical framework, supported by empirical evidence, to promote KBE in cow shoe business development as a sustainable downstream business."

Through careful cross-case comparison, they uncover how and why the motives of policy-makers, business groups and NGOs make high normative aspirations diverge from actual negotiation outcomes.’ — Dirk De Bièvre, University of Antwerp, Belgium This book critically engages with a long tradition of scholarly work that conceives of the European Union as a peculiar international actor that pursues a value-based, normatively oriented and development-friendly agenda in its relations with its international partners. The EU is a pivotal player in international trade relations, holding formidable power in trade but also exercising substantial power through trade. Trade policy therefore represents a strategic field for the EU to shape its image as a healthyeconomy and a global power. In this field, the EU has declared a twofold ambitious goal, namely that of fostering economic growth in Europe while, at the same time, promoting development and growth abroad, both in developed and developing countries. In other words, the EU aims to increase its competitiveness in world trade while acting as an ethical and normative power. Here, Poletti and Sicurelli explore the tension between these two roles.

pub.1146373213,"An overview of palm oil biomass for power generation sector decarbonization in Malaysia: Progress, challenges, and prospects","Abstract With the ever‐increasing danger of climate change, power plants are shifting from polluting fossil fuels to sustainable bioenergy fuels. As Malaysia continues to pledge to decrease glasshouse gas (GHG) emissions, quick and dramatic action should resolve the reliance on fossil fuel power plants. Furthermore, the coal‐fired power station is Malaysia's biggest supplier of energy and the final power plant to be decommissioned. In Malaysia, a significant portion of palm oil biomass has the potential to replace coal in the generation of renewable energy power. However, the deployment of palm oil biomass as a renewable energy source has not been fully achieved. Furthermore, the surplus of unutilized biomass from the palm oil milling process has emerged as the key talking point leading to environmental concerns. As estimated, this palm oil biomass can generate approximately 5000 MW of electricity under 40% of operation efficiency. This significant power potential has the ability to replace Malaysia's yearly reliance on coal. Nonetheless, the limitations of technological stability, budgetary constraints, and other government policy concerns have prevented the potentials from being fulfilled. This necessitates an integrated framework that synergizes the decarbonization drive in order to realize the primary advantages of energy renewability and carbon neutrality. Among the suggested actions to decarbonize the power generating sector is an integrated scheme of palm oil production, biogas plant for electricity and steam generation, and biofuel pellet manufacture. This review provides an in‐depth overview of palm oil biomass for Malaysian power production decarbonization.

pub.1101702908,Sourcing overseas biomass for EU ambitions: assessing net sustainable export potential from various sourcing countries,"Abstract  Low‐cost sustainable biomass availability in the European Union may not be able to meet increasing demand; exploring the option of importing biomass is therefore imperative for the years to come. This article assesses sustainable biomass export potential from Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya, Ukraine, and the United States by applying a number of sustainability criteria. Only biomass types with the highest potential are selected, to take advantage of economies of scale, e.g. pulpwood, wood waste, and residues in the United States, and agricultural residues in Ukraine. This study found that, except for the United States, pellet markets in the sourcing regions are largely undeveloped. The export potential depends strongly on pellet mill capacity and assumed growth rates in the pellet industry. Results show that the United States, Ukraine, Indonesia, and Brazil offer the highest biomass export potential. In the Business As Usual 2030 scenario, up to 204 PJ could potentially be mobilized; in the High Export scenario this could increase to 1423 PJ, with 89% of the potential being available for costs ranging from 6.4 to 15 €/GJ. These potentials meet the European Commission requirements for a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions set in the Renewable Energy Directive. The total export potentials do not reflect the net possible import potentials to the European Union, as biomass could be imported to other countries where there is a demand for it, where less strict sustainability requirements are applied, and which are proximate to the sourcing regions, notably South Korea, Japan, and China. © 2018 The Authors.

pub.1102317968,The Role of Ethanol in Brazilian Economy: Three Decades of Progress,"Sustainable energy strategies require decision-makers in government, industry, academia and civil society alike to make choices among tradeoffs. Within the transport sector alone, ethanol has been shown to be the dominant solution among viable, low carbon options to date, yet questions remain over the economic and ecological impacts of this industry. In Brazil - the largest producer of sugarcane-based ethanol and a country with over three decades of ethanol development - we find a strong basis for evaluating the ethanol industry’s role in a national economy. In the mid 1970’s, Brazilian ethanol production received an important boost with the launch of the “Proálcool” program. The ethanol industry has subsequently evidenced flux until its consolidation in the period following 2000. Over the course of three decades, economic, institutional, technological and environmental determinants have factored in the success of Brazilian ethanol diffusion. In economic terms, price tradeoffs for ethanol vs. sugar and ethanol vs. gasoline played a role in scale-up of the biofuel together with balance of payment considerations. From an institutional standpoint, support for the Proálcool program, deregulation of the sugar-cane sector in the 1990’s and fuel pump adaptations also factored. With respect to technology, the development of flex fuel cars, greater use of mechanized harvesting, and launch of domestic, co-generated, electrical power were key drivers. Finally, in environmental terms, challenges associated with pollution and public health in major cities as well as questions related to climate change gained visibility. In this paper, we analyze a set of input-output tables for the Brazilian economy from 1975 to 2006, taking the above factors into consideration. Deriving a series of indicators, such as multipliers and linkages, we study the evolution of the ethanol sector’s role in the Brazilian economy and its relation to the productive structure of the country."
pub.1174268500,Sustainable Management and Advanced Nutrient Recovery from Biogas Energy Sector Effluents,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an effective technology for the sustainable management of organic agricultural waste, producing both biogas and nutrient-rich digestate. This study aims to review and evaluate different methods for obtaining valuable products from digestate, with a focus on innovative and sustainable approaches. The main objectives are to identify effective technologies for the recovery of nutrients and organic matter, assess their environmental and economic impact and outline the challenges and prospects in this area. The review covers established techniques (with a technology readiness level (TRL) of six to nine, indicating their maturity from pilot to full scale) such as struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping, which are very effective in recovering nitrogen and phosphorus from digestate and converting it into valuable biofertilizers. Struvite, for example, offers an option for slow-release fertilizers that reduces dependence on synthetic fertilizers. A comparative analysis shows that ammonia stripping can efficiently capture nitrogen and produce fertilizer without harming the environment. New methods, such as microalgae cultivation, use digestate as a nutrient source for the production of biofuels and bioplastics, contributing to renewable energy and sustainable material production. The study also examines composting and vermicomposting, where digestate is converted into nutrient-rich soil conditioners that significantly improve soil health and fertility. The production of biochar through pyrolysis is highlighted for its benefits in improving soil properties and sequestering carbon, providing a dual benefit for waste management and climate change mitigation. Membrane technologies, including ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO), are being investigated for their effectiveness in nutrient recovery, despite challenges such as membrane fouling and high operating costs. The study highlights the potential of these valorization processes to improve the sustainability and economic viability of AD systems and to align with circular economy principles. The results suggest that the continuous optimization of these technologies and the integration of recycling processes are crucial to overcome existing challenges and realize their full potential."
pub.1145403471,Green synthesis of biomethanol—managing food waste for carbon footprint and bioeconomy,"Various microbial treatments and value-added transformations to treat and manage wastes including food wastes (FW) from numerous sources have emerged as leading concepts. The ever-increasing FW from households, retail establishments and food service industry totals 931 MMT annually globally. Landfill, incineration and bioprocess of FW have their own advantages and drawback as a waste recycling and energy recovery solution. Bioconversion of FW to produce value chemicals and bioenergy forms through anaerobically operated semicontinuous bioprocessing after a systematic solid–liquid separation followed by pretreatment seems a viable solution. Thus, the FW properties and pretreatment strategies to enhance the recovery of biofuels as well as other value products need to be standardised. Various strategies investigated to valorise FW as value-added products to biofuel, bioactive compounds, bioplastics, etc., and generate revenue have their merits and demerits. FW generates higher volatile fatty acids that may lead to bioconversion process breakdown under acidic conditions, especially during a biological strategy. The Gram (-) Methanotrophs which are proteobacteria use methane as carbon source and energy to thrive. Methane, biologically repossessed by methanotrophs, is catalytically oxidised to methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO), an endogenous irreversible enzyme. The food waste biorefineries would ensure circular bioeconomy, the recovery of nutrient and energy. The review also discusses the circular economy strategies closing the energy loop through the food supply chain, in light of strong and weak sustainabilities. Innovative technologies through integrated biotechniques to realise valuable materials and bioenergy from FW with minimal waste generation are detailed."
pub.1114201967,A review of biomass gasification modelling," Currently around 10% of all energy generated worldwide comes from biomass. Most of this 10% is biofuel energy from the fermentation of corn and sugarcane. Fermentation of corn competes with the global food supply, and fermentation of sugarcane drives deforestation. Therefore, the renewable and sustainable growth of these two bio-based energy sources may not be desirable even if it is economically feasible. Biomass gasification by contrast is significantly more flexible in terms of the bio-feedstock or waste that can be processed to either produce biofuels or to co-generate electricity and heat on demand. Fluidized bed and entrained flow gasifiers already achieve promising economy-of-scale for fuel production whilst downdraft gasifiers are well-suited for small-scale heat and power co-generation. This superior flexibility of gasification both in terms of the feedstock type and also the energy generation or fuel production options, is what drives expanding research and implementation opportunities for biomass gasification. Research progress is accelerated by modelling work. This review is the first review in the biomass gasification modelling field to collect and analyze statistics on the growing number of gasification modelling studies and approaches used. The frequency of the various modelling choices made, and the trends this data reveals, is reported. For new researchers this review provides a succinct guide to the modelling choices that needs to made early on in a modelling study or project. A detailed methodology characterization is introduced that includes consequential modelling choices not explicitly addressed by prior reviews. To seasoned researchers this study provides the first statistical (as opposed to ad hoc or anecdotal) picture of what their fellow researchers are doing."
pub.1172115123,Effective Utilization of Tannery Waste for the Fabrication of Construction Materials,"The tannery is a well-established, age-old industry that has been substantially industrialized across all nations over time and contributes significantly to the global economy, but it also offers a serious threat to the environment due to its high water and more than 250 chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyl, chromium, sulfides, nitrates, and others, are utilized in the process, which results in the production of effluent with a high concentration of pollutants into the ecosystem. The ecosystem is severely impacted by a large-scale discharge of inadequately handled solid tannery waste (STW), which contaminates the soil, surface water, and groundwater resources and poses serious risks to human and animal health. Proteinaceous untanned and tanned waste make up STW, which must be properly treated for disposal in an environmentally friendly manner. Over the years, a number of strategies have been created STW should be reduced and recycled to produce renewable energy (biogas and biohydrogen), biofuels (biodiesel and briquettes), building materials, fertilizers, commercial items (adsorbents, animal feeds, proteins, fats, and enzymes), biodegradable packaging and non-packaging materials, and biodegradable packaging and non-packaging materials. In this book chapter, we will emphasize the utilization of solid tannery waste (STW) as useful construction material. A brief review of both traditional and modern methods for treating tannery industry effluent also covered the role of nanotechnology in the tannery industry. We can protect the ecology, aquatic wildlife, and human health by turning the problem created by solid tannery waste into a possibility, paving the path for a healthier and more sustainable future."
pub.1146287711,Sustainable production of DMF and EMF using inulin-rich raw plant biomass: Perspective towards biorenewable fuel,"2,5-Dimethyfuran (DMF) and ethoxymetylfurfural (EMF) are the emerging potential bio-based fuel candidates that can replace petro-based ones. These fuels possess physicochemical properties comparable to those required in gasoline engine performance, but they have more favorable properties than bioethanol. In current, two types of input substrates, hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) and fructose-based feedstocks are used to produce these fuel candidates due to their higher production efficiency. This bio-based production process has advantages in the sustainability point of view due to the low-carbon economy and resource renewability, but its economic issue is a significant roadblock in their industrial production mainly due to high production costs. Our proposed strategies afford significant information about their cost-effective production processes. One approach is to apply the direct conversion technology of inulin-rich raw plant biomass to these biofuels. Their direct use eliminates several processing steps required in the production process of both biofuels, contributing to reduction of their production costs The processes proposed can be performed in one-step processing systems consisting of 3–4 reaction elements: Feeding substrate, ionic liquid solvent, selected catalysts, and/or ethanol/additive. Their admixture is directly processed to the final products under the given reaction condition with no separation step of the major intermediates (e.g., HMF) occurring during the processing. The proposed strategies are less complicated and straightforward processes that have not been attempted before. Together with these strategies, bioengineering strategies are introduced for facilitating the efficiency of production processing and improving inulin content of the target plants, which can conduce to reducing their production costs."
pub.1145509928,Trends in Energy Security Education with a Focus on Renewable and Nonrenewable Sources,"Energy security education explores various issues, such as a secure and competitive economy and nuclear safety. In the context of energy transition and sustainable development, it also addresses the world’s reliance on nonrenewable and renewable energy sources. The aim of this study was to identify research trends pertaining to energy security education, paying particular attention to renewable and nonrenewable sources. This was accomplished with the use of mixed-method research in two steps. The first step was a text-mining and content analysis of publications on energy security education published on the Web of Science platform between 2016 and 2021. From 660 publications on energy security education, titles, abstracts, and keywords were extracted and analysed with NVivo software to identify the most frequent concepts on energy sources in publications. The concepts were associated with nonrenewable energy sources (coal, natural gas, uranium, petroleum, and fossil fuels), nuclear power, and renewable energy sources (hydro, geothermal, solar, tide/wave/ocean, wind, solid biofuels, biogases, liquid biofuels, and renewable municipal waste). The second step was conducting detailed searches with Boolean operators, where “energy security education” was juxtaposed with the distinguished keywords. All searches on energy security education showed that publication activity tended to decrease, while citations increased. The most explored topics concerned: “fossil fuels”, “oil, petroleum”, “renewable” energy, and “solar” energy sources. An increasing trend was observed for all renewable energy sources as well as selected nonrenewable sources: “oil, petroleum”, “nonrenewable”, and “coal”. Additionally, R-squared values were calculated to indicate the fit of the trendline to the model. Due to the technologically enhanced energy transition and didactic innovations, education focussing on energy sources is expected to remain in demand. Curricula will need to be revised in the future to better reflect this reality."
pub.1164909869,Investigations into the transition to sustainable alternative fuels in a South African underground platinum mine,"Adverse environmental impacts associated with the use of fossil fuels and the over-dependence thereon has made energy security and sustainability a critical issue worldwide particularly for key energy intensive economic sectors which are heavily dependent on diesel. We thus investigated the feasibility of a transition to two different alternative fuels namely, rapeseed methyl ester (RME) biodiesel and gas-to-liquid fuel (GTL), in the platinum mining industry in South Africa. Load haul dump vehicles are the most abundant workhorses underground and were the selected vehicles to test alternative fuels at 100% without any engine modification. Potential reduction of harmful unregulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions was the focus of the research due to their adverse impacts on the environment, human health and engine operations. Quantitative collection of gas and particle phase PAHs was made possible using portable denuder devices followed by analysis by two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results showed that total PAH emissions from a high idling vehicle decreased dramatically when diesel was substituted with both biofuels (total gas phase PAH concentrations of 34; 14 and 9 µg m-3 for diesel, GTL and RME, respectively) and no substantial hinderance on engine performance was reported. This novel sector specific study on unmodified heavy duty working vehicles can potentially translate into a real-world, immediate solution, as not only would the selected biofuels be able to directly replace diesel, but both have high potential of being locally produced in South Africa and assist in the promotion of a circular economy."
pub.1146807716,"Alternative valuation pathways for primary, secondary, and tertiary sewage sludge: biochar and bio-oil production for sustainable energy","Abstract
Wastewater treatment has sewage sludge (SWS) as the primary solid product. Producing biofuels from SWS through pyrolysis is based on the circular economy and biorefinery principles, thus offering an innovative way to create building blocks and combustibles, which is an environmentally friendly alternative for management. In this work, different raw sludges, primary (PS), secondary (SS), and tertiary sludges (TS), were collected after the primary, secondary, and tertiary sedimentation (overpassing the anaerobic digestion and dewatering process), conferring a feedstock with a higher organic matter content and saving costs. The PS, SS, and TS were pyrolyzed at 450 ºC in N2 atmosphere for biochar and bio-oil production and characterization. The product yields were 51.88–57.90%, 5.02–9.81%, and 32.51–42.90% for biochar, bio-oil, and py-gas. The SS biochar presented lower ash content and superior mass and energy yields, calorific power, fuel ratio, and more coal-like fuel than PS and TS. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis showed an overall composition without potentially toxic metals for solids. Chars formed after the pyrolysis presented irregular macro- and mesopores and a bulkier crystallographic profile. The combustion behavior of the produced biochar reported a solid fuel capable of more stable combustion than raw material. Infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance of extracted oil from raw sludge and bio-oils present carbon sp3, sp2, and carbonyls that refer to carboxylic acids, a potential feedstock in further second-generation waste biorefineries. The investigation provides insights into alternative routes for biofuels that may support growing cities in their waste mitigation and energy demands."
pub.1049398582,"Biohydrogen, For Future Engine Fuel Demands","Climate change, environmental impact and declining natural resources are driving scientific research and novel technical solutions. Green Energy and Technology serves as a publishing platform for scientific and technological approaches to ""green"" - i.e., environmentally friendly and sustainable - technologies. While the main focus lies on energy and power supply, the series also covers green solutions in industrial engineering and engineering design. Green Energy and Technology is a monograph series addressing researchers, advanced students and technical consultants, as well as decision makers in industry and politics. The level presentation ranges from instructional to highly technical. The modern world is facing three critical problems: high fuel prices, climate change, and air pollution.

pub.1163310712,Waste-to-Energy Pipeline through Consolidated Fermentation–Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) System,"The rise in population, urbanization, and industrial developments have led to a substantial increase in waste generation and energy demand, posing significant challenges for waste management as well as energy conservation and production. Bioenergy conversions have been merged as advanced, sustainable, and integrated solutions for these issues, encompassing energy generation and waste upcycling of different types of organic waste. Municipal solid waste (MSW) and agricultural residues (AR) are two main resources for bioenergy conversions. Bioenergy production involves feedstock deconstruction and the conversion of platform chemicals to energy products. This review provides a detailed overview of waste sources, biofuel, and bioelectricity production from fermentation and microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology, and their economic and environmental perspectives. Fermentation plays a critical role in liquid biofuel production, while MFCs demonstrate promising potential for simultaneous production of electricity and hydrogen. Fermentation and MFCs hold a significant potential to be integrated into a single pipeline, enabling the conversion of organic matter, including a variety of waste material and effluent, into diverse forms of bioenergy via microbial cultures under mild conditions. Furthermore, MFCs are deemed a promising technology for pollutant remediation, reducing COD levels while producing bioenergy. Importantly, the consolidated fermentation–MFC system is projected to produce approximately 7.17 trillion L of bioethanol and 6.12 × 104 MW/m2 of bioelectricity from MSW and AR annually, contributing over USD 465 billion to the global energy market. Such an integrated system has the potential to initiate a circular economy, foster waste reduction, and improve waste management practices. This advancement could play a crucial role in promoting sustainability across the environmental and energy sectors."
pub.1092996222,System Level Performance and Emissions Evaluation of Renewable Fuels for Jet Engines,"Incessant demand for fossil derived energy and the resulting environmental impact has urged the renewable energy sector to conceive one of the most anticipated sustainable, alternative “drop-in” fuels for jet engines, called as, Bio-Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (Bio-SPKs). Second (Camelina SPK & Jatropha SPK and third generation (Microalgae SPK) advanced biofuels have been chosen to analyse their influence on the behaviour of a jet engine through numerical modelling and simulation procedures. The thermodynamic influence of each of the biofuels on the gas turbine performance extended to aircraft performance over a user-defined trajectory (with chosen engine/airframe configuration) have been reported in this paper. Initially, the behaviour of twin-shaft turbofan engine operated with 100% Bio-SPKs at varying operating conditions. This evaluation is conducted from the underpinning phase of adopting the chemical composition of Bio-SPKs towards an elaborate and careful prediction of fluid thermodynamics properties (FTPs). The engine performance was primarily estimated in terms of fuel consumption which steers the fiscal and environmental scenarios in civil aviation. Alternative fuel combustion was virtually simulated through stirred-reactor approach using a validated combustor model. The system-level emissions (CO2 and NOx) have been numerically quantified and reported as follows: the modelled aircraft operating with Bio-SPKs exhibited fuel economy (mission fuel burn) by an avg. of 2.4% relative to that of baseline (Jet Kerosene). LTO-NOx for the user-defined trajectory decreased by 7–7.8% and by 15–18% considering the entire mission. Additionally, this study reasonably qualitatively explores the benefits and issues associated with Bio-SPKs.Copyright © 2014 by ASME"
pub.1176087448,Biorefinery Based on Multiple Raw Materials and Wastes for the Production of Energy: A Proposal Tailored to Southwestern Europe,"In this entry, the possibility of the implementation of a biorefinery based on multiple raw materials (from agricultural wastes, vegetable oils, etc.) is covered, pointing out the available technology to interconnect different processes so that the atom economy of the process is as high as possible, reducing the environmental impact and improving the efficiency of the energy or products obtained. For this purpose, this model is based on previous works published in the literature. The role of biorefineries is becoming more and more important in the current environmental scenario, as there is a global concern about different environmental issues such as climate change due to GHG emissions, among others. In this sense, a biorefinery presents several advantages such as the use of natural raw materials or wastes, with high atom economy values (that is, all the products are valorized and not released to the environment). As a consequence, the concept of a biorefinery perfectly fits with the Sustainable Development Goals, contributing to the sustainable growth of different regions or countries, regardless of their stage of development. The aim of this entry is the proposal of a biorefinery based on multiple raw materials, using different technologies such as transesterification to produce both biodiesel and biolubricants, steam reforming to produce hydrogen from glycerol or biogas, hydrothermal carbonization of sewage sludge to produce hydrochar, etc. As a result, these technologies have potential for the possible implementation of this biorefinery at the industrial scale, with high conversion and efficiency for most processes included in this biorefinery. However, there are some challenges like the requirement of the further technological development of certain processes. In conclusion, the proposed biorefinery offers a wide range of possibilities to enhance the production of energy and materials (hydrogen, biodiesel, biolubricants, different biofuels, hydrochar, etc.) through green technologies, being an alternative for petrol-based refineries."
pub.1134494828,"Anaerobic Digestion in Europe: Key to Waste Management, Challenges, and Perspectives","Anaerobic digestion is a natural occurring process developed by a wide microbial consortium. From it, CH4, a valuable biofuel, is produced from agro-industrial wastes. The European Union has an enormous potential to continue the development of this technology. Not only the countries within it are leading the discoveries and implementing novel strategies for the process, but also they have a large amount of usable resources as raw material. Furthermore, current policies for the adaptation of the circular economy and green technologies enhance the opening of biogas plants. It is possible to search for the improvement of the process by different means. For example, reactor design has a main task, which is to provide the adequate conditions to enhance microbial metabolism. On the other hand, there are technologies to improve biogas to biomethane, which can be injected to the grid in the form of gas or electricity. However, if the process is not sustainable from an energetic or economic view, the process has no sense. To know this, technoeconomical analyses are performed. This chapter describes the current political conditions that enhance the circular economy within the EU. In addition, examples of potential modifications in reactors’ design, response from co-digestion experiments, and potential substrates for the process are provided. At last, technoeconomical examples are explained too."
pub.1158520384,ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A BASIS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY,"The article substantiates the expediency of implementing organic agricultural production in order to ensure sustainable development and the restoration of post-war agriculture, and suggests ways of solving the problem of the utilisation of agricultural waste by agricultural enterprises. Methodology. In the process of research the scientific works of domestic scientists on the problems of development of entrepreneurship in the agrarian sector of economy were processed. In order to achieve the goal, general and special methods of scientific knowledge were used, namely: abstract-logical, methods of analogy and comparison, induction and deduction (for theoretical generalisation); monographic (for deepening the study of the state and features of development of agrarian entrepreneurship); formalisation method (for determining directions of solving the problem of waste disposal both in plant and animal production). Results. The results of the research show that entrepreneurial activity is spreading in Ukraine, because entrepreneurship contributes to the expansion of the field of application of agricultural labour, creates new opportunities for employment of the unemployed rural population and releases workers from inefficient enterprises. It has been established that the main task of these enterprises is to be competitive on the market and to sell products that are in demand by consumers. It was found that organic food products are superior to traditional products in terms of consumer parameters, but inferior in terms of economic parameters, especially price. It has been established that businesses, regardless of their form of ownership, are waste producers. It has been proven that the plant and animal husbandry sectors make a significant contribution to the generation of organic waste, and agricultural enterprises are therefore faced with the important task of effectively managing this waste. Practical implications. The introduction of zero-waste production is a decisive step towards the energy self-sufficiency of a farm by processing agricultural waste in biogas plants to produce an alternative fuel such as biofuel."
pub.1149108068,Current challenges of biomass refinery and prospects of emerging technologies for sustainable bioproducts and bioeconomy,"Abstract The depletion of fossil resources and the resulting global warming are the primary motivators for moving from a fossil‐based to a biobased economy. Biorefineries, like petro‐based refineries, offer a green and sustainable option for producing marketable biobased goods through decarbonization pathways, hence upgrading the bioeconomy. In the context of the industrial revolution, economic and environmental sustainability are critical in adopting biorefinery systems. However, biorefineries still face numerous hurdles. There are numerous technological, economic, ecological, sociological and long‐term issues throughout the biorefinery production chain. The key difficulties facing biorefineries today are acceptance in the present market of the ‘fossil‐based economy’, the composition and availability of feedstock, the quantities needed to meet the market demand, the efficiency of the resource recovery, techno‐economic viability and sustainability. Life cycle assessment may provide a thorough input on the environmental setting during process optimization, minimizing the biorefinery project's environmental impact. In this review, we outline the bottlenecks and obstacles that biorefineries face while producing biofuels from biomass, as well as how biotechnology and modern technology might help researchers to overcome them. Biorefineries need to optimize their biomass usage to generate products that properly fit the market expectations. These items should be cost‐effective when compared with fossil fuels. Currently, 85–90% of petroleum refinery output is used to make fuels, with only 10–15% going to the petrochemical industry to make organic compounds. To precisely match market demands, the biorefinery should produce the same proportion of fuels and organic compounds. To overcome the challenges, biofermentation, membrane technologies and oxidation processes, among other developing technologies, are drawing interest in several areas of biorefinery. Biorefinery systems necessitate a systematic process for identifying impacts and assessing their long‐term viability. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

This article focuses on assessing the environmental, technical, and energy viability of dark fermentation using life cycle assessment (LCA) and circular economy principles. Dark fermentation for biohydrogen production is an active and promising research field in the quest for sustainable biofuels. In this context, defining operational parameters such as organic loading and the substrate-inoculum ratio is relevant for achieving better production yields. Laboratory tests were conducted using organic loading values of 5, 10, and 15 g of volatile solids per liter (gVS/L) and with substrate-inoculum ratios (s/x) of 1, 0.75, and 0.5 g of volatile solids of substrate per gram of volatile solids of inoculum (gVSs/gVSi). The combination with the best performance turned out to be an initial organic loading of 10 gVS/L and an s/x of 1 gVSs/gVSi. From this result, it was determined that the s/x had a greater impact on production. Finally, a valorization plant was dimensioned with the scaled-up process, starting from the municipal solid waste generated by Bogotá projected for 2042. The scaling was demonstrated to be energetically sustainable, producing a power of 2,368,358.72 kWh per day."

                  During the decades past, the engine industries have witnessed a remarkable upsurge in the research and development (R&D) of modern technologies due to factors such as energy security and environmental concerns. Focus is on improved engine performance, sustainable energy, fuel economy, and minimal harmful exhaust emissions. Even though globally large database now captures modern engine technologies, a skillful presentation of those data is a demanding task. Based on this analogy, the authors made a conscious effort to brief audience on the various fuels used in Wankel rotary engine (RE) which is a type of internal combustion engine (ICE). Wankel REs various operating models, their merits, and demerits regarding modern engine technologies, the type of fuels and their utilization methods, and the future prospect of biofuel as its engine fuel has been made accessible in a subtle manner in this paper. In summary, this paper provides a wide scope review of basic principles that govern practical Wankel RE design and operation, the widely used single fuels and multi fuels in Wankel RE operation with their properties as well as emissions, and the practical Wankel RE design and operation in the present era and the prospects in the near future. It also outlines simplified frameworks of modern Wankel RE technologies structured in a systematic way to contribute to enhanced engine performance, sustainable energy, reduce fuel consumption, and reduce exhaust emissions in this pragmatic field."
pub.1058095456,Life-cycle assessment of five microalgae-to-biofuels processes of varying complexity,"“Cradle-to-gate” life cycle analysis surrounding five algae-to-fuel/fuel precursor scenarios was studied. The different processes modeled were: an open pond producing either triacylglycerides (TAG) or free fatty acid methyl ester (FAME); a solar-lit photobioreactor producing either FAME or free fatty acids; and a light emitting diode irradiated (LED-lit) photobioreactor-producing TAG. These processes were chosen from amongst the simplest to most sophisticated approaches available in literature. The scenarios of production with open ponds are close to being sustainable environmentally. On the other hand, the production scenarios with solar-lit and LED-lit photobioreactors are both far from being sustainable. The reason for this is the higher embedded and operating life-cycle impacts associated with the materials in the growth reactor (and some other equipment) in these two types of production facilities, as well as the artificial photon source used in the latter. Many difficult-to-achieve improvements are required to make these processes less energy intensive. Algae strains with higher lipid productivity as well as changes in the number, the complexity, and energy expenditures in operation steps are always required to reduce overall life-cycle impacts when production of commodity fuels is the focus. An important perspective to keep in mind with algae-based processes is that there are currently no significant economies-of-scale with the environmental impacts for growth systems, since they are additive above a baseline production level."

Indonesia has about 13,466 islands that have been named, 5.8 million km2 sea areas and the fourth longest coastline in the world with a total length of 95,181 km. Geographically, Indonesia is located in a strategic position of world cruise lines, between the continent of Asia and Australia and between Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Indonesian archipelago has only 28 islands which are not classified as small islands. This fact shows that Indonesia has more than 13 thousands small islands and 92 islands which are the outer small islands. Outer and small islands are potentially for economic development and national defense. Therefore, the number of energy needs increases. To fulfill the energy needs in the form of bio-diesel and bio-kerosene, the marine microalgae is the great potential. Nusantara Microalgae Park is a concept of marine microalgae cultivation area based on coastal societies in outer and small islands. Bio-diesel and bio-kerosene produced from this concept will be very helpful for people in fishing and cooking environmentally friendly. This concept can be integrated with Island Adoption Program, Cooperative Program and Transmigration Program.

pub.1181668788,A Review on Conversion of Agricultural Waste to Bioenergy: Processes and Environmental Impacts,"Agricultural waste is a substantial and underutilized resource with the potential to contribute enormously to sustainable bioenergy production. The conversion technologies for these wastes is a significant step in the bioenergy process, therefore analyzing their impacts on the environment is considered valuable. A review of current literature, with an emphasis on studies that examines the relationship between agricultural wastes, different conversion technologies of wastes to bioenergy, and their environmental impacts was carried out. Databases like PubMed, Google scholar and Web of Science were searched using keywords like “Lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis”, “bioenergy”, “Agricultural food wastes”, and “environmental impacts”. This review demonstrates how different conversion methods may alleviate climate change, enhance energy security while fostering sustainable development. We examined biochemical conversion methods such as anaerobic digestion and fermentation to show their advantages over the thermochemical approaches. It was found that these conversion processes are not only circular but also environmentally friendly with respect to biofuel production. Anaerobic digestion was identified as one of the most promising options because of its high energy yields and decentralized character. However, there are still issues in optimizing bioenergy conversion processes and conducting a comprehensive life cycle assessment that explains some of these challenges is required. This review highlights the current and emerging technologies for transformation of agricultural wastes into bioenergy and its environmental impacts, as it is necessary to transition into a bioenergy-driven economy to foster a healthy and robust future."

pub.1128973794,"Third-generation biorefineries: a sustainable platform for food, clean energy, and nutraceuticals production","Sustainable transformation of biomass into a wide range of valuable chemicals, fuels, and materials is the eventual goal of a biorefinery. Algal feedstock (microalgae and macroalgae) is a principal component of third-generation (3G) biorefinery empowering the bio-renewables industry. While first-generation (1G) biorefineries are commercially viable, products (fuels and commodity chemicals) from second-generation (2G) and 3G biorefinery are not yet commercially competitive due to the gross technical challenges, scalable and production cost issues. Because of the inherently diversified nature of feedstock used in 3G biorefineries, a myriad of specific bioproducts can be produced. Furthermore, stable food/feed supply, environmental concerns, climate change, and geopolitical issues have necessitated the exploration of 3G feedstocks into fuels and renewable chemicals. Considerable success has been seen in research laboratories in the last two or three decades which led to mature technical developments in algal biomass conversion. However, the scale-up issues are still posing a big challenge for the commercial exploitation of algal feedstock into fuels and chemicals. Nevertheless, various products such as nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics are successfully being produced from algal feedstock.

pub.1122034814,Biomass Conversion to Fuels and Value-Added Chemicals: A Comprehensive Review of the Thermochemical Processes,"  Fossil fuels have fueled the world economy for decades. However, given their limited nature, fluctuating prices and the escalating environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to develop and valorize cheaper, cleaner and sustainable alternative energy sources to curb these challenges. Biomass represents a valid alternative to fossil fuels, especially for fuel and chemical production as it represents the only natural organic renewable resource with vast abundance. A vast array of conversion technologies is used to process biomass from one form to another, to release energy, high-value products or chemical intermediates. This paper extensively reviews the thermochemical processing of biomass to fuels and high-value chemicals, with an emphasis on the process performance, conditions, and weaknesses. Technologies with great future prospects as well as those with possible linkage to CO<sub>2</sub> capture and sequestration are highlighted. The important chemical compositions of biomass feedstock, their conversion technologies and most importantly, the role of catalysis in their conversion to fuels, fuel additives, based chemicals, and added-value chemicals are also discussed. Special attention is given to biofuel production for transportation as this sector is responsible for the highest global greenhouse gas emissions, and has an emerging market with promising future prospects for sustainable large-scale biomass processing. The processes involved in the purification and upgrading of biomass-derived products into higher-value products are equally discussed and reviewed. "
pub.1046173557,Synthesis and Recommendations,"In this chapter, the main insights and lessons of the book are synthesized, providing an overview of trade flows and key findings on amongst others the importance of biomass trade in relation to policies, logistics, sustainability. Based on that, recommendations are formulated for policy makers, NGO’s, industry and academia how to further develop international bioenergy trade. The chapter is closed by a vision on future bio-based economy, international markets and trade. We show that while bioenergy trade is not a goal on its own, and that substantial challenges for the future development of global and international bioenergy trade may be expected in the coming decades, trade is a crucial prerequisite to balance demand and supply on an international scale and in a sustainable manner which will lead to the development of bioenergy as a carbon-neutral alternative to fossil fuels. At the same time, trade can mobilize rural areas around the world into becoming key energy producers and exporters which in turn can contribute to poverty alleviation and further development and modernization of the agricultural sector. However, such developments will need governance frameworks and best industry examples to ensure sustainable production, trade and use – and this book provides many state-of-the-art insights in what can be learned from current market experiences, certification efforts, logistics and preconditions with respect to policy and investment."

Food waste is poorly managed due to inadequate treatment practices, which has a harmful impact on the environment. This paper demonstrates the high potential for food waste valorization in Indonesia and outlines the optimal valorization pathways to inform future decision-making surrounding the management of this waste. This paper also compares various conversion technologies for transforming food waste into liquid, solid, and gaseous biofuels. The challenges and opportunities for wider implementation are also considered, including the integration of supply chains and the logistics of food waste management, the technological feasibility, and the persistent behaviors surrounding food waste and energy in Indonesia. The economic and environmental benefits, the perspectives of improved food waste management practices and sustainable fuels, as well as the policy landscape surrounding waste and sustainable energy are also explored. The challenges of scalability and commercialization are also highlighted in this paper. This review demonstrates the best pathways from food waste valorization to bioenergy, including biogas or biodiesel integrated with a black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) composting system.

An additional challenge of mitigating climate change also arises during the burning of fossil fuel. The fossil fuel-based transportation system in India that gives rise to air pollution has a worse impact on people. To overcome these problems, a sustainability assessment framework is introduced in this study. Ethanol, a member of the biofuel family, is one of the cleanest and most sustainable forms of energy sources. The purpose of this research is to develop a sustainability assessment framework to investigate the environmental feasibility of a supply chain system that provides an end-to-end solution and how it would benefit the transportation sector. A second-generation (2G) ethanol-based supply chain is envisaged, and agro-waste such as corncobs and paddy straw are considered in this study. The assessment is carried out using a heuristic-based method, known as particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, within the framework of circular economy. The results show that the biomass collection in the proposed area produces 2.5 tons of CO2 per hectare area on average, which is much lower in comparison to 996.6 tons of CO2 per hectare in the Middle East, the main source of fossil fuel. In the future, this research would benefit the enterprises and government organizations that establish 2G ethanol plants."

In the design of the process, significant efforts have been made to attain sustainable utilisation of natural resources. The paper discusses the essential issues to be taken into consideration when annual fibres are used in the pulp and paper industry. The paper focuses on the physical and chemical properties of the raw materials and their relationship with the environmentally friendly concept of cellulose and paper production. The chemistry and structure of the Chempolis process as well as certain properties relevant to pulp and paper qualities are described. The concept of the Chempolis process is based on three major stages: delignification, bleaching and recovery of acids. In acidic delignification conditions, the dissolution of silicon present in the raw material is prevented, while the nutrients are dissolved. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of xylan can be controlled. To minimise the cost of recovery, cooking chemicals are selected from the compounds which are formed during the processing of lignocellulosic. Alkaline TCF conditions are used in bleaching to enable totally effluent-free operation. The Chempolis process is based on a closed system. Apart from the bleached chemical pulp, the output flows include solid organic biofuel, which can be used to generate energy for the mill and fertilizer for the cultivation of raw material. Due to the simplicity of the process and the efficient raw material utilisation, the mill economy is attractive."

As a result of the problem with the supply of natural gas in factories and the large amount of greenhouse gas emissions during harvest season, sustainable solutions have been adopted. Meanwhile, converting citrus wastes into value-added products is key to achieving a more sustainable supply chain. Biofuels produced from liquid effluents and pruning from orchards can be substituted for natural gas in factories to meet the energy demands. In this study, the primary objective was to assess the environmental impacts of the entire supply chain of lemon and its by-products (from planting and cultivation to harvesting, processing and marketing) in Tucumán, Argentina, under different alternative energy scenarios using a life cycle assessment (LCA). Overall, replacing natural gas with renewable fuels has a lower impact on production and reduces CO2 emissions by 80%. Biomass may be used for these purposes, provided that it represents a revalued waste and is not merely used for energy generation. Furthermore, it is recommended that the pruned biomass be obtained from areas without irrigation, which will reduce the water consumption load.Graphical Abstract"

The benefits water and energy (W-E) provides are: on poverty reductions, economic progress-impairment on the ecosystems, but has quantified costs. In addition, it improves the health and in education, promotes stable society and human dignity and help in realizing basic human rights. When achieving developmental goals on W-E sustainability, it is of disadvantages that there will be an increase on water scarcity, high exposure to environmental degradation, e.g. floods and droughts etc., scaling energy prices which will reduce on access to W-E and in-turn increase poverty and by extension impact on natural ecosystems. By improving the performance optimization on W-E nexus; the resultant increase on energy efficiency; decrease water pollution, reduce costs of energy and water provision, increase access to services and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. The effective development of renewable energy worldwide would be a stabilizing driver on fossil fuel availability and global climate change. Water is especially important and used in large volumes in generating electricity, whether through green energy (hydroelectric power), or heat exchange (steam systems), and for cooling (nuclear). This paper presents some studies on algae formations instead of traditional agro-based raw materials, because it does not compete with food or fodder and is abundantly available in fresh water or marine ecosystem. The studies show that algal species can be used to produce biodiesel (biofuels). A comparative study was conducted using chemically pre-treated with NaOH and un-treated spirogyra biomass. The spirogyra biomass was subjected to saccharification process by the fungi Aspergillus Niger for hydrolysis, for six (6) days and then followed by the fermentation process by using yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for another 6 days. The comparative study experimented, and the results recorded showed that high yield of ethanol was obtained for un-treated Spirogyra biomass when compared to chemically pre-treated biomass. Additional studies reveal that inducement of fertilizer and other growth media can be used to increase the growth rate of biofuels production from algae. Oil produced from algae was esterified using CH3OH as catalyst. The properties of the biodiesel produced clearly show that biodiesel produced from green algae can be used to run engine. The experimental results show that the Flash point was 1350C, Pour point was 170C and Cloud point was 180C and are all in agreement with the standard of biodiesel (biofuels).

However, several challenges such as population growth, degradation and impoverishment of soil, contamination of natural resources, and faulty agricultural practices have hindered their growth and productivity. To address such issues, it is crucial to improve the food security while also protecting and promoting soil biodiversity and functionality through sustainable management practices. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses formed between cereals, oilseeds, and the Glomeromycota fungal group offer a promising solution for sustainable agriculture and food security. These symbiotic associations evolved approximately 400 million years ago, potentially aiding early terrestrial plants in nutrient uptake before the development of complex vascular root systems.This chapter provides an overview of recent advances in AM research aimed at sustaining and enhancing the agronomic potential of cereal and oilseed crops. We summarize the current understanding of AM responsiveness in these crops and explore the following questions: (1) Can these ancient symbioses still play a role in modern agriculture? and (2) How do various factors modulate the effects of AM on cereals and oilseeds in terms of production and quality?. By addressing these questions, our aim is to shed light on the potential applications of AM symbioses in contemporary agriculture. Additionally, we will highlight and discuss the factors influencing the beneficial effects of AM in cereal and oilseed production. This chapter underscores the importance of incorporating sustainable practices and leveraging the ecological advantages of mycorrhizal technology to ensure food security and promote the resilience of cereal and oilseed crops. The information presented here emphasizes the significance of a more sustainable approach toward enhancing crop productivity in the agriculture sector."
pub.1023476125,Critical Evaluation of Genetic Manipulation for Improved Productivity: Is This a Sustainable Agenda?,"Despite brilliant successes that have been achieved with the applications of genetic improvement in food production to sustain large monocultures and to compete in a global market economy, the chronic crises affecting agriculture have not been resolved. An expansion of mechanized, modern agriculture with intensive chemical use has contributed to the reduction in the farming population worldwide, thus destabilizing local economies and food security. Nevertheless, the emerging bioeconomy is supporting the cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops as the most advanced approach to improve the quality of life for all while successfully resolving the foreseeable, global challenges of providing adequate food, fiber, and renewable energy for a growing human population. The global area planted with GM crops has more than doubled worldwide in the last decade, especially in developing countries, and resulted in a reduction of cultivated germplasm due to the diffusion of a limited number of genetically improved varieties whose products are mainly directed toward the global market. Research foci for GM crops are purposefully oriented to make crops withstand harsh environmental conditions as the effects of global climate change rapidly alter the attributes of agricultural landscapes. Also, crops are genetically modified to yield more food, fiber, and renewable energy and to withstand the effects of pests and disease. These are additional, desirable goals of the GM research agenda, yet they can be meaningless if they are not delivered to local farmers with all the advice and integration which are the basis for achieving sustainable agriculture.This review presents a critical assessment of GM crops, their potentialities, and drawbacks based on a comprehensive evaluation of current literature reporting both positive and negative aspects of GM agriculture. The debate on this topic is extremely relevant. Recent findings on possible risks for human health about the most diffused genetically engineered traits suggest that an application of GM technology in agriculture should not be overestimated.Without denying the value that genetic engineering in agriculture may possess for certain agrarian contexts, we also discuss the possibility of applying sustainable crop management approaches to food production practices as a much needed alternative to increase biodiversity within cultivated fields. This and similar efforts recreate farming conditions that could make agriculture more sustainable, thus restoring ecological services useful for the entire ecosphere, while returning the added value of agricultural products to farmers."

The purpose of the study is to determine the harmful impact on the environment and human health caused by the operation of the spatial diesel transport units at mining facilities and to prove the feasibility of transferring them to innovative green technologies in combination with the use of special marketing tools. Analysis results. In the 21st century, environmental crises in Ukraine and other countries around the world have been significantly intensified due to anthropogenic activities, slowing down the development of economies and harming the health and well-being of citizens. A number of concepts have been proposed to address environmental, social, and economic problems, among which the concepts of sustainable development and green economy have taken a special place. The last one is particularly important in the context of this study, as it aims to ensure a more harmonious relationship between economic, environmental, and social components, and is directly related to green marketing and environmental management approaches. Therefore, marketing and management tools play a significant role in ensuring the sustainable development of the biosphere and society. This investigation is dedicated, first of all, to the mining industry of Ukraine, but the results are relevant to other countries too. From one point of view, the mining industry is one of the major drivers of the Ukrainian economy, but from the other – it also has a significant negative impact on the environment. Therefore, increasing the efficiency of operation and ensuring sustainable, environmentally friendly development of mining enterprises through the active implementation of ""green"" technologies within the framework of the above-mentioned concepts is an extremely urgent task, especially given that a lot of special equipment and transport units are operating on such enterprises. Conclusions and directions for further research. As a result of the study, it was determined that the effectiveness of the application of marketing principles for the sustainable development of the mining enterprises’ transport units opens up wide opportunities for improving the management of natural resources and, as a result, meeting human needs, achieving the goals of decarbonization and sustainable development of industry, and preventing global climate change. The implementation of even seemingly insignificant environmental innovations in the mining industry, and especially in its freight transportation, is a significant and very important contribution to environmental protection, sustainable development of society and the biosphere, smart usage of natural resources, etc. And improving the logistics schemes of such enterprises, as well as making fundamental changes and transformations in this area based on the widespread use of modern digital technologies is another very important step towards ensuring the sustainable development of freight transportation at mining enterprises.

This development has been accompanied by the massive production of animal manure with various bad odors and high heavy metal content, constituting severe damage to ecological security and human health. Traditional disposal methods, including composting and anaerobic digestion, are difficult to achieve satisfactory results due to long processing time, water and soil eutrophication, and toxic gas emissions. However, converting animal manure into bioenergy through pyrolysis is a clean, safe, and promising technique to reduce the amount of waste and produce valuable products. Co-pyrolysis with other materials can decrease the content of heavy metals in biochar and ameliorate the properties of products. The application of catalysts influences the pyrolysis process and product properties positively. The objective of this review is to analyze the properties of animal manure and discuss the recovery of biofuel from harmful animal manure by pyrolysis. A comprehensive analysis of animal manure pyrolysis and related product characteristics will provide a foundation for the sustainable management and scientific disposal of hazardous manure waste."

The petroleum energy sources are the major sources of energy for the global community and it has huge demand all over the world. These energy sources are likely to be the most contributing sources to the national economy. Bio-butanol is the newest type of alternative biofuel which has the potential to replace conventional petroleum fuels as its properties are similar to conventional engine fuels. Biobutanol obtained via Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation process using anaerobic Clostridium bacteria. However, this process has limitations because a higher concentration of Bio-butanol inhibits solvent producing bacteria activity. Hence, the continuous extraction of bio-butanol is needed to increase microbial activity. The pervaporation, membrane solvent extraction gas stripping, adsorption, liquid-liquid extraction are various energy-intensive processes used for separation using toxic, volatile conventional solvents. Ionic liquids are green designer solvents to extract bio-butanol from fermentation broth using liquid-liquid extraction process. In the present paper, review about bio-butanol, its separation methods and also separation using novel ionic liquids as a prospective extractant has been discussed."

pub.1165095373,"Soil, Not Oil","‘One of the world’s most prominent radical scientists.’—The Guardian This book is classic of the environmental movement. In it, Vandana Shiva envisions a world beyond our current dependence on fossil fuels and globalization, and makes the compelling case that food crises, oil dependency and climate change are all inherently interlinked. Any attempt to solve one without addressing the others is therefore doomed to failure. Condemning industrial agriculture and biofuels as recipes for ecological and economic disaster, Shiva instead champions small independent farmers. What is needed most, in a time of hunger and changing climates, are sustainable, biologically diverse farms that are better able to resist disease, drought and flooding. Calling for a return to local economies and small-scale agriculture, Shiva argues that humanity’s choice is a stark one: we can either continue to pursue a market-centred approach, which will ultimately make our planet unliveable, or we can instead strive for a people-centred, oil-free future, one which offers a decent living for all. This edition features a new introduction by the author, in which she outlines recent developments in ecology and environmentalism, and offers new prescriptions for the environmental movement."

pub.1158500953,Recent advances in carbon dioxide selective hydrogenation and biomass valorization via single-atom catalysts,"The utilization of fossil fuels has brought unprecedented prosperity and development to human society, but also caused environmental pollution and global warming triggered by excess greenhouse gases emission. For one thing, the excess emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), which has a negative impact on global temperature and ocean acidity, needs to be controlled. For another, the depletion of fossil fuels will eventually force people to seek alternative carbon sources to maintain a sustainable economy. Thus, using renewable energy to convert CO2 and biomass into value-added chemicals and fuels is a promising method to overcome urgent problems. The hydrogenation of CO2 is very important to mitigate the greenhouse effect caused by CO2, while biomass conversion can produce alternative renewable biofuels and green chemicals. As a kind of promising catalyst, heterogeneous single-atom catalyst (SAC) has received extensive attention in the past decades. SACs combine the advantages of homogeneous catalysts with uniform active sites and heterogeneous catalysts that are easily separable. In this review, we will give a comprehensive overview of the latest progress in CO2 selective hydrogenation and biomass conversion via SACs."
pub.1129218497,Bio-Based Chemicals and Materials,"According to a definition of the International Energy Agency Bioenergy Task 42 on Biorefineries, biorefining is the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable bio-based products, and bioenergy (Sanders et al., 2010). This concept is driven by two main aims, the substitution of fossil resources through renewable ones for the production of chemicals and transportation fuels, and the efforts made in connection with reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a change from crude oil as feedstock to renewable biomass. In addition to these two arguments always taken as the main justifications for an orientation toward a more biomass-based economy, there are some other aspects fostering this movement. They include an improvement of the public image of Chemistry in general and the Chemical Industry in particular, and the availability of (high value) compounds not obtainable via the traditional petrochemical route, thereby enlarging the portfolio of marketable products. Supportive policy measures as in the case of liquid biofuels are required to realize the ambitious aim to increase the value of bio-based chemicals to between 12% and 20% of the entire chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) until 2015."

pub.1169149414,Production and Characterization of Bio-alcohols from Agricultural Wastes,"With the implementation of modern innovative technologies in agriculture, productivity is raised with profuse waste generation globally. Most often, huge agricultural wastes are burnt (stubble burning) and release harmful emissions into the air. It causes concern to the public and animal health, productivity (land and water), and economic loss. Bio-alcohols from the fermentation of agricultural waste do not compete with food, support other energy resources, and contribute to a circular economy and employment generation, together with clean energy. At present, most countries allow blending of bio-alcohols with gasoline for low emissions, energy security, saving foreign exchange, and socioeconomic upliftment with employment generation. Commercially, bio-alcohol production for biofuel is dependent on substrates like cellulose content/fermentable carbohydrates, microorganisms for fermentation, pre-treatment processes, inhibitory/toxic compounds (furfural, ferulic, phenolic compounds), growth medium, fermentation mode (fed-batch/continuous), engine performance (spark ignition/compression ignition), etc. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the different aspects of bio-alcohol generation from agricultural wastes for sustainable, economically viable, clean bioenergy production."

Hence, they play several important roles in aquaculture and are known as a major source of the food chain for aquaculture organisms. Furthermore, they are also used indirectly or directly by humans as food supplements and medicines to improve health by strengthening the immune system. Microalgae are used as biocontrol agents because they have biocidal properties, produce biomolecules (beta carotene, PUFA, and astaxanthin), wastewater, are a renewable resource of biofuel, and are used in wastewater treatment. Due to the overexploitation of wild fish and pollution, aquaculture faces serious issues. Eco- friendly methods are required to overcome this problem, so, microalgae are in practicing, that control the water pollution. Fishmeal is a rich source of protein in aquaculture but it is decreasing over time and has become cost-effective, so, to solve the problem, microalgae are used to replace the fishmeal which (microalgae as aquafeed) is cheap and not required large area to grow. Microalgae are seemed to be very useful in the growth enhancement of aquatic organisms.  </p>"

Globally, 1,300 MT (million tons) of agro-wastes are generated per year; however, India contributes 350 MTs of its total production. The quantity and complexity of waste generated lead to various environmental pollution and economic issues. Crop residues, livestock, agro-industries, and aquaculture are the potential sources of agro-wastes. In general, these wastes are managed via landfill and incineration, which causes environmental pollution, followed by global warming. Thus, bioconversion of agro-wastes to value-added green products is highly essential to resolve issues linked with environmental pollution. Therefore, recent trends in agro-waste management strategies emphasize on integrated production of bioethanol, biopolymer, and single-cell protein (SCP) through syngas fermentation and volatile fatty acid (VFA) production via acidogenic fermentation. Further, these green products, viz., bioethanol, biopolymer, and SCP, are used as biofuel, bioplastics, and protein supplement, and VFAs can be utilized as a carbon source for various industrial product formation.

Their great potential in bioproduction and bioremediation has barely been exploited, particularly for the well-characterized red algae Galdieria sulphuraria and Cyanidioschyzon merolae. These and other Cyanidiales are excellent candidates for biotechnological enhancement and metabolic engineering for a broad spectrum of applications including the production of biofuels and thermostable colourants. In particular, extremophily, such as growth at thermophilic temperatures – up to 60°C – and at low pH and high salinity, make these algae unusually resistant to contamination and pathogens, and therefore potentially more commercially viable. We review existing applications of the Cyanidiales, as well as their available molecular tools. Their varied nutritional demands, from the broad heterotrophy of G. sulphuraria to strongly autotrophic C. merolae, along with their ability to grow to high densities, confer great potential as expression hosts. We also discuss the deficiencies that must be overcome to unlock further applications and ultimately to embed thermophilic red algae into a framework of circular and sustainable economic activity relying on bio-based sources."

Biodiesel is the sustainable and alternative fuel that derived from edible and non-edible oil produced from bio-originated species, plants, and animals. This paper presents the simulation analysis on the effect of fuel temperature variations on diesel engine performance and emission using palm-biodiesel. A one-dimensional numerical analysis, Diesel RK software is used to simulate a single cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine on the performance and emission when operated at a full load condition using fuel temperature variations ranging 300 K to 333 K. Results showed that simulated results for brake power and brake torque were 0.7% each when compared to the highest and lowest fuel temperature ranging from 333 K to 300 K. Moreover, higher fuel temperature for palm biodiesel tends to produce lower exhaust gas temperature and brake specific fuel consumption at a constant engine speed of 2400 rpm. It can be concluded that from the study, fuel temperature variations of biodiesel could produce a significant effect regarding engine performance and emission that influence the driving economy of the engine."

pub.1165988014,Distillation Separation of Bioethanol,"Bioethanol fuels from abundant biomass resources via fermentation have been long considered as an important bulk chemical and sustainable biofuel in the context of the circular economy. In the bioethanol production process, an indispensable step is the downstream separation of the dilute product from water-rich fermentation broth. This separation step was proved as one of the most energy-intensive steps in the whole bioethanol process and occupied a large percentage of the production cost. To decrease the energy requirement, continuous improvement of the bioethanol separation techniques was of great necessity. Compared with other emerging bioethanol separation technologies, distillation is a time-tested method and has been widely used in industry. This chapter is focused on the distillation for bioethanol separation. In the first part, the basic property of components in the bioethanol fermentation broth was introduced followed by discussing the thermodynamic behavior and the phase equilibrium. In the second part, the current advances and technical trends in bioethanol distillation, including the selection of sequences and process intensification, were reviewed. In the third part, techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment models for bioethanol distillation are briefly introduced."

pub.1130475170,Fossil energy price and outdoor air pollution: predictions from a QUAIDS model,"Cheap fossil energy leads to overconsumption of energy and hazardous levels of air pollution. In this study, we provide a framework to connect fossil energy price policy to private consumption of energy and outdoor air pollution. We used a consumer demand system and reassessed it for the recent status of the Iranian economy. We extracted household consumption information from Iran’s 2011 and 2014−2016 annual household surveys (n=154683), prices from the Central Bank of Iran’s detailed monthly price indices from 2008 to 2016, and air pollution information from Iran’s Energy Balance Sheets. We estimated that an average Iranian household would reduce its energy consumption by 2%, 16%, 29%, 38%, and 45% if energy prices were hiked by 10%, 50%, 100%, 150%, and 200%, respectively. The corresponding reductions in total outdoor air pollution in the post-hike period would be 2.6, 26.3, 47.6, 62.9, and 74.5 million tons, respectively. Besides highlighting the importance of fossil energy price policy as a short-term strategy to reduce air pollution, this study calls attention to shifting the existing subsidies on fossil fuels to sustainable sources of energy such as waste-oriented biofuels as a -long-term solution."
pub.1160198891,Electric Vehicles from an Economic Point of View,"Abstract  Research purpose. In recent years, the importance of moving from a linear economy to a circular economy in every area and sector of the economy has been discussed more than ever before. This includes discussions on a net zero energy system as the basis for a fully decarbonised electricity sector. The increase in demand for electricity and the push for net zero emissions are leading to a focus on using electric vehicles to meet the EU's sustainability targets. The European transport sector is responsible for a significant part of the European Union's total greenhouse gas emissions. The main aim is to evaluate the impacts of the automotive industry from an economic point of view because the increase in sales of electric cars can lead, among other things, to the mitigation of environmental problems.   Design / Methodology / Approach. Electric cars and biofuel cars are the two most discussed solutions in the transport sector. As EVs are sustainable to the extent that their energy sources are sustainable, the main aim of this research paper is to investigate the impacts of the chosen electric vehicle types from an economic point of view, especially the sales of electric vehicles in the time period of 2010-2021. Battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles' sales situation will be analysed in Europe and globally. The assumptions and hypotheses were set and verified through regression and correlation analysis.   Findings. The research results have confirmed our assumptions that the number of vehicles sold in Europe and worldwide is increasing with time. During the time period under consideration, electric car sales increased worldwide. 6,600,000 battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles were supplied in total in 2021, representing a 45% increase from the previous year.

pub.1182114368,Review of recent advances in utilising aquaculture wastewater for algae cultivation and microalgae-based bioproduct recovery,"Aquaculture operations produce large amounts of wastewater contaminated with organic matter, nitrogenous compounds, and other emerging contaminants; when discharged into natural water bodies, it could result in ecological problems and severely threaten aquatic habitats and human health. However, using aquaculture wastewater in biorefinery systems is becoming increasingly crucial as advancements in valuable bioproduct production continue to improve economic feasibility. Research on utilising microalgae as an alternative to producing biomass and removing nutrients from aquaculture wastewater has been extensively studied over the past decades. Microalgae have the potential to use carbon dioxide (CO2) effectively and significantly reduce carbon footprint, and the harvested biomass can also be used as aquafeed. Furthermore, aquaculture wastewater enriched with phosphorus (P) is a potential resource for P recovery for the production of biofertiliser. This will reduce the P supply shortage and eliminate the environmental consequences of eutrophication. In this context, the present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in a generation, as well as the characteristics and environmental impact of aquaculture wastewater reported by the most recent research. Furthermore, the review synthesized recent developments in algal biomass cultivation using aquaculture wastewater and its utilisation as biorefinery feedstocks for producing value-added products, such as aquafeeds, bioethanol, biodiesel, biomethane, and bioenergy. This integrated process provides a sustainable method for recovering biomass and water, fully supporting the framework of a circular economy in aquaculture wastewater treatment via resource recovery."
pub.1175538832,Advances and challenges in humic acid production technologies from natural carbonaceous material wastes,"Humic acids (HAs) play a crucial role in enhancing agro-environmental sustainability by acting as synergistic intermediaries between soil, water, fertilizers, microbiomes, and plant nutrition. Due to the slow nature of natural humification, advanced production and activation techniques are essential for efficient HA production. Cleaner valorization of natural carbonaceous materials (NCMs)—including mining byproducts such as lignite, brown coal, leonardite, weathered coal, and peat—into HAs is critical for advancing the global circular economy and providing sustainable solutions for soil rehabilitation and environmental restoration. This review comprehensively evaluates the latest advancements in HA production and activation technologies from NCMs. Various methods are analyzed, including extraction techniques, catalytic oxidation processes, microbial activation, hydrothermal conversion routes, and solid-phase mechano-activation methods. The findings highlight that catalytic oxidation techniques and free radical mechanisms uniquely enhance HA synthesis, while hydrothermal conversion routes offer an energy-efficient process with high HA yields and a low carbon footprint. This review also examines the reaction mechanisms and functionalization of HAs, detailing their emerging applications in agriculture, environmental management, biofuel production, energy storage materials, clinical treatments, medical and healthcare products, cosmetics, and animal feed supplements. Several improvement strategies for current production and activation methods are identified, and potential future research directions to maximize HA production are outlined. These insights aim to raise awareness within the scientific community about the vast potential of HA production and activation technologies, driving advancements in humification methods and contributing to the growth of a circular economy."
pub.1151633567,Transforming wastewater treatment plants in sustainable units coupled with local economies: Microalgae as resource recovery agents,"Besides reducing the sewage organic and nutrient load, microalgae-based wastewater treatments promote the recovery of important natural resources, such as N and P, which can be used for biofuels and animal feed production. In this context, the present study proposes a treatment system based on a circular economy and resource recovery of waste streams: an up-flow anaerobic reactor (UASB, widely used in developing countries such as Brazil) followed by high-rate algae ponds (HRAPs). Geographic Information Systems tools were used to select suitable areas for allocating the proposed system in Minas Gerais (Brazil). Two regions showed excellent suitability for allocating the UASB + HRAP system, with more than 70% coverage each. These areas cover 59 municipalities, with a production capacity of 43,565 m³/day of raw sewage, a volume that, after treatment, can be used for crop irrigation and fish farming. In addition, municipalities can produce 6621.9 kg/day of microalgae biomass. This biomass can generate 13.96 MWh/day of electrical energy, 1316.7 kg/day of nutrients for animal feed, 3.97 kg of β-carotene, 2576.3 kg of biodiesel, 132.4 kg of Omega-3, 198.7 kg of glycerol or 1125.72 kg of ethanol. Productivities were calculated from three by-product valorization routes of the suggested system: energy, agriculture, and high-value products. The proposed system improves current wastewater treatment standards in the selected regions, with the potential to generate valuable resources compatible with attractive economic activities from these areas."
pub.1131411885,Recent Developments in Low iLUC Policies and Certification in the EU Biobased Economy,"The development of a sustainable biobased economy (BBE) in Europe is associated with several challenges. Amongst others, lessons learned from the development of the biofuel sector and the complex debate around land use change associated with a growing demand for biomass have to be considered when developing BBE policies. In that regard, strategies to identify and verify feedstocks with low potential risks for direct and indirect land use change (iLUC) impacts are of specific importance. Complementing existing efforts to assess iLUC with modelling activities, the European Commission (EC) has proposed a risk-based approach, aiming to differentiate high and low iLUC risk biomass. Amongst others, different additionality measures can be used to produce certified biomass with low iLUC risk. However, a comprehensive overview and analysis of these additionality measures and the challenges related to their integration in an integer verification approach is still missing. Therefore, we analyse European Union (EU) policies dealing with iLUC, iLUC risk assessment studies, certification approaches, and iLUC modelling studies to identify and develop additionality practices potentially applicable in certification and to show how the potential application of the proposed measures could be realised and verified in practice. We identified five potential practices for low iLUC risk biomass production, which are likely to be used by market actors. For each practice, we identified methods for the determination of low iLUC risk feedstock and products. Finally, our review includes recommendations for follow-up activities towards the actual implementation of additionality measures in biomass certification schemes."
pub.1152725129,Use of hemicellulose-derived xylose for environmentally sustainable starch production by mixotrophic duckweed,"Schematic diagrams of xylose-enriched wastewater treatments and value-added product production by mixotrophic duckweed.
 Duckweeds are aquatic plants with considerable potential as substrates for environmentally sustainable production of bioenergy and proteins because of their extremely high starch and protein yields, and nutrient uptake capability from various wastewaters. d -Xylose is a common sugar that exists on earth and the main sugar element of lignocellulosic hydrolysate. Efficient utilization of xylose is necessary to reduce the high cost of duckweed-based biofuel production. In this study, the potential use of d -xylose by duckweed was tested for heterotrophy and mixotrophy. The results showed that duckweed was capable of mixotrophic growth but not heterotrophic growth on d -xylose, which suggested that photosynthesis was necessary for d -xylose metabolism, with 2.8-fold increases in biomass yields compared with that of photoautotrophy. Furthermore, d -xylose markedly boosted starch accumulation up to 9.7 times higher than in photoautotrophic duckweed, and promoted nutrient recovery efficiency. The present study showed that mixotrophic duckweed could use inorganic and organic carbon simultaneously, offering an attractive strategy to enhance the duckweed biomass production with a higher carbon capture efficiency from the surrounding environment, thus boosting starch and protein productivity for bioenergy and food conversion. The method developed in this study demonstrated novel applications in duckweed biomass-based renewable bioenergy production with inorganic and organic carbon capture combined with potential organic carbon wastewater treatment. This will enable the recycling of different carbons for various uses and realize a circular economy. "
pub.1154119276,Biodiesel in Circular Economy,"Recently, waste to energy projects regained international interest due to environmental concerns and sustainability agenda oriented to reduce waste generation while using these materials as feedstocks to produce low carbon energy. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel derived from vegetable and animal triglycerides. It is obtained through a transesterification reaction between a triacylglycerol and alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. Nowadays, the primary commercial feedstocks are edible vegetable oils. However, waste cooking oil (WCO) and residual fats are alternative feedstocks that can also produce biodiesel. They are available at a reasonable cost in urban areas, where food processing residues, either from residential, commercial, or industrial sectors, are relevant sources. These feedstocks have the lowest carbon emissions per litre of produced biofuel compared to fresh oil biodiesel. In 2019, the Mexico City government launched a Sustainable Energy Strategy to increase the contribution of renewable energies in its energy matrix. Particularly, in the case of the transport sector, the government has promoted, in alliance with Academic Institutions and public companies, the production of biodiesel from WCO to be consumed as a B10 blend in a pilot program for public transport. This model is expected to maximize the environmental, economic, and social benefits from the production of biodiesel since the four steps of the life cycle system would be located at the city perimeter, minimizing transport and distribution burdens. Thus, this chapter analyses the Biodiesel Program for Mexico City as a case study of biodiesel in the circular economy."

This chapter examines the policy space to develop sustainable agriculture while fueling transformation in the Mekong region based on research from the field. This research brings together evidence, pointing to the need for a paradigm shift in the food, energy, and water nexus toward greater policy integration. The use of bioenergy may promote energy security, revitalize rural economies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions if implemented at the local community level. However, meeting food and energy needs in the twenty-first century, especially in Southeast Asia, will require a range of approaches to shift the current development paradigm in order to enhance natural resource governance and climate-friendly agricultural practices. This research shows that if current practices prevail, Thailand is likely to use an unsustainable model of trade-led development at the regional level. To the end, this chapter puts forward an alternative development strategy to build on the synergies between small-scale initiatives and agro-energysustainability. However, evidence indicates that these synergies will be difficult to capture in the current policy climate that separates people’s well-being, social progress, and ecosystem sustainability from intensifying resource usein the Mekong."
pub.1147791195,A Review on the Production of C4 Platform Chemicals from Biochemical Conversion of Sugar Crop Processing Products and By-Products,"The development and commercialization of sustainable chemicals from agricultural products and by-products is necessary for a circular economy built on renewable natural resources. Among the largest contributors to the final cost of a biomass conversion product is the cost of the initial biomass feedstock, representing a significant challenge in effective biomass utilization. Another major challenge is in identifying the correct products for development, which must be able to satisfy the need for both low-cost, drop-in fossil fuel replacements and novel, high-value fine chemicals (and/or commodity chemicals). Both challenges can be met by utilizing wastes or by-products from biomass processing, which have very limited starting cost, to yield platform chemicals. Specifically, sugar crop processing (e.g., sugarcane, sugar beet) is a mature industry that produces high volumes of by-products with significant potential for valorization. This review focuses specifically on the production of acetoin (3-hydroxybutanone), 2,3-butanediol, and C4 dicarboxylic (succinic, malic, and fumaric) acids with emphasis on biochemical conversion and targeted upgrading of sugar crop products/by-products. These C4 compounds are easily derived from fermentations and can be converted into many different final products, including food, fragrance, and cosmetic additives, as well as sustainable biofuels and other chemicals. State-of-the-art literature pertaining to optimization strategies for microbial conversion of sugar crop byproducts to C4 chemicals (e.g., bagasse, molasses) is reviewed, along with potential routes for upgrading and valorization. Directions and opportunities for future research and industrial biotechnology development are discussed."
pub.1122072087,"8. Conception, design, and development of intensified hybrid-bioprocesses","The exponential growth in demand for energy, food/feed, and commodities driven by the increasing world population imposes tremendous stress on optimization of technology. The need for process development toward a greener industry and circular economy was the motivation to propose the UN sustainable development goals for 2050. Within this trend, bioprocesses offer the exploitation of renewable resources to be transformed into food, feed, chemicals, materials, or energy promising a long-term sustainable industry. Despite huge interest, many bioprocesses have shown technoeconomic constraints and even infeasibility due the trade-off between sustainability performance indexes. Therefore, further research is necessary to developing novel technologies for bioprocesses that can overcome current process constraints. However, this is not a straightforward task due to the particular complexity of bioprocesses such as the variance of raw materials characteristics and availability, lack of process understanding, complex systems interactions, bio systems sensitivity, reliability and reproducibility of experiments (uncertain information), and monitoring difficulties. These challenges imply that methodologies to conceive, design, scale-up, and operate intensified bioprocesses are still under development. This chapter highlights the importance of intensified hybrid bioprocesses and discusses the interdisciplinary approach required to accomplish it. We outline bioprocess hybrid technologies reported in literature and current challenges of bioprocesses intensification at different levels. We present an overview of important ideas addressed within methodologies proposed for designing hybrid bioprocesses. As case studies, hybrid membrane bioreactors for biofuels and organic acids production are used to show how process understanding drives developments in hybrid bioprocesses. Finally, some forthcoming challenges and perspectives are presented for future bioprocess development."

For the domestic consumption of crude palm oil in Malaysia increase gradually between 2.2 million tonnes in 2010 and 3.6 million tonnes in 2018. Besides that, Malaysia was one of the major oil exporters among the 10 countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the exports of palm oil constituted about 90% of Malaysia's palm oil production. The exports of palm oil in Malaysia fluctuated from 1.3 million tonnes in 2010 to 1.4 million tonnes in 2018 whereas the imports of Malaysia's crude palm oil also fluctuated significantly from 121,300 tonnes in 2010 to 108,600 tonnes in 2018. Recently, there were many accusations on palm oil in Malaysia due to the environmental unfriendly product by the European Parliament and decided to ban palm oil biofuel by 2020. This will have negative impact on the company value (company's share price) by reduction in the revenue for the palm oil production companies. Moreover, palm oil was one of the most important agricultural commodities in the world and it was also the fourth-largest contributor to the Malaysian economy. Malaysia's palm oil industry has been a prominent industry that created economic growth and development. Therefore, this research was very important because the world's palm oil production was growing every year, driven largely by the growth of the European Union's biofuel markets and food demand in India and China (Clay, 2013). The palm oil industry facing the another challenging issue was to demonstrate its commitment to sustainable palm oil production. To overcome this issue, many agricultural food industries were promoting certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) as proof of sustainability in the palm oil supply chain and achieved the buyer's demand (May, 2012). This situation has raised uncertainty to investigate the determinants of the company value in Malaysia's palm oil industry. Furthermore, there are many researchers had done the research over the past few decades, so there are many different perspectives on the determinants of company value in the palm oil industry in Malaysia.

Its cultivation has spread from Africa to Asia, South America and the Caribbean. Processing of the fruits to obtain the seeds leads to generation of some agrowastes; notably the pod and seed shell which are dumped on the farmland and in the market places. Though, kola nut has been explored for some industrial applications in the production of dyes, drinks and stimulants; its utilities have not been fully tapped. The pod, seed and seed shell contain a lot of phytochemicals that can serve as precursors to develop varieties of drugs among other potentials. Traditionally, the plant is an important component of ethnomedicine in West Africa to treat different ailments. In recent times, its parts, particularly pod, seed and seed shell have been valorized for high-end services such as in catalytic production of biofuel, development of low-cost adsorbents, production of enzymes, organic fertilizers and animal feeds as well as in the green synthesis of different nanoparticles for diverse applications.

pub.1134761171,"Algae and their potential for a future bioeconomy, landless food production, and the socio-economic impact of an algae industry","Despite being a comparatively new branch of agriculture, algae production is often considered to be a solution to many food security-related problems, such as land scarcity, climate change, inefficient and unsustainable fertilizer usage, as well as associated nutrient leakage and water pollution. Algae can be cultivated independent of arable land and, especially in the case of many microalgae, produce oil- and/or protein-rich biomass with spatial efficiency which far exceeds that of terrestrial plants. Nevertheless, algae and algae-derived products are almost exclusively produced for high-value, low-volume markets and are far from being able to compete with cheap commodities such as plant-based proteins or fossil fuel. High investment and production costs are considered the main reason for this, but a lack of economic incentives for sustainable production and CO2 mitigation should not be overlooked. The development of new production technologies; the monetization of ecosystem services, such as water treatment, CO2 sequestration, and nutrient recycling; as well as the simultaneous production and marketing of “high-value, low-volume” and “low-value, high-volume” products from the same algal biomass are the most promising ways forward. A sustainable “algae industry” could be an integral part of the future bioeconomy, enabling more resource-efficient food and fuel production and creating new products, companies, and jobs."
pub.1149623661,New emerging sectors,"The European Union has been promoting the concept of bioeconomy since the early 2000s. Other countries, including industrialised (US) and developing ones, have also published bioeconomy policies and strategies in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. The definition of bioeconomy includes both biotechnological innovations and the perspective of replacing resources, i.e., fossil fuels with biological resources. The bioeconomy is based on research and innovation in the biological sciences to create economic activity and public benefit. The bioeconomy is all around us; new pharmaceuticals and diagnostics that improve human health, higher-yield crops, novel biofuels that reduce oil dependence, and bio-based chemical by-products. The chemical industry plays a fundamental role in sustaining the global economy and supports innovative technologies and scientific advances in novel materials, less toxic products, renewable energy sources, environmental protection, energy-efficient industrial processes, and renewable raw materials. Green chemistry aims to create chemical products that eliminate the use of substances that produce hazardous effects in humans or the environment. In this respect, technological innovation is rapidly developing, providing the most environmentally friendly solutions for the sustainable development of future science and technology. Moreover, it offers improved cost-efficiency of technological processes with a reduced environmental load. Innovations are applied to produce life-saving pharmaceuticals, environmentally friendly agrochemicals, new enzymes for biocatalytic chemical processes, innovative renewable energy sources, achieve energy efficiency in chemical reactions, and create innovative materials while minimising environmental impacts. This chapter analyses specific emerging sectors that significantly impact the bioeconomy, such as bioenergy, bio-based chemistry, biochemistry, and biopharmaceutical sectors. The world is still excessively dependent on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs. Energy derived from fossil fuels accounts for 81.5% of total energy consumption in the United States, making fossil fuels the primary energy source. Bioenergy, which covers approximately 10% of the global total energy needs, is energy derived from biofuels directly or indirectly produced from organic material or biomass, including plant material and animal waste. The growth of the bioenergy market can be attributed to the growing shift to renewable energy sources and other energy sources that are not based on fossil fuels, such as solid biomass, biogas, and others. As one of the largest producers of liquid biofuels, North America is constantly consolidating its bioenergy market share by significantly increasing bioethanol production."

Among different pollutants, cadmium (Cd) is one of the most noxious heavy metals that travels the ecological chain via phytoplanktons and stagnates the nutritional quality of aquatic life. In the present study, Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2, a reported Cd-tolerant algal strain, has been subjected to detailed molecular investigations through metabolomics, gene expression, and biochemical analysis to dissect the pathways involved in Cd tolerance and the carbon flux channelization resulting in enhanced lipid/extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. The metabolic rewiring in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates, amino acid metabolism, and starch metabolism presented the robust machinery of the cells to channelize the carbon pools for producing neutral lipids of vehicular quality under Cd stress. Further, microalgal cells instigated a defense network comprising organic osmolytes (betaine, ethylene glycol, sugars), antioxidants (glutathione, ascorbate, etc.,) and amino acids (glycine, glutamate, alanine, valine, threonine) suggesting the interplay of glutathione-ascorbate and probable phytochelatin based detoxification pathways as double edge sword to impart tolerance and detoxification of Cd. Moreover, stress-induced response constituted significant changes in the membrane fluidity and production of biodiesel quality lipids along with soluble EPS having paramount biotechnological applications. The outcomes of this study altogether presented an efficient model of algal-based biorefinery approach integrating the process of heavy metal (Cd) remediation and production of biodiesel and value-added products that are essential for a sustainable and circular economy."

The Palm Oil Sustainable Production Program (POSPP) was an initiative to integrate industry plus family farming, and also to ""promote agricultural production sustainability"" for biofuel production purposes. In this paper are analyzed the creation process and implantation of the already referred Program in Amazon territory in Estate of Pará, conducted by the Government, causing significant effects on the local population and natural resources, such as land speculation and a new cycle of rural depopulation, an increase of deforestation, soil degradation, pollution of water resources due to improper use of pesticides, loss of biodiversity, and risks to human health. With this social-environmental problematic in perspective, the POSPP can't be identified as an agri-environmental policy and doesn't collaborate with sustainability. To do so, the Program must go along with public politics with more wide and structural aspects, such as land regularization, check of labor law, a ruling of pesticide use, and environmental protection. That said, experiments of agroecological production, sustainable management of forests, communal deals of fishery, etc. tend to be successful experiments of agri-environmental policies when local knowledge, environmental conservation, equal distribution of benefits and environmental risks are involved."

Nonetheless, there are opportunities to increase this share even further. One such opportunity is the adoption of biorefineries that could represent a viable and sustainable alternative to replace the need for oil, coal, natural gas and other non-renewable energy sources with biomass. The fact that biomass has the flexibility to be converted into distinct outputs such as electricity, biofuels, charcoal and chemicals, along with the uncertainty regarding market prices, may allow the firm to create value from the optimal exercise of these embedded options. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze if converting a biomass power plant based on Elephant grass into a biorefinery adds value to the project and if the proposed biorefinery is economically feasible. The analysis was conducted by adopting a hybrid commercialization model where part of the plant's power generation installed capacity was sold through a 20 year long-term fixed supply contract and the remainder was optimally negotiated in the short-term market in the form electricity, charcoal or ethanol. The results show that all option values are positive ranging from approximately 90–101 million dollars, which indicates that they add value to the project. In addition, the resulting NPVs of all biorefinery strategies were positive, which indicates that biorefineries using the commercialization scheme proposed in this study represent a feasible and interesting opportunity for a sustainable energy matrix diversification."
pub.1147503404,1 Comprehensive biomass characterization in preparation for conversion,"Biomass materials have an important role for a sustainable low-carbon economy. Hence, comprehensive characterization is important especially when this material is being prepared for conversion processes. Physical and chemical properties of biomass materials are so diverse that the pathways for conversion are as complicated as well. This chapter presents all possible conversion pathways for numerous biomass types as well as corresponding characterization needs. When biomass materials are used for replacing commercial fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and natural gas, there are representative biomass resources that are ideal feedstock for each of these conventional fuels. Thus, the characterization process differs. For example, sugar and starchy crops are most ideal for the production of bioethanol, a biofuel that is now currently being mixed with gasoline. Oil crops on the other hand are ideal for making biodiesel, likewise a biofuel blended with diesel. Most other lignocellulosic biomasses are ideal for other processes such as methane (natural) gas production. Proper characterization of sugars, starches, oils, and cellulose contents in biomass becomes very important. Many of these analyses are quite complex and this chapter presents some important characterization procedures. When biomass is prepared for thermal conversions, different sets of characterizations are used. The most important of which is the heating value via a ubiquitous calorimeter as well as its ultimate analysis (i.e., elemental carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S)). This analysis also leads to the specification of the approximate “chemical formula” of the biomass important to calculate the air-to-fuel ratios via thermal conversions. The most routine characterization for thermal conversion is the proximate analysis that includes determination of moisture content (MC), volatile combustible matter (VCM), fixed carbon (C), and ash. Likewise, for thermal conversion, the determination of eutectic point or the melting point of the ash is important due to the behavior of this ash in the formation of slag during high-temperature conversion. Thus, one must be able to evaluate the tendency of the biomass material for slagging and fouling phenomena and must be avoided for sustainable operation of thermal conversion facilities. One primary issue with the use of large volume of biomass is the logistics in transport. Hence, the physical properties are important. Ideally biomass must be densified for effective transport, moisture reduced while bringing the particle sizes to minimum. There is usually a limit in the transport of biomass over longer distances for economical use. Hence, numerous biomass conversion facilities are now decentralized or mobile and numerous on-site biofuels production systems are being developed, thereby transporting only highly valuable products. Finally, highly valuable biomass materials are now being produced such as circuit boards, furnit"
pub.1146292483,Biomass Production and Energetic Valorization in Constructed Wetlands,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) are nature-based solutions for wastewater treatment, constituting an economically and environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional treatment units. CWs may provide various ecosystem services, including safe sanitation, water purification, uptake and removal of nutrients and pollutants, biodiversity promotion, regulation of climate conditions, and landscape improvement. Moreover, these systems can be considered as a bioresource providing a plethora of valuable assets, including treated water that can be reused to irrigate energy crops, and production of biomass. The biomass harvested from CWs can be composted and used as a soil amendment or can be converted into renewable and sustainable energy. This can be achieved, for instance, through direct combustion and biogas and bioethanol production. Indeed, rising attention is being given to the contribution of the biomass of plants colonizing CWs for energetic purposes, closing cycles in a circular economy. The present chapter focuses on the potential of biomass retrieved from CWs as an energetic resource. Several points are addressed, namely the type of plant species that can combine high biomass yields and water treatment efficiency, as well as the main factors that influence their growth performance in CWs. The impact of nutrient loading in influents, the time of the year, the number of harvests on plant biomass production, and its potential for valorization were also addressed. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are nature-based solutions for wastewater treatment, constituting an economically and environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional treatment units. CWs may provide various ecosystem services, including safe sanitation, water purification, uptake and removal of nutrients and pollutants, biodiversity promotion, regulation of climate conditions, and landscape improvement. The global energy demand will increase in the coming decades, keeping in consideration the expected rising of world population associated with the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the high industrialization, especially in developed countries. The use of marginal and contaminated lands for feedstock production to the energy sector appears as a suitable alternative, minimizing the conflict between food and biofuel production. Sludge treatment wetlands, and reed bed-based systems intend to provide a sustainable solution for the sludge produced in the conventional wastewater treatment plants."
pub.1153901176,Economic assessment for vegetable waste valorization through the biogas-biomethane chain in Italy with a circular economy approach,"The current geo-political framework and the environmental concern about pollution and global warming are leading Europe to rethink its energy production, moving forward to the incentivization the renewable energy market. In this scenario, the use of waste from the agri-food sector shows a huge potentiality to enhance the transition in line with the circular economy principles. Biogas production represents an environmental friendly strategy to successfully recover large amounts of waste and by-products to produce renewable energy. Furthermore, in light of the rising need of green biofuels, biogas can be converted into biomethane, allowing the implementation of a full circular model. The objective of this paper is to perform an economic assessment to evaluate whether the upgrading of an existing biogas plant, in which the diet includes also vegetable waste from a plant producing frozen vegetables, could be profitable considering different scenarios, to reach a sustainable circular model. The analysis will be conducted through the Discounted Cash Flow method, considering four main indexes: NPV, DPBT, IRR, and PI. The results highlight the unprofitability of the biogas-biomethane chain if the upgrading system is performed maintaining the same characteristics of the starting plant. On the other hand, if changes in the digester's diet occur, the investment becomes immediately profitable in the considered time-span. The circular economy model is not completely accomplished, as profitability can only be reached if silage maize is partially kept as feedstock. Moreover, the conversion of the plant is not economically feasible if an adequate subsidy is not provided. The economic assessment of the upgrading system for biogas to biomethane is an essential element to be provided to the agribusiness entrepreneurs, as they need all the relevant economic aspects to decide to invest and adopt this solution to establish an innovative circular business model in agriculture."
pub.1128898186,Algal Biorefinery for the Extraction of Bioactive Compounds," Background: Algae, tiny photosynthetic microorganisms are under investigation for commercial biofuels and biochemical production. Applications of bioactive compounds of algal origin are now increasing for food, feed, fodder, fibre, cosmetics, nutraceutical and pharmaceuticals. Recent years have witnessed a major thrust moving towards a sustainable, biobased economy using a biorefinery concept. The biorefinery concept is based on obtaining a broad spectrum of products such as biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, jet fuels, and many value-added biobased products from renewable bioresources analogous to the petroleum refinery.   Methodology: The aim of this review is to provide an insight into the utilization of algal biomass for the production of bioactive compounds, algal cultivation systems, cell disruption techniques, challenges to algal bioactive compound extraction, and offer a way forward. According to this objective, we did a comprehensive search in all available electronic information resources like in Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct.   Result: The review summarizes representative bioactive compounds from algal biomass, indicating that these biological resources are an inexhaustible source of new molecules that often display unique structures and sometimes have very interesting pharmacological properties, such as antifungal, antibacterial, enzyme-inhibitory, and other activities. A better cultivation and cell disruption strategy have been suggested for a sustainable algal biorefinery system.   Conclusion: The paper reviewed different bioactive compounds like astaxanthin, DHA, EPA, vitamins and β-1,3 Glucan, etc. present in microalgae and their applications in pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals development for human consumption along with major steps of algal bioprocessing, such as algal cultivation and cell disruption. Also, the production and role of several high-value compounds extracted from algal biomass in the treatment of various diseases along with the way forward to make algal-based biorefinery for bioactive compounds economically sustainable and viable have been discussed. However, research on various aspects of algal based bioactive compound extraction is in a nascent phase and requires bioprospecting of high yielding native algal species, development and deployment of mass cultivation strategies, process optimization for harvest and cell disruption techniques followed by efficient biomolecule extraction procedures to make algal biorefinery sustainable and commercially viable in nature.

pub.1168388654,The Dynamics and Potential of Carbon Stocks as an Indicator of Sustainable Development for Forest Bioeconomy in Ghana,"Sustainable forest bioeconomy (SFB), as a multidimensional approach for establishing mutual benefits between forest ecosystems, the environment, the economy, and humans, is a nature-based solution for a promising future. The study aims to evaluate the potential of carbon stocks (Cstocks) and variability for SFB. It is hypothesized that the decrease in Cstocks is related to an increase in population and agriculture, which caused a decrease in forest area and growing stock and consequently affected SFB. Primary and secondary data were collected from the field, national, and international databases, and analyzed using some statistical and geospatial software packages including IBM SPSS 29.0, CANOCO 5.0, and ArcGIS 10.5. The results revealed that large forest areas were converted to arable lands between 2000 and 2020. Across the forest zones, the aboveground and belowground Cstocks varied significantly, with the aboveground biomass being higher than the belowground biomass. The main drivers of Cstocks were politics and governance (57%), population growth (50%), soil degradation practices (50%), and socio-cultural beliefs (45%). Cstocks had significant negative correlation with population growth, carbon emissions, forest growing stock, forest loss, and the use of forest for biofuel. Evergreen forest zones (rainforest and moist) had more Cstocks than the moist deciduous and swamp/mangrove forests. The study demonstrated that the variability in Cstocks over the last three decades is attributed to an increase in population and agriculture, but Cstocks variability between the forest-vegetation belts could be better explained by differences in trees abundance than population. The study also revealed that the increase in Cstocks contributed to the realization of many SDGs, especially SDG 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 15, which in turn support a sustainable forest bioeconomy. Future study is necessary to evaluate Cstocks in individual tree species, biodiversity, and other forest ecosystem services to promote SFB in the country."

pub.1150685792,Agricultural Waste-Derived Management for Bioenergy: A Paradigm Shift in the Waste Perceptions,"Waste management is a global issue facing all the economies of the world. It is estimated that 2 billion tonnes of agricultural waste is generated annually, with organic waste making up to 80% of this amount. Waste generation and its mismanagement come with severe consequences such as flooding, climate change, poor health, lost productivity, and damage to businesses and tourism; and agricultural waste is responsible for 21% of greenhouse gases, globally. Nevertheless, over the years, several approaches have been widely deployed to tackle this big issue; this includes waste reduction, reuse, recycling and reclamation for energy, with overarching benefits of food and resource security, sustainable production and consumption, poverty reduction, and sustainable energy. Therefore, this chapter focuses on how what has been tagged “waste” is being used to generate useful energy. Firstly, an outlook of the general waste management is put in perspective, touching on prevailing practices and waste handling techniques from inception to the point of disposal; this is followed by an insight into climate change, the impact of associated natural and anthropogenic factors and their correlation with waste management. Next, an assessment of the various waste-to-energy conversion technologies—exploring their suitability to individual feedstock, i.e. via direct combustion, anaerobic digestion, gasification and torrefaction. The chapter also focuses on the proper applications of waste-to-energy, which include power generation, hydrogen production, biofuel, etc. It concludes by presenting some of the advances made so far in biomass conversion technologies. The chapter tries to simplify the complexities associated with agro-waste generation, conversion and utilisation, and reiterates the dangers of accelerated climate change, hence, promoting a paradigm shift in the perception of waste from discarding to reuse."
pub.1160409615,"Technical and market analysis of biomass gasification: Case study in Alentejo, Portugal","Alentejo is an extensive Portuguese region dominated by agroforestry and agro-industrial activities that generate significant amounts of biomass waste. These wastes are potential feedstocks that can be converted into new marketable products and therefore contribute to the development of new bioeconomy systems. Regionally, Alentejo has established innovation development policies that target sustainable technologies for waste valorization as one of the bioeconomy areas showing the greatest economic potential. Although these facts stimulate the motivation in developing a regional and more sustainable economy based on the use of energy sources with low carbon emissions, there is still a significant gap regarding technological know-how and attractiveness of technology investors and other stakeholders to the Alentejo region. This work focuses on gasification as one of the technologies to fulfill this competitive potential, in which local waste feedstocks can be processed into renewable biofuels providing answers to current decarbonization challenges and policies. In particular, the market and technology potential of gasification in Alentejo to position this technology in terms of the regional strategy for innovation and development is reviewed. The study revealed that Alentejo has the right spatial and market features for the development of a local bioeconomy based on gasification technologies both in terms of resources and market agents. However, different processes must be combined with gasification to convert the gas into the desired product, such as water-gas shift + pressure swing adsorption (for hydrogen production), methanation (for methane production), and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (for aviation and diesel fuels production). Agricultural residues present the best potential for producing renewable gases and liquid fuels, with estimated amounts of 450 kt/year and 232 kt/year, respectively. Overall, Alentejo presents good conditions to be a regional lead market in terms of sustainable technologies, but the region should focus on establishing its competitive advantage in terms of regulation and technology development."

pub.1175128097,"Valorization of Marine Waste Towards the Production of High-Value-Added Products, Bioplastics, and Other Industrial Applications","The maritime environment is a largely unknown and underappreciated source of functional components that can be employed in a variety of applications such as food preparation, storage, and enrichment. Marine microorganisms could provide new bioactive compounds with potential human use. Marine biomass embodies a biotechnological resource characterized by a wide range of compositions and functional attributes stemming from diverse bioactive elements such as polyphenols, peptides, and polysaccharides. Covering over 70% of the Earth’s surface, oceans and seas are vital contributors to the global economy, serving as both critical zones for the fishing industry and essential logistical pathways for mineral extraction and fossil fuel utilization. These activities all result in waste. The creation of high-value-added products from these by-products has accelerated recently due to the discovery of a wide range of biopolymers, nutrients, and functional chemicals that may be used for human consumption or in the pharmaceutical, animal feed, and other sectors. The concept of valorization, a sustainable method of turning marine garbage into useful resources, is explored in this book chapter. Additionally, the book chapter adopts a thorough thematic approach to the valorization of marine trash, covering the main contributions made by marine biotechnology to the creation of a circular economy. These contributions range from energy and valorization for biomedical enrolments to bio remedial enrolments for pollution.

pub.1175934667,Evolution of global water footprints of crop production in 1990–2019,"Crop production has the largest water footprint (WF) of all economic sectors and ranks as a leading cause of water scarcity. Despite this, our understanding of historical changes in global WFs of crops remains limited. In this study, we analyse the recently published dataset on green and blue WFs of 175 individual crops in 1990–2019. We explore the main changes in unit WFs (expressed in m3t−1 yr−1) and WFs of production (m3 yr−1) and connect the observed changes to various physical and socio-economic drivers. We find that nearly 80% of crops reduced global average unit WFs (required less water per tonne) as crop yields improved and cultivation centred around more productive areas. However, the total WF of crop production increased by 30% as these productivity gains were insufficient to compensate for cropland expansion of mostly water-intensive crops. Close to 90% of the increase occurred between 2000–2019 likely driven by accelerated economic growth, globalisation, changing diets, and production of first-generation biofuels. Among crops, we observe the largest increases for oil palm fruit, soya beans, and maize as they became the main providers of crop-based nutrients, animal feed, and biofuels for the modern economy. Among regions, most of the increase occurred across the tropics, mainly in Indonesia, Brazil, and Nigeria. However, India, China, and the USA had the largest WFs of production over the study period. Humanity consumed 6.8 trillion m3 of water (87.1% green) to produce crops in 2019. This number is likely to increase in the future which may exacerbate already existing environmental and socio-economic issues. Thus, it is important to transition to more water-sustainable agrifood systems. Much potential still exists in increasing crop water productivity, shifting production to less water-scarce geographies, and rethinking our dietary and industrial consumption patterns."

Microalgae have shown tremendous potential as a major source of biomass production that can be used as biofuels. At the same time, gas hydrogen is a non-polluting energy source because it is produced from renewable sources. This study aims to analyze the harvesting efficiency of Dunaliella salina using electrocoagulation with a helix electrode and having HHO gas as hydrogen fuel. D salina harvesting using an EC reactor made of acrylic is done on a batch scale. Helix-shaped type 304 stainless steel is the cathode, and solid cylindrically-shaped Fe is the anode. The voltage set is 20 Volts, while the electrolysis time is varied between 1. 5. 10. 15. 20. 25 and 30 minutes. The harvesting efficiency of D salina using electrocoagulation with a helix electrode was the highest at 84.74%. The highest concentration of dissolved hydrogen gas was 1.753 ppm. The highest volume of HHO gas was 1978 mL resulting from a 30-minute electrocoagulation with a helix electrode, 20-volt voltage. Nanoscale glovaries are formed on the electrode through heterogeneous nucleation at the solid-liquid interface. After nucleation, the nanobubbles grow, and the buoyancy forces of the growing bubbles cause gas release from the cathode surface. This process continues until it causes many bubbles to produce 1978 mL HHO gas for 30 minutes. During the study, the convex HHO gas formed helped remove coagulated D salina floc through electro-flotation. When the time of D salina harvesting using electrocoagulation with a helix electrode significantly affects D salina harvesting efficiency, gas HHO volume, pH, and temperature, harvesting time has no significant effect on dissolved hydrogen gas concentration and ORP.&lt;/p&gt;</p>"
pub.1123954103,Molecular and Genetic Strategies for Enhanced Production of Heterologous Lignocellulosic Enzymes,"A desire to move away from fossil fuels toward more sustainable, renewable, or carbon-neutral sources has motivated the search for alternative feedstocks. Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive option due to its abundance, low cost, and high sugar content. In nature, the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass is a sequential process involving the collective contribution of numerous microorganisms and enzymes. In biorefineries, however, the high cost and limited availability of the enzyme cocktails required for efficient biomass deconstruction are significant barriers to the adoption of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock to produce biofuels and other value-added products. Filamentous fungi have an astounding capacity to secrete digestive enzymes into their extracellular environment through the presence of efficient systems for the transcription, translation, folding, posttranslational modification, and secretion of polypeptides. These features have led filamentous fungi to be exploited for the manufacturing of homologous and heterologous proteins for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biofuel industries. Total homologous (native) enzyme expression can reach about 10–100 g/L, but heterologous enzyme production is hampered by much lower concentration. Efficient heterologous protein production often requires multilevel optimization strategies for both the protein and the expression host as factors limiting production are often protein-specific and bottlenecks can exist at any stage from transcription and translation to folding and secretion. Here, we review the molecular and genetic strategies used for the particularly challenging case of heterologous enzyme production in filamentous fungi, with an emphasis on the enzymes involved in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. The development of efficient expression systems and hosts to identify, characterize, and enhance the expression levels, yields, and activities of heterologous lignocellulosic enzymes is critical to the successful adoption of lignocellulosic biomass into the new bio-economy."
pub.1013707496,Study on the effectiveness of spent waste sugarcane bagasse for adsorption of different petroleum hydrocarbons water pollutants: kinetic and equilibrium isotherm,"This study investigates the capability of spent waste sugarcane bagasse (SWSB), obtained from bioethanol production process, for biosorption of diesel oil and kerosene, in an attempt to be applied for wastewater treatment with an enrichment of the SWSB for its use as a renewable solid biofuel. The chemical composition, microstructure, surface morphology, and reactive surface functionalities of the adsorbent were determined. Effect of different pH, salinity, initial pollutant concentrations, temperatures, and adsorbent dosages were also studied. The results showed that the sorption of petroleum products depends on the adsorbent material and the adsorbate type. The biosorption was favorable, where the SWSB removed 63–41% of diesel oil and 70–50% of kerosene in solutions containing 5–20% w/v of these contaminants. The kinetic equilibrium was reached after 6 h and the biosorption follows the pseudo-second-order rate expression. The SWBS expressed good biosorption capacity 44–86 and 78–110 mg/g over a wide range of pH and salinities. The biosorption potential increased with increase in the temperature and decreased with increase in the biosorbent dosage. The sorption may be partly due to absorption/partitioning of pollutants onto the SWBS and partly due to adsorption onto the surface of SWBS. The linear, Freundlich, and Temkin models could provide adequate fit for sorption onto the SWSB, while Langmuir model provided the best adequate fit at low temperature. The analysis of the obtained isotherm data proved the predominance of chemisorption and the endothermic nature of the biosorption process. The calorific value of the SWSB recorded ≈32.91 and 33.61 MJ/kg for SWSB after biosorption of diesel oil and kerosene, respectively. The results recommend the applicability of the low cost, readily available, sustainable and environmentally friendly SWSB for wastewater treatment, and production of a renewable solid biofuel, which would have positive impact on economy, energy, and environment."
pub.1167286542,A systematic review on biofuel production and utilization from algae and waste feedstocks– a circular economy approach,"Energy demand on a global measure grows continuously due to increased population, industrialization and economic growth. Fossil fuel resources that are currently available are definitely not sufficient to meet the growing demand. In addition, the continuous emissions from automobiles and industrial sectors should be attended to so that a complete remedial and sustainable alternative for fossil fuels is obtained. The appropriate replacement for fossil fuel is biofuel, as they are renewable and eco-friendly. First generation and second generation biodiesel derived from various sources are extensively researched and experimented practically by the past researchers. This article summarizes a continuous and comprehensive assessment of different feedstocks needed for third and fourth generations of biodiesel. Various sources of feedstock, steps for biodiesel production, yield of biodiesel obtained through different methods, properties of biodiesel like fatty acid profile, density, viscosity, cetane number, flash point, cloud point, economic feasibility and considerations are also discussed. Third generation biodiesel like microalgae can be widely used in CI engines. It is observed that their performance and combustion analysis in a CI engine is determined by the physico chemical properties of obtained biodiesel and nature of feedstock. Species selection and cultivation methods of microalgae, future perspectives of cultivating techniques and lipid production are summarized in detail. Fourth generation biodiesel like solar fuels and synthetic biomass production are covered, though their application in various energy fields is still not revealed. The type of transesterification that best suits the free fatty acid profile of fuel is selected and other reaction parameters like reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst quantity and oil methanol molar ratio are explained individually for third generation feedstocks. Proper adoption of suitable methods would help in yielding the maximum biodiesel. Future energy demand can be dealt with by the combination of various third and fourth generation oil feedstocks."

Dual-fuel combustion can potentially reduce the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot which are characteristic of diesel diffusion flame. The in-cylinder blending of different fuels to control the charge reactivity allows for lower local equivalence ratios and temperatures. The use of ethanol, an oxygenated biofuel with high knock resistance and high latent heat of vaporisation, increases the reactivity gradient. In addition, renewable biofuels can provide a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based fuels as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, ethanol–diesel dual-fuel combustion suffers from poor engine efficiency at low load due to incomplete combustion. Therefore, experimental studies were carried out at 1200rpm and 0.615MPa indicated mean effective pressure on a heavy-duty diesel engine. Fuel delivery was in the form of port fuel injection of ethanol and common rail direct injection of diesel. The objective was to improve combustion efficiency, maximise ethanol substitution, and minimise NOx and soot emissions. Ethanol energy fractions up to 69% were explored in conjunction with the effect of different diesel injection strategies on combustion, emissions, and efficiency. Optimisation tests were performed for the optimum fuelling and diesel injection strategy. The resulting effects of exhaust gas recirculation, intake air pressure, and rail pressure were investigated. The optimised combustion of ethanol ignited by split diesel injections resulted in higher net indicated efficiency when compared to diesel-only operation. For the best emissions case, NOx and soot emissions were reduced by 65% and 29%, respectively. Aftertreatment requirements that are generally associated with cost and fuel economy penalties can be minimised. Combustion efficiency of 98% was achieved at the expense of higher NOx emissions."
pub.1010397457,Landscape futures analysis: Assessing the impacts of environmental targets under alternative spatial policy options and future scenarios,"Environmental targets are often used in planning for sustainable agricultural landscapes but their impacts are rarely known. In this paper we introduce landscape futures analysis as a method which combines linear programming optimisation with scenario analysis in quantifying the environmental, economic, and social impacts associated with achieving environmental targets, on a landscape scale. We applied the technique in the Lower Murray in southern Australia. Landscape futures models were used to identify specific geographic locations in the landscape for six natural resource management (NRM) actions such that regional environmental targets are achieved. The six potential NRM actions that may be undertaken to achieve environmental targets include remnant vegetation management, ecological restoration, conservation farming, deep-rooted perennials, and the production of biomass and biofuels feedstock for renewable energy generation. We developed landscape futures under four alternative spatial prioritisation policy options and four future climate and commodity price scenarios. The impacts of each landscape future were calculated across a range of environmental, economic, and social indicators. The external drivers, climate change and commodity prices, and internal decisions such as policy options for spatially prioritising NRM actions, both have a strong influence on the costs and benefits of achieving environmental targets. Illustrative results for the cleared agricultural areas in the Mallee region indicate that whilst achieving targets can have substantial environmental benefits, it requires large areas of land use and land management change, and is likely to be costly (up to $348.5 M per year) with flow-on impacts on the regional economy and communities. Environmental targets can be achieved more cost-effectively through spatial planning. Costs can be further reduced if markets are established for carbon, biomass, and biofuels to enable landholders to generate income from undertaking NRM. Landscape futures analysis is an effective tool for supporting the strategic regional NRM policy and planning decisions of how best to set and achieve environmental targets."
pub.1125583855,"Characterization of economic and ecological advantages and challenges in development of conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon, non-hydrocarbon and renewable energy sources for resource-based economy in Kazakhstan","<p>In global socioeconomic development facing climate change challenges to minimize the output of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and moving to a more low-carbon economy (LCE) the major driving force for success in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the cost of energy generation. One of the main factors for energy source selection in the power supply and energy type generation process is the price parameters often influenced at different degree by government policies incentives, technological and demographic challenges in different countries. We research the energy sources situation and possible development trends for developing country Kazakhstan with resource-based economy. In general, the economic aspects affect the quality and quantity of energy generated from different sources with incentives for environmental concern. Traditional energy sources in Kazakhstan, such as coal, oil and natural gas remain low-cost in production due to high reserve base, which leads to steady growth in this area. In general, the cost for generating 1 kWh of energy from the cheapest carbon source of energy sub-bituminous coal is about 0.0024 $, for natural gas 0.0057 $, conventional oil 0.0152 $ (conventional diesel is 0.0664 $) and for expensive unconventional oil 0.0361 $, whereas renewable hydrocarbons could potentially become more competitive with unconventional oil production (methanol 0.0540 $, biodiesel 0.0837 $, bioethanol 0.1933 $ for generating 1 kWh). Furthermore, we consider the main non-traditional and renewable energy sources of energy from the sun, wind, water, and biofuels, hydrogen, methane, gasoline, uranium, and others. There is a difference between the breakeven prices of conventional gas and biomethane (0.0057 $ and 0.047 - 0.15 $ respectively averaging 0.0675 $ per 1 kWh for biomethane) which is often related to the difference in their production methods. The main advantage of biomethane is environmentally friendly production. We also propose an assessment of fuel by environmental characteristics, where one of the hazardous sources Uranium is forth cheap 0.0069 $ per kWh, but the environmental damage caused by its waste is the greatest. At the same time hydropower is seven times more expensive than uranium, but it does not cause direct health damage issues, however influencing significantly ecosystem balance. Hydrogen fuel is the most expensive among others. Overall in Kazakhstan energy-producing from the sun, wind and biogas is more expensive comparing with global trends from 0.4 to 5.5 cents per 1 kWh, but remains cheaper for hydropower. In addition, based on the research findings we analyzed the potential for sustainable non-renewable and renewable energy development in the future for the case of the resource-based economy in Kazakhstan. </p>"
pub.1154615551,An Overview of Biogas Production from Anaerobic Digestion and the Possibility of Using Sugarcane Wastewater and Municipal Solid Waste in a South African Context,"Bioenergy production from waste is one of the emerging and viable routes from renewable resources (in addition to wind and solar energy). Many developing countries can benefit from this as they are trying to solve the large amounts of unattended garbage in landfills. This waste comes in either liquid (wastewater and oil) or solid (food and agricultural residues) form. Waste has negative impacts on the environment and, consequently, any form of life that exists therein. One way of solving this waste issue is through its usage as a resource for producing valuable products, such as biofuels, thus, creating a circular economy, which is in line with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 5, 7, 8, 9, and 13. Biofuel in the form of biogas can be produced from feedstocks, such as industrial wastewater and municipal effluent, as well as organic solid waste in a process called anaerobic digestion. The feedstock can be used as an individual substrate for anaerobic digestion or co-digested with two other substrates. Research advancements have shown that the anaerobic digestion of two or more substrates produces higher biogas yields as compared to their single substrates’ counterparts. The objective of this review was to look at the anaerobic digestion process and to provide information on the potential of biogas production through the co-digestion of sugarcane processing wastewater and municipal solid waste. The study deduced that sugar wastewater and municipal solid waste can be considered good substrates for biogas production in SA due to their enormous availability and the potential to turn their negative impacts into value addition. Biogas production is a feasible alternative, among others, to boost the country from the current energy issues."
pub.1135848148,"Technologies, challenges and perspectives of biogas production within an agricultural context. The case of China and Africa","The use of fossil fuels in modern economies has been a success because of the low cost of fossil resources. However, the depletion of fossil reserves, the increase in waste production and global warming concerns have led to increased research on the production of biofuels from renewable resources. Waste production is steadily increasing in quantity and constantly changing in quality, creating enormous risks for the environment and, consequently, for the health of the population. This situation is much more worrying in developing countries, in particular because of the considerable delay in the field of the conversion and recovery of biomaterials, due to their difficulty in approaching the problem in a way that fits their context. The composition of such wastes and residues, rich in organic matter, allows their conversion via biochemical mechanisms, thus constituting an effective solution to address the environmental problems of their disposal. Anaerobic digestion remains a valuable and effective technology for transforming these biomaterials into biogas. The present review focuses on technologies, challenges and areas of application of biogas, especially in China and some African countries, in order to promote the large-scale use of biogas for electricity generation and biofuels. Results point out that China is more used to this technology, while African countries still rely on traditional and less advanced technologies, thus hampering the potential derived from the large availability of biomaterials. Both realities, however, share similar backgrounds about the dimension of the biogas plants and their non-commercial purposes, even if China is recently shifting toward the adoption of a different model. These considerations are used in the article to open an interesting new scenario of political alternatives which may provide a way out from poverty and economic dependence, within the framework of a wider circularity."
pub.1175018829,Dilemma and strategies for production of diesel-like hydrocarbons by deoxygenation of biomass-derived fatty acids,"The valorization of biomass to produce biofuels has become a heavily investigated field due to the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental concerns. Among them, the research on deoxygenation of fatty acids or esters derived from biomass as well as municipal sludge organics to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons has become a hot topic. Fatty acid is a key intermediate derived from ester hydrolysis, therefore has attracted more attention as a model compound. In this review, we first introduce and compare the three reaction pathways of hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation and decarbonylation, for the deoxygenation of fatty acids and esters. The preference of reaction pathway is closely related to the type of raw materials and catalysts as well as reaction conditions. The special purpose of this review is to summarize the dilemma and possible strategies for deoxygenation of fatty acids, which is expected to provide guidance for future exploration and concentrates. The atom utilization along with stability during reaction in a long time is the most important index for commercial economy. Herein, we propose that the rational design and delicate synthesis of stable single-atom non-noble catalysts may be the best solution. The ultimately goal is aiming to develop sustainable production of green diesel hydrocarbons."
pub.1169281918,"18 Potential risks, toxicology, stability, economic feasibility, and environmental impacts of biomass conversion","It is expected that global energy consumption would increase by roughly 28% by 2040 compared to 2010 levels. Biomass has potential as a source of energy for the generation of both solid and liquid fuels. Biofuels may replace fossil fuels, helping to lower the world's emissions of warming gases caused by humans. In the context of a more sustainable economy, the manufacturing of chemicals from renewable feedstocks is becoming an appealing sector for speculation by businesses. From a technological standpoint, there is a lot of room for bio-based alternatives to replace industrial chemicals and materials made from fossil fuels. However, improved manufacturing methods and cheaper prices mean that chemistry based on fossil fuels continues to dominate. Biological feedstocks are best processed in integrated biorefineries, which are comparable to conventional petroleum refineries in that they can generate both bio-based compounds and energy carriers. The difficulty is in demonstrating not only the technological and commercial viability but also the environmental viability, in the form of reduced effect across the whole manufacturing chain. This chapter compares and contrasts many methods for economically and sustainably transforming biomass. Biomass conversion technology and their effects on the environment are also discussed."
pub.1151140263,Post-Industrial Use of Sugarcane Ethanol Vinasse: A Systematic Review,"Vinasse is a toxic pollutant if it is poured into the ecosystem indiscriminately; despite this, it integrates components that make it valuable in nutrients and water. However, its use has been questioned due to the costs involved in its purification. This systematic review focuses on the valorization of vinasse from the studies performed for its post-industrial use. Trends in vinasse management and bioproduct development were analyzed. The PRISMA statement was used as a formal guide for collecting and analyzing 131 studies from 2018 to 2022. We determined that biological processes are the most used to obtain the benefits of vinasse, obtaining up to three post-industrial bioproducts. While it is true that there is a predominant trend of studies focused on the generation of biofuels, it must be noted that the beginning of the sucro-alcohol chain was the agricultural field. In this sense, we determine that 14% of the studies treat vinasse for agricultural reuse purposes, so, under Circular Economy principles, the reincorporation of vinasse into the agricultural field to take advantage of its goodness in nutrients and minerals as a sustainable and eco-efficient alternative should be a research trend that accelerates the consumption of vinasse generated in alcohol distilleries."
pub.1145717526,Sustainable Transportation,"Reducing emissions from transportation is critical to the success of tackling the broader global greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. Transportation is responsible for 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions, including 27% and increasing for the European Union and 28% for the United States, not including emissions from petroleum production. This chapter provides an overview of the law and policies that most directly affect greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, as well as the range of technologies available to do so. Specifically, it covers the various sources of transportation emissions, from per capita driving kilometers to burning fossil fuels used in a variety of transportation activities. It provides an overview of law and policy approaches that reduce driving kilometers and improve overall transportation efficiency, such as land use changes and transit investments. The chapter then summarizes the key clean fuel technologies that can reduce transportation emissions, including low-carbon biofuels, hydrogen, and battery electric vehicles, and offers examples of law and policies around the world that have proven to help expedite the deployment of these low- and zero-emission fuels. These mechanisms include mandates and incentives for clean transportation and subsidies and support for private sector action."

Process integration to yield various high-value bioproducts is implemented to raise profitability and sustainability. By incorporating a circular economy outlook, recirculation of resource flows is maximized to yield economic and environmental benefits through waste minimization. However, previous modeling studies have not looked into the opportunity of integrating productivity reduction related to the continuous recirculation and reuse of resources until it reaches its end of life. In this work, a novel multi-objective optimization model is developed centered on an algal biorefinery that simultaneously optimizes cost and environmental impact, adopts the principle of resource recovery and recirculation, and incorporates the life cycle assessment methodology to properly account for the environmental impacts of the system. An algal biorefinery involving end-products such as biodiesel, glycerol, biochar, and fertilizer was used for a case study to validate the optimization model. The generated optimal results are assessed and further analyzed through scenario analysis. It was seen that demand fluctuations and process unit efficiencies have significant effect on the optimal results."
pub.1128500127,Bio-oils from microwave assisted pyrolysis of kraft lignin operating at reduced residual pressure," Every year approximately 50 million tonnes of lignin are obtained worldwide as by-products of the paper industry and represent a potential renewable aromatic feedstock for a sustainable future carbon economy. In spite of this the availability of lignin remains largely unused so long the most part of it (ca. 98%) is still burned. For this reason pyrolysis-based technologies, such as fast pyrolysis and gasification, are considered promising methods for converting lignin into biochemicals, biomaterials, and biofuels. In this work the pyrolysis of kraft lignin were studied at reduced pressure under Microwave Assisted Pyrolysis (MAP). Experiments were carried out at different pressure (1 bar, 0.13 bar, 0.013 bar) also using a fractionating system. A multimode MW (Microwave) batch reactor was employed as oven using carbon as MW absorber. The most relevant achievements were gained at residual pressure of 0.013 kPa obtaining a 37 wt% of bio-oil in 9 min. Compositions of bio-oils were evaluated through 1H NMR, FT-IR ATR and a quantitative GC–MS method. Analysis showed high concentration of multisubstituted aromatic ring and light linear/cyclic compounds (C2-C5) from advanced thermal degradation of side chains of the lignin structure."

Here, the feasibility of applying enzymes produced on-site to obtain nanocellulose was evaluated using eucalyptus cellulose pulp as a model feedstock. A systematic analysis of the structural properties of the nanomaterials obtained after hydrolysis using a cellulolytic enzymatic complex with high endoglucanase specific activity (17.09 IU/mgprotein), produced by Aspergillus niger, followed by sonication, revealed that longer ball milling pretreatment and reaction times favored extraction of the cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). The highest yield (24.6%) of CNCs was achieved using 96 h of enzymatic hydrolysis of the ball-milled cellulose pulp, followed by sonication for 5 min. The CNCs presented approximate lengths of 294.0 nm and diameters of 24.0 nm, and the crystallinity index increased from 57.5% to 78.3%, compared to the cellulose pulp that was only ball milled. These findings demonstrated that nanocelluloses could be successfully extracted using on-site produced enzymes and that the sustainable integrated process reported here could contribute to the development of the nascent biobased economy."
pub.1099870799,Palm biomass waste as supplementary source of electricity generation in Ghana: Case of the Juaben Oil Mills,"The purpose of the study was to examine the potential of palm biomass, taking a case of the Juaben Oil Mills in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, which has over the years generated electricity for its operations from its waste products and other benefits that have accrued to the company and the host community. Primary data collection and intensive desk study approaches were employed albeit qualitatively, to describe the use of palm biomass as supplementary source of electricity generation in Ghana. The study showed that there is enough potential (waste by-products) for electricity generation to supplement current production from hydropower to meet growing demand. However, policy and institutional arrangements do not easily allow generation and extension for communal benefits. The authors therefore recommend a relook at existing policy and institutional arrangements to help promote this alternative source of energy for efficient and sustainable domestic and industrial uses. We also argue that ensuring efficiency in energy generation calls for R&D into its commercial potential and explore more efficient means of managing industrial and other agro biofuel wastes in developing economies. Future energy policy must also create and harness diversity of available biomass resources and reduce the delivery risks of the resources."
pub.1175726715,Valorization of agro-industrial waste for pectinase production and its influence on circular economy,"Pectinases are a diverse group of enzymes that play a crucial role in modifying or breaking down complex pectic substances. Pectinases are widely distributed among bacteria, fungi, and plants. The global demand for microbial pectinase has significantly increased due to its broad applicability and efficient catalytic capabilities across multiple industries including food processing, textiles, and biofuel production. Their commercial production often relies on expensive substrates, contributing to economic inefficiency and environmental burdens. Utilizing agro-industrial waste and microorganisms for pectinase production offers a rational solution to two interconnected challenges: the cost-effectiveness of enzyme production and the environmental impact of waste generation. Moreover, the valorization of waste materials not only contributes to efficient enzyme production but also exemplifies a circular approach by minimizing environmental impact and promoting sustainable resource efficiency to bioprocessing. This review offers a thorough examination of microbial pectinases, including their production from agro-industrial waste, their various industrial applications, and the current market landscape. It also delves into recent advancements in enzyme development and optimization techniques that have significantly boosted the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of pectinase production. By highlighting these developments, the review emphasizes the potential for this approach to enhance industrial practices and contribute to environmental sustainability."
pub.1169028213,General Background and Introduction of Biojet Fuel,"Biojet fuel, sometimes referred to as aviation biofuel, is a substitute fuel produced mostly from plant-based renewable resources. It is made specifically to be used in aviation, primarily in jet engines, as a replacement for conventional jet fuel. In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the aviation industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, the idea of biojet fuel was developed. A variety of feedstocks, biomass, and algae are being used to make biojet fuel. The carbon footprint of biojet fuel is smaller than that of conventional jet fuel. In addition, biojet fuel has a higher energy density, which could lead to superior fuel economy and longer flight distances. The use of biojet fuel does not necessitate material modifications to aircraft engines because it can be blended seamlessly with regular jet fuel. As a result, airlines can use the fuel without experiencing any changes to their current infrastructure. In order to move toward a more environmentally friendly and sustainable aviation sector, the aviation industry, as well as governments and environmental organizations, continue to fund research, development, and implementation efforts to advance the production and use of biojet fuel."

However, free β-glucosidase is relatively unstable, costly and difficult to recover. Immobilization of β-glucosidase may help to improve its reusability and stability, allowing developing a sustainable low-carbon and resource-efficient circular economy. BG was immobilized by adsorption on synthesised tannic acid templated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (TA-MSNPs). The synthesis procedure adopts a green templating agent cheap and biocompatible. Textural and morphological characterization was performed. We studied the effect induced by the morphology, pore size and surface features of supports, by using different amounts of templating agent, on the catalytic performance of the biocatalyst. The immobilization procedure used preserved most of the secondary structure of the enzyme and consequently its catalytic activity. The biocatalyst exhibiting the best activity and operational stability is obtained with the sorbent prepared with the largest quantity of tannic acid. In this case, the mesopores are too small for the enzyme to enter them, and the large amount of adsorbed enzyme is due to its peculiar surface features, favouring the formation of a multilayer enzyme corona."
pub.1118022730,Rapid Dissolution of Lignocellulosic Plant Materials in an Ionic Liquid,"Concerns regarding the non-renewable nature of, and pollution from, petroleum derived energy and commercial products has led to the concept of a biomass economy. As part of this vision for a society based on sustainable biomaterials, proposed biorefineries need to tackle the challenges of taking a wide diversity of raw biomass and rapidly and effectively transforming it into functionalizable platform molecules that can be derivatized into industrial and consumer products, or converted into biofuels. A substantial research effort is underway focussed on degrading biomass into smaller constituents using a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes. One promising technology for the solubilization of biomass is ionic liquids (ILs), which has received considerable attention as a medium for efficient solubilization of a variety of materials. ILs also allow fractional separation when combined with solvent extraction (conventional, and green technologies such as supercritical CO2), precipitation, and adsorption/absorption methods, and to conduct a wide range of chemical reactions using thermal, electrochemical, photochemical, and biocatalytic processes. As a potential pretreatment technology for the biorefineries of the future, we report herein the first rapid dissolution of a range of coniferous and deciduous woods and grassy lignocellulosic plant materials in an IL using microwave radiation."
pub.1052170189,Women and the Gendered Politics of Food,"Chapter SummaryIn this chapter, Vandana Shiva argues that, from seed to table, the food chain is gendered. Moreover, she locates her gender analysis within a critique of the globalization and commoditization of agriculture, particularly by means of corporate control of the seed supply. She argues that women’s traditional and local seed and food economy has been discounted as “productive work,” and that women’s seed and food knowledge has been discounted as knowledge. Globalization, she argues, has led to the transfer of seed and food from women’s control to corporate control by means of patenting and genetic engineering, for example. She further argues that food is transformed in corporate hands. It is no longer nourishment; it becomes a commodity. And as a commodity it can be manipulated and monopolized. If food grain makes more money as cattle feed than it does as food for human consumption, it becomes cattle feed. If food grain converted to biofuel to run automobiles is more profitable, it becomes ethanol and biodiesel. Finally, Shiva argues that a counter-revolution is underway, based on women’s food and agricultural knowledge, to promote a just, sustainable, healthy, and secure food system."
pub.1181840348,Marine Ecosystems and Pollution: Intersection of Zoology and Law in Environmental Sustainability,"Marine Biowaste, resulting from natural biological processes or human activities, seriously threatens the environment. Sources and impacts of Marine bio waste are discussed, classifying into two broad categories: Organic and Inorganic. Organic biowastes include those from aquaculture, agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and urban runoff, while inorganic Biowaste include plastics, microplastics, metals, and synthetic materials. Those sources present pollution, habitat destruction, and impacts on marine species, which together drastically close the ecological balances. The role of zoology in Biowaste degradation is important, because it is concerned with the study of organisms responsible for breaking down organic wastes to make nutrients available. Both National and International legislation, such as UNCLOS and MMPA in the United States, provide a legal framework for the protection of Marine ecosystems from pollution and overexploitation. Advances in Marine biotechnology offer novel solutions to problems related to bio waste management, such as algal Biofuels and integrated waste management systems. Synthetically, biology trends, adaptation of climate change, and models of the circular economy provide potential solutions for future research and sustainable practices. This paper gives reasons for full strategies of Biowaste management with a view towards the preservation of Marine ecosystems and assurance of Environmental sustainability."

Methanol fuel is an alternative biofuel for internal combustion and other engines, either in combination with gasoline or independently. Methanol's high octane and oxygen content produces a cleaner burning gasoline which significantly reduces vehicle exhaust emissions. A lower boiling temperature for better fuel vaporization in cold engines, the highest H-C ratio for a lower carbon intensity fuel, and no Sulphur contamination which improves catalytic converter operation. In the paper, a study is carried out for the blend of 15% methanol (M15) with Gasoline on BS-IV vehicles and a comparison is done for the tailpipe emissions. A gap analysis of vehicles with E0 and M15 fuel is done with baseline emission testing along with full throttle performance of the vehicle to check the effect of oxygenated fuel (M15). The main purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of M-15 fuel on 2 and 3-wheeler vehicles in the as-is condition without any engine tuning and retaining the base gasoline (E0) settings.

The manuscript highlights the impact on health while using used cooking oil and the scope for revenue generation from WCO. Up to a 20% blend with diesel results in less pollutants, and it does not demand more modifications to the engine. Also, this reduces the country’s import bill. Furthermore, it suggests the scope for alternate sustainable income among rural farmers through a circular economy. Various collection strategies are discussed, a SWOC (strength, weakness, opportunity, and challenges) analysis is presented to aid in understanding different countries’ policies regarding the collection of WCO, and a more suitable method for conversion is pronounced. A techno-economic analysis is presented to explore the viability of producing 1 litre of biodiesel. The cost of 1 litre of WCO-based biodiesel is compared with costs Iran and Pakistan, and it is noticed that the difference among them is less than 1%. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is mandatory to reveal the impact of WCO biodiesel on socio-economic and environmental concerns. Including exergy analysis will provide comprehensive information about the production and justification of WCO as a biodiesel."
pub.1152934953,Nonconventional Yeasts Engineered Using the CRISPR-Cas System as Emerging Microbial Cell Factories,"Because the petroleum-based chemical synthesis of industrial products causes serious environmental and societal issues, biotechnological production using microorganisms is an alternative approach to achieve a more sustainable economy. In particular, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used as a microbial cell factory to produce biofuels and valuable biomaterials. However, product profiles are often restricted due to the Crabtree-positive nature of S. cerevisiae, and ethanol production from lignocellulose is possibly enhanced by developing alternative stress-resistant microbial platforms. With desirable metabolic pathways and regulation in addition to strong resistance to diverse stress factors, nonconventional yeasts (NCY) may be considered an alternative microbial platform for industrial uses. Irrespective of their high industrial value, the lack of genetic information and useful gene editing tools makes it challenging to develop metabolic engineering-guided scaled-up applications using yeasts. The recently developed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein (Cas) system is a powerful gene editing tool for NCYs. This review describes the current status of and recent advances in promising NCYs in terms of industrial and biotechnological applications, highlighting CRISPR-Cas9 system-based metabolic engineering strategies. This will serve as a basis for the development of novel yeast applications."
pub.1143499166,Yeast cell factories for sustainable whey-to-ethanol valorisation towards a circular economy,"Cheese whey is the major by-product of the dairy industry, and its disposal constitutes an environmental concern. The production of cheese whey has been increasing, with 190 million tonnes per year being produced nowadays. Therefore, it is emergent to consider different routes for cheese whey utilization. The great nutritional value of cheese whey turns it into an attractive substrate for biotechnological applications. Currently, cheese whey processing includes a protein fractionating step that originates the permeate, a lactose-reach stream further used for valorisation.  In the last decades, yeast fermentation has brought several advances to the search for biorefinery alternatives. From the plethora of value-added products that can be obtained from cheese whey, ethanol is the most extensively explored since it is the alternative biofuel most used worldwide. Thus, this review focuses on the different strategies for ethanol production from cheese whey using yeasts as promising biological systems, including its integration in lignocellulosic biorefineries. These valorisation routes encompass the improvement of the fermentation process as well as metabolic engineering techniques for the introduction of heterologous pathways, resorting mainly to Kluyveromyces sp. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The solutions and challenges of the several strategies will be unveiled and explored in this review."
pub.1112967566,Straw Utilization in China—Status and Recommendations,"As the world’s largest grain producer, China’s straw yield was 700 million tonnes in 2014. With a national utilization rate of 80% in 2015, there is still a large amount of straw burned in open-field, resulting in air pollution and a reduction in the quantity available as a source of bioenergy. This paper conducts a literature review of success stories and major challenges in comprehensive straw utilization in and out of China. It is noted that nationwide long-term feasible and sustainable straw utilization at a high rate is a highly complex operation, involving most societal sectors, many people and facilities often at different regions. Scenarios were analyzed to estimate the energy potential and air emission reductions China would accomplish in 2020 by converting an additional 5 or 10% of straw-yield to biofuel. Currently, the approach to control straw burning in China is primarily administrative, relying heavily on prohibition and penalties, inconsistent across policy areas and geography, and lacking in long-term planning. Consequently, the effectiveness of the current approach is limited. The main cause of burning is a lack of infrastructure, effective preventive measures, and viable alternatives. Recommendations aimed at promoting a circular bio-economy around using crop straw as resources were provided, including improving straw utilization rates and reducing open-field burning."
pub.1101720850,Fine grinding of wood – Overview from wood breakage to applications," Due to its abundance, wood is the pre-eminent lignocellulosic raw material for a sustainable bioeconomy based society. Wood is widely used as fuel, construction material, and raw material in cellulose and lignocellulose based products. Besides the established uses of wood powder, like co-firing with coal and biofuel production, there are also novel uses and process applications, e.g., advanced wood-plastic composites and biochemical production are emerging for which the pulverization or fine grinding of wood is an essential pre-treatment step. Due to the tenacious nature of the wood matrix, size reduction is an energy intensive process and thermal or chemical pre-treatment may be needed to improve economy. This paper provides a broad overview of the fine grinding of wood. First, wood breakage mechanisms and the mechanisms of size reduction are presented, followed by fine grinding techniques and wood pre-treatment methods. A comparison of the specific energy consumption of wood fine grinding in both a gaseous and liquid environment is illustrated.

Finally, the use and requirements of wood powders in various applications are discussed."
pub.1170663414,"Global Bioeconomy Assessment: Coordinated Efforts of Policy, Innovation, and Sustainability for a Greener Future","The bioeconomy, also known as the bio-based economy, refers to the economic activity involving the use of biotechnology and biomass in producing goods, services or energy. It aims to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels in the energy and industrial sectors. Bioeconomy has been widely accepted by different countries and regions as a critical strategy for coping with fossil fuel shortage and climate change, among other environmental problems. Bioeconomy mainly utilizes biomass resources to generate bio-based products. In terms of biomass resources, they can be divided into three generations. The first-generation biomass resources, primarily edible biomass materials, present an issue of “competing with people for food/land.” The second-generation biomass resources are derived from non-edible sources, mainly lignocellulosic materials, which are accompanied by immature processes for their efficient conversion into valuable biofuels and other high-value bioproducts. Thirdgeneration biomass resources represent an emerging frontier in the world of sustainable bioenergy and bioproducts, primarily consisting of algae or rapidly synthesized biomass achieved through advanced cell engineering techniques. This report focuses on bioenergy, bio-based chemicals, bio-based plastics and bio-based macromolecular materials (textiles and paper) in technical conversion, highlighting the resources, dominating technical routes, challenges and prospects."
pub.1170502447,Indoor CO2 direct air capture and utilization: Key strategies towards carbon neutrality,"Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising technology that can help to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air. One application of DAC is indoor CO2 direct air capture (iCO2-DAC). A wide range of materials with unique properties for CO2 capture have been investigated, including porous materials, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks. The selection of suitable materials for iCO2-DAC depends on several factors, such as cost, CO2 adsorption capacity, and stability. The development of new materials with improved properties for iCO2-DAC is an active research area. The captured CO2 can serve as a renewable carbon source to produce biofuels for internal use (e.g., for heating purposes), decreasing the environmental impact of buildings. This review article highlights the importance of iCO2-DAC to improve indoor air quality in buildings and boost the circular economy. We discuss the available carbon capture technologies and materials, discussing their properties and focusing on those potentially applicable to indoor environments. We also provide a hypothetic scenario where CO2 is captured from different indoor environments and transformed into sustainable fuels by using an emerging carbon capture and utilization technology (microbial electrosynthesis). Finally, we evaluate the economic feasibility of such an innovative approach in comparison to the use of traditional, fossil-based fuels."
pub.1152786320,Valorization of Fruit and Vegetable Waste: Yeast Fermentation,"The ever-increasing need for materials, energy, and water in the world and the ever-decreasing resources force the transition to a sustainable circular bioeconomy. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in renewable resources and industrially important value-added bioproducts. Today, yeasts are an important tool for producing value-added bioproducts from renewable resources through the fermentation process. Fruit and vegetable wastes (FVWs), which cause soil and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and economic losses, have a very high potential to be used as a substrate source due to their nutritional components. The evaluation of FVWs as a substrate also contributes to the zero waste policy, which is becoming increasingly widespread in the world. Some of the natural bioproducts produced by yeasts using FVWs are enzymes, color and flavoring agents, biopolymers, single-cell proteins, and fuels. These products are widely used in food, chemical, biomedical, and many other industries. This chapter focuses on the potential of FVWs to be converted into value-added products through fermentation by yeasts and the importance of this process for global industry, human health, environmental protection, and the economy."
pub.1164781473,Role of Green Nanotechnology to Manage the Agricultural and Food Waste via Advanced Anaerobic Digestion Technology,"Energy crisis and environmental pollution are serious problems of sustainable development in the world. The problem is acute in developing economies like India, where there is significant pressure on available natural sources of energy. One of effective approaches to solve these energy problems is developing biomass energy such as biogas and biofuel. Biogas production is a well-established conversion technology i.e., anaerobic digestion, to obtain energy from biomass that is alternative to fossil fuel. Nanotechnology can contribute to the improvement of biogas production through the use of nanocatalysts. These catalysts can enhance bioconversion strategies, facilitate better breakdown of substrates, and optimize output delivery. Generally, nanoparticles can be prepared through a variety of chemical and physical methods, some of which can be expensive and potentially hazardous to the environment. These methods often involve the use of toxic chemicals that pose various biological risks. This may be the reason for the increasing interest in the biosynthesis of nanoparticles through a green route, which avoids the use of toxic chemicals. Such environment friendly processes are gaining momentum. Therefore, in this article, the green synthesized plant derived various metal nanoparticles which can be used for enhancement of biogas production from cattle dung, will be discussed."
pub.1146975647,Beyond Crystallinity: Using Raman Spectroscopic Methods to Further Define Aggregated/Supramolecular Structure of Cellulose,"In the bio-based economy, conversion of biomass to biofuels and other products is essential for developing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. For this to become a reality, understanding of the biomass ultrastructure is critically important. For instance, to enhance the yield of fermentable sugars from enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, the understanding of the latter’s supramolecular structure and the ability to modify it appropriately is essential. Although cellulose crystallinity is one way to define the aggregated structure, previous research has shown that merely studying how cellulose crystallinity influences the hydrolysis is not good enough. This deduction is based on the fact that not only most crystallinity estimation methods have limitations but also crystallinity measurement inadequately defines the aggregated state of cellulose. Therefore, better approaches to describe the ultrastructure are needed. Raman spectroscopy is particularly well suited to this task because, in addition to crystallinity, several pieces of structure-related information can be generated, which when combined provide a more comprehensive description of the aggregated state. Additionally, the information derived using Raman spectroscopy is more resolved because it comes from spectral features that represent both the aggregated and the molecular states of cellulose. Few examples will be presented to illustrate this capability."

Algae-based systems can simultaneously remove organic matter, N, and P and may offer substantial energetic advantages compared to traditional biological treatment systems, require small spatial footprint, and contribute to biofuels production and CO2 emissions mitigation. Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) present characteristics compatible with the use in isolated realities for water and wastewater treatment with contextual energy recovery and may be combined with other nature-based process technologies to achieve good treatment and energy efficiencies. Despite that their application in real-scale plants has not been assessed yet, the most probable outcome will be the in situ/on site treatment (or pretreatment) of wastes for small “in house” plants not connected to the sewerage network. This paper focuses on the current practices and perspectives of hybrid nature-based systems, such as constructed wetlands and microalgae integrated phytoremediation plants, and their possible integration with microbial electrochemical technologies to increase recovery possibilities from wastes and positively contribute to a green economy approach."
pub.1022226657,Metabolic Engineering in Sugarcane: Assisting the Transition to a Bio-based Economy,"Sugarcane is a promising crop for sustainable production of biomaterials and biofuel feedstocks, as well as sugars for food. It is a highly efficient biomass producer under tropical and sub-tropical conditions. Tissue culture and genetic transformation systems are well established and applicable to diverse commercial genotypes. It has inbuilt genetic containment features. Many cultivars are sterile under the usual commercial growing conditions. Cultivars are vegetatively propagated and they do not persist without human cultivation. Early steps in extraction remove all proteins and nucleic acids from the major food product, sucrose. A key decision in development of sugarcane for commercial production of a novel material is whether to co-produce the material with sucrose, or as an alternative to sucrose. Logical materials for production in such a large-scale industrial crop are those required in large quantities, or those for which sugarcane has a particular advantage in terms of precursor metabolite pools. This chapter summarises progress, potentials and limitations in metabolic engineering of sugarcane for enhanced yield of sucrose, higher value sugars and sugar derivatives, sucrose-derived polymers, bioplastics, aromatic compounds and waxes"
pub.1173805570,Process evaluation of simulated novel cellulosic ethanol biorefineries coupled with lignin thermochemical conversion,"The conversion of lignocellulose into valuable products is an area of interest to achieve sustainable development. Nowadays, the corn stover-ethanol biorefinery just produces lignin as a waste. However, lignin valorization can enhance profitability, improve resource utilization efficiency, and reduce carbon emissions. Thus, the objective of this work is to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of integrating lignin thermochemical conversion to generate bioproducts within ethanol biorefineries. Herein, 2000 metric tonne per day corn-stover biorefineries with various lignin utilization processes (combustion for power, pyrolysis to produce arenes, and gasification-syngas fermentation to produce ethanol) were modeled. Then, a comparative analysis was conducted across various dimensions of energy, environment, and economy (3E). The results suggest that integrating lignin valorization instead of combustion enhances carbon and energy recovery, as well as environmental and economic benefits. The minimum ethanol selling price has been estimated to be 834–873 $/t for various lignin utilization processes. Notably, lignin gasification-syngas fermentation demonstrates the best performance in all 3E metrics. However, related lignin thermochemical conversion processes still face high levels of uncertainty, necessitating further laboratory and pilot-scale research to improve technology readiness levels. This work is valuable for future advancements in the full conversion of lignocellulose into biofuels and chemicals."
pub.1171563843,Functional insights into fungal F-box protein: From pathogenesis to sustainable economy,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) alter the molecular structure and function of proteins while tightly regulating protein turnover and activity. Eukaryotes exhibit a wide range of PTMs, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, glycosylation, methylation, lipidation, and palmitoylation. Ubiquitination, facilitates the degradation of specific substrates through PTMs. This process heavily relies on the SCF complex (SKP1-Cullin-F-box protein) a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a crucial role in the recruitment of target substrates for ubiquitination. Apart from substrate degradation, F-box proteins in pathogenic fungi are involved in diverse cellular processes essential for fungal growth and virulence. In this review article, we summarize the functions of various F-box proteins in pathogenic fungi, discussing their roles in cellular functions such as pathogenicity during host infection, transcription and cell cycle progression, endocytic recycling, sexual reproduction, mitochondrial connectivity, and maintenance of circadian rhythm. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed a novel function of fungal F-box proteins in biofuel production via CAZymes, highlighting their industrial significance. This comprehensive review aims to enhance our understanding of the emerging role of F-box proteins in host-pathogen interactions, and it holds broader significance for the scientific community, stimulating new discussions and future investigations in this field."
pub.1153411129,Smaller human populations are neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for biodiversity conservation,"Human population (often treated as overpopulation) has long been blamed as the main cause of biodiversity loss. Whilst this simplistic explanation may seem convenient, understanding the accuracy of the statement is crucial to develop effective priorities and targets to manage and reverse ongoing biodiversity loss. If untrue, the assertion may undermine practical and effective measures currently underway to counter biodiversity loss by distracting from true drivers, alienating some of the most diverse countries in the world, and failing to tackle the structural inequalities which may be behind global biodiversity declines. Through examining the drivers of biodiversity loss in highly biodiverse countries, we show that it is not population driving the loss of habitats, but rather the growth of commodities for export, particularly soybean and oil-palm, primarily for livestock feed or biofuel consumption in higher income economies. Thus, inequitable consumption drives global biodiversity loss, whilst population is used to scapegoat responsibility. Instead, the responsibilities are clear and have recently been summarized by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services IPBES: Leverage points for biodiversity conservation lie in reducing unsustainable consumption through diet shifts, tracking supply chains, and technological innovation as well as ensuring sustainable production to reduce biodiversity losses associated with industrial agriculture."

The European Commission has concluded in a regulation that palm oil use in biofuels will be reduced to zero by 2030. This regulation is based on allegations against oil palm plantation that causes excessive environmental damage. Environmental issues that arise as a result of the growing awareness of the international community in preserving the earth are often contrary to the wishes of a country in developing its economy. Campaigns from environmental activists in Indonesia highlight a lot about the palm oil industry which is often considered not sustainable and causes environmental damage. On the other hand, this campaign caused a negative reputation followed by the decline of Indonesia's palm oil exports to Europe. One of the regulations that arose was the EU Directive which was considered by the Indonesian government as discrimination against oil palm products and their derivatives. This article uses a qualitative analysis method. This study aims to analyze how the Indonesian government responds to the EU Directive regulation on Palm Oil which is considered detrimental to Indonesia's palm oil exports to Europe."

Implementation of sustainable waste management in Zagreb should be performed through the introduction of source-separation of waste, and its utilization. One of the aspects is usage of biowaste as a feedstock for biomethane production. Produced biomethane could be distributed by dedicated network of filling stations within City area. The main objective of paper is presentation of environmental and economic benefits of proposed approach and citizen’s involvement in separate collection of waste from households. In this sense, a survey has been conducted among residents in order to assess their behaviours regarding the separate collection of waste fractions. The main motivation is the reduction of waste fee, creation of new jobs, stimulation of local economy and biofuel production. This paper presented the fact that paper/cardboard, glass and packaging are most suitable waste fractions for separate collection, while biowaste is most demanding due to odours issue and lack of space. Finally, large majority of the citizens are willing and motivated to participate in the process of waste separation."
pub.1111828967,Bioethanol: New opportunities for an ancient product," Ethanol as a key component of alcoholic beverage came along with human in an extremely long history. Nowadays, it has been the most successful sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, even beyond wind power and solar energy, to fuel vehicles and alleviate environmental pollution. Although almost all bioethanol produced by starch- or sugar-based biomass, also known as the first-generation bioethanol, is economically feasible nowadays, it still causes many controversial issues in food security and CO2 emission. In order to address these concerns, the second-generation bioethanol, taking lignocellulose such as forest waste and crop straw as the feedstocks, has emerged a promising future of ideal biofuel. Unfortunately, because of the challenges raised in technology and economy, the running of industrial plants for second-generation ethanol closely depends on the global price of crude oil. The third-generation bioethanol is derived from algae, which is considered as a valuable option for feedstock due to its potentially abounding output. In this chapter, we drew a sketch of three-generation bioethanol in the regular production process and innovative research input globally. Bioethanol production, as a long story since the beginning of civilization, is destined to promise human a bright energy road."
pub.1107150406,Bioenergy in the Nordic-Baltic-NW Russian Region,"The status of use of bioenergy, the current barriers for increased use and the future use of bioenergy in the Nordic-Baltic-NW Russian region is described in this report. In this region, forests are abundant and a long tradition of growing agricultural crops is evident. Therefore, there are sound possibilities for an increased future use of bioenergy, which can become an important part of a sustainable energy supply. However, bioenergy production is a juvenile industry, where political decisions are of prime importance for lifting the utilisation of bioenergy to the full impact on economy and environment. A number of the main technical bottlenecks have already been solved and biofuels are used on a relatively large commercial scale today. A full scale technical development of the bioenergy area must be market driven, but the technology is just below the threshold level where it will attract the large scale investments needed to establish a market. Holistic strategies and interdisciplinary efforts taking all part of the bioenergy chain into account is important. Political support in the form of limited subsidies or mandatory use of bioenergy will have a large positive impact on the creation of a commercial market with committed involvement from the industries."
pub.1181937901,Chapter 3 Enhancing carbon neutrality: the role of biomass in CO2 uptake,"Globally, increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing energy demand are refocusing attention on sustainable alternatives for fuels and chemicals. It is possible to achieve carbon neutrality through microalgae, forests, and crops since CO2 uptake into their biomass is the primary hydrocarbon source. Since they uptake CO2 through photosynthesis into biomass, as well as store it in the form of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates during their growth phase, the biomass of lignocellulosic, microalgal, and agricultural crop residues can be used for chemicals and biofuels production. Their carbohydrates can be used as feedstock for bioethanol production, while their residual biomass can be used to produce bio-oil. As microalgae, forest trees, and crops grow, they capture almost the same amount of CO2 released as biomass or fuel is burned, making their biomass a carbon-neutral energy source. This approach exploits biomass to mitigate CO2 emissions while concurrently producing bioenergy. Using microalgae, a circular carbon economy will be enabled through biorefinery. This chapter explores whether the uptake of CO2 into biomass is feasible and desirable for achieving carbon neutrality. Some trade-offs include biomass availability, GHG emissions, policies, the environment, biodiversity, land use, and food security."

Pyrolysis tests were carried out at 673, 773, and 873 K. Bioenergy indexes were calculated for BSG and its biochar, and germination tests were carried out to obtain lentil sprouts. The results showed that the BSG biochar obtained at the lowest temperature biochar presented the best performance for use as biofuel. Regarding the germination tests, the different biochars were applied at 4 doses, and the evaluated parameters such as germination percentage, germination rate, mean germination time, and seed vigor were strongly influenced by the biochar addition. The biochar at 773 K added at a dose of 5% doubled the values of mean germination time, seed vigor, and time for 50% of the seeds to emerge compared to the control, constituted only with distilled water. The sustainable BSG valorization through pyrolysis reduces waste and contributes to circular economy practices by transforming industrial by-products into valuable resources for energy and agriculture. This approach highlights the importance of sustainability in reducing the environmental impact of industrial waste and promoting renewable energy sources."

The agro wastes are produced from various sources mainly crops left out, agro industries, aquaculture, and livestock. The major ingredient of agro wastes are of cellulose, lignin, hemicelluloses, etc. Conventionally, most of the crops left out were used for composting, animal fodder, domestic fuel, etc. Due to modernization technology in agriculture sector, people from Third World countries prefer cost-effective methods such as combustion process. Improper management of agro waste generated in the process has been contributing toward escalating air, soil, and water pollution. A proper environmental-friendly management of agro waste is the need of the time for sustainability, food, and health security of human. Lignin and hemicellulose can be used for generation of biofuels and biofertilizer. Cellulose can be sustainably used for the production of nanosilica, biodegradable polymer, paper, pulp, etc. This chapter emphasizes sustainable agro waste management without affecting the environment at lower cost in timely manner. In particular, the agro waste biomass could be used as a source of value-added bio-product, which has wide applications and impacts the bio-economy without hampering the climatic change issue."

This study aims to establish the best energy source in South Sulawesi as a reference or guide in the decision-making process. A questionnaire was used to collect data, and it was constructed with the criteria of renewable energy assessment. The analytical network process model was presented to rank renewable energy sources in energy development. This method applied a multi perspective approach specifically economy, environment, potential, technology, risk, and social with 3 sub criterions for each perspective. This study also involved six renewable energy sources namely solar, wind, hydro, biomass, biofuel and geothermal, assessed as an alternative. It is identified that potential criterion is the most priority criterion for renewable energy planning with a weight of 0.2452 and the availability of energy sources is the best sub criterion with a weight of 0.4660. The further results revealed that solar energy has a huge potential to generate electricity in South Sulawesi with a weight of 0.2788 and a percentage of 28.6 percent.

pub.1150501574,Green biomass processing to lower slurry viscosity and reduce biofuel cost,"Sustainable fuels for industries that cannot be easily electrified, like aviation and marine, will be crucial to achieving a carbon neutral economy. Processing wet solids through a process like hydrothermal liquifaction to produce upgradeable bio-oil is one pathway that could transform high moisture waste into a fuel. This work pioneers two green processing pathways to produce a biomass feedstock for liquefaction that is far less viscous at higher solids loadings than traditional slurries. This decrease in viscosity could significantly improve the profitability of producing fuels through slurry-based conversion processes. Natural biological degradation of corn stover before grinding has been shown to lower slurry viscosity by a factor of three and torrefaction has been shown to produce slurries that are 150x less viscous than the original material. Additionally, new insight has been gained into the critical physical and chemical parameters that impact slurry viscosity. Common parameters in slurry processing, like the average particle size, shear rate, and solids loadings clearly control viscosity, and these results are confirmed for biomass. Additionally, new physical parameters like aspect ratio and sphericity, as well as chemical parameters like extractives content, non-structural sugars, and zeta potential have been shown to impact and be good predictors of slurry viscosity and processability."

This case study focuses on the microbial production of higher-value products from selected organic waste streams abundant in the South African agricultural sector using microbes adapted to utilize different parts of biomass waste streams. A ruminant-based carboxylate platform based on mixed or undefined anaerobic co-cultures of rumen microorganisms can convert the carbohydrate polymers in the lignocellulosic part of organic waste streams to carboxylic acids that can be upgraded to biofuels or green chemicals. Furthermore, yeast and fungi can convert the simpler carbohydrates (such as the sugars and malic acid in grape and apple pomace) to ethanol and high-value carboxylic acids, such as lactic, fumaric, succinic and citric acid. This review will discuss the combinational use of the ruminal carboxylate platform and native or recombinant yeasts to valorize biomass waste streams through the production of higher-value organic acids with various applications."

In this mode, large amounts of organic wastes could be processed on a large scale through various biotechnologies; meanwhile, high value-added products could also be produced. Efficient utilization of organic wastes and energy recovery require efficient targeted technologies according to different types of organic wastes. In addition, a suitable and effective collection and pretreatment of organic wastes could also increase utilization efficiency and decrease costs. The concept of biorefinery was proposed in this background and was considered as an effective technology to convert organic wastes to biofuels and organic fertilizers. Further research and development is essential for improving and making better exploitation of these biotechnologies in actual production.

The analysis is carried out based on the bioethanol production targets in Thailand’s Alternative Energy Development Plan 2015, covering cassava and molasses ethanol. The role of taxes and production efficiency improvement on the entire economy is presented via bioethanol promotion options. The socio-economic and environmental effects of bioethanol promotion are also considered. The effects of bioethanol promotion are derived via a hybrid approach including computable general equilibrium modeling and life cycle impact assessment. Environmental effects are converted into monetary units using the conversion factors for Thailand. The results show that increasing bioethanol production and use can bring about a net benefit to society of around 62 billion Thai Baht over 2016–2026. Improving the production efficiency of feedstock along with increasing bioethanol production can increase the net benefit to society. Furthermore, not only does bioethanol promotion enhance real Gross Domestic Product, but also creates more jobs in the society and leads to less environmental cost per unit of domestic production when air emissions and irrigation water consumption are considered. The study can thus support decision-making towards sustainable biofuel development in Thailand."
pub.1087060183,Chapter 6 Separations Technologies for Biobased Product Formation—Opportunities and Challenges,"Recent years have witnessed a major thrust moving towards a sustainable, biobased economy using a biorefinery concept. The biorefinery concept is based on obtaining a broad spectrum of biofuels and value-added biobased products from renewable resources—analogous to the petroleum refinery concept. It has two major components—environmentally benign conversion technologies and efficient separations technologies. Separations technologies are important as they contribute to 30–50% of the overall production cost. Due to higher financial incentives, there is a surging interest for commercializing value-added biobased products, which function as precursors or building blocks for industrially relevant downstream chemicals. Particularly, oxygenated biobased species, such as alcohols, organic acids and furans, due to their reactive nature, are of great interest. We embrace this opportunity and designed this chapter focusing on separations technologies that are relevant to biobased product formation. Both fundamental aspects of separations technologies and their state-of-the-art applications for biobased product formation are emphasized. Since this is an emerging area of research and commercialization, none of the technologies are devoid of limitations. Therefore, we discuss the technical challenges and potential solutions associated with the technologies. We believe that this chapter will function as a guideline for identifying suitable separations schemes for biobased product formation."

pub.1121649476,Games for Change,"Global environmental change and the need for sustainable development require investment in infrastructure by many countries to improve their resiliency to volatile weather events (mostly large-scale flooding) while still having remaining resources to plan and implement sustainable development. The difficulty of this situation is illuminated by identifying the 50 poorest countries, in terms of GDP per capita compared to the USA, and identifying various challenges. These challenges represent the adaptation deficit faced by many countries. In addition, the data case is easily made that global climate change is primarily driven by our escalating consumption and the total embodied energy it takes to maintain this trajectory. This embodied energy directly manifests as documented increases in ocean heat content which is changing the very nature of the Earth system. This dominance of the Earth system needs to be replaced through the conceptual framework of “just sustainability.” This framework facilitates a change in global value system away from the primary concern of increasing prosperity through economic gain and toward prioritizing global justice and environmental health. This shift in value system may automatically yield sustainable development. This kind of transformation is needed if we are to prove ourselves as trustworthy guardians of nature and her resources for the well-being of future generations. This entry reviews the technological and scientific developments generated by the Green Revolution and how their intensive and extensive implementation have been decisive factors in the sustainability of the world’s production of crops for food, feed, fiber, and biofuels. It also discusses their impact on the landscape, water resources, environment, economy, culture, socioeconomic development, and the attitude and worldview of producers in developing countries towards agrochemicals, agricultural practices, and management and monoculture productivity. To date, the Green Revolution has focused on the global issue of sustainable development by concentrating exclusively on crop production; that is, by assessing only productivity per hectare or yields derived from technological breakthroughs, improved seeds, irrigation systems, and the suitability of the land to make it viable and sustainable to cultivate a given crop in a region. However, to achieve sustainable development it is necessary to incorporate aspects such as: organic agriculture, precision agriculture tools, life cycle analysis, soil and plant health, environmental impacts, water quality, post-harvest technology, by-product uses, and peasant and farmer perceptions of new paradigms such as globalization, value chains, competitiveness, bioeconomics, biorefineries, etc. Therefore, strategies for technical advice; training; skills development; transfer and adoption of technologies and knowledge; experiences and innovations with a multi-, trans-, and interdisciplinary approach; and the participati"

This study aims to assess structural changes in the sectoral energy matrix, considering the renewability of energy sources and the contributions of imports and exports to achieving the targets set out in international environmental agreements. Structural changes were assessed using an input–output model to calculate and evaluate the evolution of Brazilian energy and carbon footprints in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The share of renewable energies in total energy consumption in Brazil increased from 40.7% in 2000 to 47.6% in 2015, compared to 11.2% and 11.7% by global standards. Renewable sources accounted for 25.7% of the energy footprint in 2000 and 30.2% in 2015, compared to 21.6% and 26.5% of the national carbon footprint. The structural changes in the Brazilian economy reveal that, although increasing total energy consumption and total emissions, there is an increase in renewable energy sources consumption, which positively impacts GHG emissions. Renewable energy sources such as hydropower and biofuels have favored the emissions patterns of sectors such as industry and services, and transport, respectively. However, as Brazilian imports are intensive in non-renewable energy, incorporating them to fulfill the sector's intermediate and final demand, the Brazilian energy and carbon footprints become more polluted, as noted in the Agribusiness aggregate.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1151895046,"Evaluation of a biomethane, food and biofertiliser polygeneration system in a circular economy system","Biomethane is a viable alternative to natural gas and diesel for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as agriculture, industry and heavy transport. Unlike conventional biogas upgrading, photosynthetic biogas upgrading cogenerates biomethane, biofertiliser and microalgal bioproducts with the potential to improve resource utilisation and process performance in a circular economy. In this paper, a photosynthetic biogas upgrading-based polygeneration process is proposed and analysed to co-produce biofuel (biomethane), bio-fertiliser (digestate) and food (Spirulina powder, protein supplement) using agricultural feedstock. Based on a multi-criteria performance assessment, the economic and environmental benefits of the process are demonstrated. Thermodynamic performance of the process revealed that reducing the energy for greenhouse heating to cultivate microalgae would enable a higher energy output than input. Using economic allocation, a carbon footprint of biomethane less than 10 gCO2-eq/MJ (lower than 32.9 gCO2-eq/MJ for sustainable biomethane use in transport in the EU Renewable Energy Directive (Recast) (RED-II)); Spirulina protein of 0.8 kgCO2-eq/100 g protein (compared to 50 kgCO2-eq/100 g protein for beef); and digestate of 0.4 kgCO2-eq/kgN (comparing positively to 1.5–3 kgCO2-eq/kgN for synthetic nitrogenous fertiliser) was achieved. Unlike the current RED-II mandated methodology, the analysis established that the energy, CO2 emissions, land and water footprints of each co-product are best represented using an economic allocation principle. Based on the extended nutrition profile, Spirulina as a complete food outperforms most meat and plant-based protein alternatives in terms of CO2 emissions, land, and water footprints."
pub.1155069709,A Review on Pyrolysis of Agro-waste and Plastic Waste into Biofuels: Shifting to Bio-based Economy,"An increase 
in world energy consumption and its subsequent effect of carbon emission necessitates a shift towards the use of clean and sustainable fuels. Biomass is a promising resource for energy generation owing to its renewable nature and substantial energy content. The addition of plastics to improve the product yield has also been elaborated. Thermogravimetric analysis is a technical tool that can be used to elucidate the pyrolysis temperature and heating rate. Activation energy helps to identify the energy requirement for the pyrolysis process. Kinetics of the pyrolysis process is an effective tool for determining the minimum energy requirement and feasibility. This review highlights the importance of reaction kinetics, exergy, and energy analysis. The liquid fuel obtained through the thermal cracking of biomass has the potential to be used as a blend with conventional petroleum fuels. Substitution/blending of pyro-oil with petroleum fuels helps to reduce greenhouse emissions and global warming. The oxygen content of rice straw and Alga Sargassum sp. is 55 and 67%, respectively. Energy and exergy analysis improves the process economy. The success of any technology depends on its easy handling and economic feasibility. This review is the first of a kind in throwing light on the energy and exergy analysis of the pyrolysis process. Pyro-oil has an increased amount of oxygen content which has to be upgraded for further use. Pyrolysis also serves as an efficient tool for converting plastic waste into energy.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1166840193,Barley Straw Fiber Extraction in the Context of a Circular Economy,"The potential for sustainable lignocellulosic agro-waste is immense, owing to the fact that it represents the most abundant organic compound on Earth. It is a valuable and desirable source for material production across numerous industries due to its abundance, renewability, and biodegradability. This paper explores the world of barley fibers, which are extracted from the straw of two different cultivars (old Rex or new Barun) and have tremendous potential for use, primarily for technical textiles. The quantity of the extracted fibers depends both on the type of barley used and on climate conditions that influence the plants’ growth, resulting in fiber yields ranging from 14.82% to 19.59%. The chemical composition of isolated fibers revealed an optimal content of cellulose and lignin in barley fibers isolated from the Rex variety. Those results were confirmed with FTIR analysis, which revealed a lower intensity of peaks associated with hemicellulose and lignin and, therefore, indicated their better removal after the chemical maceration process. In terms of fiber density, the quality of the fibers was comparable to that of cotton fibers, but they differed significantly in moisture regain (10.37–11.01%), which was higher. Furthermore, sufficient fiber tenacity (20.31–23.08 cN/tex) was obtained in a case of old-variety Rex, indicating the possibility of spinning those fibers into yarns, followed by their extended usage for apparel. Additionally, our paper reveals the possibility of fulfilling the requirements of the zero waste principle due to the fact that a high percentage of solid waste left after the fiber extraction (26.3–32.3%) was afterwards successfully used for the production of biofuels, enabling the closing of the loop in a circular economy."
pub.1141966207,"Biobased Products from Food Sector Waste, Bioplastics, Biocomposites, and Biocascading","In the past, food waste has been used to produce biogas and biofuels, fertilizers, and animal feed. Using it as a feedstock for innovative biorefineries is not only an ethical issue but also a smart application of the circular economy. This book explores the zero-waste concept in the thriving biobased sector, proposing technologies and procedures to meet the sustainable development goals. The volume categorizes food waste sources and proposes an impressive number of high value-added compounds (e.g., platform chemicals, enzymes, nutraceuticals, antioxidants, organic acids, phosphate, bioadsorbents, pectin, solvents, and pigments) that can be obtained in a sequential biocascade, via chemical, biochemical, thermal, and physical technologies. The synthesis of bioplastics from food waste, their copolymerization and blending, as well as the production of biocomposites and bionanocomposite with biofillers from food scraps, are presented: eluding the cost of waste disposal, reducing biobased materials price, and avoiding using edible resources as a starting material for biobased items are the main beneficial peculiarities of the process. The Authors illustrate challenging characteristics of new biobased materials, such as their mechanical and physico-chemical features, their biodegradability, compostability, recyclability, chemical compatibility, and barrier properties. The volume also delves into socioeconomic considerations and environmental concerns related to the upcycling of food waste, as well as the safety and life cycle assessment of biobased products. Finally, the authors address how advances in digital technology can make food waste upcycling a negative-cost process and discuss best practices to practically implement the biorefinery concept. Research gaps and needs are suggested, and recommendations for food waste handling and management during this COVID-19 pandemic are provided."
pub.1164645526,A review of the industrial use and global sustainability of Cannabis sativa,"The Cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa L.), also known as hemp, is a sustainable and multipurpose plant that may be used for a wide range of purposes, from the fiber in its stalks to the food in its seeds to the oil in its flowers and seeds. Since the Cannabis plant has been recognized to be an outstanding carbon trap and environmentally friendly biofuel that supports all three aspects of sustainability—the economy, the environment, and society—it may provide a solution to the climate change dilemma. The cultivation of the Cannabis plant has been practiced as a dietary staple in numerous places across the globe for an extended period. However, its production has been prohibited in several countries mostly owing to its relationship with illicit drug consumption. The illegality of the plant has impeded research efforts for an extended period of time on a global scale. As a result, people's ability to assess the whole range of beneficial effects and dangers shrank. However, the global trend toward Cannabis legalization and decriminalization has accelerated in recent years. This has stimulated more investigation into the botanical, ecological, and practical aspects of the plant. This study reviewed the available literature to understand more about the Cannabis plant's global sustainability. The results demonstrated the potential of Cannabis plants to affect product sustainability and the use of hemp as a renewable raw material. Furthermore, this review outlines the connections between the Cannabis plant and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. This research fills a gap in our understanding of the Cannabis plant's sustainability as a highly promising multi-purpose crop for the future."
pub.1173002638,Recovery of Cellulose and Extracellular Polymers from Sewage Sludge,"The disposal of sewage sludge poses significant environmental challenges due to its high organic content and potential for releasing harmful substances into the ecosystem. This study focuses on recovering valuable cellulose and extracellular polymers from sewage sludge, aiming to explore sustainable solutions for sludge management and resource utilization. The chapter employs physical, chemical, and biological methods to extract cellulose and extracellular polymers from the sludge matrix. Initially, the sludge is subjected to mechanical pretreatments, such as size reduction and solid‐liquid separation, to enhance the accessibility of target polymers. Subsequently, chemical treatments involving alkaline and acidic hydrolysis selectively dissolve cellulose and extract extracellular polymers. The recovered cellulose and extracellular polymers are characterized using various analytical techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X‐ray diffraction (XRD). These analyses provide insights into the extracted polymer structure, composition, and purity. The potential applications of the recovered cellulose and extracellular polymers are investigated, considering their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and physicochemical properties. Cellulose can be a renewable feedstock for producing biofuels, bioplastics, and high‐value chemicals. At the same time, extracellular polymers hold promise in areas like bioremediation, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Moreover, the environmental impact of the recovery process is evaluated, encompassing energy consumption, waste generation, and emissions. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) are conducted to determine the overall sustainability of the proposed approach, considering both economic and environmental aspects. These contribute to developing sustainable strategies for sewage sludge management, providing a valuable alternative to traditional disposal methods. The recovery of cellulose and extracellular polymers not only minimizes waste generation but also harnesses the potential of these biomaterials, fostering the transition toward a circular economy and reducing reliance on fossil‐based resources."
pub.1162837721,Sustainable energy production from grape marc: from thermo-analytical and chemical analysis to kinetic modeling and environmental impact assessment,"Managing winery solid waste remains a challenge. The aim of this work is to experimentally study grape marc (GM) as a possible sustainable biofuel and/or as an auxiliary fuel with lignite. GM co-combustion with lignite has never been reported. Several thermo-analytical techniques (Calorific Value, Proximate Analysis, Ultimate Analysis, Thermogravimetry/Derivative Thermogravimetry, Ion Chromatography, Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy) and several other analyses (Kinetic Modeling, Thermodynamic Analysis) were performed. The Environmental Footprint Index (produced ash per megajoule), the potential Maximum Emission Factors (per megajoule) and several Ash Quality Indices were calculated. The main results showed that GM is a very promising alternative to lignite fuel since its energy content is extremely high (~ 19.3 MJ/kg) while its ash content is quite low (~ 5.7 wt.%) compared to lignite. This means that more energy can be produced by simultaneously reducing solid waste (ash) production and problems related to ash. Similarly, the GM sample is superior to lignite regarding gas emissions for producing the same amount of energy (98.5 gCO2/MJ, 0.5 gNO/MJ, and 0.5 gSO2/MJ). Kinetic analysis showed that GM combustion is kinetically favored over lignite due to its lower Activation Energy (64.7 kJ/mol). Similarly, as the proportion of GM is increased in the blends, the quality characteristics of the composite fuel becomes better. The Empirical Chemical Formula of the GM is C277N10SH398O134. Cl− content was the same as for lignite (0.02 wt.%). Experimental and modeling results revealed that GM, and its co-combustion with lignite, in several proportions, could be used for bioenergy production."
pub.1160458076,Recent Trends in Microbial Fuel Cell,"Microbial fuel cell (MFC), a bioelectrochemical system, helps to generate electricity at atmospheric temperature conditions with/without existence of inter-mediator using bacteria or microorganism. This technology is very important for future sustainable technology for biodegradable materials using microorganism. In microbial fuel cell, microbes undergo catabolism reaction for easy energy generation. Energy produced is relatively of low intensity due to its nature of mimicking bacterial interactions. However, as per Carnot cycle, efficiency of energy level in MFC is relatively more than 50%. Views on various aspects of MFC will be explained from different resources in terms of their electrochemical performance using their morphology, catalyst arrangement, and activation of microorganism including cathode, anode, and separator along with catalyst. The MFC system assembly consists of a cathode and anode along with biocatalyst which is separated by an ionic porous separator in presence of an electrolyte medium. In real condition, this porous separator is polymeric/ceramic in nature which allows flow of ions thereby electron move in the external circuit. Porous cathode material helps to induce reduction process and anode material undergo oxidation without any external/internal obstruction during operation of MFC will be explained from reported literature. Various factors such as pH, Temperature range, etc. may influence electrochemical redox reaction during MFC working process. This can give a clear idea and simultaneously leads to improvement of the system performance indirectly, which also will be validated from reported documents. Design of MFC module for optimal performance with energy output and other factors influencing MFC performance with application potential will be considered in various aspects. In addition to this, bioenergy harvesting will also be discussed from reported literature."
pub.1176216298,Electric fields to support microalgae growth with a differentiated biochemical composition,"Microalgae are a group of microorganisms well-known for their high metabolic plasticity and biomass with commercial interest for several industries. In the present work, the influence of in-situ electric field application (INEF) on the growth and biochemical composition of Pavlova gyrans was, for the first time, assessed. Electrical protocols were tested, namely by applying INEF in different growth stages, in varying treatment times and even by combining it with dark phase of cells' photoperiod. INEF did not promote a stimulatory effect on growth but influenced the biochemical composition of P. gyrans – maximum increases of 74.9 and 66.2 % in the chlorophyll a and carotenoid content and of 4.72, 18.7 and 5.41 % in the lipid, carbohydrate and protein content were observed in independent experiments. Hence, with this study, the potential of INEF application as a strategy to modulate growth and to promote biochemical composition alterations was proven. Industrial relevance Microalgae, with their unique ability to efficiently convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into biomass, offer a sustainable platform for the synthesis of diverse bioactive compounds. By subjecting microalgae to controlled electric stress conditions, their metabolic pathways can be redirected towards the production of specific target compounds. This strategy has the potential to enhance the yield of high-value molecules, including biofuels, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and pigments, whilst minimizing resource inputs. Additionally, metabolic stress responses in microalgae often trigger the accumulation of secondary metabolites with bioactive properties. Harnessing the metabolic plasticity of microalgae through controlled stress manipulation represents a cutting-edge strategy for sustainable and economically viable bioproduction systems that align with the goals of green chemistry and circular economy principles."

The WH, as an energy crop, has been harnessed as a phytoremediation agent to purify contaminated water and produce fuel and environmentally friendly products. A country’s economy relies on the availability of raw materials for energy production, cleaning life-supporting abiotic resources for consumption, and the innovation of cost-effective, eco-friendly products. The present study focuses on a three-in-one nexus using the WH to purify polluted water, the (post-purification) biomass to produce clean energy fuels (biogas and bioethanol), and for the manufacture of daily-use products. The ability of the WH, an aquatic macrophyte, to act as a phytoremediator to improve the quality of eutrophic lake water in a laboratory setting was investigated. Water samples were collected from four lakes surrounding the urban community in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The potential to remove salts and solutes and improve the physio-chemical properties of water, including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDSs), turbidity, and NaCl concentration, were assessed. During the aquatic macrophyte treatment, a 100% WH survival rate was shown, with no visible toxicity symptoms observed in the biomass. The WH improved water quality after one week, as determined by a significant decrease in turbidity, EC, NaCl, and TDSs, and improved pH and DO levels. Here, we establish the WH’s proficiency in removing nutrients/solutes and improving water quality. In addition, we discuss the utilization of this invasive aquatic biomass to produce energy after remediation of water including cost-effective and eco-friendly products to incur daily life with environmental and socioeconomic benefits in Bangladesh."

That would serve as a solution for ecosystem bioremediation, an effective utilization of marine macroalgal resources, and a new initiative to promote a green and low-carbon economy. Ulva fasciata biomass can be utilized as an organic fertilizer with total N, P2O5, and K2O contents of 3.17% and a C/N ratio of 11.71. It can also be used as a solid biofuel with a sufficient calorific value of 15.19 MJ/kg. It has high carbohydrate content and low lignin content of approximately 44.85% and 1.5%, respectively, which recommend its applicability in bioethanol and biobutanol production. Its protein, fiber, lipid, and ash contents of approximately 13.13%, 9.9%, 3.27%, and 21%, respectively with relatively high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and omega-9 fatty acids (n-9 MUFAs) and relatively low omega-6 fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs) and a n-6/n-3 ratio of 0.13 also recommend its applicability as food additives and animal feeders. Moreover, the suggested sequential zero-waste biomass residue process yielded 34.89% mineral-rich water extract (MRWE), 2.61% chlorophylla,b, 0.41% carotenoids, 12.55% starch, 3.27% lipids, 22.24% ulvan, 13.37% proteins, and 10.66% cellulose of Ulva fasciata dry weight. The efficient biocidal activity of extracted ulvan against pathogenic microorganisms and sulfate-reducing bacteria recommends its application for medical purposes, water densification, and mitigation of microbially induced corrosion in the oil and gas industry."
pub.1156586800,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF CHINA'S AND INDIA'S NATIONAL ECONOMIES,"The development of society is highly dependent on energy. However, the extensive use of power causes global problems such as resource exhaustion and climate warming. China and India are typical fast-growing developing countries whose economic advancement relies on traditional energy consumption. To realize the vision of sustainable development for these states, it is necessary to study the nations' economic efficiency of power use. Based on the analysis of energy consumption and gross domestic product trends in China and India from 1990 to 2019, this paper discusses the changes in the energy consumption index per unit of gross domestic product. The authors concluded that the power consumption in China and India is mainly concentrated in the industry, residential, and transport sectors. Divided by resource types, the energy consumed by China comes primarily from coal, oil products, and electricity, while the power consumed by India is mainly from coal, oil products, biofuels and waste. Since both countries mostly use coal and oil products which belong to fossil fuels, they emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, endangering the environment quality. Given this, China and India should focus on green power development. China's total energy consumption is much larger than India's, and China's gross domestic product is much larger than India's. However, China's energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product is less than India's. The higher the energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product is, the higher the dependence of economic development on energy is. The authors' suggestions are to develop non-fossil energy sources and adjust the energy mix, recycle solid wastes, and encourage carbon trading, climate investment and financing in the states to reach sustainable development targets."
pub.1113776628,Synthesis of Biocomposite with Different Ratios of Rapeseed Oil Binder/Wood Bark: Mechanical and Hygrothermal Properties,"Growing economy is a basis of public well-being, and its rapid growth is implemented on the expense of environmental quality; therefore, the harmonization of different aims and interests is one of the most important aspects of sustainable development concept. One of the priorities of sustainable development in Lithuania – the reduction of building and building materials industries’ impact on environment by increasing their eco and energy efficiency; consequently, the use of waste from renewable resources for the synthesis of chemical materials and production of building materials may reduce the usage of limited sources and emission of greenhouse gases. Such waste open up the opportunities to partially or fully replace traditional materials such as petroleum based polymers or cements which production emits many pollutants, uses lots of energy and natural resources. Nowadays, wood and agricultural waste are used for the production of biofuel; however, such heat source provides with short-term benefit. The use of the above mentioned waste materials for the production of bio-based thermal insulating composites would provide with long-term benefit and contribute to the improvement of currently targeted energy performance of buildings. During the study, it was obtained that the ratios of wood bark/rapeseed binder changes the main parameters of biocomposites. The obtained products are characterized by the density ranging from 329 kg/m3 to 378 kg/m3 and thermal conductivity – from 0.0665 W/(m·K) to 0.0781 W/(m·K). The compressive strength and short-term water absorption have shown that biocomposites can be used as a self-bearing structural materials due its sufficient strength which is approx. 2 MPa and water uptake varies from 20 vol.% to 40 vol.%."
pub.1053351215,Malaysian palm oil: Surviving the food versus fuel dispute for a sustainable future,"For the past few decades, palm oil has gone through a revolution that few would have predicted. From a humble source of edible oil that was heavily criticized as being un-healthy and un-fit for human consumption, it has proven itself based on scientific findings that it is indeed one of the most nutritious edible oils in the world. Besides, palm oil, the cheapest vegetable oil in the market has diversified as one of the main feedstock for oleo-chemical industries. Recently, with the price of crude petroleum hitting records height every other day, palm oil has become one of the few feasible sources for biodiesel, a renewable substitute for petroleum-derived diesel. Nevertheless, the conversion of palm oil into biodiesel has again received criticism from various NGOs worldwide, mainly on extinction of orang utans, deforestation and particularly the food versus fuel dispute. It was claimed that the conversion of food crops to fuel would significantly increase the number of undernourished people in the world. Malaysia, being the world second largest producer of palm oil, is not spared from this criticism. On the contrary, in the present study it was found that palm oil is indeed the most economical and sustainable source of food and biofuel in the world market. Besides, it was shown that it has the capacity to fulfill both demands simultaneously rather than engaging in priority debate. Nevertheless, fuel is now a necessity rather than a luxury for economy and development purposes. A few strategies will then be presented on how palm oil can survive in this feud and emerged as the main supply of affordable and healthy source of edible oil while concurrently satisfying the market demand for biodiesel throughout the world."
pub.1172637823,Sustainable biogas production via anaerobic digestion with focus on CSTR technology: A review,"Background Waste pollution can negatively impact the ecosystem directly or indirectly. Utilizing waste as a resource to produce value-added products, like biofuels, is one option to address this problem. This would create a circular economy, which is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 5, 7, 8, and 9 of the United Nations (UN). Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a technology that humans have extensively used to generate renewable energy. However, a great deal of research is required to optimize biogas production under diverse conditions. Several factors have been considered pertaining to the design and operation of digesters to ensure cost-effective and efficient digestion. Method This article summarizes the underlying AD processes and the operating parameters used to enhance process efficiency. Considering older research and recent developments, a comprehensive of the theory of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) technology for AD has been presented. The novelty of this review article lies in the emphasis on advanced intensification strategies to stabilize the AD process in CSTR for enhanced biogas/biomethane production. Furthermore, energy balance calculations of CSTR for biogas production are reviewed to promote the practical application of the technology on a global scale. Significant Findings While pretreatment enhances the substrate's surface area, eliminates lignin, and decreases the crystallinity of cellulose to stimulate microbial uptake, co-digestion provides feedstock accessibility to the microorganisms and improves CH4 yield. Energy balance studies of CSTR revealed that the majority of the energy consumed is used during heating, mixing, and feedstock transportation. In addition, the use of digestate enhances the energy recovery efficiency of the CSTR system. With proper process optimizations, AD for biogas production can help the country overcome current energy issues."
pub.1145533308,Valorization of Algal Spent Biomass into Valuable Biochemicals and Energy Resource,"Algae are the largest primary producers in the world and are found in every ecological niche conceivable. They are production systems of numerous bioactive compounds that are gaining more interest since they can be utilized in several ways. After large-scale production of primary compounds of interest, the residual biomass left is rich in many value-added compounds, which are mostly underutilized or unmapped. Algae production facilities should run in a closed loop biorefinery approach in order to produce the maximum number of possible products, which have a key role in launching sustainable bioprocess technologies, industrial translations, and a circular economy. Algae are an untapped source for valuable biochemical and energy resources. This effective biomass exploitation will lead to sustainable bio-economy advancement. Although there are few reports suggesting this practice, its complete usage within biorefinery context is still enigmatic. Residual algal biomass is left after major product extraction, with many value-added compounds with potential application in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical, energy, food, and agriculture industries. The targeted utilization of spent biomass in various bio-processes will result in efficient carbon utilization and therefore maximum yield of quality products. Valorization of this spent biomass in the field of biopolymer industries can address the environmental issues concerned with plastic. In this chapter, we discuss the cost-effective optimization of different extraction methods, valorization of each residual biomass fraction obtained after extraction, and the composition and different industrial utilities for the multiple bio-based products. This chapter discusses the cost-effective optimization of different extraction methods, valorization of each residual biomass fraction obtained after extraction, and the composition and different industrial utilities for the multiple bio-based products. The ultimate goal of the biorefinery is to integrate the production of value-added commodities like valuable biochemicals, energy resources, and biofuels, and to attain zero waste at the end in order to optimize the use of biomass resources while maximizing benefits and profitability. The most favorable biorefinery concept ultimately aims at utmost valorization of the algal biomass along with greater concentrations of target compounds. Algal biorefinery mainly targets the sequential extraction of multiple product recovery towards zero-waste processing. It valorizes its feedstock potential to exploit several bio-based products with a combined sustainable bioprocessing approach. Algae mostly contain protein, lipid, and carbohydrate, and their proportion is varied among different algae species."
pub.1181209019,Upcycling of Plastic Waste,"Annual global production of plastics has reached 368 million metric tonnes, which resulted in a dramatic increase in the production of plastic waste (PW) and associated environmental problems. The existing conventional techniques of PW management, including mechanical recycling, incineration and landfilling, cannot be considered as sustainable solutions owing to several technoeconomic and environmental infeasibilities. Upcycling refers to the valorization of waste material into value-added goods with potentially higher value than its raw feed. Plastic waste upcycling has received a lot of attention recently as a potentially effective way to achieve economic legitimacy by turning PW into goods of additional value. The current techniques can be majorly divided into thermal upcycling, and chemical upcycling, chemo-biotechnological upcycling techniques. Thermal upcycling includes carbonization, pyrolysis, and gasification technologies to recover by-products, including solid char, liquid oil and syngas, which are considered to be energy dense or can be further processed to products for use in energy and environmental applications. Chemical upcycling techniques majorly include solvolysis, hydrogenolysis, and photocatalysis for the recovery of monomers and several organo-chemicals of value. A chemo-biotechnological approach is majorly used to produce biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) – a type of bioplastic – which are widely used in the fields of biotechnology, packaging and other industrial applications. These technologies help in the recovery of value-added products like graphene sheets, porous carbon compounds, carbon nano particles, carbon dots, activated carbon, biofuels, biodegradable polymers, three-dimensional printing filaments, acids, detergents, plasticizers and different types of batteries. However, the main obstacle in achieving commercial success for valorization of PW into new by-products of value is achieving economic viability where further research must be focused upon. So, valorization of plastics through several upcycling techniques following the principles of circular economy could be a solution for sustainable waste management."
pub.1152138506,Development Prospect of Sustainable Aviation Fuel,"Greenhouse gas emissions from the global aviation industry are still rising rapidly, which is based on the emissions from developed economies and driven by the rapid growth of developing economies. China’s aviation industry became the world’s second largest aviation market after the US, with emissions of 94.9 million tons in 2018, equivalent to more than 30 million tons of aviation fuel. However, China’s per capita passenger traffic is still significantly lower than that of developed countries. By 2050, China’s aviation emissions will increase by 130–400%. Although with the growth of the national fleet, Chinese airlines have purchased new and more energy-efficient aircraft, major innovations are still needed in order to avoid uncontrolled growth of emissions in this field. With the rapid development of aviation industry, Chinese President Xi Jinping recently announced at the United Nations General Assembly that China plans to reach the peak of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Although the details are still under study, it is obvious that every sector of China’s economy, including the aviation department, needs to take major actions to decarbonize. In addition, as the international pressure to reduce emissions from the aviation industry is increasing and the international emission reduction plan frameworks, including Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), gradually come into effect, China needs to formulate a plan. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the global civil aviation departments will need to significantly increase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to replace fossil aviation fuel. With the implementation of new technologies, the use of SAF will account for more than half of the total aviation emission reduction. As one of the largest aviation fuel consumers, China also needs its own methods to develop and expand its SAF production capacity. In this paper, the main opportunities and problems surrounding the development of SAF were summarized, and the main stakeholder groups were identified. It is suggested that the stakeholders in China work out a comprehensive and achievable roadmap to greatly increase the production and application scale of SAF in China, so as to support China’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. By learning from the experience of other countries and regions in SAF industry development, policies and formulation of SAF roadmap, China now has the opportunity to promote the development of SAF technology, supply chain and industry in China by combining the needs and interests of government, aviation industry, energy industry, environmental protection and people. In the end, some commercial and policy suggestions were put forward to promote the sustainable development of China's aviation industry in the future."
pub.1135473155,Life Cycle Assessment of Lignocellulosic Waste Biorefinery,"The twenty-first century is witnessing fossil fuel depletion, increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, industrialization, urbanization and global climate change. There is a growing need to switch over to renewable energy resources and move towards circular bioeconomy. Sustainable bioeconomy has been promoted to replace fossil fuels and to produce bioenergy, chemicals and high value-added products. Biorefineries play a pivotal role in circular bioeconomy. Adoption of biorefineries is a win-win proposition both from the perspective of energy security and waste management. “Biorefining is defined as the sustainable synergetic processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable food and feed ingredients, products (chemicals, materials) and energy (fuels, power, heat)”. Biorefinery system endeavours to maximize the production of useful products from the biomass. Biorefineries adopt technologies which aim to process the biomass into diverse building blocks. The building blocks are further processed to generate biochemicals and biofuels. The biorefineries are classified based on key features such as (a) feedstocks used in the biorefinery, (b) conversion processes, (c) platform or intermediary products and (d) targeted products. The feedstocks including its characteristics, availability and biodegradability is one of the pertinent factors deciding the sustainability of biorefinery system. The debate between food and fuel has led to the search for second-generation biorefineries, which thrives on non-food biomass. The second-generation biorefineries utilize feedstocks such as residual biomass, lignocellulosic biomass and waste streams. The alternative biomass resources have huge potential for energy generation and can minimize fossil fuel use. Lignocellulose is the most abundant source of unutilised biomass. The positive attributes of lignocellulose biomass are year-round availability of biomass, renewability, sustainability, and amenability to conversion. Nevertheless, lignocellulosic waste biomass requires pretreatment for augmenting the efficiency of the conversion process. Several pretreatment strategies and methods such as physical, chemical and biological methods are adopted to enable lignin deconstruction. The pretreated lignocellulosic biomass through thermochemical conversion (combustion, gasification, hydrothermal processing, liquefaction, pyrolysis) and biochemical conversion are converted into bioenergy, biofuels, speciality chemicals and value-added products. Nevertheless, it is important to assess the impacts of biorefinery on the environment from the perspective of feedstocks, product generation and economic returns. The sustainability of the biorefineries is assessed through the life cycle assessment methodology. Life cycle assessment of biorefineries gains currency on account of (a) technological advancement, (b) bioconversion of diverse feedstocks into value-added products, (c) evaluation of the environmental perfor"

pub.1132627077,Chapter 7 The role of using bioalcohol fuels in sustainable development,"The history of mankind is has a close relationship with energy sources, and the contribution of these resources is crucial for the development and wellbeing of human societies. Dependence on energy sources can be traced back to several millennia, but nowadays there are a number of issues in their use beyond energy security. For the future of humanity, it is essential to look for solutions to the problems of energy supply and the preservation of the natural environment. Despite the Paris Agreement adopted in 2016, global CO2 emissions increased in 2017 and a new emission peak was projected by 2018. The troublesome emission values require more effective action to combat climate change. Reducing environmental risks requires an appropriate environmental policy. In this spirit, the European Commission has accepted a package of documents aimed at promoting Circular Economy. The purpose of Circular Economy is to profoundly transform the use of resources. The current emission trend has to be reversed, in which the use of biofuels can play a major role. The problem of replacing crude oil appears unabated in experimental and research activities. Low-carbon alcohols mixed with petrol can be an effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. With the first-generation technology, ethanol can be made from plants with high sugar content (sugar cane or sugar beet) or high starch content (cereals). The most important source of ethanol production is maize in the temperate climate zone. An important question is whether environmental benefits are derived from the use of bioethanol from maize for transport. There is no clear answer to this question, and depending on the methodology used, the GHG emissions decreased or increased. One of the difficulties of the first generation of bioethanol production in Europe is ensuring predictable source of raw material. Our climate creates volatile conditions in terms of maize cultivation, with significant annual yield fluctuations. Some projections suggest that such low yields can be realized that there may be no commodity supply for the production of biofuels. Since first-generation bioethanol production alone is not able to meet climate policy aims, efforts should be made to use second- and third-generation fuels to diversify raw materials. Biomethanol produced using renewable resources shows very favorable values in terms of reducing carbon dioxide emissions when used as motor fuel. In the production of biomethanol, nonfood plants and organic wastes are used. There is a lot of organic waste produced during agricultural production, the treatment of which is much more expensive than of municipal waste. The waste that accompanies agricultural production is typically biomass which is suitable for biomethanol production. The industry, which considers waste as a raw material, provides opportunities for many countries to be sustainable and competitive. Several studies have shown that waste management based on circular economic"
pub.1043046073,Global Perspectives on Birds in Agricultural Landscapes,"Earth is home for about 10,000 bird species. They inhabit all continents and interface with agroecosystems worldwide. Bird migrations across continents and nations make birds a truly global phenomenon of broad but complex conservation appeal. Global agricultural expansion during the past 200 years and intensification in the last 50 have been key drivers in global habitat loss and in declines of about 60% of the birds listed on the IUCN red list. Agricultural intensification is a continued concern as is expansion in tropical areas such as Latin America. Maintaining field-edge and set-aside habitats and using lower-intensity practices in production areas are important options for sustaining bird populations globally. Many key threats to birds in agroecosystems are global but specific impacts and management options may differ among geographical areas. Global climate change creates uncertainties for agriculture and birds, including impacts on bird migration and nesting, and concerns about synchrony between birds, habitats, and food resources. Climate change adds to other existing challenges of habitat loss and fragmentation, urbanization, migration barriers, and uncertain food resources. The push for biofuels has resulted in production intensification and habitat losses, especially removal of set-aside lands. Wildlife-friendly farming approaches can facilitate bird movement in fragmented agroecosystems and can provide important habitat for agricultural species and migratory birds. Wildlife-friendly and land sparing approaches are currently being debated toward the goal of sustaining biodiversity and food production. Global influences from social and political systems affect agroecosystems, people, and birds.Ecotourism may hold potential to benefit local economies, people, and biodiversity if proper and persistent attention is given to ensure these outcomes. Producing food and fiber while, at the same time, sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem services is a challenge for interdisciplinary research in collaboration with working farms and farmers. Research and decision-support tools are needed to facilitate development of policies and infrastructures to support sustainable agriculture and to facilitate conservation of biodiversity in agroecosystems. A conservation vision for the future is needed that embraces the realities of both natural resource limits and human desires for improved quality of life. The positive relationships between people, birds, and sustainable farms may be a key starting point to develop such a vision."
pub.1009938356,Cleaner energy for sustainable future,"This special issue of the Journal of Cleaner Production focuses on “Energy for Sustainable Future”. It is designed to mirror the increasing relevance of renewable energy sources and improved efficiency as crucial topics for practitioners in industry, for governmental policy makers, as well as for civic service providers, researchers, and educators. The purpose of this special issue is to serve as a catalyst for dialogue. The global warming related to CO2 emissions, coupled with steeply rising energy prices and the recent global financial institutional melt-down are causing massive societal concerns and give rise to increasing demand for ways to improve societal and individual energy efficiency and for ways to shift increasingly to alternative, low or non-carbon based energy systems.Until recently, industrial energy efficiency improvements have focused on improvements on efficiency rather than on the integration of renewable sources. The aim of this special issue is the identification of policies to support the development and implementation of technologies and management approaches we can employ to make the transition to more sustainable societies. The collection of papers in this special issue provide a foundation for students, researchers, scholars, practitioners and policy makers interested in making sustainable development more than a metaphor.The papers include focus upon ways for:(a)Improving industrial process to achieve improvements in energy efficiency.(b)Minimising waste disposals and reducing their impact through better management.(c)Reducing CO2 emissions by making progress toward lower carbon, renewable energy based systems,(d)Improving production of biofuels and hydrogen production systems, facilitated by employing cleaner production and novel LCA tools.(e)Improving integration of advanced materials and energy efficient equipment in different industrial sectors.Current and future developments in national and world economies are closely connected to sustainable, efficient and safe usage of raw materials and upon energy based on cleaner production concepts and approaches that are ecologically and economically appropriate for the short and for the long-term future of society.These challenges have received considerable attention in the media and scientific journals over the last several years. The idea of developing a specialised conference focussed upon them was put forward on various occasions. Focus upon them became reality on the 5th and 6th May 2008 in the historic Castle of Veszprém, Hungary, the current premises of the Hungarian Academy of Science which hosted the Workshop.The Workshop was a stimulating event and an overwhelming success, with nearly 100 contributors from Africa, North America, Asia and Europe, representing 28 countries. After a comprehensive selection and thorough reviewing procedure 11 papers were selected for this special issue."
pub.1175861520,Energy Efficiency and Productivity of a Pressure Swing Adsorption Plant to Purify Bioethanol: Disturbance Attenuation Through Geometric Control,"Biofuels produced from renewable raw materials, in this case bioethanol, provide a sustainable and renewable energy source for the future, as bioethanol positively impacts the economy, the environment, and society. Bioethanol is an alternative and immediate solution to mitigate the main greenhouse gases generated by transportation and industries that use fossil fuels. However, to produce bioethanol, it is necessary to use advanced dehydration processes or technologies. Currently, azeotropic distillation, extractive distillation, and the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) process using selective zeolites on water molecules are used. This PSA process has shown high selectivity, high yield, and high energy efficiency for producing anhydrous ethanol compared to other technologies. This work aims to implement automatic control laws (geometric and PID) to maintain stable the desired purity (99.5%), have higher bioethanol recovery, and generate higher productivity using less energy. Both controllers performed adequately on the PSA bioethanol-producing plant; however, the geometric control presented greater robustness against disturbances, achieving to maintain stable bioethanol purity above 99% by wt, generating a recovery of 73.62%, with productivity of 59.07 kmol and using an energy efficiency of 59.21%. Using this control law, it was possible to use the entire length of the columns to adsorb a greater amount of water molecules and achieve higher production."

However, the presence of alkali metals and alkali earth metals (AAEMs) can reduce EFB quality and limit their usage. To improve EFB quality, acid washing and biological pretreatment methods are commonly used. The different types of acids used for washing, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and citric acid, are evaluated for their effects on EFB quality under various concentrations and washing conditions, and the pros and cons of each acid-washing method are discussed. Additionally, the application of biological pretreatment techniques, such as fermentation using fungi and bacteria, is explored to improve the quality of EFBs. The impact of different fermentation conditions and microbial strains on EFB quality is assessed, and the benefits and drawbacks of each biological pretreatment method are analyzed. This review article provides a comprehensive understanding of the acid washing and biological pretreatment methods for EFBs and their impact on feedstock quality. The knowledge gained from this research can be used to optimize the pretreatment process and increase the efficiency of EFB utilization, promoting the development of a sustainable and circular bioeconomy."
pub.1156571244,"Benchmarking composting, anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation for apple vinasse management as a strategy for sustainable energy production","Looking for renewable energy sources is one of the main targets in the transition to low-carbon economies. Bioenergy appears as an alternative with great potential, but firstly, it requires addressing all aspects that can limit its environmental viability. Stillage has been identified as an environmental concern of the bioethanol production. Thus, eco-friendly strategies for valorizing this resource should be pursued. In this work, three strategies such as composting (non-energy valorization), one-stage anaerobic digestion (with the aim of biogas production), and dark fermentation followed by anaerobic digestion (scheme under development to produce biohydrogen and biogas) were evaluated under a life-cycle perspective; and through process modeling based on literature data. The aim is to identify the advantages and disadvantages of dark fermentation for the management of apple stillage. To do this, a cradle-to-gate and attributional framework were followed, considering impact and damage perspectives. Results showed a very significant environmental load (around 99%) of composting compared to the selected energy recovery schemes, considering the added value of compost and the associated emissions versus those of biofuels. Otherwise, small differences were found between single-stage anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation (up to 16%), mainly, due to changes in chemical consumption and organic matter degradation efficiency."
pub.1112544675,Rapid microwave-assisted liquid phase conversion of bio-ethanol to n-butanol over a heterogeneous catalyst,"A sustainable bio-based fuel industry is dependent on finding efficient technologies for the production of biofuels. A microwave-assisted method to produce bio-butanol from bio-ethanol in liquid phase was investigated using a 2-level factorial design with catalyst type and loading, reaction temperature and reaction time as variables. A combined severity factor (CSF) was used to quantify the combined effect of all reaction conditions on ethanol conversion and butanol selectivity. From the results, it could be qualitatively deduced that the reaction initially followed the Guerbet mechanism for formation of butanol, but gradually shifted toward the direct coupling mechanism as reaction conditions became more severe with 50% of the butanol produced at a CSF of 6, produced through the direct coupling mechanism. The overall reaction order and observed specific reaction rate was determined as 1.54 ± 0.26 and 2.91·10−6 ± 2.36·10−7 g.0.54.L−0.54.s−1 respectively. Both high ethanol conversions (76.6 wt%) and high butanol selectivity (60 wt%) could be obtained in a very short reaction time (60 minutes). The results represent an improvement in reaction time, ethanol conversion and butanol selectivity of 300%, 47% and 16.7% respectively compared to previously reported data. This represents a significant step towards realizing an affordable low-carbon drop-in fuel for a low carbon economy."
pub.1169770190,Is Biomass Energy a Boon or Bane for Society: A Comprehensive Analysis,"In recent years, due to rising fossil fuel costs, the recycling and reuse of biomass into value-added applications have gained attention. There are several disposal concerns and governance problems as a result of the rapidly increasing amount of biomass waste. Over the past few years, the use of biomass for electricity production has increased across the globe. Energy systems reliant on biomass wastes have the potential to improve local energy access, generate employment opportunities and rural development in emerging economies, and aid in adapting and mitigating the influences of climate change. However, research has also shown that some biofuel production can lead to conflicts with the food supply and environmental issues. This review chapter is based on a thorough and extensive literature search and critical evaluation of previously published scholarly and non-scholarly material to discover a wide range of high-quality sources on biomass energy usage and its impact on the surrounding environment. Furthermore, inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the importance of ensuring access to clean and affordable energy (SDG 7) and climate change mitigation (SGD 13), this chapter examines whether biomass energy is a blessing or a curse for society."
pub.1157439033,Recent advances in waste-based and natural zeolitic catalytic materials for biodiesel production,"Considering the current world crisis and definite future energy challenges,
   biomass-to-fuel transformation is increasingly becoming important both to
   the policy makers and to the industry. In this perspective, the valorisation
   of oils and fats via transesterification/esterification reaction is an
   attractive method for producing biodiesel with qualities suitable for diesel
   engines. The recent interest indicated a significant shift to industrial
   waste valorisation as another approach for achieving process eco-efficiency.
   In this respect, the use of zeolite-based catalysts for the production of
   biofuels is reviewed here, with a special emphasis on the utilization of
   waste raw materials following the principles of green chemistry and
   sustainable development. Zeolites are interesting due to their outstanding
   catalytic properties, including the presence of intrinsic acid sites, simple
   loading of base sites, shape-selectivity, and high thermal stability. Neat
   zeolites or modified by the loading of active species are classified into
   several groups following their origin. For each group, the most relevant
   recent results reported in the literature are reviewed together with some
   critical considerations on the catalyst effectiveness, stability,
   reusability, and economy of synthesis. As an important part required for
   understanding and optimization of the biodiesel production process, the
   mechanisms of the reaction were discussed in detail. Finally, key
   perspective directions for further research studies were carefully
   identified and elaborated."
pub.1147553935,An overview of lignin pathways of valorization: from isolation to refining and conversion into value-added products,"The increasing demand for greener and sustainable alternatives to fossil-derived fuels, chemicals, and materials has attracted huge attention to lignin, the largest renewable source of aromatic building blocks on earth. This natural polymer accounts for 15 to 40% of all lignocellulosic biomass. As such, in the pulp and paper industries, for example, huge amounts of lignin are produced worldwide. However, most applications for these lignins are of low value, such as their burning for energy. Furthermore, with the introduction of second-generation ethanol biorefineries, the overall lignin production increased. To attain a circular bio-based economy, all side-streams of lignocellulosic biomass and, particularly, lignin should be valorized to as high of a value as possible. Lignin’s rich structure has allowed achieving various high-value products over the years, not only in the production of biofuels but also regarding chemicals and materials. The present paper addresses a broad vision of the several stages of lignin valorization, from the isolation of lignin through pre-treatments of lignocellulosic biomass and the current industrial lignin production to fractionation methodologies that provide homogeneous lignins more adequate for valorization and the conversion of lignin into value-added products via chemical and biological routes."
pub.1145421117,Global Land Use Impacts of Bioeconomy: An Econometric Input–Output Approach,"Many countries have set ambiguous targets for the development of a bioeconomy that not only ensures sufficient production of high-quality foods but also contributes to decarbonization, green jobs and reducing import dependency through biofuels and advanced biomaterials. However, feeding a growing and increasingly affluent world population and providing additional biomass for a future bioeconomy all within planetary boundaries constitute an enormous challenge for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Global economic models mapping the complex network of global supply such as multiregional input–output (MRIO) or computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have been the workhorses to monitor the past as well as possible future impacts of the bioeconomy. These approaches, however, have often been criticized for their relatively low amount of detail on agriculture and energy, or for their lack of an empirical base for the specification of agents’ economic behavior. In this paper, we address these issues and present a hybrid macro-econometric model that combines a comprehensive mapping of the world economy with highly detailed submodules of agriculture and the energy sector in physical units based on FAO and IEA data. We showcase the model in a case study on the future global impacts of the EU’s bioeconomy transformation and find small positive economic impacts at the cost of a considerable increase in land use mostly outside of Europe."
pub.1169770372,Myco-degradation of Lignocellulosic Waste Biomass and Their Applications,"Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant and renewable biomaterial on our planet. It is crucial to develop alternative energy technologies to create a variety of value-added products from this waste biomass in order to reduce the environmental problems that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. For this, myco-degradation is a very promising bioconversion technique in which fungi, such as white-rot basidiomycetes, are used to breakdown complex lignocellulosic structures into simpler compounds useful in a variety of applications. In addition to cellulases and hemicellulases, the hydrolytic enzymes that breakdown polysaccharides, fungi have special oxidative systems that work in conjunction with ligninolytic enzymes to breakdown lignocellulose. Fungi that breakdown lignocellulose improve the quality of the degraded biomass and aid in the production of several by-products that are used to produce biofuels, enzymes, animal feed, fertilizers, and soil amendments. This chapter gives an overview of the myco-degradation mechanisms, the relevant enzymes used, the types of fungi employed in the process, and their uses in various industries. Overall, myco-degradation has the potential to be a cost-effective and sustainable process for recycling lignocellulosic waste biomass into useful products, with significant benefits for both the economy and the environment."
pub.1046414488,Prospects of biodiesel production from microalgae in India,"Energy is essential and vital for development, and the global economy literally runs on energy. The use of fossil fuels as energy is now widely accepted as unsustainable due to depleting resources and also due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the environment. Renewable and carbon neutral biodiesel are necessary for environmental and economic sustainability. Biodiesel demand is constantly increasing as the reservoir of fossil fuel are depleting. Unfortunately biodiesel produced from oil crop, waste cooking oil and animal fats are not able to replace fossil fuel. The viability of the first generation biofuels production is however questionable because of the conflict with food supply. Production of biodiesel using microalgae biomass appears to be a viable alternative. The oil productivity of many microalgae exceeds the best producing oil crops. Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms which convert sunlight, water and CO2 to sugars, from which macromolecules, such as lipids and triacylglycerols (TAGs) can be obtained. These TAGs are the promising and sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Microalgal biorefinery approach can be used to reduce the cost of making microalgal biodiesel. Microalgal-based carbon sequestration technologies cover the cost of carbon capture and sequestration. The present paper is an attempt to review the potential of microalgal biodiesel in comparison to the agricultural crops and its prospects in India."
pub.1027628907,Energy geotechnology,"Energy consumption is closely correlated with quality of life. A 1% annual increase in power production is required to sustain current trends, and a 2% annual increase will be needed to satisfy anticipated growth in the developing world. On average, 85% of all primary energy comes from fossil fuels; this carbon-based economy faces limitations in reserves and climate-change implications. Energy Geotechnology must play a central role in the development of a sustainable energy strategy. Geotechnology is intimately involved in all energy resources, including fossil fuels (petroleum gas and coal), nuclear energy, and renewable sources (wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, biofuels, and tidal energy). While wind and solar energy are surface processes that require limited geotechnical engineering, subsurface geo-storage is a viable alternative to bridge the time-gap between production and demand peaks. Geotechnical engineering is required to manage energy-related waste, ranging from fly ash to CO2 emissions and nuclear waste. Furthermore, geotechnical engineering can contribute to geo-environmental remediation, the design of new facilities in view of life-cycle needs and decommissioning, and geotechnical construction methods that reduce the embodied energy in infrastructure projects. Education programs must be restructured to prepare the next generation of geotechnical engineers to address the needs in the energy sector."
pub.1145745866,"A comparison between microalgal autotrophic growth and metabolite accumulation with heterotrophic, mixotrophic and photoheterotrophic cultivation modes","Microalgae are sustainable feedstock for healthy food and feed, organic drugs, ecological polymers, green chemicals and dyes, biofuels, biofertilizers, and environmental bioremediation technologies. Despite its enormous promises, microalgae cultivation is expensive and thus large-scale production is centred on low volume/high value markets, such as the specialty food and feed, dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals. Large-scale microalgal cultivation is severely limited by the low biomass productivity achieved in current production systems, due to low photosynthetic efficiency. Furthermore, the management of carbon dioxide (CO2) for microalgal large-scale production is costly and faces technological constraints. The cultivation of microalgae in media supplemented with organic carbon substrates, with or without light, can significantly increase biomass productivities and overcome the technical constraints associated to CO2 supply. This review collects quantitative data to compare microalgal autotrophic growth and metabolite accumulation with heterotrophic, mixotrophic and photoheterotrophic cultivation modes. Critique hypotheses are proposed to explain the increase in biomass productivity once microalgae are supplied with organic carbon molecules. The main cultivation parameters that could affect biomass accumulation are also analysed. Supplementation of microalgae with organic carbon substrates could be a suitable strategy towards a microalgal economy, despite the constraints and challenges that have to be overcome and that are also analysed."
pub.1104295311,Supply Chain Mixed Integer Linear Program Model Integrating a Biorefining Technology Superstructure,"A crucial element of the quest of curbing carbon dioxide emissions is deemed to rely on a biobased economy, which will rely on the development of financially sustainable biorefining systems enabling a full exploitation of lignocellulosic biomass (and its macrocomponents such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) for the coproduction of biofuels and bioderived platform chemicals. In this work, a general modeling framework conceived to steer decision-making regarding the strategic design and systematic planning of advanced biorefining supply networks is presented. The design task is formulated as a mixed integer linear program which accounts for the maximization of the supply chain profit, considering multiechelon, multiperiod, multifeedstock, and multiproduct aspects as well as spatially explicit features. The applicability of the proposed model, along with the use of a bilevel decomposition approach, are demonstrated with a case study of lignocellulose-based biorefining production systems in the South-West of Hungary. Results show the effectiveness of the tool in the decision-making regarding the systematic design of advanced biorefining SC networks. An economic analysis of different design configurations (i.e., centralized and distributed scenarios) through a holistic evaluation of the entire biobased SC, integrating technology superstructure, shows that both instances generate profitable investment decisions that could be equally trusted by the decision-maker unless regional restrictions are applied."
pub.1166392992,Where engineering meets biology: The Computational Fluid Dynamic analysis of a stacked duckweed bioreactor,"The necessity for sustainable farming practices, wastewater valorisation and circular economy applications have prompted increased interest in duckweed cultivation. As floating plants, duckweed species show rapid growth and can be cultured agri-food industry wastewater. Further, the resulting plant biomass is a valuable high-protein livestock feed and a biofuel feedstock. The development of multitiered (i.e., vertically stacked) indoor bioreactors enable reliable, high-capacity growth irrespective of seasons. Here, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approach was applied to a pilot-scale duckweed cultivation system to provide insight into wastewater hydrodynamics to support further development and optimisation. CFD modelling and validation indicated that the pilot-scale system behaved non-ideally, with 60.1 % of the volume considered stagnant, and with surface channelling also identified. Analysis of the aspect ratio and inlet/outlet port positions of the cultivation tray enabled a 24.3 % decrease in stagnation, as well as a significant reduction in channelling, when the number of tray inlet/outlet ports was increased from two to three. Thus, the current study highlights the value of in-depth evaluation of the fluid flow using CFD, as a strategy to improve design of duckweed cultivation systems. This strategy can be further expanded to incorporate local and temporal nutrient depletion and predict duckweed growth rates."
pub.1165705916,Patterns in interactions of variably acetylated xylans with hydrophobic cellulose surfaces,"The recalcitrance of plant cell wall lignocellulosic biomass to deconstruction is a major hurdle to sustainable biofuel/bioproduct economy. A multitude of interactions stabilize lignocellulosic biomass structure. Among these, tight packing of hemicellulose-cellulose is partly responsible for biomass recalcitrance. Here, unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations are employed to understand the influence of the nature and pattern of naturally-occuring acetyl decorations of the xylan backbone on interactions with the (100) hydrophobic cellulose surface. Periodically O2-acetylated xylan (2AcX) assume twofold helical screw conformations that are stabilized by a combination of multiple hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds with the hydrophobic cellulose surface. In contrast, acetylation at the O3 position in xylan obstructs interactions, thereby adopting threefold helical screw conformations that potentially preferably interact with lignin rather than cellulose. Fully acetylated xylan desorbs from the surface implying a minimum number of unsubstituted residues on the xylan backbone is required for interaction with the surface. The substituted residues must form ~ 20% fewer contacts than the unsubstituted residues to sustain stable twofold helical screw xylan conformations on the cellulose surface. Thus, specific roles of macromolecular conformations of cellulose and hemicellulose in influencing the supramolecular interactions and function of plant cell walls have been determined."
pub.1142031538,Phycoremediation: A sustainable alternative in wastewater treatment (WWT) regime,"Wastewater (WW) generated from the industries, agricultural and domestic activities produce high amounts of nutrients, heavy metals (HMs) and chemicals that degrades the environmental assets like land, air, water and culminates in human and animal health hazards. The conventional techniques of remediation are inefficient and eco-hazardous compared to the non-conventional which are cost-effective, reliable and ecofriendly. The utilization of biological agents for the remediation of natural assets is known as bioremediation. Phycoremediation (a bioremediation technique) strategies cater to the possibility of using algal diversity to remediate hazardous contaminants (hydrocarbons, pesticides, radioactive matter, HMs etc.) while also valorizing the treated biomass for the manufacture of value-added goods (fertilizers, biofuel etc.). Apart from being a carbon sink, algae have a significant surface-to-volume ratio, for biosorption (due to metal-binding groups on cell surfaces), bioconcentration, and biotransformation of pollutants. After reviewing the extant literature (170 publications), we conclude that in future phycoremediation shall bring in a radical change in the existing wastewater treatment (WWT) regimes for the benefit of mankind through the concept of circular economy. Meticulous studies and joint efforts of the academia and industries should focus on developing and conserving hyperaccumulator microalgal strains and fully exploit their remediation potential against emerging wastewater (WW) contaminants to attain sustainability in the health and environment sector."

This fuel flexibility enhances the other qualities demonstrated by Gas Turbines among which the prominent ones are: energy effectiveness, operational reliability and emission compliance. Therefore, Gas Turbines using local fuel resources and deployed in simple or combined cycles or in cogeneration plants, enable the concept of cost-effective and environmentally-conscious power projects and can make a valuable contribution to the sustainable, regional development. However, in order to benefit from the fuel flexibility of Gas Turbines, some basic technical considerations are necessary. The paper intends to provide the power community with comprehensive information about alternative GT fuels. It offers a review of the main alternative fuel candidates and sets out the primary technical/engineering considerations that underlie their safe and reliable utilization. Special emphasis is placed on: (i) volatile fuels (naphtha, NLG, condensates); (iii) weak gas fuels from the coal/iron industry (coal-bed; coke-oven, blast furnace gas); (iv) paraffin-rich and hydrogen-rich by-products from refineries (‘fuel gas’; LPG) and (iv) ash-forming oils (residuals; heavy crude’s).Copyright © 2002 by ASME"
pub.1007758822,Conditions for a 100% renewable energy supply system in Japan and South Korea,"In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident, alternative energy paths have been discussed for Japan, but except for a few studies the assumption is usually made that Japan is too densely populated to be suited for a near-100% sustainable, indigenous energy provision. The studies emphasizing renewable energy have proposed the use of photovoltaic power as the main source of electricity supply, in combination with diurnal battery storage and supplemented by other renewable sources such as wind, hydro, and geothermal power. Here, an alternative approach is explored, with wind and derived hydrogen production as the main energy source, but still using solar energy, biofuels, and hydropower in a resilient combination allowing full satisfaction of demands in all sectors of the economy, i.e., for dedicated electricity, transportation energy as well as heat for processes and comfort. Furthermore, the possible advantage of establishing a regional energy system with energy interchange and coordinated management of the mix of renewable energy resources across a wider region is discussed. As the closest neighbor, the energy system of South Korea is considered, first regarding the possibility of a similar full renewable energy reliance, and then for possible synergetic effects of connecting the Korean and the Japanese energy systems, in order to be able to better cope with the intermittency of renewable energy source flows."
pub.1146392324,Optimization and Kinetics Studies of Biodiesel Synthesis from Jatropha Curcas Oil Under the Application of Eco-Friendly Microwave Heating Technique: An Environmentally Benign and Sustainable Bio-Waste Management Approach,"<p>This study attempts to synthesize biodiesel as a green liquid fuel from <em>Jatropha curcas</em> oil utilizing waste eggshell (WES) as an effective and excellent sustainable source of the heterogeneous catalyst under the application of environmental benign microwave heating technique. After preparing the CaO-based catalyst, diverse characterization techniques such as XRD, EDS, SEM, FITR, and BET were employed for measurements. Under different optimized conditions, a considerable high biodiesel yield of 91.7% was attained while employing the following reaction conditions; methanol to oil ratio (MTOR) of 9:1, 5 wt% catalyst loading, 165 min reaction time with a microwave power of 800 W, and a 65&deg;C reaction temperature. The developed catalyst had significantly retained its reusability up to the 5th cycle of reuse. The catalysed transesterification process's activation energy (Ea) of 9.58 kJ/mol demonstrated that the reaction is chemically controlled. The physico-chemical properties of the <em>Jatropha curcas</em> oil (JCO) biodiesel were studied in accordance with international standards such as ASTM D6751 and EN14214, among others. Therefore, the waste eggshell has been utilized as a renewable base heterogeneous catalyst for novel biodiesel synthesis from JCO, which can be applied in diesel engines to lessen air pollution, specifically pollutant emissions from diesel vehicles. The results of this study are not for academic purposes only. They can also serve as models for industrial biodiesel production by exploiting bio-waste as catalysts and non-edible oils as feedstocks in microwave heating systems as environmentally friendly chemistry systems. In addition, our study uses non-consumable oil feedstock and bio-waste materials in an economical way to produce biofuel while contributing to environmental sustainability and sustainable bio-waste management. This approach extends to the existing state-of-the-art research. Therefore, the proposed value increase method contributes to integrating the circular economy concept through an efficient biorefinery model.</p>"
pub.1028257845,Sustainable Food Security in the Era of Local and Global Environmental Change,"This volume discusses a broad range of vital issues encompassing the production and consumption of food in the current period of climate change. All of these add up to looming, momentous challenges to food security, especially for people in regions where malnutrition and famine have been the norm during numerous decades. Furthermore, threats to food security do not stop at the borders of more affluent countries – governance of food systems and changes in eating patterns will have worldwide consequences. The book is arranged in four broad sections. Part I, Combating Food Insecurity: A Global Responsibility opens with a chapter describing the urgent necessity for new paradigm and policy set to meet the food security challenges of climate change. Also in this section are chapters on meat and the dimensions of animal welfare, climate change and sustainability; on dietary options for mitigating climate change; and the linkage of forest and food production in the context of the REDD+ approach to valuation of forests. Part II, Managing Linkages Between Climate Change and Food Security offers a South Asian perspective on Gender, Climate Change and Household Food Security; a chapter on food crisis in sub-Saharan Africa; and separate chapters on critical issues of food supply and production in Nigeria, far-Western Nepal and the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Cameroon. Part III examines Food Security and patterns of production and consumption, with chapters focused on Morocco, Thailand, Bahrain, Kenya and elsewhere. The final section discusses successful, innovative practices, with chapters on Food Security in Knowledge-Based Economy; Biosaline Agriculture in the Gulf States; Rice production in a cotton zone of Benin; palm oil in the production of biofuel; and experiments in raised-bed wheat production. The editors argue that technical prescriptions are insufficient to manage the food security challenge. They propose and explain a holistic approach for adapting food systemsto global environmental change, which demands the engagement of many disciplines – a new, sustainable food security paradigm."

This study investigates the feasibility of producing bioethanol and the commercially important EPS from a non‐nitrogen fixing marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus BDU 10144 in a novel low‐cost seawater‐fertilizer medium for the development of a biorefinery strategy. Herein, agricultural fertilizer diammonium phosphate (DAP) (nitrogen source), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and potassium were optimized by the central composite design to produce maximum biomass and carbohydrate accretion. The optimal physical conditions for attaining maximum growth and carbohydrate accumulation were determined to be pH 10, 50 μmol m−2 s−1 (light intensity) and 25°C. Further, different concentrations of seawater were mixed with the optimized fertilizer‐salts, and it was observed that 70% of seawater mixed with the optimized fertilizer‐salts (hereafter FSW medium) was an optimum condition for growing the test cyanobacterium, which ultimately reduced the cost of the medium by >40 times compared to the standard artificial seawater nutrient (ASN‐III) medium. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum biomass (1.79 g/L) and carbohydrate (702.4 mg/L) yield obtained were ~1.7 and 2.2 times higher than the ASN‐III. The yield of bioethanol was noted to be 318.1 mg/L, which was ~2.3 times greater than ASN‐III. The commercially important EPS was obtained from the discarded supernatant (0.28 g/L), which was ~1.6 times higher in the FSW medium. Thus, the present investigation paves a way forward for mass cultivation of the S. elongatus BDU 1044 in the novel FSW medium for the cost‐efficient and sustainable development of a biorefinery concept. Cyanobacteria can be found in a variety of bio‐economy products like biofuels, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus BDU 10144 was shown for the first time to be a quintessential feedstock for co‐production of bioethanol and high‐value exopolysaccarides for sustainable biorefinery."

pub.1135476465,Climate Change and Innovation in Brazil- Threats and Opportunities,"In recent decades, Brazil has adopted a political approach focused on maintaining economic stability and consolidating inclusive social policies. However, despite repeated attempts, little progress has been made in overcoming difficulties within the country and making Brazil more competitive in the global market. Nevertheless, there seems to be an awakening and a certain consensus among scholars of Brazilian problems that the expected inclusive economic growth cycle may be achieved if Brazil invests in enhancing the bioeconomy business environment through bioenergy and innovation.The actual crisis is fast–tracking two major transformations at the global level: the energy transition and the information revolution, both dependent on innovation. Brazil showcases a comparative advantage for renewable energy sources in comparison to the rest of the world. Even considering the controversial major use of hydroelectricity and sugarcane biofuels, these sources are undoubtfully less harmful than fossil sources, such as coal and diesel. This could be an unprecedented opportunity. Nevertheless, Brazil has faced considerable environmental disasters in recent years, despite its consistent legal framework protecting the environment. This paper advocates a legal pathway to disseminate knowledge and to reach sustainable growth by adopting decarbonization processes and innovation. By decarbonization processes, the authors mean the transition to a decarbonized economy by adopting innovative technological transformations that provide bioeconomy lead traditional manufacturers into renewable and sustainable industries. In relation to these processes, it is essential that decision makers, especially public officials in the national environmental and innovation agencies, understand the existing legal paths, modernize the instruments used for cooperation and the generation of new products with a focus on growth and competitiveness, and enforce environmental protection law and mechanisms. Regarding innovation, the premise is that the new cooperation instruments allowed by the legal framework of innovation will strengthen relations between public and private agents.This paper first presents the principles and main environmental and energy transition rules that comprise the current Brazilian legal framework. It then shows the contradictions that need to be overcome in the environmental system. Finally, the paper presents opportunities and proposals for change and improvement towards sustainable growth. and"
pub.1174659409,Biocatalytic Screening of the Oxidative Potential of Fungi Cultivated on Plant-Based Resources,"The environmental impacts of the postindustrial era, which rely on fossil fuels, have compelled a reconsideration of the future of energy and chemical industries. Fungi are a valuable resource for improving a circular economy through the enhanced valorization of biomass and plant waste. They harbor a great diversity of oxidative enzymes, especially in their secretome. Enzymatic breakdown of the plant cell wall complex and lignocellulosic biomass yields sugars for fermentation and biofuel production, as well as aromatic compounds from lignin that can serve as raw materials for the chemical industry. To harness the biocatalytic potential, it is essential to identify and explore wild-type fungi and their secretomes. This study successfully combined genome mining and activity screening to uncover the oxidative potential of a collection of underexploited ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The heme peroxidase and laccase activities of four promising candidates, Bipolaris victoriae, Colletotrichum sublineola, Neofusicoccum parvum and Moesziomyces antarcticus, were investigated to gain a deeper insight into their enzyme secretion. Furthermore, a plant-based medium screening with the phytopathogen C. sublineola revealed that soybean meal is a beneficial component to trigger the production and secretion of enzymes that catalyze H2O2-dependent oxidations. These results demonstrate that understanding fungal secretomes and their enzymatic potential opens exciting avenues for sustainable biotechnological applications across various industries."

This study addresses the logistic challenge of mobilizing national cellulosic feedstock supplies for a sustainable bioenergy industry. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was developed and updated to deliver on-spec biomass that considers both a desired quantity and quality at the biorefinery. Our supply chain analysis includes multi-modal transport (truck and rail), varying depot and biorefinery sizes, and feedstock blends of corn stover (harvested by either a two- or three-pass method), switchgrass, and miscanthus. The following US states: Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Georgia, and Texas were identified as key locations for producing accessible miscanthus. Based on our most optimistic scenario, using trucks as the only transportation mode in 2040 with a cost target of $79/dt, corn stover, switchgrass, and miscanthus could help meet 48% of the EPA target, 173 million dry tons that translate into 7.8 billion GGE. The addition of rail transportation for biomass delivery to biorefineries could help meet 79% of the EPA target, 283 million dry tons that translate into 12.7 billion GGE."
pub.1164930001,Resource recovery of bioactive compounds from food waste and their diverse industrial applications,"Food waste is a matter of great concern because of its impact on society, the economy, and the environment. The requirement of establishing sustainable practices for food waste management as the focus has changed from disposal to valorization. To reduce the environmental effect and create economic opportunities, food waste valorization entails converting waste into valuable resources, such as power, biofuels, animal feed, and high-value commodities. Additionally, the recovery of resources and the extraction of bioactive compounds with a variety of industrial uses are made possible by food waste and by-products. The extraction of bioactive compounds from food waste has been recently been made possible by several new technologies, including microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), high hydrostatic pressure extraction (HHP), pulse electric field extraction (PEFE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE). The prime objective of the current review is to highlight the possible use of these bioactive compounds in a variety of fields, such as food, medicine, cosmetics, textiles, and agriculture, and to demonstrate their numerous advantages and wide-ranging consequences. The manuscript also provides a thorough analysis of the challenges encountered in the recovery of bioactive compounds and provides insight into potential future developments."

However, in addition to issues like competitiveness and employment, bioclusters operate with the additional goal of fostering the transition to a sustainable bioeconomy. The profound changes that are required for a successful shift from a fossil‐based economy to a bioeconomy are called transitions and the relatively new scientific field of transition theory has emerged to study them. The aim of this paper is to show the contribution that transition theory can make to the study of bioclusters. In this paper I will review frameworks from the study of sustainability transitions (multi‐level perspective and technical innovation systems) and frameworks from theories of evolutionary economic geography and cluster studies (regional and sectoral innovation systems). The review shows how the choice of a particular framework will shape the analysis of the biocluster through the particular focus and delineation associated with each framework. The review shows the advantages and disadvantages these frameworks have for incorporating the various issues related to the shift towards a bioeconomy that are currently neglected in the literature on bioclusters. © 2018 The Authors.

pub.1136335080,Statistical Modeling of the Energy Market Development in the Regions of Ukraine,"The article is aimed at modeling the energy market of Ukraine on the meso-level, identifying its features and development problems, forming a system of indicators for monitoring the development of electricity production at the regional level. It is determined that Ukraine produces electrical power mainly from non-renewable energy sources, namely fossil and mineral fuels, using nuclear power plants and thermal power plants, which comprises 54% of the total electricity production. Wind, solar sources of electrical power, biofuels and hydroelectric power plants make up a smaller part of production – 7%. It is noted that Ukraine annually consumes about 92 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) of energy, has a high level of energy intensity of the economy, therefore, in order to reach the world average level, it is necessary to reduce energy consumption by 50 million toe. The level of losses of the produced and imported energy during its transformation and transportation to the end user is 44%. The potential for reducing energy consumption during consumption in sectors such as housing, budget-based and energy supply is about 19 million toe. To assess the state of the energy sector in Ukraine in 2019, a grouping of regions of Ukraine was carried out using cluster analysis. The regions that have entered the 1st cluster, namely: Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, have the best prospects for the rapid innovative development of the energy market. The regions that are included in the 3rd cluster have the lowest values of energy sector development indicators among other clusters and require special attention to the development of new, cost-effective energy technologies. The system of indicators for the analysis of the energy market development on meso-level is substantiated. The proposed indicators are adapted to the indicators of monitoring the achievement of sustainable development goals, namely: sustainable development goals 7 «Ensuring access to inexpensive, reliable, sustainable and modern energy sources for everyone»."
pub.1133312915,"Optimum sustainable utilisation of the whole fruit of Jatropha curcas: An energy, water and food nexus approach","The growing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions combined with the rise of the demand on energy resources has expedited research into sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel. In this context, biomass has increased in popularity and acquired a significant share of the global energy mix in a relatively short time. However, several biomass resources have triggered wide criticism for compromising food resources, agricultural lands and fresh water to produce energy crops. Therefore, a second generation of non-edible biomass such as Jatropha curcas has become a major biofuel feedstock for several countries. Not only can its oil be converted into liquid fuels, but also the Jatropha fruit residues have high calorific value and are processed into several forms of energy. Several studies have investigated the different processing technologies to produce energy and food-related products, although no conclusions have been made on the most sustainable pathway for Jatropha utilisation considering its interlinkages to the energy, water and food resources, whilst considering its possible contributions to mitigating carbon emissions and the development of circular economies. As such, this study investigates 11 processing pathways for the major three components of Jatropha fruit from cradle to gate via a combination of three key tools including Energy-Water-Food (EWF) Nexus, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Return on Investment (ROI). Aspen Plus software is used to simulate the production processes including transesterification, hydrotreatment, hydrocracking, gasification, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, anaerobic digestion, saccharification and fermentation, incineration and detoxification. In addition, a mathematical model is developed to run a five-objective optimisation study using MATLAB. The model identifies an opportunity to process the Jatropha oil by transesterification (49%), hydrotreatment (28%) and hydrocracking (23%). while it is suggested that the seedcake is best utilised directly as fertilisers (35%) and processed for energy production by pyrolysis (30%) and anaerobic digestion (17%). Nevertheless, the shells of Jatropha are best utilised via SSF (32%), pyrolysis (28%), anaerobic digestion (22%) and incineration (11%)."
pub.1144984427,Experimental Investigation of the Combustion Behavior of Jet-A/Water Emulsified Fuel and Ethanol-Blended Jet-A/Water Emulsified Fuel Droplets,"Abstract
                  The demanding emission requirements must be satisfied by the modern aero-engines which led the researchers into exploration and development of environment-friendly, and sustainable aviation fuels. Water emulsification in fuels is a proven mechanism to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOX) and pollutant emissions. Furthermore, water addition in liquid fuel can improve the combustion performance and fuel economy by micro-explosions and puffing phenomenon due to the volatility difference between liquid fuels and water. These micro-explosions and puffing result in the breaking of fuel droplets into smaller droplets which promotes secondary atomization of the liquid fuels. The secondary atomization contributes to a higher combustion rate, improves fuel-air mixing, and thus improves fuel economy. Also, with the depletion of fossil-fuel sources, the scientific community is exploring renewable sources which can be both reliable and better substitutes for conventional fossil fuels. Blending biofuel with fossil fuel is an interesting way to a sustainable solution for green energy production and carbon footprint reduction of conventional aviation fuels. In these contexts, the present study reports an experimental investigation on the combustion characteristics of water emulsified Jet-A and water emulsified ethanol-blended Jet-A fuels. The Ultrasonication method is used to prepare homogenized fuel emulsions with three different water concentrations (2.5%, 5% & 10% by weight) for both Jet-A and ethanol-blended Jet-A fuels. Blended Jet-A fuels are prepared for different ethanol concentrations (2.5%, 5% & 10% by weight). Combustion characteristics such as ignition delay, combustion rate, and droplet burning time data are generated for each emulsified fuel. The results are compared for both Jet-A, and ethanol-blended Jet-A fuel emulsions. It is found that there is a general decrease in combustion rate and droplet burning time for all the emulsions. This decrease is higher with higher content of water and ethanol. There is also a general increase in ignition delay. Again, this increase is higher for emulsions with higher water concentration. Hopefully, the outcomes of the present study will increase further interest in combustion characteristics modification of conventional aviation fuels by emulsification. In addition, the findings of the present study will provide experimental data which can be applied for future computational modeling of the combustion process of emulsified fuel."
pub.1174734854,Novel biofuel blends for diesel engines: Optimizing engine performance and emissions with C. cohnii microalgae biodiesel and algae-derived renewable diesel blends,"Fossil diesel is a significant global fuel; however, environmental concerns and resource scarcity necessitate alternative fuels. Third-generation microalgae biodiesel (MB), despite its carbon neutrality, leads to higher oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions and poor engine performance. Renewable diesel (RD), also known as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), could reduce these issues. A quasi-dimensional multi-zone combustion model is employed in this study to look into how different fuel blends of diesel, C. cohnii MB, and algae-derived RD affect the performance, combustion, and emissions of a compression ignition (CI) engine. The study uses a 2000 rpm engine arrangement with different engine loads, and validates the computational analysis with an experimental test engine arrangement. The study aims to explore the potential of sustainable biofuels in CI engines. D70MB30 (70 vol% diesel, and 30 vol% MB) fuel blend leads to a higher ignition delay period (IDP) while lowering peak cylinder pressure (PCP) and peak heat release rate (PHRR) compared to D100; however, when RD is added to diesel-MB fuel blends, it reduces IDP and increases PCP and PHRR. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) for the D70MB30 blend rises by 5.28–8.9 %, while brake thermal efficiency (BTE) reduces by 0.98–4.27 %. However, RD in MB blends reduces BSFC by 1.57–3.41 % and marginally enhances BTE, resulting in greater fuel economy and efficiency. D70MB30 fuel blend results in higher specific carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions while lowering particulate matter (PM) and smoke emissions compared to neat diesel due to its high intrinsic oxygen content. In contrast, RD with the MB blend reduces specific CO2 and NOx emissions; however, it increases PM and smoke emissions due to the NOx-PM trade-off. The optimum results occur with a full load and D70MB15RD15 (70 vol% diesel, 15 vol% MB, and 15 vol% RD) fuel blend. Compared to the D70MB30 blend, D70MB15RD15 reduces BSFC, specific CO2, and NOx by 2.15 %, ∼1%, and 8.37 %, respectively, while increasing PM emissions at 100 % load."
pub.1131540611,Jatropha: A Potential Bioresource for Biofuel Production,"There has been an increased urgency in the demands of energy worldwide because of (a) the exhaustion of fossil fuels, (b) extended growth of global population, and (c) the economy from industrialization. Considering various countries, India has outperformed Japan and Russia and evolved as the third best consumer of oil, universally. Apart from the high demands of oil fuels, environmental problems like global warming, pollution, etc. have great consequences, and thus, there is a dire need for the development of an alternate form of energy in the R&D domain. An alternate form like production of energy from biomass is considered as a sustainable form of energy and has also gained positive responses from various sectors such as public sector, industrial sector, and policies of the government. Another alternate form of energy which is the talk of the talk from the recent past is jatropha. Jatropha is considered as a novel and a promising plant which results in the amplification of a renewable source of energy. Because of numerous advantages, it is one of the exclusive nominees with appreciable and ethereal merits toward ecology and the environment. The majority of the plantations are done on reduced wastelands globally. There is dearth awareness about jatropha in order to understand the contribution to the societies and toward the environment. Currently, jatropha has grabbed much of the attention of researchers due to its enormous performance in the production of biodiesel, an environment-friendly fuel, which is biodegradable and renewable in nature with no toxicity in the environment compared to petroleum oil, diesel, etc. There is an utmost requirement for some blueprint or plan to sort the issues of the crisis associated with the energy and to make use of jatropha as a substitute for the fossil fuels and other sources of energy. This chapter deals with the use, strengths and weaknesses, and toxicity of jatropha and its associated issues. Also, the dire need for alternative fuels has also been discussed following capital investment, cost of production, processing technologies, and some examples."
pub.1132743675,Low carbon hydrogen production from a waste-based biorefinery system and environmental sustainability assessment,"<p>Low carbon biofuels and biochemicals production from renewable feedstock (waste) in a biorefinery approach.</p>
<p> Production of low carbon biofuels and biochemicals from renewable feedstocks using a biological process is considered a sustainable alternative to the fossil-fuel-based linear economy. This study demonstrated the pilot-scale (10 m <sup>3</sup> ) production of biohydrogen (bio-H <sub>2</sub> ) and volatile fatty acids/carboxylic acids (VFA) through acidogenic fermentation (AF) using food waste (FW) as renewable feedstock. Bio-H <sub>2</sub> production of 54 288 L (155.10 LH <sub>2</sub> per kg COD) along with 25.77 g L <sup>−1</sup> of VFA composed of acetic (H <sub>Ac</sub> : 15.2 ± 1.98 g L <sup>−1</sup> ), propionic (H <sub>Pr</sub> : 4.89 ± 1.26 g L <sup>−1</sup> ) and butyric (H <sub>Bu</sub> 5.67 ± 0.96 g L <sup>−1</sup> ) acids was achieved within 48 h of the fermentation period. The further acidogenic process was integrated with a biorefinery platform (methanogenesis + photosynthesis) in a circular loop strategy which helped derive multiple biobased products (CH <sub>4</sub> , algal biomass, O <sub>2</sub> and treated water for reuse) from fatty acid-rich acidogenic effluent and untreated COD of AF. The whole bio-manufacturing unit (acidogenesis + methanogenesis + photosynthesis) converted the renewable feedstock (waste/wastewater) into fuels and platform chemicals, in analogy to a conventional oil refinery with a maximized resource recovery. The life cycle assessment (LCA) tool was employed to study the environmental impact of both the bio-H <sub>2</sub> (standalone, ST) and waste biorefinery (WB) processes, and the results depicted that the WB approach offered a relatively low impact (approx. 3.5 fold less than ST). The approach helped determine the flow of carbon and its conversion to products; this aided the reduction of carbon emissions as well as minimized the burden on natural resources with the biosynthesis of green H <sub>2</sub> and other value-added products, addressing carbon neutrality with bioeconomy. </p>"
pub.1131317369,Biodiesel production from alternative raw materials using a heterogeneous Low Ordered Biosilicified Enzyme as biocatalyst,"<p><strong>Background:</strong> Cumulative reported evidence has indicated that renewable feedstocks are a promising alternative source to fossil platforms for the production of fuels and chemicals. In that regard, the development of new, highly active, selective, and easy to recover and reuse catalysts for biomass conversions is urgently needed. The combination of enzymatic and inorganic heterogeneous catalysis generates an unprecedented platform that combines the advantages of both, the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of enzymes with the ordered structure, high porosity, mechanical, thermal and chemical resistance of mesoporous materials to obtain enzymatic heterogeneous catalysts. Enzymatic mineralization with an organic silicon precursor (biosilicification) is a promising and emerging approach for the generation of solid hybrid biocatalysts with exceptional stability under severe use conditions.

Thus, LOBE4 emerges as a promising tool to produce second-generation biofuels, with significant implications for establishing a circular economy and reducing the carbon footprint.</p>"
pub.1146185305,Biomass from trees for bioenergy and biofuels – A briefing paper,"Tree biomass may be utilised to produce heat, electricity, and biofuels. Despite the fact that the technology for turning woody biomass into energy has existed in many cases for decades, bioenergy generation from woody biomass has not been extensively embraced since the cost of woody biomass energy is not viable with old fossil fuels. However, current predictions of future energy usage, as well as proposed renewable energy and climate change laws, imply that forest and farm biomass energy will be used more in the next decades. Biomass, which accounts for roughly 11% of the world's major energy supply, is mostly made up of organic matter, with a lesser proportion of inorganic compounds comprising a range of intricately linked phases or minerals of various origins. Over 55 percent of the 4 billion m3 of wood utilised yearly in developing countries is immediately utilised as a source of forest products or carbon to satisfy the daily energy requirements to be used for warming and culinary. The proximal and ultimate analyses are commonly used to characterise a fuel's composition. Concerns about the environmental effect of fossil-fuel-based energy generation are rising. In this context, replacing fossil fuel-based energy with bio-energy might be a viable option. The attraction to forest biomass as an energy source stems from some of its characteristics, such as its global availability and homogeneity, as well as its CO2 emissions neutrality. However, there are concerns associated with its usage, the most of which are connected to the long-term viability of forest systems and their products. Due to huge uncertainty regarding future agricultural productivity improvements and land availability for biomass plants, bioenergy's potential for climate change mitigation remains unknown. Bioenergy potentials, global food costs, and water shortages are all expected to be affected by large-scale growth of dedicated biomass. As a result, coordinated energy, land use, and water management strategies are required. Because biomass contains all of the components found in fossil fuels, albeit in various proportions, current and emerging technologies can help us move toward a future based on renewable, sustainable, and low-carbon economies."
pub.1135066240,Transnational sustainability certification for the bioeconomy? Patterns and discourse coalitions of resistance and alternatives in biomass exporting regions,"The bioeconomy is nowadays widely proclaimed by governments and corporations around the world as a new paradigm for a sustainable economy. Essentially, it broadly denotes the promotion, development and establishment of the use of biogenic resources in diverse kinds of industrial technologies, production processes and products. Yet, in order for the bioeconomy to be sustainable, it has to be assured that these biogenic resources are sourced sustainably. In the last 30 years, transnational sustainability certification (TSC) has established itself as a popular instrument in this context, for example in the case of European biofuels sustainability regulation. In the last decade or so, however, TSC initiatives in several biomass production sectors like palm oil, soy, fruits, aquaculture or fisheries—mostly initiated by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and corporations from the Global North—are increasingly met with resistance from actors from the resource-producing countries, mostly located in the Global South. Issues brought up in this context concern their lack of legitimacy and respect for national regulatory sovereignty and conflicting priorities in terms of sustainable development. Consequently, governmental and corporate actors from the resource-producing countries have developed sustainability standards that now at least partly compete with TSC. Against this background, this contribution investigates this apparent dilemma of biomass certification by taking stock of existing TSC initiatives and territorial responses to them in several sectors of the bioeconomy in order to discover general patterns and dynamics of transnational biomass sustainability certification. This analysis is based on a review of existing empirical studies on these issues as well as on conceptual literature on discourse coalitions and transnational hybrid governance for the classification of the different aspects and developments in the individual sectors. Results show that TSC is indeed challenged in all sectors around story lines of sovereignty and sustainability, employed by closely associated state and industry actors in the specific context of the prevalent state-industry relations and the practices and institutions of the respective international political economies. Beyond this general pattern, these alternative systems take on different shapes and complex relations between transnational and territorial sustainability governance emerge that are not always antagonistic, but also exist in parallel or even complementarily and involve various hybrid configurations of public and private actors. Overall, this casts some doubt on the potential of TSC as an instrument to safeguard the sustainability of the bioeconomy and shows one of its potential pitfalls, which is reflected upon in the conclusion."
pub.1122899716,Approach for CO2 Reduction in India’s Automotive Sector,"India has gone through a lot of transformation over the last decade. Today it is the 6th largest and one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Rising income level, increased consumerism, rapid growth in urbanization and digitization have attributed to this change. Government focus on “Make in India” for promoting trade and investment in India have ensured that India emerge as one of the largest growing economies in the world. The automotive industry played a pivotal role in the manufacturing sector to boost economic activities in India. The passenger car market has increased 3 times over the last decade and it has led to increased mobility options for many people across India. However, this has put concerns on the country’s energy security and emission levels. According to IEA’s recent report on global CO2 emission, 32.31 Gt of CO2 emissions were from fuel combustion in 2016, out of which transport sector contributed ~25%. India contributed ~11% of transport emissions in Asia in 2016. This necessitates systematic approach and action plans to curb India’s vehicular CO2 emissions. In line with this, Government of India has already implemented different regulations, policies (e.g. CAFÉ, BSVI) and has also notified future action plans (e.g. RDE, electrification, etc.). Globally, CAFÉ norms have been adopted by many countries (e.g. USA, EU, South Korea, etc.) to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing CO2 emissions and petroleum consumption. Its implementation has accelerated since 2010 and globally governments are imposing stricter targets. India on the other hand has its own unique challenges like large population (1.3 Bn.), high cost sensitivity, unorganized urbanization and average lower income. India need its own unique sustainable and affordable mobility approach (CNG, HEVs, EVs, Biofuels, etc.) and at the same time strike a balance between automotive industry growth, environmental impacts and employment opportunities to address these concerns. This paper aims to provide systematic approach for CO2 emission reduction in the automotive sector."
pub.1156294865,Concomitant strategy of wastewater treatment and biodiesel production using innate yeast cell (Rhodotorula mucilaginosa) from food industry sewerage and its energy system analysis,"In many recent studies, the wastewater with high organic matter and high utilization value compounds was treated using yeast. It decreases the effluent contaminants and makes it applicable for reuse in many food industries. This present study focuses on the combined approach of treatment and biorefinery to increase the circular economy in food industries. The two primary goals of the work were to screen the potential oleaginous yeast from the food industry effluent (FIE) collected from the food flavourant producing industry and used for FIE remediation through bioaugmentation and to extract microbial oil of yeast biomass harvested after remediation. Further, the extracted microbial oil was trans-esterified to produce biodiesel. The process of transesterification was optimized for its influencing parameters. After 10 days of treatment of FIE with the yeast cell, the treatment efficiency was analyzed and found to be precise with the typical discharge value. The overall lipid content of the oleaginous yeast (Rhodotorula mucilaginosa SML) used for the FIE treatment was 67.95 w/w% of dry cell biomass. The extracted microbial oil was used for transesterification; the process was optimized through the one-variable analysis approach and response surface methodology optimization using a central composite design. The transesterification process showed maximum conversion (98%) at oil to methanol ratio - 5.0, catalyst concentration - 2.8% and time - 1.15 h. The fatty acid composition and the physicochemical characteristics were compatible with petroleum diesel, making it applicable for alternative biofuel production. Thus, this concomitant strategy has proved efficient for reducing contaminants in FIE and suggested a new sustainable source for biodiesel production. The exergy, energy and mass balance analysis of the biodiesel conversion process proved that this process is the most economically viable one to increase the circular economy of food industries."
pub.1139906933,CONCEPTUAL PRINCIPLES OF BIOECONOMY AND ITS RELATIONS WITH RATIONAL NATURAL RESOURCES USE IN UKRAINE,"Scarcity of the natural resources, exciting global environmental problems, climate change, soil and ecosystem degradation accompanying with the population growth force to searching new consumption and production patterns. Appropriate modernization of the industries would impact into strengthening of the country's position in the world economy and conserve the natural resources. Achievement of these goals is possible with bioeconomy, which accompanied by digital technologies becomes the mechanism promoting the sustainable development. Bioeconomy is the new approach ensuring the rational use of natural resources and their conservation due to more efficient use of biological raw materials.
Goal of the article is substantiation of conceptual principles of the development of bioeconomy on Ukraine and discovery of its relations with the rational natural resources use. 
Main areas of bioeconomy’s impact to the environment, economy and social sphere include improvement of the land use, conservation of the biodiversity and ecosystems, protection of the environment, expansion of the biotechnology markets, and making human lives better. The mentioned outcomes of the bioeconomy show its role in the rational use of natural resources, further commercialization of biotechnology and the following effects in social and economic spheres.
Today, Ukraine's share in the biotechnology market is negligible, and segments of biodegradable materials, bioplastics, and biofuels are completely absent. Among the possible factors for the development of the bioeconomy are the significant potential for agricultural biomass formation and organic production. The legislation gaps and shortcomings, lack of the national strategy for the development of bioeconomy, low economic capacity, scarcity of scientific researches on biotechnologies, and depletion of the human capital are the obstacles in this regard for Ukraine. Development of the new directions of bioeconomy will contribute to comprehensive solution of the problem of irrational use of natural resources and poor life of people by stimulus for the development of biotechnologies, making the market of innovations, protecting the environment and preserving the biodiversity."
pub.1026165438,"Potential of indigenous fruit-bearing trees to curb malnutrition, improve household food security, income and community health in Sub-Saharan Africa: A review","Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has an estimated annual population growth rate of 2.7% making it the highest globally. More than two thirds of the over 800 million people in the region stay in rural areas where they depend on subsistence agriculture. Socio-economic instability, poor soil fertility and unreliable rainfall result in poor crop yields. This exposes the vulnerable to food insecurity and inadequate nutrient intake. Malnutrition is not restricted to undernutrition as in the urban areas the adoption of diets rich in carbohydrates and fats also poses health problems associated with obesity. Malnutrition causes derangements in the immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to and severity of infections among the affected population. In SSA, indigenous fruit bearing trees (IFBTs) are treasured sources of macro- and micro-nutrients, and health promoting phytochemicals. The phytochemicals have biological and pharmacological activities that mitigate some of the physiological effects of malnutrition. In this paper, the contribution of IFBTs such as Uapaca kirkiana and Adansonia digitata to household food security, rural economy and community health are highlighted. Examples of community-based projects dependent on fruit from IFBTs are given. Using this evidence the need for unlocking the seemingly hidden potential contribution of the genetically diverse IFBTs to food security is highlighted. In this regard, research should focus on how to tap into health benefits of oils from IFBTs seeds. Residual cakes from oil extraction could be developed into biofuels, bio-fertilisers and animal feed ingredients. Fruit pulp could be exploited to produce more health-promoting natural sweeteners and pectins for industrial use. This beneficiation and value addition of products from IFBTs over and above contributing to the enhancement of household food security and the rural economy would translate into increased community-based sustainable utilisation and conservation of IFBTs."
pub.1130118972,Biocrude production from sugarcane bagasse and ethanol over green catalysts based on shellfish waste,"The development of sustainable fuels has been a great challenge during the last decades. In this regard, this research discusses the liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse, a waste from bio-ethanol and/or sugar manufacture, using water, hydrous ethanol and anhydrous ethanol over shellfish waste catalysts (mussel and crab) constituted mainly by CaCO3. In the absence of catalysts, the bagasse dissolved better in hydrous ethanol (82%) than to dry ethanol (72%) and water (73%). The total yield of biocrude for the process with water was low (18%) because it was necessary to perform a liquid-liquid extraction with an organic solvent to recover it. The yield of the biocrude increased to approximately 60% when ethanol was used instead of water. Reactions with the waste catalysts presented a reduction of biochar content and yielded products with different compositions, mainly due to esterification/hydrolysis reactions between the ethanol, water, and the acids from the biocrude. The biochars and biocrudes presented high-energy content, with a higher heating value between 19.8 and 26.9 MJ.kg−1. The catalysts based on crab residues showed to be a little more effective for liquefaction compared to the catalyst from mussel wastes, due to the presence of more alkaline phases than CaCO3. The biocrude obtained with hydrous ethanol and crab catalyst presented esters (39%), alcohols (6%), and phenols/aromatics (35%). For the reactions with mussel catalyst, the biocrude composition changed to esters (56%), alcohol (5%), and phenols/aromatics (38%). Both biocrudes have the potential to be used as sustainable biofuels for a sugarcane plantation, processing, and other activities. Due to the alkaline compounds present in the solid product, which is a biochar-CaCO3 composite, it could also be used in the soil to neutralize its acidity and reducing cane plantation costs, in a circular economy."
pub.1181782815,Cassava Waste Pulp Valorization for Biohydrogen Production: A Sustainable Approach to Advancing Circular Economy,"In response to the escalating issue of atmospheric emissions from fossil fuels, harnessing biofuel-based renewable energy is considered a highly promising energy option. Biohydrogen, being carbon-free and non-polluting, has gained significant attention. This study investigated the potential of cassava waste pulp (CWP) as a substrate for biohydrogen production through photofermentation, using Rhodopseudomonas palustris as the inoculum. An acid-hydrolyzed substrate with a sugar concentration of 10.2°Brix was produced via 1% hydrochloric acid hydrolysis pretreatment and used in the experiment. The optimum values for the operating variables of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and inoculation volume ratio (IVR) were assessed under controlled conditions, with a constant pH of 8.0, light intensity of 720 lx (120 W), and an ambient room temperature of 25 ± 3 °C. The results showed that the highest biogas yield was achieved with a 60 h HRT and a 30% IVR. The central composite design of the response surface methodology revealed that the model was highly significant, with a p-value of < 0.0001. The result is further supported by its regression coefficient of 0.9605, which indicates a high consistency between the actual and predicted values. Gas chromatography analysis revealed a high biohydrogen gas composition (92.98%), along with a small presence of carbon dioxide (6.01%) and nitrogen (1%). This proves that photofermentation with R. palustris inoculum effectively produces biohydrogen with no traces of carbon monoxide and methane in the gas composition. Approximately 10.2 ± 0.12 L of pure biohydrogen can be optimally produced from one kilogram of CWP at an HRT of 61.86 h and an IVR of 35.25%. These findings highlight the viability of cassava waste pulp as a valuable feedstock for sustainable biohydrogen production, offering a promising solution for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and advancing renewable energy technologies."
pub.1154942746,Aqueous extraction processing: An innovative and sustainable approach for recovery of unconventional oils,"Background Unconventional crops (e.g., tiger nut, macaw, babassu, sesame, and others) are promising edible oil sources. However, the traditional oil extraction methods, mechanical pressing, and solvent extraction show low efficiency or use environmentally unfriendly solvents (hexane). Aqueous extraction processing (AEP) has recently emerged as a significant opportunity for achieving the sustainable development goal (SDG) to produce edible oils. This technology usually requires a pre-treatment step, e. g., milling, followed by a demulsification step, which traditionally involves enzyme addition for free oil recovery. Optimizing the demulsification methods can lead to high oil yields (>95%), which is comparable to the use of hexane. Scope and approach This review discusses the scientific data and trends related to demulsification steps on AEP for oil recovery, focusing on unconventional oil crops. New physical demulsification possibilities, such as filter coalescers and membrane technology, are outlined as alternatives to traditional demulsification methods, which present some drawbacks regarding process scalability and oil quality. Additionally, a complete route, with a biorefinery approach, is suggested for the industrial application of oil and high-added-value compounds from the by-products of AEP (liquid and solid fractions) as an opportunity to update the traditional oil production sector. Key findings and conclusions With the increased demand for conventional oils for biofuel purposes, exploring unconventional crops is a viable and suitable alternative to obtain food-grade oil. Integrating AEP with physical demulsification methods is an eco-friendly and promising strategy for producing high-quality oil from unconventional and minor crop sources since water is used as the solvent instead of hexane. Moreover, applying biorefinery concepts is an opportunity to stimulate the circular economy and produce valuable compounds (proteins, carbohydrates, fibers, and others) with beneficial health properties and wide application in food industries."
pub.1090994068,New composite sustainability indices for Cradle-to-Cradle process design: Case study on thinner recovery from waste paint in auto industries,"In a conventional chemical process design, the main focus is on the process economy resulting in the generation of huge amounts of waste materials within the process. Such design approach demands end-of-pipe treatment, which is neither profitable due to the hefty costs of the installation and operation of large scale waste treatment facilities, nor environmentally conscious due to the potential impacts of the generated wastes within the process on the environment. The recent approach to sustainable process design has surmounted this challenge. This paper presents a new application of an already introduced composite sustainability index (CSI) that requires minimum amount of data to monitor the sustainability performance of a chemical process and troubleshoot, if necessary. Then, the CSI is applied to an existing process for the purpose of Cradle-to-Cradle design by significant reduction of the environmental impacts of the process, and the escalation of the plant profitability due to sustainable retrofitting of the plant. The CSI methodology can be applied to chemical, refinery, petrochemical, oil & energy, fuel and biofuel processes. The three main advocates have been considered in the CSI, which are the impacts of “energy” and “material” on the environment as well as “risk assessment”. The CSI is technically imperative at all engineering stages of above process plants with the aim of source reduction and environmental protection. The CSI gives process and safety engineers a competitive edge, making their designed process stand out amongst other design array. The current study proves that the CSI methodology is a powerful tool for process and safety designers, and that the process sustainability and profitability are strongly linked. So, it is specifically decisive at managerial level pursuant to strategic planning towards company's sustainability."

SJFs also have the potential to provide fuel supply diversification and security, enhance fuel price stability and provide regional/rural economic development benefits. This paper measures and ranks perceived drivers and barriers to an economically viable SJF industry in a unique U.S. region, the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW), through personal interviews with key aviation fuel supply chain stakeholders conducted from June to September 2015. In addition to providing a fertile arena for this first effort to systematically assess these drivers and barriers, the U.S. PNW is unique due to the region's long strategic focus on aviation innovation and its importance to the regional economy, the seminal efforts in the region to outline a path forward on SJF beginning in 2010, and the relatively small population spread over a large geographic area with a limited number of “hub” airport nodes which geographically concentrates aviation fuel demand and distribution. Nineteen stakeholder interviewees acknowledge that, in order for regional SJF adoption-diffusion to occur, airline jet fuel buyers must drive the process, particularly as they deal with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission issues and related policy considerations. Important perceived barriers to SJF industry scale-up in the U.S. PNW include the high production costs of SJF and related issues, such as fuel logistics and quality control in the transport, storage, and blending of SJFs. Perceptions around chain-of-custody issues, such as blending, tracking, and crediting of SJFs and future SJF market share projections for the year 2030 were also examined. Incorporating stakeholder input into discussions about adding blended SJF into the U.S. aviation fuel supply provides needed insight for the biofuels industry, policymakers, and researchers."
pub.1156638129,Do natural resources impact economic growth: An investigation of P5 + 1 countries under sustainable management,"Natural resources represent the base of our living and the entire economic activity. Their depletion is a major challenge for the economic development of both developed and developing economies. Their efficient use is an indispensable requirement and must be the aim of the public policies designed by the authorities worldwide. In this research, we have investigated the impact of the natural resources rent on the economic growth in some major wealthy economies of the world (P5 + 1 countries namely: US, UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany). We have applied a quantile-on-quantile regression to analyse this impact on different quantiles and a cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) approach for the panel of these six countries. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test was also used to check the causality between natural resource rents and economic growth in these countries. Results show a negative relationship between natural resources rent and economic growth for the panel but a different impact on quantiles in each country. Only for China and the US, a positive effect can be noticed for both lower and higher quantiles of natural resources and economic growth. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test shows that natural resources can predict economic growth only in China, the U.S., and the panel. In contrast, no causality was found for the other four countries included in the panel. We suggest that nations invest in wind and solar projects, use biofuels and nuclear energy, introduce a temporary profit tax to protect consumers from escalating energy prices, and increase energy efficiency in buildings and industry. Businesses would benefit from a regulatory framework that is uniform and exhaustive, as well as easier to traverse and more receptive to innovation and creativity. Public-private partnership investments in innovation, innovation incentives, and environmental sector opportunities may foster long-term economic growth."

Renewable energy (RE) sources play an important role in the pursuit of these goals, which has been taken into account in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The aim of this article is to describe patterns and trends in the achievements of the energy policy of European Union (EU) countries in the field of renewable energy in sustainable development. The identification of leaders in this field gives the possibility to analyse actions taken by the governments of these countries and the possible implementation of the introduced solutions on the ground of individual Member States at the regional and national levels. At the beginning Main goal of energy policy on the field of renewable energy sources (RES) is to increase production from environmentally friendly sources that is why trends were determined in order to assess the rate of achievement of the national target for changes the share of energy from renewable sources in total gross energy consumption. Groups of similar countries were then identified on the basis of three indicators corresponding to the targets set in the climate and energy package. In the group of analysed countries, 14 have achieved the 2020 targets and 4 have exceeded the 2030 targets. The main renewable energy sources (RES) are biofuels, wind, and hydropower. In the assessment of the achievement of energy policy targets, the best situation was observed in the case of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. These countries have significantly increased the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption. Compared to other EU countries, they have reduced the economy’s energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions the most."

This is a response to global challenges including sustainable management of natural resources, sustainable production, public health improvement, mitigation of adverse effects of climate change, and integrated social and economic development. This article aimed to describe how bioeconomy develops and how significant it is to the European Union and evaluate the potential of bioeconomy in Poland in comparison to other EU member states. The potential of bioeconomy was analysed according to the level and structure of employment, gross value added generated by this sector of the economy, as well as according to labour productivity. The analysis was based on an official classification of economic activity in Europe (NACE). The timeline of the study was 2008 and 2017, which allowed evaluating changes that occurred over a decade. The analysis involved data deriving from the European Commission’s statistical database. The studies imply that in 2017 Poland ranked first in the EU in terms of the number of bioeconomy workers, whereas differences in the structure of employment could be observed between Poland and the whole EU. They mostly referred to a higher share of employment in Polish agriculture, with a lower percentage of employment in the food, beverage and tobacco sector. In addition, Poland had a 5% share in generating the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the EU bioeconomy, which put it fifth among all the member states. The GVA of bioeconomy in Poland had a structure similar to that presented by the whole EU with Food, beverage and tobacco and Agriculture being the most significant sectors and Bio-based electricity and Liquid biofuels being relatively insignificant. In addition, in all the sectors labour productivity was lower than on average in the EU."
pub.1105295835,Multi-scale system modelling under circular bioeconomy," Waste sector is expected to play significant roles in the evolving circular bioeconomy in the coming decades. Considerable amount of carbon-containing and nutrient-rich wastewater and organic sold waste resources are generated every year globally. In the UK, wastewater is estimated as 16 billion litre per day, which together with annual production of over 100 million tonnes of carbon-containing solid biowaste (e.g. biodegradable fraction municipal solid waste (BFMSW)), above 14 million tonnes of forestry and agricultural residues and large amount of other waste provide significant opportunities (BIS 2015). They could be converted via various routes to bioenergy or other value-added products such as bioenergy, biofuels, bio-plastics and fertilisers, which shift us to a resource-circular bioeconomy. In this study, a multi-scale system modelling approach is presented to investigate the holistic economic and environmental profiles of alternative resource recovery methods integrated into wastewater and organic waste treatment systems, and bring such sustainability criteria into the process synthesis and value chain optimisation. By introducing game theory into the multi-objective optimisation model and formulating the interactions between multi-level nodes involved in the supply chain, our modelling toolkit offers the functionality to account for both macro-level economy performances and micro-level individual stakeholder benefits. The modelling methodology has been applied to two case studies - wastewater and lignocellulosic waste resource recovery. Our results suggest that ion exchange is a promising technology showing high nitrogen and phosphorus removal and recovery efficiency from municipal wastewater and delivering competitive sustainability scores; whereas the integrated thermochemical and biochemical routes are favourable options for lignocellulosic resources. Current study also demonstrates such multi-scale modelling toolkit can support decision-making on optimal or equilibrium solutions for the waste bioconversion process design and waste recovery supply chain strategy at temporal-spatial scales, which are the key elements in building a sustainable circular economy."
pub.1128715892,Introduction,"The problem of energy and environment is a great challenge for mankind in the twenty-first century; with the increase of energy crisis and environmental pollution, the exploitation and utilization of new energy and renewable resources has become a global hot point. Plant energy has many advantages, such as environmental protection and safety, rich reserves, convenient, and transportation, and its development and utilization prospect is second only to coal, oil and natural gas. The evaluation of industrial oil plant germplasm resources is to describe and compare the characteristics of various oil plant germplasm samples under suitable environments, and to comprehensively evaluate the status of various oil plant germplasm resources in industrial oil plant and their potential for development and utilization. The ideal evaluation of germplasm resources includes not only genes that determine phenotypic traits, but also the interaction between genetic traits and the environment. Nowadays, we are in an energy-driven society, and relying solely on petrochemical resources no longer supports the sustainable development of the social economy. The industrial application of oilseed plants has ushered in historic development opportunities and it will provide new avenues for solving energy and environmental problems. The main use of oil plants is the consumption of their oil resources and industrial products. It is an important subject to strengthen the research on the development and utilization of energy plants to implement the energy strategy of sustainable development in China. Industrial oil plant resources are used as an important raw material resource of energy, chemical and material. Large-scale utilization of industrial oil plant resources is of great significance for saving cultivated land, improving ecological environment, increasing farmers’ income and cultivating new economic growth points."
pub.1100743516,Combining low-carbon economic development and oil exploration in Brazil? An energy–economy assessment,"Brazil's nationally determined contribution (NDC) pledged under the Paris Agreement has marked a new stage in its climate policy towards strengthening low-carbon economic development beyond the recent drastic cuts in emissions from deforestation. Brazil especially means to limit oil consumption driven by future economic growth and to increase energy efficiency and biofuel use in the transport sector. On the other hand, Brazil still aspires to become a major petroleum province given its huge reserves of ‘pre-salt’ oil. This article aims to clarify under what conditions low-carbon economic development and oil exploration can possibly be combined in Brazil and what would be the energy system, environmental and macroeconomic implications of enabling policies for doing so. To address these questions, an energy–economy computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Brazilian economy is used to simulate alternative scenarios up to 2030. The results first show that implementing the most recent energy plans, which take into account the new economic reality in Brazil, should lead to over 20% lower domestic CO2 emissions in 2030 than the indicative NDC target, and to the export of the bulk of newfound crude oil. Second, with the same level of oil production, deeper domestic decarbonization, triggered by additional carbon pricing and sustainable efficiency measures, appears achievable with very small gross domestic product (GDP) loss and maximum oil exports, while being aligned with a 2°C emission pathway. However, (i) extra oil exports may induce net additional emissions outside Brazil and be seen as a perverse incentive and (ii) the economic growth strategy based on high oil exports may hinder the necessary diversification of the Brazilian economy. Key policy insights Low-carbon development goals will strongly interact with oil policy in Brazil.The 2030 NDC target should be easy to achieve considering the new economic reality in Brazil.Deeper domestic decarbonization is achievable with very limited GDP loss and significant oil exports, while being aligned with a 2°C emission pathway.A broad strategic vision is needed to reconcile climate policy, energy policy and other economic development objectives.

pub.1168533258,Power module for integration of renewable hydrogen storage with bioethanol production from non-food biowastes,"Sustainable biofuels that do not compromise food security will play an integral role in the world’s transition to renewable and circular economies. Integration of their production with surplus renewable electricity offers significant potential to improve overall system efficiencies. One such pathway is integration of bioethanol production with surplus renewable power via a power module modelled in this study. This module comprises of an electrolyzer, a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), a Magnesium Hydride (MgH2) Tank and two reactor columns. This module is then connected to the Carbon Negative Biorefinery, which produces bio-acetate from non-food biowastes. Simulations are carried out wherein the module converts surplus/off-peak renewable grid power to hydrogen, storing 25% in the MgH2 Tank. The MgH2 Tank releases waste heat during the storage process which is used with 75% of the electrolytic hydrogen to hydrogenate Carbon Negative Biorefinery’s bio-acetate into bioethanol. Simulation results show that 15 kg of hydrogen is able to produce 120 kg of ethanol. This equates to a 77% increase in the lower heating value when compared with 15 kg of hydrogen. Simulation results also reveal that waste heat from the SOFC is enough to preheat oxygen and hydrogen, and desorb hydrogen from the MgH2 Tank during fuel cell’s electricity generation. These results are encouraging, warranting further investigation into the co-production of hydrogen and ethanol as electrochemical and biochemical energy vectors."
pub.1045769900,The Role and Applications of Xyloglucan Hydrolase in Biomass Degradation/Bioconversion,"Lignocellulosic biomass is currently the most promising alternative energy source for realizing sustainable demands of agrarian economies. Its natural recalcitrance to degradation necessitates a detailed study on the complex biochemistry involved in bioconversion of this lignin–carbohydrate complex. A comprehension of the enzymology and role of principal and accessory glycosyl hydrolases involved in biomass degradation are, hence, noteworthy in this context and the xyloglucan-active hydrolases warrant special mention. These are enzymes which carry out hydrolysis and transglucosylation of xyloglucan, the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide in plant biomass. The structurally complex xyloglucans cover and cross-link the cellulosic microfibrils in plant cell walls and make cellulose inaccessible to saccharification by cellulases. Solubilisation of biomass polysaccharides and release of sugars are central to the biomass-to-bioethanol process. Complete conversion of biomass carbohydrates requires a suite of hydrolytic enzymes, which may be designed specifically to accommodate the predominant and subsidiary biomass-cleaving enzymes. Xyloglucan hydrolases which are known to act synergistically with cellulases and xylanases in loosening the plant cell wall are vital enzymes to be deployed for successful bioconversion processes. This chapter is an insight into the capacity of these accessory, but indispensable, hydrolytic enzymes in unlocking the inaccessible biomass polysaccharides for increased sugar recovery and thereby, in drafting the fuels of future."

However, limiting energy access may slow the rate of industrialisation. Bioenergy integration into Nigeria's energy mix can accelerate the industrialisation agenda due to the co-benefits it offers. We used a disaggregated approach to map agri-residue availability and identify knowledge gaps in agri-residue application to support modern and sustainable bioenergy integration into Nigeria's energy mix. Expert interviews with stakeholders from government departments, small- and large-scale industries, and feedstock producers were used to validate the biomass mapping. The output of the biomass mapping shows that residues from yam, sorghum, wheat, palm, cassava, rice, sugarcane, etc, have knowledge gaps in agri-residue application and they could support the industrialisation agenda of Nigeria. The output of the stakeholder engagement shows that fossil fuels are the main energy source for productive uses in Nigeria. Current waste management practices involve onsite burning and disposal on land. Bioenergy technologies currently deployed in Nigeria are predominantly anaerobic digestion and combustion. Stakeholders have a strong preference for electricity to be the predominant energy vector. However, awareness of modern bioenergy applications and technologies was limited even though Nigeria's Energy Masterplan supports the efficient use of biomass to generate clean heat, electricity and biofuel for industrial, transport and household applications. Based on these findings, we have developed a suite of novel bioenergy case studies to support biomass integration into Nigeria's energy system."

Major contributors to this sector include Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia. In fact, the agricultural sector has contributed to 10–30 % of gross domestic product in most Southeast Asia countries. However, the high demand for agricultural products has led to the generation of excessive biomass, which accounted for approximately 100–200 millions metric tonnes annually, much of which remains unused. In response, there has been a growing trend towards biomass biorefinery, producing value-added products such as bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. Several key challenges in utilizing biomass as a feedstock are the high cost of enzymes required for conversion processes, as well as pretreatment required in the agricultural biomass utilization, which hinders commercialization efforts. To address this challenge, leveraging microorganisms for enzyme production using biomass itself has emerged as a promising solution. This review aims to provide the comprehensive potential utilization of major agricultural biomass in Southeast Asia in bioconversion of valuable product, in such enzyme. This work intends to enlighten the potential and feasibilities factors driving the transition from traditional agricultural practices to modern enzymatic production. It delves into fermentation factors and condition, emphasizing the need for sustainable and efficient enzymatic conversion processes to fully exploit the potential of agricultural biomass for industrial applications."

pub.1168048391,Chapter 6 Treatment of agro-industrial wastes using microalgae,"Every year, large amounts of agro-industrial waste are produced all over the world and its sustainable management is still a technological challenge. The agro-industrial wastes are an abundant source of nutrients derived from various sources such as livestock and animal husbandry wastes, processing of plant and animal foods, the production of animal-derived products, beverages, edible oils, restaurants, and municipal markets. The management of these wastes involves the reduction of their level of nutrients and microbial pathogens to prevent eutrophication phenomena and the dispersion of contaminants into the environment. The use of microalgae in the treatment of agro-industrial wastes enables the recovery of nutrients, leads to the production of biomass, and allows the capture of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The produced microalgal biomass can be used in biorefinery configurations that may include animal feed, agronomic applications, extraction of pigments and antioxidants, or production of biofuels, such as biogas, hydrogen, bioethanol, or biodiesel. As for other tertiary remediation processes, the treatment with microalgae requires specific conditions of suspended solids, total solids, and chemical oxygen demand. Therefore many agro-industrial effluents require dilution or pretreatment processes before treatment with microalgae to improve the bioremediation efficiency and prevent inhibition factors. The association of bioremediation with microalgae and complementary processes such as treatment with aerobic or anaerobic bacteria has been proposed as a synergetic approach to increase remediation efficiency and promote a circular economy."
pub.1134828824,Enzymes in Fuel Biotechnology,"Rapid depletion and drawbacks of conventional energy sources worldwide presents a dire situation demanding a potential replacement to surmount the current energy crisis. Lignocellulose which presents a logical candidate for biofuel production has however a high processing cost for alternate bio-based fuels worldwide. For economically feasible bioethanol production, three major aspects which are: feedstock pretreatment technology, enzymatic hydrolysis followed by the configuration of fermentation is to be considered. The pretreatment is a crucial step during lignocellulosic biomass processing, since it not only has a great impact on final yields, but also makes an important contribution to overall costs. Microbial lignocellulolytic enzyme systems are of importance both to the scientific as well as commercial world due to incipient applications in bio-based fuels and other valuable commodity chemicals. Lignocellulolytic enzyme complexes play crucial role in hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and wide range of lignocellulolytic enzymes are thereby of utmost importance in the transition of the society into a more sustainable and bio-based economy. Further, the fermentation processes of lignocellulosic hydrolysate such as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) have to be selected carefully for valuable solutions to the increasing liquid fuel demand. These strategies in future are anticipated to play a major role for replacing oil-based refineries with lignocellulosic-based biorefineries in future."

To decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reliance on nonrenewable energy sources, alternatives are required. Integrated biorefineries, which effectively utilize all components of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) for extraction of chemicals, fuels, and energy, constitute a foundation in the establishment of a circular economy. The increasing focus on biological treatment in biorefinery advancements reflects a conscientious approach toward environmental considerations, diverging from conventional physicochemical methods. This approach aims to enhance the recovery of bio-based products from waste, as well as improve saccharification and fermentation yields. LCB has become particularly appealing for the production of second-generation bioethanol (BE), offering both environmental and economic benefits. Enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) process is considered sustainable and enables increased sugar production, facilitating the generation of ethanol as a more readily available industrial product. Fungal enzymes are essential to these bioconversions because they can decompose LCB’s complex structures into simpler molecules and sugars. These sugars can then undergo further conversion into bio-based products. Therefore, the goal of the chapter is to provide an in-depth analysis of both conventional and novel approaches to biomass valorization, which will encompass the processes involved in transforming biomass into commercially viable products and sources of energy."

Dyes are majorly organic compounds used by various industries as an identifier, colorant or for aesthetic purposes. Effluents discharged by such industries containing dyes may change the physical, chemical and biological properties of water in long run which causes adverse impacts on the ecosystem. While in humans and other aquatic animals, the dyes have toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic effects. The treatment of dyes can be done by various methods like membrane filtration, ion exchange, photochemical oxidation, nanotechnological approaches and various other physicochemical methods. Plants and microorganisms like algae, fungi, and bacteria also play a vital role in remediation of dyes through enzymatic processes. Phytoremediation of dyes takes place under the influence of reductase enzyme which reduces the dye into simpler organic compounds. Algae are source of carbon sink in oceans and also help in remediation of pollutants present in water. Algal cells are useful feedstock for various sectors of our economy such as biofuels, microalgal biochar, nutraceuticals, microbial fuel cell for bioelectricity, phyconanoparticles for environmental and medical applications. This review article aims to discuss dyes, sustainability issues and ecotoxicity related to them. It will give an insight on various methods of dye removal emphasising phytoremediation and factors responsible in its removal.

Biorefineries are considered an integral part of the development toward a future sustainable bioeconomy. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize current knowledge about how biorefinery technologies are being developed, deployed, and diffused, and to identify actors, networks, and institutions relevant for these processes. Several key findings can be obtained from the literature. First, investing more resources in R&D will not help to enable biorefineries to cross the ‘valley of death’ toward greater commercial investments. Second, while the importance and need for entrepreneurship and the engagement of small and medium‐sized enterprises ( SMEs ) is generally acknowledged, there is no agreement how to facilitate conditions for entrepreneurs and SMEs to enter the field of biorefineries. Third, visions for biorefinery technologies and products have focused very much on biofuels and bioenergy with legislation and regulation playing an instrumental role in creating a market for these products. But there is a clear need to incentivize non‐energy products to encourage investments in biorefineries. Finally, policy support for biorefinery developments and products is heavily intertwined with wider discussions around legitimacy and social acceptance. The paper concludes by outlining current knowledge gaps. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd "
pub.1037085952,"Biodiesel from the perspective of Turkey: Past, present and future","Energy is an indispensable factor of today's developed and developing societies. However, supplying most of the energy need through nonrenewable fossil fuels has come to the threatening position for both the energy demand and the sustainable development in the future. For this reason, most of the developed countries have started to reduce the foreign dependency in order to stabilize their economies and head towards more environmental and renewable resources. Particularly, economic fluctuation and environmental damages depending on the oil need which increases day by day raise the importance of biofuels. Biodiesel developed as an alternative of diesel fuel has reached up to 17.6 billion liters of production amounts over the last 20 years. It is predicted that this increase would be much more rapid in the next decade and reach up to 42 billion liters. EU, Argentina, Brazil, Malaysia and the USA supply the 93% of the biodiesel production of the world. Turkey, which is 78% foreign-dependent in terms of energy and imports its 93% of oil need, supported biodiesel production in 2000s in order to close its current deficit and prevent oil's environmental damages. However, the desired aims could not be achieved and many biodiesel facilities were shut down. Along with the amendments in the legislation of petroleum products by the end of 2011, it is aimed that the biodiesel sector would be boosted through arousing interest in biodiesel again."

In this work, the influence of the carbon support type (carbon nanotube [CNT], activated carbon [AC] and graphitic carbon black [GCB]) and the addition of Pt (1 wt.%, 1.5 wt.% and 2 wt.%) and ZnO (10 wt.%) to Ni10/CNT (10 wt.% Ni) are studied in steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) at low temperatures (≤450°C). The prepared CNT-based catalysts were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) analyses. Ni supported on CNTs was found to be highly active for SRE compared to other conventional carbon supported catalysts. The promotional effect of Pt in the Ni10Ptx/CNT catalysts was found to be unexpectedly insignificant in terms of ethanol conversion, hydrogen production and selectivity. By contrast, the hybrid (ZnO)10Ni10/CNT catalyst showed superior catalytic performance below 450°C with high H2 selectivity and low CO selectivity compared to all other CNT-based catalysts. The Ni10/CNT catalyst undergoes rapid deactivation compared to the ZnO promoted Ni10/CNT due to the large amounts of carbon deposition on the catalyst. The ZnO promoted Ni10/CNT catalyst enhances the hydrogen production and reduces the carbon formation, making the catalyst attractive for the SRE reaction."

Among the array of options available, biofuel stands out as a highly effective and environmentally sustainable alternative. Biobutanol presents properties like high heating value, low volatility, high viscosity, and low corrosion. Additionally, it is a much safer option for use, and its ability to blend with gasoline and other fuels turns it into a suitable and promising renewable alternative. Biobutanol can be produced from the agricultural industry's residues by the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process. The separation and purification of biobutanol from the fermentation broth account for 40 % of the plant budget, which is notable. Various separation techniques like liquid-liquid extraction, membrane perstraction, gas stripping, vacuum flash, membrane pervaporation, thermopervaporation, reverse osmosis, adsorption, etc., are applied. A befitting separation method must produce sufficient butanol concentration in the output and reduce the final product's cost so biobutanol can compete economically with other fuels. This work reviewed the existing processes for the separation and purification of butanol from ABE fermentation, including advanced methods. All methods will be discussed in detail considering environmental and economic parameters and each technique's superiors and challenges."

Industrial biotechnology - through its potential to reform our energy resources - is of specific interest given its controversial reception. With the ongoing shift from a fossil-fuel-based to a bio-based economy, the demand for biomass production for biofuels and biomaterials has increased dramatically. Although countries such as the USA may have enough land-surface available, it is not likely that the necessary biomass to 'fuel' Europe can be grown domestically. Europe must look elsewhere for its biomass needs and Africa is one of the more likely candidates. A large percentage of African arable land is currently not in use for agriculture. Moreover, the production potential of developing countries near to the equator is significantly higher than that of countries in more temperate climates such as most of Europe. An increasing number of parties are showing interest in growing biomass in Africa, which may result in harm as well as benefit for these regions. Europe is not alone in turning towards equatorial regions. China for example, is a very important stakeholder currently investing in African land. Regarding the issue of competition or cooperation, the enterprise carries enormous responsibility and requires attention to be paid to a range of local and global social, economic and ethical considerations, as well as the elucidation of a clear view of what success for all parties will require from this multifaceted effort."

pub.1174378072,Solid Biofuel from the Amazon: A Circular Economy Approach to Briquette Production from Wood Waste,"The Amazon region contains numerous areas dedicated to sustainable timber extraction. This operation has low yields and generates a large amount of waste. However, this waste can be repurposed for energy generation, providing income for locals and reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources prevalent in the region. This study aimed to assess the impact of torrefaction on various wood residues for briquette production. Wood residues from Mimosa scabrella Benth (Bracatinga), Dipteryx odorata (Aubl.) Willd. (Cumaru), and Aspidosperma populifolium A.DC. (Peroba mica) were torrefied at temperatures ranging from 180 to 220 °C for sixty minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere. Briquettes were produced using laboratory equipment with loading pressures between 7 and 14 MPa. Torrefied particle properties were evaluated based on proximate composition and calorific value tests, while briquette quality was assessed for physical and mechanical properties. The results demonstrated the briquetting potential of different wood species before and after torrefaction, with optimal outcomes achieved by torrefaction at 220 °C due to its enhancement of energy density. Briquettes showed optimal characteristics at compression pressures of 14 MPa, resulting in increased density (between 1.10 and 1.24 g·cm−3) and compression strength (between 7.20 and 21.02 MPa). The ash values were low and met the requirements.

pub.1151888838,Bioplastics innovation: commercialization strategies for polyethylene furanoate (PEF) and polyhydroxy alkanoates (PHA),"Abstract Plastics have become ubiquitous materials essential for modern life and sustaining the global economy. On the other hand, their dependence on dwindling fossil fuel sources and their durability has raised concerns about their sustainability. Biobased plastics, which include biodegradable plastics, appear to be an appealing solution, yet their uptake has been slow. This paper specifically looks at the commercialization challenges for two bioplastics: polyethylene furanoate (PEF) and polyhydroxy alkanoate (PHA), that have been claimed by the industry as potentially disruptive. The superior barrier, mechanical and thermal properties of PEF present a suitable competition to polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The versatility and marine biodegradability of PHAs have attracted interest from several potential adopters. However, the high production costs of both pose a serious commercialization challenge when considering the established production, supply chain and recycling infrastructure for fossil‐based plastics. This study illustrates how firms are mitigating technical and market uncertainties by strategies such as adding value to other products, utilizing existing industrial assets, balancing exploration of more efficient and sustainable production pathways with commercial exploitation, lowering transaction costs by utilizing existing knowledge base, by developing formulation capabilities and forward integrating into end consumer products, or by entering collaborative alliances. These strategies could inevitably overcome inertia posed by the current market structure for fossil‐based plastics. © 2022 The Authors.

This is a prime time to develop and implement the “waste to energy” projects across the globe to attain a sustainable environment. Anaerobic digestion (AD) has attracted the scientific community due to its simplicity and easiness to handle, and has the potential to utilize any kind of organic waste to produce a mixture of combustible gases, i.e., biogas and digested slurry, which has further applications in agriculture, solid biofuels, and purification. The process, in turn, reduces the local waste and helps in recycling in a manner that reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, conserves the resources, and establishes a circular economy in the time of undetermined future for the production of energy and safe disposal of the waste. However, the conventional processes encounter with the low biogas yield and long retention time, which discourage the developers. To enhance biogas yield and quality, the momentum of research has increased towards implementation of advanced techniques for development of efficient processes. The present article summarizes the effect of different operational parameters on AD and impact of advanced techniques for enhanced biomethane/biogas. The article further covers the life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic aspect (TCA) of the AD process. This will provide the comparison of different advanced techniques in terms of biomethane/biogas yield.Graphical Abstract"

pub.1125452038,Priority Estimation Model for Renewable Oils in Biodiesel Production,"Abstract
Energy security, volatile petroleum prices, source depletion issues and global climate change have driven countries to consider adding alternative and renewable energy options to their conventional energy sources. The use of vegetable oil-based biofuel as an option instead of diesel is important for development of sustainable and eco-friendly energy sources. The fatty acid composition of biodiesel manufactured from diverse plant resources and their properties are different. The aim of the present paper is to select the most feasible vegetable oil as biodiesel by using Analytical Hierarchy Process technique, one of the multi-criteria decision making methods based on priority estimation model. Among vegetable oil species, the problem of selecting the most feasible vegetable oil is evaluated, using numerous criteria related to their properties. This article highlights a novel insight into assessment of the feasible vegetable oil-based biodiesels for the decision makers such as research and development engineers and engine manufacturers to empower the green revolution to obtain the emission norms and fuel economy. The quantitative results indicate that the Corn with a global priority of 0.0636 is the option that contributes the most to the goal of selection the best plant oil that satisfies all the criteria selected. On the other hand, Palm and Pumpkin are the vegetable oil alternatives that are ranked last with equal priority values of 0.0337."

Researchers conducted a literature review of existing studies on the ECW nexus in terms of concepts, research focuses, mechanisms, and methodologies. Current research on the ECW nexus mainly focuses on the ECW flow accounting, the impact assessment of ECW‐related policies or measures, and the description of the nexus characteristics. ECW‐related measures may lead to a variety of cobenefits: economic growth, pollutant reduction, water quality improvement, and the carbon–water trade‐off—that is, that the adoption of water‐saving cooling technologies (such as wet cooling) could increase energy use and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. ECW‐related measures could also lead to the deployment of some low‐carbon power generation technologies, such as hydro, nuclear, and biofuel that could increase power sector water use. Nexus mechanisms of existing studies are mainly aimed at a specific sector; fewer studies consider the mechanisms from an economy‐wide perspective. Integrated models, such as computable general equilibrium‐based models and input–output (IO)‐based hybrid life cycle assessment models, should be used to assess the broad socioeconomic impacts of ECW‐related measures in future, in order to inspire policymakers to design and implement effective measures for integrated ECW management.

pub.1112226548,Pathways for a Brazilian biobased economy: towards optimal utilization of biomass,"Abstract  Biomass is responsible for 25% of the primary energy supply in Brazil. However, future biomass demand will be influenced by many factors. This study evaluates potential pathways for the utilization of biomass in Brazil until 2050, while considering novel biobased sectors (renewable jet fuel and biochemicals), resource competition, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Whereas other least‐cost optimization models assess biobased options to meet energy and chemicals demand in Brazil to a limited extent, this study provides a detailed breakdown of biomass feedstock, including an extensive portfolio of biomass conversion technologies. A least‐cost optimization model is used to assess the demand for energy and chemicals, and the competition between biomass and other climate‐mitigation measures such as renewable power generation technologies, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and energy efficiency. Varied over the three scenarios, 86–96% of the sustainable biomass supply potential is used. Under more stringent mitigation targets, novel biomass conversion technologies start to play an important role: Biobased electricity production with CCS, jet fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass, and chemicals are partly produced from ethanol and bio‐naphtha. The modeling framework provides a transparent view of which type of biomass can be used for which specific purpose. It is therefore an interesting tool for future research, for example to examine the dynamic interaction with demand for land. © 2019 The Authors.

pub.1172469640,Sugarcane Bagasse: Challenges and Opportunities for Waste Recycling,"Sugarcane has primarily been used for sugar and ethanol production. It creates large quantities of residual lignocellulosic biomass such as sugarcane bagasse, leaves, tops, and vinasse. Biomass is a sustainable prospect for biorefineries aiming to optimize production processes. We detail recent research developments in recycling sugarcane, including energy generation and pyrolysis to obtain biofuels, for example. To produce biochar, the energy cost of operating at high temperatures and large-scale production remain as obstacles. The energy generation prospects can be enhanced by pellet production; however, it requires an improvement in quality control for long-term storage or long-distance transportation. In civil construction, the materials still need to prove their long-term efficiency and reliability. Related to adsorbent materials, the use of sugarcane bagasse has the advantage of being low-cost and environmentally friendly. Nevertheless, the extraction, functionalization, and modification of cellulose fibers, to improve their adsorption properties or even mode of operation, still challenges. The synthesis of nanostructures is still lacking high yields and the ability to scale up. Finally, controlling dispersion and orientation and avoiding fiber agglomeration could improve the mechanical response of composites using sugarcane bagasse. The different possibilities for using sugarcane and its residues reinforce the importance of this material for the industry and the global economy. Thus, the present work addresses current challenges and perspectives of different industrial processes involving sugarcane aiming to support future research on waste-derived subjects."
pub.1169157215,Biorefining of Organic Solid Current Technology and Future Perspectives,"With an increased attention towards the circular economy, the application of biorefinery concept is on a constant rise. This has inspired the production process of refining crude oil to generate liquid fuels and other petroleum-based products such as gas, plastics, and petroleum jelly through various industrial techniques in an oil refinery. The increasing demand for energy and resources is driven by an increase in the usage of vehicles, industrial growth, and a massively growing population. However, numerous potential technological and energy-balance challenges were created from the manufacture of biofuels using seaweeds and algae. The prospective biomass production of algae per unit area is often greater than that of terrestrial plants that are produced under cultured conditions. Yet, the volumes of solid and liquid waste generated are increasing, resulting in the addition of a burden on waste management for dealing with wastes of this complexity. Many biorefining treatment systems and energy-assisted extraction techniques have been suggested for application in agricultural, municipal, and food and biochemical waste management. This chapter provides a brief overview of available novel biorefining methods that aim to utilize the generated wastes for the energy production, fuels, and seaweed feeds, with the possible aim to reduce waste pollution in the environment. Authors have also focused on the opportunities and threats in the global context that need to be possibly explored in the future to accelerate the growth of sustainable energy."

To achieve the maximum benefits of this technology, anaerobic co-digestion with phase separation by temperature and microorganisms (TPAD) of sewage sludge and waste from the agri-food sector (poultry manure and vinasse) was tested. To this end, each phase was optimised separately by applying different hydraulic retention times (HRT) first in the thermophilic acidogenic phase and then in the mesophilic methanogenic phase, in order to find the optimum conditions in terms of hydrogen and methane yield, volatile solids (VS) removal and pathogen removal in the effluent. The results obtained show a maximum hydrogen yield of 40.41mLH2/gVS in the acidogenic phase at 5 days of HRT and a methane yield of 391.0mLCH4/gVS in the mesophilic methanogenic phase at 12 days of HRT, respectively. At the end of the process, a total removal of VS of 93 % and of pathogens of more than 96.7 % was achieved, which would allow it to be classified as class A biosolid according to USEPA. Therefore, this technology would allow solving a local environmental problem of organic waste generation, valorising it in the form of biohydrogen, biomethane and biofertiliser, thus contributing to the transfer to a circular economy model."

Apart from the search for alternatives, there is a need to achieve energy independence, directing much focus on biofuels. Biodiesel is simple to use, biodegradable, nontoxic, and essentially free of sulfur and aromatics. Oil was extracted from the seeds of Blighia unijugata and Luffa cylindrica, subjected to chemical characterization and biodiesel production. The oil yield from the seed of B. unijugata was 50.82 ± 1.20% while that of L. cylindrica was 39.10 ± 0.20%. The biodiesel produced had ester content above 98%. The flash point of the biodiesel from B. unijugata and L. cylindrica was above 120°C while the phosphorus content was also below 1 ppm in both cases. The oxidative stability of B. unijugata was 44.30 ± 0.30 h, while that of L. cylindrica was lower than this value due to its high unsaturation. The copper strip corrosion value of the biodiesel was also found to be 1A. This study showed that the high free fatty acid content of B. unijugata and L. cylindrica seed oil can be reduced in a one-step pretreatment of esterification reaction using H2SO4 as catalyst thus reducing the problem of soap formation encountered when using oil with high free fatty acid for the production of biodiesel."

The renewable energy technologies such as biomass energy, solar, wind, and geothermal energy have the unlimited amount of primary energy resources. They can provide sustainable energy access, climate-friendly agriculture, environmental, and socio-economic benefits for the farmers in the rural communities. The integration of renewable energy systems such as solar and wind can provide a sustainable energy source for water pumps, crushing grain, and other activities in the rural life and sustainable agricultural activities of these regions. Geothermal power can provide a significant source of heat energy. Bioenergy crops such as corn, sugarcane, switchgrass, and other plant biomass can produce alcohol, biofuels, biogas, methane, oils, and hydrogen. There are significant opportunities in the application of renewable energy technologies for the socio-economic development in the agricultural production of rural areas. However, further technological improvement is needed to upgrade their equipment to obtain the maximum energy use efficiency (e.g., cold stores, irrigation pumps) to install renewable energy system to run intensive operations and provide the energy for high energy intensity activities such as irrigation systems, packaging and processing equipment, water heating, and sterilization. Through government and private energy incentives, the farmers can increase their energy self-sufficiency through energy use efficiency, and thus the renewable energy will lower their energy bills and costs, strengthen the food supply chain, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and provide clean agricultural products. The renewable energies are the second largest source of energy after coal, but ahead of nuclear, natural gas, and oil. The renewable energy technologies such as biomass energy, solar, wind, and geothermal energy have the unlimited amount of primary energy resources.

pub.1096948685,Integrated Model for Sustainable Development (IMSD): Impact of Technology Integration,"ABSTRACT There is a need worldwide to diversify the energy resources and rely on unconventional energy sources to prolong the oil reserves, attract hi-tech manufacturers, support knowledge based economy, and reduce carbon foot print. The current state of knowledge is confined in isolated research and development related to various renewable energy technologies such as passive energy, wind, Solar, biofuels, hydrothermal, and energy conservations. However, there are limited attempts, to integrate many of the aforementioned technologies in one place and monitor the impact of the integration on their efficiency and feasibility; as well as quantify the impact of other technologies related to energy and water conservation. The Integrated Model for Sustainable Development (IMSD) is a conceptual model that provides a unique conceptualization approach to study the impact of integrating individual technologies on a holistic energy and water systems. Additionally, blooming population increase worldwide put lots of strain on already scarce water resources. Almost 25% of energy produced is used for water extraction, treatment and delivery. Therefore, it is important for the 21 century technologies to address the energy-water-environment nexus, which result in better management of resources while maintaining clean environment for future generations. The IMSD is an innovative approach that provides a comprehensive platform that combines technology development, economics, environmental impact assessment, decision support and human capacity development in one platform. The IMSD is an integrated field scale testing platform that will likely improve the usefulness of models by including a probabilistic risk assessment approach that utilizes rigorous methodologies for dealing with missing and uncertain information; improved methods for interpretation of multivariate data sets and for multi-objective decision making involving trade-offs among conflicting goals; and novel modeling methods as alternatives to traditional mathematical models. Development of complex conceptual models, data collection and mathematical modeling are essential components of the IMSD. The IMSD is designed to quantify the impact of passive energy buildings and energy conservation technologies on enabling renewable energy technologies and reduction of carbon foot print using a holistic SD approach. The IMSD incorporates the Process Network Synthesis (PNS) to find an optimal technology pathway out of a complex technology network; a novel Graphical User Interface (GUI) to simulate the impacts of proposed management options; and a separate module for the Sustainable Process Index (SPI) to evaluate the economical and environmental feasibility of the designed integrated system. The IMSD is designed to address indirect problems related to energy production such as water management practices for oil operations, while mitigating the environmental impacts of waste water disposal processes and methods.

At the same time, in order to decarbonise the heat and transport sectors, power-based solutions are often seen as promising option, through so-called sector coupling. At times when VRE power supply exceeds demand, the surplus power could be used for producing liquid and gaseous electrofuels. The power is used for electrolysis, producing hydrogen, which can in turn be used either directly or combined with a carbon source to produce hydrocarbon fuels.</p><p>Here, we analyse the potential development of surplus power for the case of Germany, at an ambitious VRE expansion until 2050 and perform a cost analysis of electrofuels at different production levels using sorted residual load curves. These are then compared to biofuels and electric vehicles with the aid of an optimisation model, considering both cost- and greenhouse gas (GHG)-optimal options for the main transport sectors in Germany.</p><p>We find that, although hydrocarbon electrofuels are more expensive than their main renewable competitors, i.e. biofuels, they are most likely indispensable in addition for reaching climate targets in transport. However, the electrofuel potential is constrained by the availability of both surplus power and carbon. In fact, the surplus power potential is projected to remain limited even at currently ambitious VRE targets for Germany and carbon availability is lower in an increasingly renewable energy system unless direct air capture is deployed. In addition, as the power mix is likely to contain fossil fuels for decades to come, electrofuels based on power directly from the mix with associated conversion losses would cause higher GHG-emissions than the fossil transport fuel reference until a very high share of renewables in the power source is achieved. In contrast, electric vehicles are a more climate competitive option under the projected power mix with remaining fossil fuel fractions, due to a superior fuel economy and thereby lower costs and emissions.</p><p>As part of the assessment, we quantify the greenhouse gas abatement costs for different well-to-wheel pathways and provide an analysis and recommendations for a transition to sustainable transport.</p>"
pub.1164007962,ECONOMIC SPECIALIZATION OF THE REGION: OPPORTUNITIES AND PROSPECTS FOR DEVELOPMENT,"The article discusses the possibilities of developing the economic specialization of the energy profile region – the Republic of Bashkortostan. Currently, considerable attention is paid to the problems of spatial development of regions. In turn, this development is one of the most important components of the socio-economic well-being of the region. The concepts of spatial development include the adaptation of existing priorities of socio-economic development to available resources and new trends that contribute to the deformation of the existing system of division of labor. This feature includes the specialization of regional socioeconomic complexes. Historically, specialization is undergoing significant changes in the course of economic development. In order to maintain the sustainable competitiveness of the region's economy, it is necessary to constantly search for new development opportunities that provide unique advantages of the region, preferably for the long term. The purpose of the article is to search for opportunities and prospects for the development of economic specialization contributing to the preservation of the competitiveness of the region. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were solved: an analysis of the development of promising industrial specialization based on the rational use of economic resources, which includes an assessment of the current socio-economic situation and the degree of achievement of the goals of the region; an assessment of the prospects for the development of regional industrial specialization of the energy profile; justified scenarios for further development of promising industrial specialization. The optimal scenario for the economic development of the region based on the use of renewable energy sources, namely the production of biological raw materials, and biofuels from it, has been chosen.

This has led to the depletion of fossil fuels at a faster pace with an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, followed by increasing intensity and frequency of natural calamities. In this regard, Paris Climate Agreement or COP21 has been signed by 196 countries in 2015 to reduce the emission of GHGs, by at least 25% by 2030. Thus, biorefineries based on the most abundant and sustainable lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks are the future candidates to mitigate emerging global warming scenario. The lignocellulosic biomass is converted into bioenergy majorly through two platforms, namely thermochemical platform (gasification, pyrolysis, and liquefaction) and biochemical platform (alcoholic fermentation and anaerobic digestion). However, the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass is yet to be economically viable because of higher production costs due to several challenges such as the complex structure of lignocellulosic biomass, supply chain management, expensive processing of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels, and lower fermentation yields. In this context, the economic sustainability of biorefinery can be achieved by the valorization of all streams of lignocellulosic biomass into value-added chemicals. This chapter focuses on the potential of integrated lignocellulosic biorefinery to process a range of agricultural feedstocks, the conversion routes of lignocellulosic biomass to liquid and gaseous fuels, and the valorization of all major components of lignocellulosic biomass to value-added products. This chapter focuses on the potential of integrated lignocellulosic biorefinery to process a range of agricultural feedstocks, the conversion routes of lignocellulosic biomass to liquid and gaseous fuels, and the valorization of all major components of lignocellulosic biomass to value-added products. Pretreatment is the most complex and capital-intensive step that depolymerizes cellulose and hemicellulose and separates lignin. The pretreatment process for any biomass depends on its characteristics and targeted derived products. Efficiency is one of the most important indicators of perfection in technology development followed by commercialization. A highly efficient or fast process that is yet to gain reliable levels of technology readiness poses much higher risks associated with scale-up and plant operation than technologies that have travelled a significant learning curve at a commercial scale. Technological advancement with niche product development and their market development will bring more robustness in the bioenergy sector."

Apart from its adverse effect on its economy, it has also negative impacts on the health and the environment, in general. However, investments in renewable energy are faced by the competitive oil prices, the very high investment cost for renewable energy, and high local electricity prices. This paper appraises the attractiveness of investing in renewable energy sources over the continued use of non-edible oil for electricity generation.MethodsThis paper explores the application of biomass seed oil to produce a renewable fuel (biodiesel) using heterogeneous base catalyst. Meanwhile, two-step processes were employed to produce the biofuel. In the first step (esterification), the acid value of the oil was reduced to the recommended limit (FFA ≤ 1.5) using H2SO4, while in the second step (transesterification), the catalyst calcination of grounded Brette Pearl Spar Mable (BPSM) pre-soaked in methanol was used as a biobase for biodiesel production. For the optimization, minitab response surface (MRS) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to model and optimize the process variables responsible for the optimum production of the oil and the biodiesel.ResultsThe result presented showed that T. peruviana seed was found to be rich in oil with an average yield of 44.00% (w/w), and the oil was highly unsaturated with a high FFA. The maximum experimental biodiesel yield obtained was 86.00% at a catalyst amount of 4 g, a reaction time of 70 min, and a methanol/oil ratio of 0.1(v/v). This result was validated in triplicate under the same conditions, which yielded 85.70% (v/v) for MRS and 85.98% (v/v) for ANN. Furthermore, the optimization results also indicated that the p values (p < 0.05) of the model terms were significant, and the accuracy of the models achieved by MRS and ANN based on R2 depict that both optimization tools gave good predictions of R2 (MRS: R2 = 99.98% and ANN: R2 = 99.97%). The properties of the biodiesel, as described in other earlier reports using the same feedstock with different catalysts, indicated that the produced biodiesel had properties which agreed to those reported in the literature.ConclusionsT. peruviana seed has proved to be a good biomass raw material for oil production, and its conversion to biofuel using a heterogeneous biobase catalyst showed its suitability as a renewable environmental friendly fuel. Government should invest in more sustainable sources of energy by imposing law for the use of non-edible oil or decreasing the price of electricity."

Not only facing a growing energy demand, but ASEAN also needs to balance its energy trilemma (energy security, energy equity, and energy sustainability). On the other hand, ASEAN countries also acknowledge the need for transitioning into a low‐carbon economy to contribute to the global agenda of sustainable development goals 2030. Considering all the challenges, we argue that a comprehensive review of the historical and outlook of the ASEAN energy landscape, as well as national and regional energy policies, is important to investigate the capability of ASEAN Member States (AMS) to accelerate energy transition while securing energy supply. ASEAN has been a net importer of oil since before 2005, with transport accounting for the largest share of oil demand. Measures in the transportation sector need to be taken by the AMS by enhancing their biofuels and electric vehicle developments. The electricity grid can also be more diversified with the integration of renewable energy, considering the region possesses the untapped potential for hydro and solar, among others. Public financing is required to create a supportive environment for the ASEAN energy transition pathway by opening up the path and catalyzing market participation from private businesses. This article aims to provide a novel contribution to assessing energy potential in the Southeast Asia region toward the 2030 global agenda."

Ethanol has been widely used since the 1800s as a fuel of choice for internal combustion engines (ICE). Compared to conventional feedstock (corn/sugar beet), microalgae has a better potential in terms of ethanol yield: 40–140 ML ha−1 versus 3–6 ML ha−1 and can be a promising alternative for the future. Although various approaches have been presented to convert algal biomass to fuels, feed and chemicals; none of them are feasible from the economic point of view. Therefore, it is prudent to develop a biorefinery concept where multiple numbers of products can be recovered from the same algal biomass with a limited expense on unit operation. In order to address the present bio-economy challenges, it is pertinent to focus on the development of multiple products from the same biomass. In the present chapter the recent developments on algal refinery concept have been studied focussing on integrated bioethanol production under a biorefinery paradigm. The review also covers the technical challenge which inhibits the realization of algal biorefinery, along with providing insight on how to overcome the technical hurdles."
pub.1126919380,Modelling of renewable gas and renewable liquid fuels in future integrated energy systems," This study conducts an integrated energy system assessment to evaluate pathways for using locally distributed sustainable biomass resources in the conversion to renewable gas and liquid biofuels in future integrated energy systems. A modelling framework with a detailed spatiotemporal representation is used, optimising the usage and transportation of local biomass resources for producing renewable gas and renewable liquid fuels through the OptiFlow model, along with the comprehensive power and district heating model Balmorel, integrating short-term dynamics in the long-term planning horizon. Results for a fossil-independent Danish energy system by 2050 show that production of bio-jet fuel in Denmark would impose high pressure on national biomass resources. Electrofuels, such as biomethanol, have economic viability and promising potentials. The results regarding renewable gas production show that anaerobic co-digestion of a mixed feedstock to produce biogas, which is further upgraded to biomethane using water scrubbing for CO2 removal, would be the preferred option. Biorefineries are located near larger cities to benefit from economy of scale and access to large district heating networks, as excess heat from biorefineries could supply up to 21% of the national district heating demand. On the contrary, biogas plants would be located in the countryside, as the costs of transporting manure are a determining factor. Therefore, our study provides a novel modelling approach, which enables optimisation of geographical distributed resources for renewable gas and liquid fuel production, while taking synergies across energy vectors in account."
pub.1002376867,Low Carbon Production of Hydrogen by Methane Decarbonization,"Hydrogen is one of the energy vectors that is proposed to have an important role in the future. The implementation of the called “hydrogen economy” is a challenge that requires the development of sustainable production technologies for hydrogen. Such technologies are intended to be fed by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or biomass. Hydrogen generation from wind and solar photovoltaic cells will be done via water electrolysis. Direct thermal energy sources such as solar thermal are expected to use thermochemical methods, either from water or hydrocarbons as the main raw material. Biomass can be used in this context in two ways: as raw material, through the production of syngas or bio-methane to produce hydrogen by thermochemical processes, and as an electricity producer to generate hydrogen via electrolysis. In this chapter, techniques for hydrocarbon decarbonization will be discussed. The general chemical description of methane pyrolysis will be the starting point to describe concepts for its implementation, mainly applying solar technology. Other alternatives, such as the use bio-methane as raw material and the integration of methane pyrolysis with ammonia production or biofuel synthesis will be discussed. The scientific viability of methane decarbonization has been tested and proven, but viable industrial implementation of the technology still remains. The status of the implementation of this technology on an industrial scale will be discussed analyzing its main technological showstoppers and their potential solutions."
pub.1152392052,Optimization of deep eutectic solvent pretreatment for bioethanol production from Napier grass,"The growing demands of fossil fuel consumption led to the depletion of fossil fuels, and other environmental impacts. As a step toward sustainable development, fossil fuels should be replaced by lignocellulosic biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among the lignocellulosic biomass, Napier grass is an important energy crop due to its high growth rate, less water and nutrient requirement for their growth, and high carbohydrate content. This study focused on the improvement of ethanol production from Napier grass by pretreatment with acidic deep eutectic solvent (DES), choline chloride: lactic acid (ChCl/LA) at a mole ratio of 1:4. The parameters for DES pretreatment included biomass loading (1:5 to 1:20, w/w), temperature (80 to 130 ℃), and time (0.5 to 5 h), which were optimized based on maximized sugar release from enzymatic hydrolysis. Under optimized pretreatment conditions (biomass loading of 1:6.5 (w/w), temperature of 80 ℃ for 5 h), 71 % cellulose recovery and 68 % lignin removal were obtained, which led to a glucose yield of 87.09 % from Ctec2 saccharification. The inhibitor analysis revealed that ChCl/LA pretreatment produced only a negligible amount of inhibitor, acetic acid (0.001 % v/v). Furthermore, fermentation studies were also conducted to evaluate the bioethanol production from the biomass, of which 86.6 % of the theoretical ethanol yield was achieved. Overall, this study demonstrated the significance of ChCl/LA pretreatment for ethanol production from Napier grass and the potential of this lignocellulosic ethanol to achieve reach the goals of the green economy."

pub.1141211370,Carbon-Negative Policies by Reusing Waste Wood as Material and Energy Resources for Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Taiwan,"Carbon-negative policies for mitigating the emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) from the energy sector are becoming more urgent and important. Therefore, the environmental policies and regulatory promotion for reusing waste wood as a carbon-negative resource in Taiwan were discussed in this work, which focused on mitigating the emissions of GHG from the energy industries and the manufacturing and construction industries. Considering the official GHG inventory report, the trend analysis of GHG emissions from the energy and the manufacturing and construction industries was addressed first. In addition, this study placed emphasis on the environmental policies and regulatory measures for the material and energy resources from waste wood according to the promulgation of the relevant acts. It was found that the total GHG emissions from the energy and the manufacturing and construction industries accounted for over 80% of net GHG emissions in 2018. In review of the resource recycling and circular economy, lignocellulose-based (or bamboo-based) char, ecological building material, and wood-to-biofuel pathways (e.g., solid recovered fuel) were discussed in this work because they have been promoted by the central competent authorities of the Council of Agriculture (COA), the Ministry of Interior (MOI), and the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), respectively. In order to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Taiwan, carbon-negative policies for reusing waste wood as material and energy resources will play an important role in the mitigation of GHG emissions."
pub.1136678467,Climate Change Mitigation Pathways for the Aviation Sector,"Even though the contribution of the aviation sector to the global economy is very notable, it also has an adverse impact on climate change. Improvements have been made in different areas (i.e., technology, sustainable aviation fuel, and design) to mitigate these adverse effects. However, the rate of improvement is small compared to the increase in the demand for air transportation. Hence, greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector are steadily increasing and this trend is expected to continue unless adequately addressed. In this context, this study examined the following: (i) the factors that affect the growth of aviation, (ii) trends in greenhouse gas emissions in the sector, (iii) trends in energy demand, (iv) mitigation pathways of emissions, (v) mitigation challenges for the International Civil Aviation Organization, (vi) achievements in mitigating emissions, (vii) barriers against mitigating emissions, and (viii) approaches of overcoming barriers against emissions mitigation. This study finds that continued research and development efforts targeting aircraft fuel burn efficiency are crucial in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although biofuels are promising for the reduction of aviation emissions, techniques to reduce NOx emissions could enhance large-scale deployment. Pragmatic market-based mechanisms, such as the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and/or carbon tax must be enforced on a global scale to capitalize on a collective stakeholder effort to curb CO2 emissions. The findings of this study will help in understanding the emissions and energy consumption scenarios, which will provide a comprehensive package of mitigation pathways to overcome future emissions reduction challenges in the aviation sector."
pub.1181264583,Phycoremediation of Domestic Waste Water and Biodiesel Extraction from Fresh-Water Microalgae,"ABSTRACT: Microalgae have recently drawn attention as a potential source for the sustainable production of biotechnologically valuable resources and improving the environment in various ways. They are widely distributed and can thrive even under extreme circumstances like high temperatures or high salinity. However, producing microalgae takes a lot of nutrients, which may have an adverse impact on the environment and the economy. The use of wastewater, particularly those from agro-industrial facilities, domestic waste waters, and industrial discharges, which often contain high nutrient concentrations, can serve as an alternative to synthetic culture media. Because the composition of wastewater and usual culture media is relatively similar, wastewater can be utilized to both clean itself and culture microalgae at the same time. Utilizing microalgae as wastewater bioremediation agents can efficiently remove N and P from domestic wastewater, maintain dissolved oxygen concentration, and reduce the various disease-causing pathogens and fecal bacteria that are present in domestic wastewater. The potential of microalgae to be used as a feedstock is increased by their ability to change the composition of their biomass under stress and accumulate lipids or carbohydrates that might be used to produce biodiesel. Methyl or ethyl esters of fatty acids produced from triglycerides by transesterification process by using renewable feedstocks are known as biodiesel. The microalgal biomass is considered as the next generation of feedstock for biofuel production. The Dual function of microalgae in domestic wastewater treatment and biomass growth for biodiesel production is outlined and discussed in detail in this review paper."
pub.1171255677,Bioremediation as a Sustainable and Circular Solution for Mining Waste Management and Bioenergy Generation,"Extensive mining activities cause a significant social and environmental impact. Mining waste residues, especially low-grade ores and tailings, pose a serious environmental threat. The mining sector needs to move towards an environmentally friendly approach with zero waste technology. Metals and metalloids in mine waste contaminate the environment to a significant extent, affecting human life. Bioremediation of mining waste contaminants is one of the safest, least expensive, and most environmentally friendly approaches. Global energy consumption will continue to grow at a 4.6% annual pace, with developing nations accounting for more than 70% of this increase. This constant increase in both production and consumption has the unintended consequence of generating massive amounts of mining waste. Almost 0.4 tonnes of coal refuse are created for every tonne of coal produced. India is the world’s second-largest producer of coal mining waste and generates about 170 million tonnes of solid waste from mining every year, with growth projected to reach 300 million tonnes. A variety of native microorganisms including bacteria, archaea, and fungi are used to bioremediate diverse mining pollutants. Microorganisms have different underlying mechanisms to degrade these pollutants and can survive high metal concentrations. Bioremediation of mining waste with simultaneous bioenergy generation, in the form of biofuel and organic acids, holds promise as a circular- economy solution to ever-increasing mining pollution. This chapter describes recent advances in bioremediation technology-based approaches for mining waste treatment, pollution abatement, and simultaneous resource recovery and bioenergy generation."

pub.1182112474,A review on economical and impact of bioethanol production from microalgae: Current scenario and future prospect,"Fossil fuel is one of the most important sources of energy that have been powering economies for last 150 years. However, the combustion of these fossil fuels is the primary cause of emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which contributes to the warming of the planet and enhances greenhouse effect. In order to mitigate the negative effects of fossil fuels, biofuel is promoted as the most effective and environment friendly alternative to fossil fuels. Among the existing feedstocks diatoms and other microalgae have proved to be the most abundant source of existing crude oil from the previous studies and existing literatures. However, an important alternative for fuel from microalgae biomass, is its conversion into bioethanol which is currently the most demanding alternatives to fossil fuels replacing gasolines and aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the scale-up production of bioethanol using microalgae is challenging due to low yields, and high cost. It is crucial to discuss economic aspects, and innovations needed to overcome these shortcomings. Chemical free technologies such as pulsed electric fields (PEF), or induction of biosynthesized nanoparticles as pretreatment methods and economic cultivations like bubble farming and microalgae in microbial fuel cells could enhance the yields, and lower the cost. Wet biomass processing also plays a critical role in cost-effective bioethanol production from microalgae. The present study will channel the research in bioethanol production using microalgae through sustainable approaches such as PEF and biosynthesized nanoparticles that can be improved and used for up scaling the bioethanol production."

The objective of the present review is to discern potential sources of biomass and their corresponding alternatives for transformation, with a particular emphasis on energy generation within the Mexican highlands and semi-desert regions. Methodologically, this review was conducted by reviewing various search engines, identifying articles related to energy production, the transformation processes, and the obtained product, establishing the relevance of each contribution, and including the information that was deemed pertinent. From this information analysis, it was found that most of the studies are conducted at theoretical and laboratory levels; then, scientific knowledge has been generated in this topic. However, low interaction with the social and industrial sectors is observed. It is required to develop strategies to transfer the generated knowledge and to scale up the studied transformation processes to generate ecological, economic, and social benefits. According to the information obtained it can be concluded that the agricultural and forestry sectors in the highlands and semi-desert regions of Mexico hold significant promise for generating bioenergy via the utilization of residual biomass, including stubble, straw, branches, stems, and sawdust.

We analyzed a mature conversion technology for woody resources for the contiguous US that takes advantage of economies of scale: the nth-plant. We developed a database to quantify the total accessible woody biomass within a distributed network of preprocessing depots and biorefineries considering both quality specifications for conversion and a target cost to compete with fossil fuels. We considered two categories of woody biomass: 1) forest residues from trees, tops and limbs produced from conventional thinning and timber harvesting operations as well as non-timber tree removal; and 2) short rotation woody crops such as poplar, willow, pine, and eucalyptus. A mixed integer linear programming model was developed to analyze scenarios with woody feedstock blends at variable biomass ash contents and cost targets at the biorefinery. When considering a target cost of $85.51/dry ton (2016$) at the biorefinery, the maximum accessible biomass from forest residues in 2040 remained constant at 106 million dry tons regardless of ash targets. Including short rotation woody crops as part of the blend increased the total accessible biomass to 153 and 195 million dry tons at ash targets of 1% and 1.75%, respectively. We concluded from our analysis that woody resources could address about 55% of EPA’s (Environmental Protection Agency) target of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel."

pub.1001922340,Chapter 6 Strategies for Producing More Rice with Less Water,"Rice is life for more than half of humanity. It is the grain that has shaped the cultures, diets, and economies of billions of people in the world. Food security in the world is challenged by increasing food demand and threatened by declining water availability. More recently, the increase in area under biofuel crops at the cost of food crops is also threatening. Exploring ways to produce more rice with less water is essential for food security. Water-saving rice production systems, such as aerobic rice culture, system of rice intensification (SRI), ground-cover rice production system (GCRPS), raised beds, and alternate wetting and drying (AWD), can drastically cut down the unproductive water outflows and increase water-use efficiency (WUE). However, these technologies can sometimes lead to some yield penalty, if the existing lowland varieties are used. Other new approaches are being explored to increase water economy without compromise on yield. These include the incorporation of the C4 photosynthetic pathway into rice to increase rice yield per unit water transpired, the use of molecular biotechnology to develop rice varieties with improved water-use efficiency, transpiration efficiency (TE), drought tolerance, and the development of varieties for aerobic system, to achieve high and sustainable yields in nonflooded soil. Through the adoption of water-saving irrigation technologies, rice land will shift away from being continuously anaerobic to being partly or even completely aerobic. These shifts will produce profound changes in water conservation, soil organic matter turnover, nutrient dynamics, carbon impounding, weed flora, and greenhouse gas emissions. Although some of these changes can be positive, for example, water conservation and decreased methane emission, others might be negative, for example, release of nitrous oxide from the soil and decline in soil organic matter. The challenge will be to develop effective integrated natural–resource–management interventions, which would allow profitable rice cultivation with increased soil aeration, while maintaining the productivity, environmental safety, and sustainability of rice-based ecosystems. This chapter discusses the integrated approaches like genetics, breeding, and resource management to increase rice yield and to reduce water demand for rice production."
pub.1148561313,Fungal Biotechnology Prospects and Avenues,"Traditional studies in mycology mainly deal with damage caused by fungi, for instance, diseases of plants, animal ailments, air-borne pathogens, decomposition of wood and production of mycotoxins in food. Applied mycology focuses on the fermentation of foods (flours, bakery products, cheese and others) and production of fermented products (wine, beer and spirit). Further value-added approaches show the significance of fungi in the production of bioactive metabolites and pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of human diseases, including cancer, and plant diseases (e.g. pest control).

Some key characteristics of illustrative net-zero energy systems include increased penetration of renewable energy and carbon sources, use of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in hard-to-abate sectors, and a greater role for energy carriers such as electricity and hydrogen (Davis et al, 2018). Another common feature of such energy systems is the need for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches (Horowitz et al, 2022). Across all these characteristics of net-zero energy systems, bioenergy and biomass feedstock is anticipated to play an important role. Biomass feedstock serves as a renewable carbon source. This can enable conversion of such feedstock into fuels and energy carriers for hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Indeed, the U.S. Government has a target to meet all jet fuel demand by 2050 from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), where biofuel pathways are likely to have an important role (EERE, 2020). Bioenergy is also highly versatile with the possibility to convert feedstock into electricity, hydrogen, liquid fuels, heat or high-value products, based on biomass type, demand and technology availability (Clarke et al, 2022). Combination of bioenergy with CCS can also nominally deliver CDR (Fuhrman et al, 2023). As such, the share of bioenergy is expected to grow by at least five time across scenarios studied for the long-term strategy of the U.S. between 2020 and 2050 (Horowitz et al, 2022). Notwithstanding the role of bioenergy in the energy systems, its deployment, costs and scalability are influenced by a number of factors. Some of these factors pertain to policy interventions such as imposition of a binding decarbonization target either at an economy-wide level or the sectoral level. Resource availability and type of biomass feedstock also varies considerably across regions. From a technological perspective, the readiness of bioenergy conversion pathways is subject to high variability. This influences the costs of deployment. Moreover, the sourcing of feedstock, grid carbon intensity, and co-product handling approaches all affect the life cycle efficacy of bioenergy. The latter, in turn, is particularly important in determining the extent to which bioenergy with CCS or BECCS can effectively deliver CDR (Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017)."
pub.1159255175,Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge with lignocellulosic and algal biomass for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuel production: A life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis,"Biowastes are marked sources of global greenhouse gas emissions, however, locally accessible biowaste could be a sustainable source for biofuel production to generate clean energy. This study examined the environmental sustainability and economic feasibility of using co-pyrolysed sewage sludge (SS) with lignocellulosic and algal biomass for liquid and gaseous fuel production from the perspective of life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis. Wastewater-grown microalgae, sawdust, and wheat straw were selected as co-feed materials, and three mixing ratios (25, 50, and 75 wt%) of each feedstock with SS were examined. Wastewater-grown microalgae and SS were obtained from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which were assumed to be near the pyrolysis plant facility, obviating the need for transportation. An Aspen simulation was used to estimate the amount of energy recovered from the pyrolysis as gaseous fuel for electricity and heat generation via gas turbines. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify future considerations for SS co-pyrolysis to make it a more environmentally and economically viable industrial process for producing liquid and gaseous fuels. The co-pyrolysis of SS with biomass reduced the overall environmental burden, with sawdust co-pyrolysis outperforming wheat straw and microalgal co-pyrolysis. All scenarios achieved a high net positive energy balance (from 2,595 to 6,323 kWh/1,000 kg bio-oil) and reduced global warming potential (GWP) (from −793 to −1,970 kg CO2 eq/1,000 kg bio-oil). Sawdust co-pyrolysis resulted in the highest GWP reduction (from −1,510 to −1,970 kg CO2 eq/1,000 kg bio-oil) and energy recovery (from 5,551 to 6,323 kWh/1,000 kg bio-oil). Energy recovery from gaseous fuel through gas turbine operation generated a process energy demand of 23 %–224 %. Sawdust co-pyrolysis exhibited the highest net present worth (NPW) of 6.16 million CAD. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the GWP and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential were affected by the transportation of sawdust and wheat straw. Overall, the co-pyrolysis of SS with both lignocellulosic and algal biomass is sustainable and economically feasible for producing liquid and gaseous fuels and treating hazardous waste originating from WWTPs, thereby facilitating environmental sustainability and a circular economy from the sale of pyrolysis products. Broader implication of this study is using effective catalysts to further strengthen the sustainability and increase the profitability of the co-pyrolysis process, which has not been yet investigated."
pub.1002352727,Conclusion and Outlook,"In a nutshell, smart bioenergy can be described as the process of optimizing individual technologies and plants to an optimized contribution of bioenergy technologies to the overall energy system and infrastructure with the benefit of providing additional services from bioenergy. The focus of this book is on the conceptual approaches and the technical potential for developing different biomass provision routes towards more flexibility. This requires conversion plants with units that can be controlled with precision and well adapted to short reaction times, with a partial load function of the conversion process and additional storage facilities.Power provision from biomass is one application, where increasing flexibility can be expected in Germany over the next 5 years when electricity from wind and photovoltaic will become more important. Due to the specific frame conditions of power provision, the demand for flexibility in this sector is expected to be very challenging, requiring reaction times of only a few minutes to provide positive or even negative energy to balance grid stability. Beside the specific German case, flexible power to increase the grid stability can be necessary due to different reasons and is required in many countries of the world. Highly flexible heat provision in small scale combustion units is not so much an issue at the moment, but is expected prospectively to be due to an increasing supply of heat from solar systems and/or heat from excess energy from wind and photovoltaic (power to heat). Fuels for transportation are also expected to change in the years to come. Furthermore, the increased availability of fluctuating wind and solar power will provide excess energy during certain periods. Basically speaking, the excess electrical energy can be converted into thermal or chemical energy and meet some of the demand for heat or fuel consumption. As a result, some of the flexibility needs can be shifted between the different sectors. To enable technologies to fulfil the additional demands for smaller and more flexible bioenergy provision, the availability of advanced intermediates is a core issue. This includes further development and market implementation of advanced solid biofuels as well as biomethane.Challenges on the road to becoming more flexible do not only occur from the technical options and limitations but also from the elements of the supply chain, including sustainable feedstock provision, the implementation of flexible conversion concepts and the demand from the renewable energy market. With regard to the holistic system approach, three pillars for smart bioenergy systems can be identified: (i) an additional demand for smaller application units in terms of energy provision from biomass, (ii) the necessity to have improved technologies providing the desired products in small units and (iii) and new concepts of system integration – including the energy system but the coupled production of materials energy carriers f"
pub.1141267680,Sugarcane biorefineries: potential opportunities towards shifting from wastes to products,"Biorefining involves the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable food and feed ingredients, bio-based products (chemicals and materials), and bioenergy (biofuels, power, and/or heat). The processing of sugarcane is a successful example of renewable bioenergy being produced on a large industrial scale. As the world largest crop by production quantity, around 1907 millions of tons of sugarcane were globally produced last year. Currently, most of the sugarcane mills produce first generation (1 G) ethanol, sugar, and energy from the burning of bagasse. However, the use of part of the sugarcane bagasse to produce second generation (2 G) ethanol is beginning to move towards an industrial reality. The 2 G ethanol process itself also generates several side-streams, which could be further used to obtain high added-value products. Integrated 1 G-2 G biorefineries, where the whole sugarcane biomass is converted to bioenergy and a suite of bio-based products, can be an attractive investment option for a future scenario of a low-carbon economy. The purpose of this review is to gather together the most recent technologies that have been developed to enable the whole use of feedstocks, byproducts, and side-streams within the sugarcane biorefinery. Possible ways to improve the efficiency of biomass processing are discussed, such as the use of low-cost additives, together with the economic and environmental aspects related to the implementation of a sugarcane biorefinery. Potential applications of sugarcane bagasse and straw to obtain valuable products including enzymes, biofertilizers, nanocellulose and lignin-derived commodities are presented as opportunities to improve the attractiveness of this business model."
pub.1120093525,Estimation and Efficient Utilization of Straw Resources in Ghana,"The significance of this research is on maize, rice, sorghum, millet, groundnut, soybeans and cowpea straw for stronger sustainability in Ghana’s economic development. Quantifying and re-use of crop straw resources in Ghana is still at the infancy stage hampering the efficient recycling of these resources in a sustainable manner. Sustainability is straw as a renewable resource to improve soils, livestock production, generate renewable energy and reduce pollution for development. The aim of this research was to estimate the crop straw yield from 2006 to 2016 and identify the various utilization modes for major cereals and legumes in Ghana. In addition the distribution of maize, rice, sorghum and cowpea straw across major producing regions was calculated. Results obtained showed that 77,404,709.75 tonnes of cereals and legumes straw were produced in Ghana from 2006 to 2016. Cereal straw recorded a 72.3% yield whilst legume straw recorded 26.8%. Maize and groundnut straw recorded the highest yield of 37,323,264.16 and 12,495,288.96 tonnes respectively. Brong Ahafo region of Ghana had the highest maize straw yield with the Northern region recording readily availability of both cereals and legumes straw resources. The major re-use methods of straw in Ghana are as livestock feed, fertilizer, cooking fuel, for sale and as a substrate for mushroom production. We recommend strategies the government can adapt to develop policies geared towards the accurate recording of straw and their comprehensive utilization in Ghana. The efficient utilization of straw resources will reduce soil erosion, improve soil fertility, serve as feed for livestock, reduce pollution, generate biofuels plus generate employment to benefit the rural economy."
pub.1051069899,Learning curves for hydrogen production technology: An assessment of observed cost reductions,"At present three key energy carriers have the potential to allow a transition towards a sustainable energy system: electricity, biofuels and hydrogen. All three offer great opportunity, but equally true is that each is limited in different ways. In this article we focus on the latter and develop learning curves using cost data observed during the period 1940–2007 for two essential constituents of a possible ‘hydrogen economy’: the construction of hydrogen production facilities and the production process of hydrogen with these facilities. Three hydrogen production methods are examined, in decreasing order of importance with regards to their current market share: steam methane reforming, coal gasification and electrolysis of water. The fact that we have to include data in our analysis that go far back in time, as well as the uncertainties that especially the older data are characterized by, render the development of reliable learning curves challenging. We find only limited learning at best in a couple of cases, and no cost reductions can be detected for the overall hydrogen production process. Of the six activities investigated, statistically meaningful learning curves can only be determined for the investment costs required for the construction of steam methane reforming facilities, with a learning rate of 11±6%, and water electrolysis equipment, with a learning rate of 18±13%. For past coal gasification facility construction costs no learning rate can be discerned. The learning rates calculated for steam methane reforming and water electrolysis equipment construction costs have large error margins, but lie well in the range of the learning reported in the literature for other technologies in the energy sector."

This marked the transition for Ukraine towards a circular economy and sustainable development. The entry into force of the Law ""On Waste Management"" on July 9, 2023, initiated the transition to the European waste management system in Ukraine. This includes adopting the European approach to waste classification, applying the five-level hierarchy of waste management, and implementing the principles of extended producer responsibility and the polluter pays principle. According to state statistical data, only 25.51% of industrial waste in Ukraine is disposed of properly. To examine woodworking production as a source of waste generation, an analysis was conducted on the equipment used for wood processing and the characteristics of wood raw materials and lumber. The paper identifies the types of waste generated during the mechanical processing of wood raw materials, which include dust, small and large shavings, sawdust, and lumpy wood waste. Calculations of woodworking waste generation during furniture production were also conducted. From an annual processing volume of 300000 m³ of lumber, the following waste volumes are produced: Piece wood waste: 79.515 m³/year; Shavings: 4.950 m³/year; Sawdust: 6.300 m³/year. The total volume of wood waste, in relation to the input raw materials, is 30.26%. The amount of wood waste removed by the aspiration system, which includes dust-capturing equipment, was also calculated. Recommendations for managing wood processing waste were developed. The recommended areas for processing woodworking industry waste include: Production of pellets, Biomass energy, Production of wood panels, Production of bio-electrochemical products, Pulp and paper production, Biofuels, Recycling and reuse, Hydrolysis of wood, Production of compost."
pub.1171833195,Unlocking the potential of second cheese whey: a comprehensive review on valorisation strategies,"The second cheese whey (SCW) is the liquid fraction that remains after the production of whey-cheeses. SCW appears as a white to yellow/green opalescent liquid with suspended solids and contains up to 6% lactose and variable amounts of proteins, fats, and mineral salts. Due to its organic load, SCW is characterized by levels of Biochemical Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand that are significantly higher than urban wastewater. Therefore, it poses an environmental challenge and represents a significant cost and a problem for cheese production facilities when it comes to disposal. On the flip side, SCW contains valuable nutrients that make it a cost-effective substrate for bio-based productions including lactose extraction, and the production of lactic acid, bioethanol, eco-friendly bioplastics, biofuels, beverages, bioactive peptides, and microbial starters. A search in Scopus database indicates that despite the numerous potential applications, interest in SCW exploitation is surprisingly limited and, accordingly, sustainable management of SCW disposal remains an unresolved issue. In this review, which marks the first exclusive focus on SCW, with the aim of contributing to increase the interest of both the scientific community and the stakeholders in the exploitation of this by-product, the processes aimed at SCW valorisation will be described, with particular attention to its use in the production of beverages, food and feed, single cell proteins and as a source of biodegradable bioplastics, organic acids and renewable energy. Moreover, to provide valuable insights into its applications and innovations, an overview on patents regarding the exploitation of SCW will be presented.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1164572085,Effect of removal of inhibitors on microbial communities and biogas yield of Jatropha curcas seeds during continuous anaerobic digestion,"Jatropha curcas seeds, as an abundant lignocellulosic biomass, offer a highly promising and ideal alternative for producing energy in the form of methane. Use of J. curcas seeds has the potential to significantly bolster the biofuel sector, fostering a more sustainable circular economy. In the current study, different fractions of processed J. curcas seeds were investigated for biogas production. J. curcas seed pressed cake, a by-product of biodiesel production, was subjected to methanolic extraction. The remaining solids, referred to as methanolic residues, yielded more biogas in batch experiments than pressed cake and residues from aqueous and n-hexane extractions. The compounds extracted with methanol inhibited hydrolysis and reduced biogas production by 35.5% compared to the same setup without extracts. In continuous reactors fed with methanolic residues, the highest biogas yield occurred at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1 g VS L−1 day−1 and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days. The relative abundance of acetogenic bacteria was higher in reactors fed with methanolic residues than in those fed with seed pressed cake, seed oil, and whole seed. Jatropha seed oil and whole seed did not inhibit methanogens. A higher relative abundance of methanogenic communities was observed in all reactors at HRT of 20 days compared to those at HRTs at 15 and 10 days. These findings can be used to increase biogas production during anaerobic digestion of J. curcas seed components and suggests a zero-waste biorefinery production route for value added compounds derived from the removal of biogas-inhibiting components."
pub.1147871325,Use of hemicellulose-derived xylose for starch production by mixotrophic duckweed,"<p><strong>Background</strong>: Duckweeds are aquatic plants with considerable potential as substrates for environmentally sustainable production of bioenergy and protein because of extremely high starch and protein yield, and nutrient uptake capability from various wastewaters. D-xylose is a common sugar that exists on earth and the main sugar element of lignocellulosic hydrolysate. Efficient utilization of xylose is necessary to reduce the high cost of duckweed-based biofuel production. </p><p><strong>Results</strong>: In this study, the potential use of D-xylose by duckweed was tested for heterotrophy and mixotrophy. The results showed that duckweed was capable of mixotrophic growth but not heterotrophic growth on D-xylose, which suggested that photosynthesis was necessary for D-xylose metabolism, with increases in biomass yields of 2.8-fold compared with that of photoautotrophy. Furthermore, D-xylose markedly boosted starch accumulation up to 9.7 times higher than photoautotrophic duckweed, and promoted nutrient recovery efficiency. </p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The present study showed that mixotrophic duckweed could use inorganic and organic carbon simultaneously, offering an attractive strategy to enhance the duckweed biomass production with a higher carbon capture efficiency from the surrounding environment, thus boosting starch and protein productivity for bioenergy and food conversion. The method developed in this study demonstrated novel applications in duckweed biomass-based renewable bioenergy production with inorganic and organic carbon capture combined with potentially organic carbon wastewater and flue gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) treatment. This will enable the recycling of different carbons for various uses and realize a circular economy.</p>"
pub.1146203302,"Application of Decoupling Approach to Evaluate Electricity Consumption, Agriculture, GDP, Crude Oil Production, and CO2 Emission Nexus in Support of Economic Instrument in Nigeria","The paper appraised the nexus between electricity consumption, agriculture, GDP, oil production, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Nigeria using a decoupling approach. The result showed that agriculture, electricity, and GDP were predictive variables for CO2 emissions in the Granger causality analysis. The relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions also indicated that the amount of CO2 released tends to rise as the economy’s output and industrial sectors grow, making GDP and CO2 emissions increasingly relevant indicators as a driver of CO2 emissions. Modern agriculture is reliant on large-scale use of fossil fuels and fertilizer production, as well as GHG emissions from crop and livestock production. However, increasing per capita real production can help to enhance quality of the environment, and speed up the uptake of renewable energy which can consequently help to ameliorate global warming. As a result of this study’s policy implications, policies in the agricultural sector that could combat CO2 emissions, including deforestation, land clearing, fertilization with highly environmentally destructive chemicals, neglected integration of agroforestry, and social forestry practices, can help reduce CO2 emissions in the agricultural sector. In addition, the study recommends that the financial markets’ monetary policy should regulate the GDP to charges to compensate for their various sectors’ contributions to CO2 emissions. This investigation might help policymakers in Nigeria to define the CO2 emission monetary and fiscal strategies. In addition, more alternative energy sources such as biofuels, hydropower, solar energy, and other renewable resources should be embraced in Nigeria as sustainable substitutes for fossil fuels."
pub.1140382075,A two-stage stochastic model for co-firing biomass supply chain networks,"A sustainable alternative to fossil fuels is biomass. The design of cost-efficient biomass networks is necessary to compete with nonrenewable resources. The creation of integrated biomass supply chain (BSC) network design models and solution procedures can contribute to the achievement of this goal. In particular, the emerging bioenergy industry must take advantage of the economies of scale in transportation to minimize the final product’s cost. Hub-and-spoke networks have been proposed as a modeling approach to design large scale BSCs. The majority of these models are deterministic and do not consider the inherent variability in the biomass feedstock, such as physical and chemical properties that affect transportation, the effects of future climate on the biomass supply, overall cost, and production operations. Levels of ash and moisture are directly related to the quality of the feedstock, which negatively affects production of biofuels, increasing transportation and handling costs as well as the burden on the BSC’s efficiency. Varying weather affects biomass yield, which creates a fluctuation in the incoming supply into the network, creating a complex large scale Newsvendors Problem. In this paper, a stochastic hub-and-spoke network model and an efficient solution are proposed to minimize logistical costs by finding an optimal production and distribution network as well as optimal transportation while reducing computational burden by using metaheuristics, such as Simulated Annealing, when solving large NP-hard instances. The proposed solution procedure was compared to recent benchmark models, i.e. Bender’s Decomposition, yielding an overall solution difference of less than 7.71% and average reduction time difference of 91.4%. Case studies with several scenarios based on varying weather conditions were created using realistic data from the northeast region of the U.S."
pub.1023206201,"Comparative LCA of the use of biodiesel, diesel and gasoline for transportation","The energy fuels used for in the Greek transport sector are made up of gasoline consumed by automobiles, diesel oil consumed by taxis, trucks, maritime transport and railroads, and jet fuel used in the aircrafts. All these fuels are hydrocarbons that emit great amounts of CO2 which has a major impact in the global warming phenomenon. The issues relating to climate change, the soaring energy prices, and the uncertainty of future oil supplies, have created a strong interest in alternative transportation fuels. During the past decade biofuels in the form of blended gasoline and biodiesel have begun to find place in energy economy. The Greek car market shows a remarkably low rate in the penetration of biodiesel compared to the average European Union market. This work compares the environmental impacts of the use of gasoline, diesel and biodiesel in Greece using as a tool for the comparison the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The environmental impacts taken into consideration include: organic respiratory effects, inorganic respiratory effects, fossil fuels, acidification – eutrophication, greenhouse effect, ecotoxicity and carginogenic effects. From the environmental point of view, biodiesel appears attractive since its use results in significant reductions of GHG emissions in comparison to gasoline and diesel. It also has lower well-to-wheel emissions of methane. However, the use of biodiesel as transportation fuel increases emissions of PM10, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well as nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous; the latter are the main agents for eutrophication.This study can be considered as an opportunity for further research and evaluate the available options for a sustainable transportation system planning in Greece."
pub.1173427252,Recent advances in microalgal carbon capture and utilization (bio-CCU) process vis-à-vis conventional carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies,"The rise of the global mean temperature as a consequence of incessant anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, led by CO2, is one of the direst challenges faced by humankind today. The need of the hour is to minimize fossil fuel usage and capture the atmospheric CO2. Broadly, the CO2 mitigation strategies employ carbon capture and storage (CCS) and biological carbon capture and utilization (bio-CCU) technologies. A critical comparative summary of the prevalent CCS and bio-CCU methods has been presented in this study. Among all the CO2 capture technologies, the microalgal bio-CCU in a biorefinery model is more environment and economy-friendly. Microalgal biorefinery can potentially serve as a platform not only for bio-CCU but also for producing third-generation biofuels and commercially important value-added products as means of wealth generation from waste CO2. Alongside reducing the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, this approach also directly or indirectly addresses most of the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs). To enhance the microalgal CO2 capture efficiency and consequent biomass productivity, smart bioprocess design and reactor engineering performed by researchers are summarized to understand the progress in this direction. Recent advances, innovations, and existing challenges in the design and development of microalgal cultivation processes and systems, including CO2 delivery mechanisms, have been critically discussed and assessed in terms of carbon capture efficiency. The futuristic vision for the fourth-generation microalgal biorefinery-based bio-CCU has also been outlined to make some practical recommendations for its successful implementation or adaptation by the thermal power plants and cement industries."
pub.1112233844,Quantifying the global cropland footprint of the European Union’s non-food bioeconomy,"A rapidly growing share of global agricultural areas is devoted to the production of biomass for non-food purposes. The expanding non-food bioeconomy can have far-reaching social and ecological implications; yet, the non-food sector has attained little attention in land footprint studies. This paper provides the first assessment of the global cropland footprint of non-food products of the European Union (EU), a globally important region regarding its expanding bio-based economy. We apply a novel hybrid land flow accounting model, combining the biophysical trade model LANDFLOW with the multi-regional input–output model EXIOBASE. The developed hybrid approach improves the level of product and country detail, while comprehensively covering all global supply chains from agricultural production to final consumption, including highly processed products, such as many non-food products. The results highlight the EU's role as a major processing and the biggest consuming region of cropland-based non-food products, while at the same time relying heavily on imports. Two thirds of the cropland required to satisfy the EU's non-food biomass consumption are located in other world regions, particularly in China, the US and Indonesia, giving rise to potential impacts on distant ecosystems. With almost 39% in 2010, oilseeds used to produce for example biofuels, detergents and polymers represented the dominant share of the EU's non-food cropland demand. Traditional non-food biomass uses, such as fibre crops for textiles and animal hides and skins for leather products, also contributed notably (22%). Our findings suggest that if the EU Bioeconomy Strategy is to support global sustainable development, a detailed monitoring of land use displacement and spillover effects is decisive for targeted and effective EU policy making."
pub.1171590670,Sustainability implications of the EU's bioeconomy transition along global supply chains,"The EU has set ambiguous targets for the development of a bioeconomy (BE) that not only ensures sufficient production of high-quality foods but also contributes to decarbonization, green jobs and reducing import dependency through biofuels and bio-based chemical products. However, the various and complex interrelations between the BE, the natural environment as well as wider economy and society risk that the EU's targets might indirectly compromise achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) globally. Here, we assess the impacts of the EU's BE on the achievement of a broad range of SDG indicators using the hybrid econometric input-output model that covers 64 countries plus a region rest of world with 36 industries and 28 agricultural production sectors each. We compare the impacts of the EU's BE across three different scenarios based on SSP2 combined with corresponding IEA and FAO scenarios describing different futures of population and GDP growth, climate policy and structural changes in the energy and agriculture sector. Our results show that, especially without further measures focusing on the circular use of biomass, the EU's BE is likely not contributing to a general improvement in SDG indicators. Instead, there are major trade-offs between various SDGs. Firstly, between the goals of climate change mitigation, on the one hand, and preservation of ecosystems through the protection of natural land, especially forests, and water bodies on the other. The second major trade-off is between the EU's goals of fostering the economic competitiveness and lowering the import dependency of fossil energy and food security especially in low income countries outside Europe."
pub.1151613421,Innovative biorefineries for cleaner waste textile management towards circular economy: Techno-economic analysis,"The primary practices for waste textile management are landfill and incineration, generating serious environmental problems while they have a high potential for sustainable production of different green products. This study dealt with the economic analysis of bioethanol production and polyester recovery from waste textile through different scenarios. The pretreatment plays a key role in the biofuel production from waste textile and the most promising methods are pretreatment with NaOH, NaOH/urea, NaOH/thiourea, NaOH/urea/thiourea, and N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide, evaluated through scenarios 1 to 5, respectively. After pretreatment, the cotton part is enzymatically hydrolyzed and fermented through simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Detailed simulations of the processes were carried out by Aspen Plus, and economic studies were conducted by Aspen Process Economic Analyzer for each scenario. The bioethanol production price were 0.447, 0.524, 0.624, 0.618, and 1.244 $/L for scenarios 1 to 5. The total capital investments required for scenarios 1 to 5 were 38.54, 38.60, 38.42, 38.57, and 39.35 M$, respectively. The profitability index for scenarios 1 to 5 were 2.17, 1.92, 1.61, 1.34, and 1.51. Therefore, the biorefinery based on producing bioethanol from waste textile is economically feasible. Moreover, In scenario 1, the payout period was the minimum time of 3.56 year, and the net return rate was 117.16. Sensitivity analysis also reveals that the price of waste textile has a significant impact on the profitability of the designed biorefinery. Scenario 5 is the most sensitive to variations in waste textile price; a 100% increase in the cost of waste textile increases the cost of producing bioethanol to more than 1.45 $/L, respectively."
pub.1142736499,Between Heterochthonous Laissez-Faireism and Autochthonous Organic Farming: Africa’s Lazarus Global Food Security Challenges,"The globalisation of the world is not a thing that started like yesterday. It commenced with the advent of European explorers such as Christopher Columbus to the era of slave trading, colonialism, and neocolonialism. Africa is always at the receiving end when it comes to the issue of development due to intellectual and technological piracy. This is more pronounced when one examines the continent that was hitherto described as a forgetting enclave, but now is the last resort when it comes to arable land for the production of food for human consumption, for alternative energy (biofuel), and for animal feeds. Land grabbing is ongoing unabated due to the imposition of the Western version of globalisation and the supremacy of the forces of demand and supply. This has reduced the land to a commodity whose value and ownership are determined by the willing buyers and the willing sellers. This is contrary to the tenets of rent as the reward for land. This development has impacted negatively on the ownership of land in Africa with a special focus on indigenous peoples, women and girls, and the vulnerable in the rural areas who are the custodian of food security. This chapter intends to examine the crises of large-scale farming imposed on Africa and how the same impacted negatively on the health, financial, and general economic development. Hetetochthonous laissez-faireism is a harbinger of economic disarticulation as documented by many students of the African political economy. In trying to address this, the chapter adopts the transformative theory and relies on secondary data. The conclusion of the chapter recommends organic farming for sustainable development on the continent."
pub.1114900081,食料をめぐる国際情勢と日本農業・農政の展開方向,"Due to a smaller number of exporting countries and a larger number of importing countries in international food trade caused by continuous tariff reduction under the WTO (World Trade Organization) system, the recent grain prices are more responsive to changes in supply-demand balance. Moreover, the sense of insecurity becomes a cause of export restraint and raging grain speculation, thereby increasing grain price volatility. Food importing countries recognized after the recent world food crisis that each country should maintain a certain level of basic food production in its own country. However, since the current WTO rules have several unfair aspects favorable to exporting countries with large-scale farms, it would be difficult for Asian small-scale rice farming to survive under these rules. The rules focus on economic efficiency without considering external economies such as national security and environmental concerns. Furthermore, it is said that a total ban on export subsidies by the end of 2013 was agreed, but the pledge is very unlikely to be fulfilled because many “hidden” export subsidies are left out of this agreement. Therefore, Asian countries should aim jointly to incorporate more comprehensive rules for sustainable growth of Asian agriculture into the worldwide rules. In order to re-vitalize rice farming in Japan, we should allow producers' discretion in cropping and introduce inductively coordinated direct (deficiency) payments to rice by end use (direct consumption, rice powder, animal feed, and biofuel) and alternative crops (wheat and soybeans), based on calculated differences between a standard (or target) production cost and a standard selling price. In addition, direct payments based on agricultural multi-functionality should be expanded especially for small farmers in mountainous areas."

This includes municipal, industrial, biomedical, hazardous, and e-waste. Generation of solid waste is directly proportional to the size of economy and population. Management of waste is a responsibility of every human being living on this earth. Recent report of World Health Organization (WHO) states that about 25% diseases in developing countries are due to improper waste management, leading to environmental pollution and ultimately to diseases. Waste can be classified into five broad categories including solid, industrial, plastic, e-waste, and biomedical wastes. Policy guidelines at national and international level were drafted and implemented for management of wastes, environmental protection, and sustainable development. Converting waste into energy like biogas, biofuels, and novozymes (an enzyme-based solution that converts low-grade oils and cooking oils into biodiesel) is a smart approach. Another important aspect is the recyclability of certain products like plastics. Identification of one plastic polymer from another is very challenging and hence their recyclability. All the developing countries need to ratchet up the recyclability procedures. Further, the attitude of people needs to change drastically for waste generation, e.g., people being charged for the amount of food wasted by them, enforcing them to change their attitude. In addition to that, process like bioremediation is playing a significant role in environmental cleanup and to remove toxins. It is the emerging green technology of environment conservation which explores the potential of microbes for degradation of xenobiotic compounds as well as eradication, transformation, and infringement of various other contaminants."
pub.1090944841,Possibilities for conversion of microalgae oil into aviation fuel: A review,"The aviation sector relies on petroleum jet fuel because it is the most efficient energy carrier. Due to environmental and economic concerns a strong demand for alternative fuels is emerging. There is a need for diversification of energy sources from natural resources. These resources must be environmentally friendly and costs effective. Environmental impacts of fossil fuels on global warming and climate change are being a major concern today. Furthermore, the fluctuations of oil prices and need for sustainable fuel supply are the strong drivers for the economies of fuel users. In the aviation sector, Jet fuel from microalgae is one of the alternatives receiving considerable attention; it offers the potential to diversify energy sources. Microalgae species can produce lipids; they do not require high use of land, do not need freshwater, can grow in marine water or wastewater, grow faster in very short period of time, the produced oil is not a threat to food security. Similarly, the effect of climate change and global warming due to the generation of greenhouse gases (GHG) from petroleum jet fuel can be considerably reduced due to low carbon footprint generated by algae based fuels. Therefore, algae based aviation fuels can be considered as an alternative to produce an efficient fuel compared to conventional fuels. Conversely, the key challenge is: many algae species have lower lipid content. Harvesting and drying processes are costly as well as upstream processes to convert microalgae oil into Jet fuel. Although algae biofuels are still small players in the aviation industry, there is a potential for the future. This review analyses some routes to be explored or already explored, their strengths and weaknesses, the current trends and possible conceptual approaches to get aviation fuel from microalgae oil."
pub.1034889973,Forecast for the use of alternative fuels in aviation under environmental constraints and volatile market conditions,"In a context of volatility in the oil price and with the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, the sustainable growth of the aviation is conditioned by the environment, economy and technical efficiency. In order to overcome these issues, new alternative fuels and biofuels could be an alternative to established technologies. In this study, a dynamical competition model for aviation fuel substitution has been developed. Investment and market factors are modeled by the Lotka–Volterra dynamical system for the substitution of fossil by alternative fuels. The model calculates the dynamics of Jet A-1, gas-to-liquid (GtL)/coal-to-liquid (CtL) and biomass-to-liquid (BtL) market shares up to the year 2030. In particular, the model looks at the use of carbon capture sequestration for GtL/CtL and the indirect land use change for BtL. Three main scenarios (high/low environmental incentives and business as usual) based on input data provided by the partners of the FP7 Alfa-Bird Project (2012) consortium were developed in 2012, and according to these scenarios, alternative fuels appeared to be competitive in the near term. Current collapse in oil prices, however, removes one of the key drivers that supported alternative fuel development in recent years: energy scarcity and security concerns, and as a consequence, it delays in this way the competitiveness of alternative fuels with respect to Jet A-1. This has been quantified in the present paper, and the respective conclusions were drawn."
pub.1168972024,Carbon‐based Catalysts for Sustainable Chemical Processes,"The relevance of carbon materials in heterogeneous catalysis is described in terms of a combination of their texture and suitable surface chemistry, which are the most important features affecting their catalytic performance. The versatility of carbon materials is strictly related to their ability to be easily functionalized with heteroatoms such as S, N, O, P, or B, allowing control of their electronic properties. Various methods can be applied to oxidize carbon materials, including traditional treatments in the liquid or gas‐phase. The introduced oxygen or sulfur functional groups can act as active sites in various catalytic reactions, such as oxidation, reduction, dehydrogenation, dehydration, esterification, alkylation, acetalization, and acylation. On the other hand, nitrogen can be introduced into the carbon structure by treatments in ammonia flow at elevated temperatures or by a novel mechanothermal method, involving ball milling of the material with melamine, and final thermal treatment. The basic carbon materials can be successfully applied to environmental protection by eliminating organic pollutants from water and wastewaters through advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Catalytic conversion of biomass and biomass waste into chemicals and fuels is gaining increasing interest in the pursuit of implementing a circular economy. The main biomass components such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin can be easily converted into platform molecules, biofuels, and fine chemicals, substituting fossil‐fuel‐derived commodities. Biomass can also be converted to carbon products, including activated carbons, hydrochars or biochars, which can later be applied as catalysts in various biomass valorization reactions, such as transesterification of glycerol or cellulose hydrolysis. Bifunctional carbon‐based catalysts containing metal nanoparticles exhibit excellent performance in cascade conversion of cellulose or cellobiose to high‐value‐added chemicals, such as gluconic acid, sorbitol, ethylene glycol, and other platform chemicals."

The aim of this paper is to assess the role of biomass usage in the context of these targets. The paper identifies progress made between 2013–2022 by focusing on a selection of EU countries. The largest bioenergy increments of 130PJ, 77PJ and 60PJ were reported for Poland, Sweden, and the Netherlands. This study valuates the crucial role in co-generation and heat in EU regions, with biomass usage between 55-80% of the combined heat and power (CHP) energy in Nordic countries. The future perspectives for bioenergy based on EU policies, biomass resources and technical issues were addressed. The EU possess around 9% of the global biomass supply, ensuring a certain level of biomass resource dependence. Thus, the biomass usage demand in energy production, non-energy sectors and transport is expected to rise leading to increments of 13%-76% on biomass imports. It appears that bioenergy development is mostly limited by economic issues and uneven support for bioenergy in different EU countries as well as environmental issues. The study shows a promising and sustainable potential of bioenergy in the EU as a renewable energy source while minimizing negative impacts on the environment and the economy. By 2050, liquid biofuels are likely to be increasingly used in the transport sector. Non-energy sector usage of biomass is still in an early stage of development, except for the pulp and paper industry, and significant use of biomass in non-energy sectors seems unlikely in the near future."
pub.1150099104,Current Challenge and Innovative Progress for Producing HVO and FAME Biodiesel Fuels and Their Applications,"Current petroleum issues, quickly raising its costs and uncertainties regarding petroleum fuels availability endanger the renewable and sustainable challenge of the worldwide economy. Both the ecological consideration and availableness of fuels highly impact fuel directions for transport vehicles. The current paper introduces the Prospects for producing hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) biodiesel fuels and their applications. The potential of raw material supply for the production biodiesel in Russia was examined, including sunflower oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, tall oil, and used cooking oil. Additionally, an economic evaluation of biodiesel production in Russia was performed. Likewise, Russia has launched the process of developing low-carbon strategies for the energy transition, but the country is placing more emphasis on the electrification and gasification of transport. The results reported that HVO is a promising low-carbon component of biological nature than FAME, according to it has a high calorific value, and great chemical stability. Furthermore, the results indicated that the most promising feedstock for biodiesel production in Russia is rapeseed oil, as rapeseed retains a higher yield growth potential. Finally, the most preferable option is the hydroprocessing of oils in a separate unit with a capacity of 500,000 tons/year for oil. Large capacity is probably redundant given the limited resources of advanced raw materials up to 100–150,000 tons of waste oils and up to 150–200,000 tons of tall oils.Graphical abstract"

The major findings of the study are: 1) the major strength of the Finnish bio-coal sector is its secured biomass supply, higher environmental credentials, and supportive policies. The clear implication here is that the entrance requirement for the bio-coal business is relatively low, “early birds” with foresight will win out; 2) the current weakness of Finnish bio-coal development is undeniable. As an entirely new business, bio-coal does not have a clear development model, which can be attributed to the little market information available, non-viable economic structure, and distribution channels which are not yet available. We would like to advise Finnish companies to work out the cost structure, profit feasibility of the bio-coal business and construct a practicable and sustainable biomass supply system; 3) the opportunities of the Finnish bio-coal sector come along with the national sustainability development policies and construction of a bio-economy. We would suggest that they focus on decentralised local economic sales, biomass supply and energy end use; 4) the crucial threat to the bio-coal sector industry comes from competition with fossil coal and other wood-based biofuels. Improving its competitiveness requires cooperation and integration along the whole supply chain."

This study aims to optimize and simplify the decision-making processes for the valorization of marine wastes (natural and from aquaculture) as secondary raw materials to produce high-value-added market goods. However, significant concentrations of pollutants may be present within wastes, compromising overall quality, and social dynamics can hinder their usage further. Goro’s lagoon was chosen as a case study, where the relations between the ecosystem services, a thriving bivalve economy, and social dynamics are deeply rooted and intertwined. Therefore, in the manuscript cost–benefit and foresight analyses are conducted to determine the best usage for algal biomass considering pollution, social acceptance, and profitability. These analyses are virtually conducted on bio-refineries that could be operating in the case study’s area: briefly, for a thirty-year running bio-plant, the CBA indicates the two best alternatives with an income of 5 billion euros (NPV, with a 5% discount rate) for a biofuel-only production facility, and a half for a multiproduct one, leading to the conclusion that the first is the best alternative. The foresight, instead, suggests a more cautious approach by considering external factors such as the environment and local inhabitants. Hence, the main innovation of this work consists of the decision-maker’s holistic enlightenment toward the complexities and the hidden threats bound to this kind of closed-loop efficiency-boosting process, which eventually leads to optimized decision-making processes."
pub.1166420104,Piloting Bioethanol Production from Source-Separated Food Waste Boosts Technology Readiness,"By the end of 2023, biowaste must be completely separated or recycled at source, based on EU legislation. Separate biowaste collection and valorisation for biofuels could play an essential role in the biobased circular economy. In this context, the principal goal of this paper was to demonstrate on a pilot scale the technological solution of bioethanol production via the utilisation of urban source-separated biowaste within the city context of Athens, Greece. More specifically, the main aim was the demonstration of a pilot system for more than 10 consecutive operating cycles with real feedstock—wet; separately collected biowaste. From the 11 pilot trials performed with wet feedstock, the mean starch and cellulose degradation of the pilot trials amounted to 80.69 ± 16.27% and 79.41 ± 10.37%, respectively, while the bioethanol yield was 74.05 ± 6.82%. The latter was comparable to that of more intensive pretreatment methods. Homogenization and shredding, which were applied in this study, stand as promising pretreatment methods for bioethanol production from wet feedstock. Further research is needed to optimize conditions and evaluate scalability. Nevertheless, pilot-scale testing is a crucial step in the deployment of this technology since it serves as a bridge between laboratory research and full-scale implementation, offering a practical and controlled environment to validate and optimize the technology while minimizing risks and uncertainties. Conclusively, this study could stand as a flagship case study for the implementation of circular and sustainable approaches in the management of organic fractions of source-separated municipal waste, showcasing the technical feasibility of the whole value chain from waste collection to final bioethanol product recovery."
pub.1135323682,Influence of lignin level of raw material on anaerobic digestion process in reorganization and performance of microbial community,"Huge quantum of agricultural crop residue from agrarian economies like India is disposed of improperly by open land burning contributing to particulate and gaseous pollutants thereby severely impacting the environment and human health. There is an overwhelming need for sustainable utilization of this misplaced resource as feedstock in biofuel production through anaerobic digestion. Substrate composition influences the digestibility of the substrate and underlying microbial plasticity involved in anaerobic digestion. In this study, anaerobic inoculum was subjected to enrichment in the presence of agricultural residues with different lignin content whose influence on biogas production, and differential modulation/ reorganization of microbial communities was explored. BMP assay emphasized the inverse proportionality between lignin content and biogas yield, with highest biogas yield of 622 mL/g VS added in case of rice straw (lowest lignin, 16.9%), followed by wheat straw—556 mL/g VS (18.12% lignin), sugar cane leaves—451 mL/g VS (21.87% lignin), and lowest biogas yield of 411 mL/g VS added in case of cotton crop waste (highest lignin, 23.97%). Biogas production efficiency was correlated with the selection and shift of microbial communities to key hemicellulolytic (Bacteroides, Clostridium, Prevotella, Thermotoga, Cytophaga) and lignocellulolytic (Bacillus, Geobacter, Flavobacterium, Spirochaeta, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia) genotypes in comparison to initial anaerobic inoculum. Study highlighted that the variable lignin content resulted in genomic reorganization and created a scenario for high biogas production by selectively enriching different methanogenic pathways such as hydrogenotrophic pathways in rice straw metagenome (lowest lignin) and acetoclastic pathways in cotton crop waste metagenome (highest lignin)."
pub.1030166050,Organization of straw‐to‐energy systems in Ukraine and Scandinavia,"Abstract Ukraine (UA) faces broad needs for energy security enhancement, energy diversification, revitalization of agriculture, and improvements in the state of the environment. UA has large biomass‐for‐bioenergy potential, which can be leveraged to contribute to local/regional energy self‐sufficiency, rural development and diversification, and environmental improvement via fossil fuel substitution with local and more sustainable biofuels. However, the manner in which biomass energy utilization is emerging is poorly documented and its organizational basis is not well understood. This work focuses on bioenergy from agricultural waste as an early emergent area. It applies cross‐case analysis to nine straw‐fired installations in UA. Analysis yields three straw‐based frameworks for organization and action, including small‐scale local heat production, small‐scale local straw production for municipal fuel provision, and medium‐scale straw combustion for district heating (DH). The UA context is then compared to more advanced agro‐bioenergy sectors in Sweden (SE) and Denmark (DK) to delineate crucial factors for the growth of UA's embryonic sector. The study finds that evolution of individual business entrepreneurship qualities and knowledge dissemination are key parameters to move the sector forward at small to medium scale, while stable and targeted incentive based systems, national government support, and collective bioenergy stakeholder action are required for advance to medium and large scales. Barriers to the expansion of bioenergy in UA include low access to technology and funding, and a lack of knowledge on bioenergy funding schemes, and bioenergy in general. The outcomes of the paper are principally transferable to other transition economies (EiTs). © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"
pub.1166355036,Biochemical Approach for Transformation of Agricultural Waste to Bioenergy and Other Value-Added Products Through the Bioelectrochemical System,"Agricultural industries are the largest waste producer that comprises a major problem worldwide due to the adverse effect of agro-waste on the environment, economy, and social life. Annually 1300 million tons of trash are produced from the agricultural fields, out of which up to 50% are raw materials dumped without treatment. Therefore, minimising agricultural solid waste is imperative to combat its detrimental effects on the health of humans and other animals. Furthermore, agro-waste contains different bioactive compounds such as lignin, cellulose, chitin, and polyphenolic compounds; therefore, it can be envisaged as a potential source for producing biofertiliser, biofuel, biogas, enzymes, vitamins, antioxidants, and other value-added products. Additionally, utilising agro-waste as a raw material diminishes production costs and provides the scope of additional revenue for the reliant industries. Also, the synchronised recovery of renewable energy and wastewater treatment through bioelectrochemical systems (BES) utilising agro-waste products as feedstock demonstrates a waste biorefinery approach leading towards a sustainable circular bioeconomy. Therefore, this chapter elucidates the application of different agro-waste products in the field of BES and their effects on bioenergy production and other value-added product recoveries. Moreover, this chapter aims to enlighten the readers on the advancements in biochemical processes for agro-waste remediation and biochemical conversion technologies to recover valuable biochemicals. In addition, different roadblocks associated with biochemical conversion technologies, considering recommendations and future perspectives, are also highlighted. Additionally, recent developments in potential imminent research areas of agro-waste-assisted BES have also been covered to make this nascent technology ready for large-scale implementation."
pub.1152384741,A solar-rechargeable bio-photoelectrochemical system based on carbon tracking strategy for enhancement of glucose electrometabolism,"Establishing a green power system to achieve reasonable and high-efficiency renewable energy utilization is undoubtedly a large engine to promote the development of sustainable socio-economy. In this context, an ingenious carbon tracking strategy was proposed to enhance glucose electrometabolism by developing a solar-rechargeable bio-photoelectrochemical system (BPECS). The prototype of this BPECS is a glucose/O2 photo-biofuel cell (PBFC) that contains a Prussian blue/glucose oxidase (PB/GOD) biocathode and a Mo-doped bismuth vanadate (Mo:BiVO4) photoanode. Benefiting from the specific electrooxidation selectivity of Mo:BiVO4 towards gluconic acid, namely the by-product of biocathode, the carbon track from glucose (C6H12O6) to gluconic acid (C6H12O7) and then to arabinose (C5H10O5) can be achieved in one-chambered PBFC. Under light illumination, this PBFC obtained an open circuit voltage of 0.52 ± 0.01 V and a maximum output power density of 98.11 ± 2.26 μW cm−2. Furthermore, in response to the intermittent nature of sunlight, a polypyrrole (PPy) capacitor electrode, as energy storage module, was integrated into PBFC to assemble the solar-rechargeable BPECS. Through bio-discharge (biocathode-PPy) and photo-charge (PPy-photoanode) of BPECS, the carbon track is divided into two-step electrometabolism process, which effectively avoids the deficiency of traditional cascade kinetics. Meanwhile, consecutive electricity output can be obtained from BPECS whether day or night. Based on the proposed carbon tracking strategy, this developed solar-rechargeable BPECS not only enhances glucose electrometabolism, but also achieves reasonable utilization of sunlight, which provides a judicious research model for high-efficiency renewable energy exploitation."
pub.1136414166,Scale up study of a thermophilic trickle bed reactor performing syngas biomethanation,"Biomethane constitutes an important biofuel for the transition towards a biobased circular economy with a sustainable energy sector. An environmentally friendly pathway for its production is through the gasification of 2nd generation biomass that generates syngas (H2, CO, and CO2), followed by syngas biomethanation. A novel design thermophilic trickle bed bioreactor was successfully tested at semi-pilot scale. It was operated continuously performing biomethanation of an artificial syngas mixture (45% H2, 20% CO, 25% CO2 and 10% N2). Its effectiveness was compared to a primitive design lab scale trickle bed reactor with a 28 times lower bed volume under identical operating conditions. At an empty bed residence time of 0.6 h, the novel semi-pilot scale trickle bed reactor converted 100% and 98% of the influent H2 and CO, respectively and produced CH4 at a rate of 10.6 ± 0.2 mmol·lbed −1·h−1, whereas the lab scale reactor converted 89% of the H2 and 73% of the CO and achieved a CH4 productivity of 8.5 mmol·lbed −1·h−1. The maximum CH4 productivity achieved in the semi-pilot scale reactor was 17.6 ± 0.6 mmol·lbed −1·h−1 at an empty bed residence time of 0.33 h with a 99.2 ± 0.1% product selectivity. Furthermore, the semi-pilot scale reactor was connected in series with a fluidized bed gasifier fed with wood pellets to assess the biomethanation potential of the system when supplied with real syngas. The obtained results showed no process inhibition in the semi-pilot scale reactor, which accomplished 100% H2 conversion efficiency and 92.4 ± 0.6% CO conversion efficiency at an empty bed residence time of 0.6 h."
pub.1127250435,Saline Soil Reclamation Index as an efficient tool for assessing restoration progress of saline land,"Abstract  Restoration of degraded land is imperative for addressing climate change, deriving additional benefits such as biomass and biofuel for supporting a biobased economy and also for meeting various targets of the Bonn Challenge and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN‐SDGs). In this context, the present research aimed to evaluate the performance of mixed biomass plantations on the saline land of western India over a period of 4 years. The impact of plantations on soil quality over the study period (2015–2018) was analysed by the Saline Soil Reclamation Index (SSRI), developed through principal component analysis. The study found a strong correlation between plant growth attributes and soil quality ( p < .01). Soil porosity, texture, pH balance, electrical conductivity (EC), available potassium (AK) and available nitrogen (AN) levels are found to be the key indicators regulating the plant growth. The EC, AK and AN levels were seen to change significantly during the initial stage (2014) from 25 dS m −1 , 10 mg kg −1 and 23 mg kg −1 to 1 dS m −1 , 24 mg kg −1 and 39 mg kg −1 , respectively, towards the end of the study period (2018). Among the various test plants, six species ( Albizia lebbeck, Casuarina equisetifolia, Cordia dichotoma, Pithecellobium dulce, Pongamia pinnata, Terminalia arjuna ) were found with high SSRI (>0.50); while the rest displayed moderate SSRI (0.30–0.49), except for Azadirachta indica , which shown low SSRI (<0.30). The trees having high SSRI are most suitable for the reclamation of saline soil and therefore, SSRI can be used as a tool for assessing the progress of saline land restoration. "
pub.1123535881,European legislation and incentives programmes for demand Side management,"Energy is now intrinsically linked to technological development, given it powers all such systems. The use of fossil fuels to supply the required energy is causing global environmental and health issues and is impacting on all life forms on the planet. Given increasing energy consumption, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are consequentially increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to replace fossil fuels with renewable energies, biofuels and eco materials and related technologies and to try and find a way to develop sustainable zero emission solutions for all areas including constructions, transport and water resources. A critical and evolutionary way of thinking about the energy (and other resources) demand, management and supply is necessary because there are clear concerns about irreversible impacts to the world and a scarcity of the resources as well. Energy supplies should be mostly or entirely through renewable resources and highly efficient technologies put in place to achieve solution such as nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB). At the same time, all the energy and resource use processes should be optimised in order to maximise the benefits, reduce the costs and promote stakeholders (consumers, companies or governments) network, toward a circular economy. This could be the way to supply the demand without increasing the scarcity of the resources and to simultaneously achieve environmental benefits. Therefore, it should be possible to improve productivity with the same amount of resources, by e.g. maximising the potential of smart grids and heuristically develop solutions with stakeholders. The concept of Demand Side Management (DSM) emerged after the energy crisis and it employs solutions such as reducing the daily peak load. At the same time, creating an educational grid is important to change the established paradigms, in order to promote critical thinking about the wasted resources and thinking holistically about overall consumption. This paradigm shift is changing the market, making it more competitive and reducing inefficiency by promoting the efficient use of resources including the deployment of energy storage during the periods of low consumption in daily peak shift. All these issues present a new way of thinking in the path towards sustainability, maximising the circular economy and reducing environmental impacts, making connections and using the Internet of Things to provide more information to all stakeholders. All these changes in social behaviour are related to the rational use of resources and make it easier to improve the existing infrastructures instead of building new ones. This paper analyses the state of the art at the European level in the production and use of renewable resources. A survey and analysis of the incentives to consumers and the policies to encourage the circular economy, and parallel analysis of benefits and drawbacks, was made. It is intended to identify the main forms of intervention and improvement"
pub.1146292474,Global Perspective and Challenges in Utilization of Bioenergy Crops for Phytoremediation,"Environmental pollution and energy crisis are the two important concerns the world is facing today and both these issues need an immediate resolution. Several conventional remediation techniques have been practiced from time to time to mitigate environmental pollution, but are costly and negatively affects the ecosystem stability. However, the only strategy which is cost-effective as well as eco-friendly is phytoremediation. Employing energy crops as phytoremediation agents offers a valid answer for the issue of energy crisis as well as pollution. The biomass of energy crop harvested after the decontamination process can be successfully utilized for the production of renewable energy. Another striking attribute is the role of energy crops in maintaining carbon economy of the soil by efficiently sequestering them and thereby mitigating climate changes to a great extent. Even though energy crops are excellent candidates for phytoremediation and are a source of energy, there exist some challenges which are yet to be resolved. These include the presence of contaminants in biofuels, decreased biomass yield, changing land use pattern and proper implementation of the technique. If these concerns are met, in the future, energy crops will influence our economy in the form of energy sources as well as increased productivity of other food crops as the soil quality will be enhanced through decontamination of pollutants. Environmental pollution and energy crisis are the two important concerns the world is facing today and both these issues need an immediate resolution. Environmental remediation of toxic compounds adversely affects the ecosystem structure and function. Removal of contaminants from soil, air and water in a sustainable manner is crucial for the existence of biodiversity. The high biomass yield and non-food utilization of bioenergy crops make it to be the best candidate for phytoremediation of contaminated soil. Energy crops utilized for the production of second-generation bioethanol comprise primarily perennials. Energy production from renewable energy sources such as biomass will play a major role in mitigation of climate change effects by reducing the release of CO2. The perennial crops are highly successful in carbon sequestration due to the long time survival and constant biomass production, thereby enhancing the residual matter."
pub.1008699036,"Europe's resource use: Basic trends, global and sectoral patterns and environmental and socioeconomic impacts","This chapter will provide an overview and international comparison of global material resource and land use of the European Union. The current level and composition of total material consumption of industrial economies can hardly serve as a model for worldwide adoption, as this would lead to an increase of global resource extraction by a factor of 2 to 5. Nevertheless, the good news is that a decoupling of economic growth and material and resource use is already under way. There is, however, no reason to expect an automatic absolute decline of resource consumption. On the contrary, stabilisation at a high level seems probable and the rapid increase of resource requirements in countries such as China indicates the need for enhanced decoupling. Our analysis reveals that resource requirements of industrial regions such as the EU are being increasingly supplied from other regions, and in particular from developing countries which have to carry a growing burden of resource extraction and refining. We will have a closer look at the case study of the platinum group of metals (PGM). The ‘green polluter’ provides an excellent example of how environmental policy and technology can contribute to problem shifting; and of how future technological development, such as the widespread introduction of fuel cells, will be faced with severe scarcity problems, should the efficiency of material use not be drastically increased. The case of biofuels then shows that these may turn out to be risky renewables. The growing demand for non-food biomass will lead to global expansion of cropland at the expense of natural ecosystems, with impacts on biodiversity and higher risk of climate change. Again, alternative and more efficient use of biomass and mineral resources may lead the way towards more sustainable resource use. Building the bridge to economic actors we analyse and compare ndustries and product groups. Only a few are associated with the major share of the economy's resource requirements as well as with environmental pressures such as global warming. These sectors also perform below average with regard to socioeconomic indicators such as employment. Our results show that dematerialisation in terms of resource productivity gains could contribute to resource as well as climate protection while improving socioeconomic development."
pub.1175446852,"From Domestic Sewage Sludge to Clean Energy, Useful Resources, Zero Waste and Circular Economy Approach","Sewage sludges are typically composed of non-toxic and biodegradable organic compounds mixed with a small percentage of non-toxic and toxic inorganic compounds with very low biodegradability. The large proportion of biodegradable matter forms an important pool of green/clean energy that can be used in industrial and domestic applications. The production of energy from sewage sludge can be used to supply energy to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as it is well known that 40–60% of the operating costs are related to energy usage. The WWTP autonomy can be increased using energy recovery from sewage sludge incineration by 60% for electricity and 100% for thermal energy. However, energy for sewage sludge drying exceeds energy recovery unless solar drying is performed. There are numerous sludge-management options in which energy generation (heat, electricity, or biofuel) is a key treatment step. The most important options are anaerobic digestion, co-digestion, incineration with energy recovery, co-incineration in coal-fired power plants, co-incineration with organic waste focused on energy recovery, use as an energy source in the production of cement or building materials, pyrolysis, gasification, thermoliquefaction, supercritical (wet) oxidation, high-temperature hydrolysis, production of hydrogen, acetone, butanol, or ethanol, and direct generation. Sewage sludge can be considered a renewable energy source, and its incineration generates substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than energy generation from fossil fuels. For the same amount of energy, sewage sludge emits 58% fewer emissions than natural gas and 80% less than hard coal and fuel oil. The energy efficiency of these processes strongly depends upon the dewatering and drying steps. It is expected that these applications will strongly increase in the future. Supercritical wet oxidation is a promising innovative technology that is still in development. With the exception of biogas production, the other biological methods to produce energy are still in the initial research phase. Production of biogas from sewage sludge is already applied worldwide on small, medium, and large scales. This study aims to analyze and assess the possibility of producing energy out of sewage sludge in a sustainable way adhering to the circular economy concept and fulfilling the zero waste approach for a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The study will also suggest ways to prevent waste from remaining after energy production."
pub.1023598689,An Institutional Framework for a More Efficient Use of Natural Resources,"The importance of natural resources is recognized by its constitutional protection. A strategy to lower the impact of availability and cost of materials will have positive externalities, lessening exporting jobs abroad. A robust policy framework will improve eco‐efficient resource use and promote sustainable production and consumption. An Institutional Framework for Resource Management incorporating an international panel, would help to decouple natural resources use from its environmental impacts, monitor global material and energy flows balance and guide the design of policies and measures. Additionally, it would coordinate constituencies and generate information and knowledge, within the framework of existing environmental institutionalism. Humans change ecosystems to meet their respective needs. Their unfathomable ingenuity and drive needs a strong legal framework to provide order and deter predatory free market practices, thus limiting environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources throughout the global economy. The world economy is based on abundant fossil fuels reserves, and their use as fuels to supply energy and transport have the undesirable side‐effects of air pollution and global warming. Energy consumption is likely to expand with economic growth and prosperity; ‘business as usual’ needs to be checked with innovation playing a crucial role in reducing CO2 emissions and creating alternatives to satisfy societal needs, but also in devising new laws. Market enthusiasm alone without strong guidance could lead to disorder, like the optimistic biofuels boom, compared with a more organized and orderly evolution provided by laws such as the German feed‐in law or Danish container law. Better organization based on a robust legal framework, innovation, information and incentives, within a market context, will create conditions to develop core competences and attitudes for achieving efficiency. Incentives, economic and fiscal, will help counterbalance the increasing importance of gas and coal and promote life cycle thinking, ecoefficiency and ecoplanning of cities. While the paper gives an overview of these aspects, the main thesis of this paper is as follows: Raw materials supply could be secured by forging strategic alliances with reserve rich stable countries like Peru with 12 metals exhibiting 10 decades of constant growth. Methodologically, this paper follows the New Institutional Economics. The paper outlines a few suggestions for an international institutional arrangement. It is neither an ex‐post analysis of international regimes nor does it contain a modelling of players involved."
pub.1162693281,Invasivorism as a Sustainable Strategy to Confront Animal and Resource Exploitation,"Through hunting, overfishing, and farming, the human appetite drives plant and animal species to extinction. At the same time, human-introduced species are invading and deteriorating ecosystems throughout the world, with negative impacts on human health, livelihoods, and economies. Behind “invasivorism” is the premise that we could use our insatiable appetite for good by redirecting it toward these invasive alien species (IAS). A review of existing research, while limited, suggests that a carefully implemented and monitored invasivorist program could serve as an effective tool for IAS management. International legal instruments are well-poised to assist the implementation of invasivorist programs and facilitate the safe trade in IAS food products. However, the context-specific nature of IAS management constrains their utility, requiring examination of local regulatory contexts. A comparative overview of the regulatory systems of the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) as they pertain to invasivorism reveals defects in the US’s environmental and food safety regimes that impede the successful implementation of a large-scale invasivorist project. But despite the absence of these regulatory hurdles in EU legislation, the current lack of implemented invasivorist projects thwarts any assessment of their potential success. Ultimately, this emerging area of research and policy will require the collaboration of a variety of experts to study all sides of the issue. Through hunting, overfishing, and farming, the human appetite drives plant and animal species to extinction. At the same time, human-introduced species are invading and deteriorating ecosystems throughout the world, with negative impacts on human health, livelihoods, and economies. Behind “invasivorism” is the premise that we could use our insatiable appetite for good by redirecting it toward these invasive alien species (IAS). The scope of this chapter is limited to efforts promoting the consumption of invasive animal species, due to the greater potential to displace environmentally harmful forms of meat production. However, further research should examine strategies that could promote the harvest of invasive edible plant species like kudzu, “the vine that ate the south,” as well as those promoting harvest of IAS for purposes other than food, such as for fertilizer or biofuel. The US and EU are compared as examples of regulatory landscapes that are less and more compatible, respectively, with an effective invasivorist strategy."
pub.1158083212,Green New Deal Agendas: System Change versus Continuity,"As a popular slogan, ‘System Change Not Climate Change’ highlights the political-economic system which drives climate change, other environmental harms and social injustices. Global elites have evaded the systemic causes through deceptive techno-optimistic climate fixes, encouraging a passive public to accept or await them. As exemplified by carbon trading, market-type instruments are meant to incentivize technological innovation which will supposedly decarbonize or replace high-carbon systems. This neoliberal techno-market framework has analogies in other deceptive environmental fixes, which have provoked public controversy. Using this opportunity, various critics have opposed false solutions and counterposed low-carbon, resource-light, socially just alternatives. However, an effective social agency to implement them has remained elusive. By default, alternatives have often remained as futile appeals to hypothetical planners or as supplements to harmful high-carbon systems. Towards system change beyond climate fixes, this book presents a big picture of transformative mobilizations. To build a common future vision, frame-bridging has helped to align disparate frames of groups opposing false solutions. For an effective social agency, transformative mobilizations combine five main elements: counter-publics, frame alignments, eco-localization agendas, grassroots innovation and solidaristic commoning. Such efforts could help fulfil the demand for ‘System Change Not Climate Change’. The potential is illustrated here through several controversies: GM crops, biofuels, waste incineration and Green New Deal agendas. Political elites have been evading the causes of climate change through deceptive fixes. Their market-type instruments such as carbon trading aim to incentivise technological innovation which will supposedly decarbonize or replace dominant high-carbon systems. In practice this techno-market framework has perpetuated climate change and social injustices, thus provoking public controversy. Using this opportunity, social movements have counterposed low-carbon, resource-light, socially just alternatives. Such transformative mobilisations can fulfil the popular slogan, ‘System Change Not Climate Change’. This book develops key critical concepts through case studies such as GM crops, biofuels, waste incineration and Green New Deal agendas. Les Levidow argues that the current strategies for climate change mitigation perpetuate environmental harm, and offers alternative policies for real system change. In recent years, Green New Deal (GND) agendas have gained significant support for a transition to an environmentally sustainable, low-carbon, socially fairer economy. In the 2019 US and UK versions, endorsed by some public-sector trade unions, the GND sought to achieve a net-zero carbon by 2030, localize production-consumption circuits and reduce resource burdens. Proponents envisaged greater socio-economic equity by mean such as expanding public goods "
pub.1116098879,グリーンニューディールの構築 : 合衆国の場合,"The U. S. economy will need to undertake a major transition of its entire energy infrastructure in order to raise the living standard of U. S. residents over the next generation. The U. S. energy transformation will entail three major projects: 1. Investments to raise energy efficiency in buildings, industry and transportation, such that overall energy consumption in the United States falls by about 30 percent from its current level of about 95 quads to about 65 quads. We will need to reach this efficiency standard while also providing for the expansion of good job opportunities and rising average incomes. As we have seen, the proposal described here is able to achieve the necessary cuts in emissions while also expanding job opportunities. 2. Investments in clean renewable energy sources- including wind, solar, geothermal and clean biofuels. Clean renewable sources will need to supply about 15 quads of the total 65 quads needed to power the U. S. economy. 3. Delivering around 50 quads of total energy through operating the U. S. economy's existing capacity of oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power supplies. The challenge here will be to determine how best to manage the excess capacity with non-renewable energy sources that will result when total U. S. energy consumption falls from 95 to 65 quads, with 15 quads being supplied by clean renewables. As I have discussed above, crucial considerations here include emission levels, other environmental impacts, job creation, public safety, minimizing oil imports, and the social impacts on communities of traditional energy industries facing decline. This transition to a clean energy economy will be greatly bolstered by two basic sets of findings presented in the last two sections of this paper. The first is that the transition to a clean energy economy will be a major new engine of job creation. As we have seen, investments in clean energy generates about 3 times more jobs than spending within the fossil fuel sector. As such, if the U. S. spends about $110 billion a year on investments in efficiency and expanding capacity of clean renewables, and that level of investments is exactly matched by declines in fossil fuel spending, the net effect will be to increase overall U. S. employment by 1.2 million jobs. Finally, we have seen there is no research which shows any significant negative effect on GDP growth of policies that would limit the supply of fossil fuels. Even the opponents of cap-and-trade legislation found through their modeling exercises that the impact of such measures on GDP growth will be negligible. This finding does not suggest that maintaining a high GDP growth rate should be, in itself, the foundation for raising U. S. living standards. But it does suggest that we can achieve two cornerstones of a higher living standard-good jobs and a sustainable environment-without having to also be focused on the consequences for living standards of a declining GDP growth rate. Overall then, what emerg"
pub.1153444370,Microbial Production of Terpenes,"Sustainability is one of the main challenges facing humankind in the twenty-first century due to the continuous increase in the demand for energy and resources that characterizes our current industrial activity, driven in part by exponential population growth. This problem can be tackled from different strategies and among them the search for biomolecules, either recovered through processes based on the circular economy or through synthetic biology, are highly promising. In this sense, terpenes, the largest family of secondary metabolites in the plant kingdom, have attracted much of the research in recent decades in pursuit of alternative, more ecological, and sustainable ways for their obtention. The reasons for this interest are due to their extensive structural diversity and the possibility of gaining new functionalities, simply by chemical modification, which also makes them excellent candidates in areas such as biomaterials and pharmaceuticals. But also, the fact that the natural biosynthetic pathways of terpenes are well known from the point of view of metabolites and enzymes facilitates their industrial production using genetically modified microorganisms.This chapter aims to give the reader a broad but at the same time comprehensive view of the production of microbial terpenes in a sustainability context. Starting by the circumstances that lead to the need to look for renewable sources of biomolecules and following by why terpenes represent a very promising opportunity even if only their characteristics from a chemical and bioactivity point of view were considered. Finally, it will be discussed which microorganisms can produce these unique lipids and how, the main option followed nowadays is using synthetic biology strategies, involving modified organisms that are already being used on an industrial scale for applications ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals."
pub.1033310810,Effects of first‐ and second‐generation bioenergy crops on soil processes and legacy effects on a subsequent crop,"Abstract  To develop a more sustainable bio‐based economy, an increasing amount of carbon for industrial applications and biofuel will be obtained from bioenergy crops. This may result in intensified land use and potential conflicts with other ecosystem services provided by soil, such as control of greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration, and nutrient dynamics. A growing number of studies examine how bioenergy crops influence carbon and nitrogen cycling. Few studies, however, have combined such assessments with analysing both the immediate effects on the provisioning of soil ecosystem services as well as the legacy effects for subsequent crops in the rotation. Here, we present results from field and laboratory experiments on effects of a standard first‐generation bioenergy crop (maize) and three different second‐generation bioenergy crops (willow short rotation coppice ( SRC ), Miscanthus × giganteus , switchgrass) on key soil quality parameters: soil structure, organic matter, biodiversity and growth and disease susceptibility of a major follow‐up crop, wheat (Triticum aestivum) . We analysed a 6‐year field experiment and show that willow SRC , Miscanthus, and maize maintained a high yield over this period. Soil quality parameters and legacy effects of Miscanthus and switchgrass were similar or performed worse than maize. In contrast, willow SRC enhanced soil organic carbon concentration (0–5 cm), soil fertility, and soil biodiversity in the upper soil layer when compared to maize. In a greenhouse experiment, wheat grown in willow soil had higher biomass production than when grown in maize or Miscanthus soil and exhibited no growth reduction in response to introduction of a soil‐borne (Rhizoctonia solani) or a leaf pathogen (Mycosphaerella graminicola) . We conclude that the choice of bioenergy crops can greatly influence provisioning of soil ecosystem services and legacy effects in soil. Our results imply that bioenergy crops with specific traits might even enhance ecosystem properties through positive legacy effects. "
pub.1012028886,Investigation of thermochemical biorefinery sizing and environmental sustainability impacts for conventional supply system and distributed pre‐processing supply system designs,"Abstract  The  2011 US Billion‐Ton Update  estimates that by 2030 there will be enough agricultural and forest resources to sustainably provide at least one billion dry tons of biomass annually, enough to displace approximately 30% of the country's current petroleum consumption. A portion of these resources are inaccessible at current cost targets with conventional feedstock supply systems because of their remoteness or low yields. Reliable analyses and projections of US biofuels production depend on assumptions about the supply system and biorefinery capacity, which, in turn, depend upon economic value, feedstock logistics, and sustainability. A cross‐functional team has examined combinations of advances in feedstock supply systems and biorefinery capacities with rigorous design information, improved crop yield and agronomic practices, and improved estimates of sustainable biomass availability. A previous report on biochemical refinery capacity noted that under advanced feedstock logistic supply systems that include depots and pre‐processing operations there are cost advantages that support larger biorefineries up to 10 000 DMT /day facilities compared to the smaller 2000 DMT /day facilities. This report focuses on analyzing conventional versus advanced depot biomass supply systems for a thermochemical conversion and refinery sizing based on woody biomass. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the economies of scale enabled by advanced logistics offsets much of the added logistics costs from additional depot processing and transportation, resulting in a small overall increase to the minimum ethanol selling price compared to the conventional logistic supply system. While the overall costs do increase slightly for the advanced logistic supply systems, the ability to mitigate moisture and ash in the system will improve the storage and conversion processes. In addition, being able to draw on feedstocks from further distances will decrease the risk of biomass supply to the conversion facility. "
pub.1144821738,An efficient strategy to degrade lignin by a novel endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum combined with ultrasound,"Green biological pretreatment of lignocellulose is the critical step in the degradation of biomass in the sustainable economy for biofuels and bio-based chemicals. In the present study, a novel laccase-producing endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum was screened out from the flower of Hibiscus manihot L. in combination with ultrasound to improve the degradation of lignin in larch sawdust. Under the optimized conditions with the material to liquid ratio 1:20, temperature 30 °C, time 4 days, pH 7, the ultrasonic power 200 W, time 20 min, the degradation rate of lignin reached 34.29%, which increased 1.5-fold and 2-fold higher than that of fungus and ultrasonic treatment correspondingly. In addition, SEM and FTIR analysis showed that the combined treatment changed the surface morphology and chemical structure, and found that mycelium colonized in the interior of sawdust. Analysis of three types of lignin contents showed that the contents of p-Hydroxyphenyl and Guaiacyl increased from 0.46 to 0.70 mg/g and from 9.31 to 11.87 mg/g, while the contents of Syringyl propane did not change significantly, the results indicated that laccase from Chaetomium globosum might have special selectivity. After docking the three lignin monomers and laccase molecules, it was found that the hydroxyl group of Coniferyl alcohol was formed by the active groups of GLU-460 and SER-113 amino acids. The hydrogen bond distances were 1.8 Å and 2.2 Å, which were far smaller than the traditional hydrogen bond of 3.5 Å, this indicated that the compound binds strongly to the protein. The benzene ring of Sinapyl alcohol contained two methoxy groups increasing the molecular volume and hydrophobicity, which reduced laccase's ability to oxidize phenols. In general, as indicated by the results of this study, the novel endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum from Hibiscus manihot L. has great potential to selectively degrade lignin in larch sawdust."
pub.1113461437,A Technology Review and Cost Analysis of the Production of Low Carbon Methanol and Following Methanol to Gasoline Process,"Abstract
The increasing feed-in of electricity from fluctuating renewable energy sources (RES) can lead to sporadic excess supply of electricity to the grid and subsequently curtailment of RES plants and of existing thermal power plants. Industry has developed several technologies for energy storage at MWh scale over short time-periods of hours. Energy storage, which takes advantage of resources from both the energy sector and industry, coupled with the production of fuels for transport, offers a unique chance to integrate more renewables in the electricity grid and enable sustainable, rapid decarbonisation of mobility. Fuels like methanol, gasoline, diesel or kerosene derived from hydrogen – produced from RES via water electrolysis – and CO2 – captured from industrial processes – have a lower CO2 footprint and do not compete with food production, unlike bioethanol or biodiesel. This technology offers a new business model to utilities, which today are restricted to heat and electricity production and play no role in the green fuel market. The paper is based on publications [1–5] as well as the references named in the publications and presents case studies on carbon intensity, efficiency, and economy of CO2 derived fuels that can be produced by existing technology. Furthermore, it describes a new business model for energy producers and energy intensive industries in co-operation with (petro)chemical industry. It is also shown that this approach will help to overcome issues with competition between the biofuel sector and food production. This new business model allows traditional power producers to diversify, in order to attract sufficient revenues in future markets with high RES penetration."
pub.1020509136,Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Bagasse Sulfite Pulp for Production of Fermentable Sugars,"The exploitation and utilization of biomass, which would be the foundation of our future economy, is an effective way to relieve the present energy and environment crisis, and is vital to sustainable development of our society. Lignocellulose is the most abundant biomass resource in the world. Many researches have focused their studies on the transformation of lignocellulose into high-valued energies and chemicals. The hydrolysis of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars is the key and most challenging step in the process of lignocellulose utilization. Thus, the transformation of the straw-based lignocellulose into fermentable sugars effectively was investigated in this thesis. Some factors on the enzymatic hydrolysis of bleached and unbleached bagasse sulfite pulp were explored. Two technical routes leading to the maximum hydrolysis yields were established. It was found that bagasse sulfite pulp showed a good performance on enzymatic hydrolysis and the hydrolysis yield of unbleached pulp was higher than that bleached at the same condition. After the analysis of the contents of hydrolyzates by Ion Chromatography, it was found that the concentration of cellobiose exhibited a rapid increase firstly and then decreased gradually and because of the content of cellulose was higher than that of hemicellulose in pulp, so we can also found that the content of glucose was higher than that of xylose in the hydrolysate. The structural analyses of the feedstocks before and after enzymatic treatment by using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated that there was an increasing crystallinity as the amorphous region was readily attacked, and disrupted crystalline region was also observed during enzymatic hydrolysis. This study shows a new approach for the development of integrated the traditional pulp and paper industry into biorefineries and can increase their revenue by producing biofuels and chemicals in addition to their core products. So it will be an attractive alternative for pulp and paper mills."
pub.1165577839,Potentials and prospects of solid biowaste resources for biofuel production in Ethiopia: a systematic review of the evidence,"Biowaste is becoming a significant category in the global energy mix to mitigate the negative impacts of burning fossil fuels. The aim of this review paper was to investigate the potential, conversion mechanisms, benefits, and policy gaps related to the utilization of solid biowaste resources as renewable, clean, and affordable energy sources. Thus, a systematic review approach was employed to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the studies that dealt with solid biowaste resources for energy recovery. This review paper was conducted from November 2022 to June 2023. The relevant literature was searched using databases from scholarly journal publishers, online search engines, and websites. A total of 82 studies were determined to be eligible from 659 records. Ethiopia has a huge potential for biowaste resources, with an annual generation potential of 18,446.4 MJ per year. The multifaceted advantages associated with biowaste-to-energy conversion such as clean energy production, waste management, forest conservation, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and maintaining soil fertility using the digestate left after anaerobic digestion were mentioned. This review highlights various conversion technologies for converting solid biowastes into valuable forms of energy, such as thermochemical, biochemical, and physico-mechanical techniques. It also investigated the value-added products of the Solid Biowastes-to-Energy (SBWtoE) process, including bio-oil, syngas, bioethanol, biodiesel, biomethane, bio-briquettes, and pellets, with applications ranging from transportation to power generation. Furthermore, this review addresses the multifaceted challenges associated with implementing a circular economy, emphasizing the need to overcome policy, technological, financial, and institutional barriers. These efforts are crucial for harnessing the growing biowaste resources in Ethiopia, ultimately promoting sustainable and cost-effective energy production while advancing the nation's environmental objectives."
pub.1148253384,Process optimization for recycling of bread waste into bioethanol and biomethane: A circular economy approach,"Bread is the second most wasted food in the UK with annual wastage of 292,000 tons. In the present work, bread waste (BW) was utilized for fermentative production of ethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae KL17. Acidic and enzymatic saccharification of BW was carried out resulting in the highest glucose release of 75 and 97.9 g/L which is 73.5 and 95.9% of theoretical yield, respectively. The obtained sugars were fermented into ethanol initially in shake flask followed by scale up in bioreactor in batch and fed-batch mode. In the fed-batch mode of cultivation, the maximum ethanol titers of 111.3, 106.9, and 114.9 g/L with conversion yield and productivity of 0.48, 0.47, and 0.49 g/g, and 3.1, 3.0, and 3.2 g/L.h was achieved from pure glucose, glucose-rich acidic and enzymatic hydrolysates, respectively. Further to improve the process economics, the solid residues after acidic (ABW) and enzymatic (EBW) hydrolysis of BW along with respective fermentation residues (FR) obtained after the ethanol production were pooled and subjected to anaerobic digestion. The solid residue from ABW + FR, and EBW + FR yielded a biochemical methanation potential (BMP) of 345 and 379 mL CH4/g VS, respectively. Life cycle assessment of the process showed that the total emissions for ethanol production from BW were comparable to the emissions from more established feedstocks such as sugarcane and maize grain and much lower when compared to wheat and sweet potato. The current work demonstrates BW as promising feedstock for sustainable biofuel production with the aid of circular biorefining strategy. To the authors knowledge, this is the first time, such a sequential system has been investigated with BW for ethanol and biomethane production. Further work will be aimed at ethanol production at pilot scale and BMP will be accessed in a commercial anaerobic digester."
pub.1145435348,Emergy-based sustainability analysis of bioenergy production from marginal and degraded lands of India,"Analysing the sustainability of cultivating biomass and biofuel plant species on marginal and degraded lands is essential for assessing the socio-economic and environmental perspectives. Various approaches have been suggested for the sustainability analyses, such as life cycle assessment, footprint analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis, and emergy analysis. Among these approaches, the emergy analysis is one of the most direct methods to assess the system's sustainability. The present article was aimed to perform the emergy analysis to quantify the ecological impacts, bioenergy potential, socio-economic efficiency, and the sustainability of the bioenergy production systems. The emergy-based sustainability analysis was conducted for the Soyabean-, Pongamia-, Jatropha-based biodiesel and Tectona-based biomass production systems from the Indian marginal and degraded lands. Results depicted that under a set of system boundaries for each plant species, total emergy output (U) of 1000 kg biodiesel (biomass in case of Tectona) was calculated to be 0.99E+16 for Soyabean-; 1.01E+16 for Pongamia-; 1.33E+16 for Jatropha- and 0.72E+16 sej for Tectona-based bioenergy production options. Emergy of fuels dominated the economic inflows (F) (32.53%) under the Soyabean-based option making it the second system to represent a greater environmental load ratio (ELR) of 17.98. Furthermore, the emergy of water resources was dominated under F in other studied bioenergy options, i.e., 38.08% of F in Pongamia-, 44.54% in Jatropha-, and 66.52% in Tectona-based systems. The emergy sustainability indices (ESI) of 0.06, 1.04, 0.34, and 0.02 were found for Soyabean-, Pongamia-, Jatropha-, Tectona-based bioenergy production systems, respectively. Sensitivity analysis further suggested that a decrease of 3.5% in F resulted in a 10.02% increase of ESI for the Pongamia-based option. Pongamia-based options depicted an ESI > 1, which could be considered to have a sustainable contribution to the economy for medium periods. The estimated ESIs were fundamentally low because the systems were dependent mainly on the F."

Lignocellulose is one of the organic component in many was available an agricultural waste as a source of microbes to produce welfare fuel. In process of renewable energy, hydrolysis on source lignocellulose using a lignocellulose enzyme will be imported. Bioethanol produce there are have some problems, among other lack of strains superior enzyme lignocellulose microbes producer. Lignocellulose that degrades an enzyme is cellulose much used in various industries. An enzyme can be produced of a group of bacteria, like mold and yeasts. This article is determine to identify superior lignocellulose microbes producing an enzyme. Sample of the study obtained from the specimen land, litter, decayed wood, sand, water crater in various districts in Indonesia. Produce an enzyme lignocellulose identification microbes to bioetanol begins with exploration, isolation and selection, further testing and selection. From 15 bacteria producing cellulose isolates, and selection isolate superior obtained was that B93 with the activity of enzyme reached 25,3 U/ml. Identification of superior cellulose microbes producer is Enterobacteria Sp. Based on this outcome was expected that B93 is a potential source of an cellulose enzyme producer. That can be used to producing welfare fuel (bioethanol). The next research can get reducing part cost of bioethanol production from lignocellulose is cost of cellulose and xillanase (commercial enzim), so it is very impact alternative to solve the global warming problem and ensure sustainable development of the economy leaf litter biomass from tree plantation sites can be collected and used as a promising feedstock for biofuel production to mitigate energy crisis."
pub.1126171455,Multi-objective optimal synthesis of algal biorefineries toward a sustainable circular bioeconomy,"Production of biodiesel from renewable resources like microalgae biomass presents a potential for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption. The integration of processes from other industries have been implemented in microalgal biorefineries to increase economic sustainability by co-producing several high-value algal-based products. Agro-industrial processes have the potential to be incorporated into the biorefinery because it requires input material flows from other biorefinery process units to cultivate and sell crops for an additional source of revenue and increased carbon sequestration, while generating wastewater that may be used as a cultivation medium for algae or as a resource for other biorefinery processes. Circular bioeconomy, an extension of the circular economy ideology, has the goal of achieving economic and environmental sustainability through maximizing the dedicated recirculation of resource flows, and minimizing waste generation and end-of-life disposal. However, existing modelling studies have not explored this opportunity; previous studies have not considered that resource functionality runs out with repeated recirculation and reuse as it reaches its end of life. In this work, a novel multi-objective optimization model is developed to design and manage closed-loop algal biorefineries integrating agro-industrial processes that captures the effect of recirculation on resource material viability and end-of-life environmental impact. A case study is solved as proof of concept and to illustrate the design methodology, optimal solutions based on economic and environmental performance are analyzed. The results of the case study validate the initial hypothesis that there is a conflict between the economic and environmental objectives since the decision for biofuel production varied for each single objective. With the multi objective model, a balance between the two objectives was found. The results of the optimization model can be applied in the design of an algal biorefinery along with the decisions relating to production quantities incorporating a zero waste outlook."

This virtual conference was held online from 15 to 16 December 2020 via the GoogleMeet platform, and was officiated by the Vice Chancellor of Universiti Malaysia Perlis. The virtual platform was chosen in the first place due to travel restrictions and safety reasons during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we ensured that this platform is as good as any face-to-face conference as all plenary sessions were open to every participants to build efficient research networks. In the spirit of knowledge sharing, the 2 Keynote sessions were made live via the official Facebook of Universiti Malaysia Perlis. Our conference participants represented Malaysia, Philippines, Nepal and Indonesia. Keep the network growing! We have seen global scenarios of environmental pollution resulting from burning of agricultural wastes. Also, almost all biodiversity is not plastic-free today, and plastics are not renewable. Thus this brings us to the theme of the conference this year, which was “Biomass Innovation for Sustainable Development”. This theme has been chosen in view of the current revolution and rapid developments in the field of biomass utilization. With breakthrough research and novel findings, agricultural wastes can be made directly into valuable chemicals and products with an increase in value. A number of 117 papers were published and organised around broad subdisciplines such as such as sustainable biomass resources for decarbonising the economy, biomass conversion technologies for bioenergy, biomass conversion to intermediates and products, bioeconomy sustainability, impacts and policies, bioenergy integration and many more. A total of 16 plenary virtual sessions were conducted with 79 oral presentations (15 minutes presentation and 5 minutes Q&A) and 42 posters.

pub.1120927462,"Towards improving the sustainability of bioplastics: Process modelling and life cycle assessment of two separation routes for 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid","Within the framework of an economy excessively dependent on fossil resources, the concept of sustainable development, aimed at obtaining environmentally friendly consumer goods, has given rise to the development of biorefineries. These facilities are based on the production of biofuels and platform chemicals from the most abundant raw material on the planet: biomass. The use of biomass such as wood or lignocellulosic residues makes it possible to seize opportunities offered by the implementation of renewable feedstocks, which in many cases can be embedded within the perspective of circular economy, through the exploitation of residual fractions. Among the multiple basic chemicals that can be obtained from biomass, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a great potential, as it is the precursor of poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF) polymer, which is considered a feasible substitute for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The purpose of this study is the simulation and environmental analysis of two separation routes for FDCA production with the objective of identifying the environmental hotspots at an early stage of the process design. The present study addresses the modelling of FDCA production from hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) by heterogeneous catalysis using commercial Aspen Plus® V9 software. Two different downstream separation options resulting in purified FDCA were simulated: crystallization (Scenario A) and distillation (Scenario B). The estimation of the mass and energy balances were considered in the development of the data inventories required to conduct Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA-assisted decision making identifies the conceptual configuration that would eventually lead to the least environmental burden. In the case of Scenario A, the stage with the highest environmental burden was the reaction unit, due to the use of HMF. In Scenario B, on the other hand, the separation stages contributed most to the impact due to their high energy demand. The combination of process simulation and LCA allowed acquiring a detailed vision of the process, through the analysis of the sensitivity of the environmental profile to different process parameters. The operating pressure in flash and distillation units for both scenarios affects plant operation by influencing total energy consumption and FDCA production. The sensitivity of environmental outcomes to these parameters was also studied, resulting in small variations. Thus, the results of this assessment provide strategic information of the early decision-making process on potential configurations for industrial-scale FDCA production."
pub.1127084599,ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES FOR INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF IRRIGATION SYSTEMS,"Actuality of the problem. The article discusses the current level of use of alternative sources of electrical power in the world. The main areas of the global power development were determined, the statistical data of leading energy companies, analytical international organizations and financial institutions were analysed. For today, all civilized countries successfully switch to alternative energy sources: wind, solar energy, biofuels, etc. In addition, the use of solar energy is one of the most promising inexhaustible, renewable energy sources. The use of renewable energy sources replaces the traditional one, based on extractive technologies polluting the atmosphere with harmful emissions, and enhances the greenhouse effect, reduces the burden on the resource base and energy systems of countries and improves the environment. Sustainable development of the agricultural sector of the economy of Ukraine and, in particular, irrigated agriculture requires a reduction in energy dependence. In the structure of the cost of irrigation water, a significant share accounts for electrical power. That is why to increase the efficiency of irrigated agriculture, to ensure high and sustainable yields in the context of climate change, it is extremely important to reduce the cost of power consumption. The need to use alternative energy sources in the drainage complex of Ukraine as part of the implementation of the energy strategy of Ukraine, aimed at the transition to fficient use and consumption of energy resources is highlighted. The Institute of Water Problems and Land Reclamation deals with the investigations of measures and technologies to improve power efficiency to reduce the specific energy consumption for pumping water by pumping stations and to reduce the rate of power losses for water intake and water transportation by water supply paths. One of the effective measures to reduce power cost is the use of alternative energy sources, in particular solar energy. The economic potential of the measures for improving energy efficiency in irrigation systems wass estimated. Conclusions. The estimation showed that the use of modules of solar power plants installed above the surface of open irrigation canals will lead to lower energy costs in the face of a constant increase in tariffs, that is, it will help to increase the economic efficiency of irrigation, reduce the share of water resources in national energy consumption and have a positive environmental effect. The sale of surplus power to the energy system at “green” tariffs can significantly reduce the payback period for the modernization of the engineering infrastructure of irrigation systems."
pub.1109525601,"Green Chemistry in Environmental Sustainability and Chemical Education, Proceedings of ICGC 2016, New Delhi","Chemistry is considered to be one of the prime causes of environmental pollution and degradation. The United Nations General Assembly also addressed the environmental challenges in its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have been adopted in 2015. A closer look shows that to meet these goals chemistry will play an important role. Green chemistry encompasses design and synthesis of environmentally benign chemical processes, green approaches to minimize and/or remediate environmental pollution, the development of biomaterials, biofuel, and bioenergy production, biocatalysis, and policies and ethics in green chemistry. When products in use today become waste, we need to treat that waste so that hazardous substances are not re-circulated into new products. In this context, circular economy is also an important point of discussion, which focuses on recycling, reuse and use of renewable sources. The theme of the International Conference on ""Green Chemistry in Environmental Sustainability & Chemical Education (ICGC-2016) held in Delhi from 17-18 November 2016 was to discuss the emerging green trends in the direction of sustainability and environmental safety. ICGC-2016 consisted of keynote, plenary and invited lectures, panel discussion, contributed oral papers and poster presentations. The conference provided a platform for high school students, undergraduate and postgraduate students, teaching fraternity and young researchers to interact with eminent scientists and academicians from all over the world who shared their valuable views, experience and research on the harmonious methods in chemistry for a sustainable environment. This volume of proceedings from the conference provides an opportunity for readers to engage with a selection of refereed papers that were presented during the ICGC-2016 conference. The overarching goal of this book is to discuss most recent innovations and concerns in green chemistry as well as practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted to remediate a scathed environment into a pristine one. It includes an extensive variety of contributions from participants of ICGC-2016 that demonstrate the importance of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach to problem solving within green chemistry and environmental management. The proceedings is thus a green chemistry monograph resulting from the fruitful deliberations in the conference, which will deeply enhance awareness about our responsibility towards the environment."
pub.1036737926,Nanoheterogeneous Design of Biocatalysts for Biomass Valorization,"Biocatalysis (enzymatic and whole cell catalysis) has been extensively applied in white biotechnology for the production of fuels and ne chemicals in recent years.1 Furthermore, biocatalysis is currently on the policy agendas because it is considered one of the most promising routes for a bio-based economy. Biocatalysis plays a key role in the development of biorenery for conversion of biomass into a wide array of fuels, chemicals, and materials.2-4 Expanding from traditional applications, biocatalysis is nowadays providing the initial steps toward the production of chemicals commodities5,6 for sustainable energy supply and environment of long-term care throughout the world. Consequently, the importance of biocatalysis as a biotechnological tool on biomass transformation is increasingly every day as well.7,8 Chemical production from biomass can be followed on two different directions, which are the biomass biodegradation and further the biotransformation of the biomass derivatives to nal value-added products (Scheme 7.1).

pub.1030021065,A Hierarchy of Natural Resources with Respect to Sustainable Development—A Basis for a Natural Resources Efficiency Indicator,"To resolve complex issues and establish guidelines for industry, politicians need data that can be transformed into indicators for policy decisions. Using a four-level hierarchy of natural resources as a base, a meaningful resource efficiency indicator can be developed as a tool for such policy decisions.According to this concept, sustainable development implies substituting materials at a higher level of the hierarchy, either by material from a lower level, or by resources from the technosphere that replace resources from the same level in the geosphere. Energy resources occupy the highest level of the four-level hierarchy. Most problems concerning natural resources can be solved with enough affordable energy: water can be recycled after use; saline water can be desalinated; soil erosion through deforestation can be reduced by lessening the need for biofuel; cut-off grades in metal deposits can be lowered to increase available reserves; and lower-quality scrap metal can be recycled. The next hierarchy level is represented by raw materials derived from occurrences that developed over geological time and were formed by natural enrichment (e.g., all metal deposits and some non-metallic deposits such as barite or phosphate). This level also includes deposits of the technosphere that can be recycled. The third level comprises materials available in almost unlimited amounts on Earth, such as granite, sandstone, and clay, but also those raw materials that can be produced from air (e.g., nitrogen fertilizer), or from sea water (e.g., boron, potassium, or magnesium). Wood used for construction purposes is included in this third level because it is a renewable resource. The lowest level represents waste and residue materials from the technosphere that are potential raw materials for secondary use.
Because energy resources occupy the top of this hierarchy, it makes sense to conserve energy by using more raw materials of lower ranking, rather than materials from the top levels. It then follows that in order to measure resource efficiency it is not appropriate to use a pure indicator, such as “total tonnage of natural resources produced or consumed in relation to the gross national product.” Instead, in establishing guidelines for political decisions designed to improve resource efficiency in a national economy, resource efficiency should mainly be measured in terms of an energy efficiency indicator."
pub.1172873296,AS A RESOURCE OF FOOD AND FEED:ALGAE,"Food supply security is at risk due to factors such as improper agricultural practices, increase in human population, soil and water pollution. To cope with this risk, the search for an innovative, sustainable and effective food alternative has arisen. Algae have been used as a food source for many years because they have the nutritional composition that is the basic need of a living thing. Algae contain macronutrients such as usable protein, fat and carbohydrates, as well as essential amino acids and fatty acids. They are also rich in vitamins, minerals and pigments with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Studies on algae, which can be used in many areas such as biofuel production, C capture, wastewater treatment, have begun to focus on the production of high-value molecules. In recent years, algae-based food products containing these high-value molecules have been designed and commercialized. These products have a significant place in the algal biotechnology market and all the countries of the world have started to realize this. Algae have the potential to be used as human food as well as animal feed. Since algae contain more protein compared to traditional agricultural products and do not need to occupy agricultural land for their production, they are seen as a remarkable source of biomass in animal feed. In addition, intensive microalgae production for animal feed contributes to sustainable agriculture by absorbing the salinity and drought caused by the brutal use of agricultural lands, global warming by absorbing carbon, and preventing agricultural pollution by using nitrogen and phosphorus. There are still some obstacles to the use of algae as food and feed. however, when its economic return and efficiency are evaluated, it is clearly understood that they are the most important organisms for the prevention and overcoming of the food and environmental problems awaiting humanity in the future. Further studies are needed to optimize culture conditions, the effects of culture stress parameters on biochemical composition and molecular pathway studies, and to increase biomass productivity per unit volume. If algal biotechnology studies continue at the current pace, all these obstacles will be overcome in the next 10 years and the algal biotechnology market will have increased at least 3 times. In this chapter, the potential of algae as food and feed, the current status of algal biotechnology applications in this field, their contribution to the economy and the environment, the obstacles in front of this sector and what needs to be done to overcome will be focused on."
pub.1166857795,Significance of Biotechnology in Promoting Energy and Food Industries: Exploring the Potential of Bio-based Products,"The field of biotechnology has emerged as a major and significant force that has the potential to bring about revolutionary changes in important industries, including energy and food production. This study examines the significant contribution of biotechnology in promoting sustainability and improving efficiency in the energy and food sectors by advancing the production and application of bio-based goods. Biotechnology has emerged as a promising field within the energy industry, presenting novel opportunities for the generation of biofuels. This development provides a sustainable and ecologically sound substitute for traditional fossil fuels. Researchers have successfully used the metabolic capacities of microbes and plants to develop innovative bio-based fuels, therefore decreasing reliance on finite resources and alleviating the environmental consequences associated with energy generation. Moreover, the biotechnology field has been essential in optimizing agricultural methodologies and the augmentation of crop productivity. The enhancement of pest and disease resistance in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has significantly contributed to the enhancement of food security through the augmentation of agricultural production. In addition, the progress made in biotechnology pertaining to crop breeding and precision agriculture has facilitated the creation of robust cultivars that exhibit adaptability to various environmental circumstances. The production of bio-based goods, encompassing a variety of materials such as bioplastics and bio-based chemicals, is an additional facet of biotechnology's influence on the energy and food sectors. Through microbial fermentation and metabolic engineering methodologies, researchers in the field of biotechnology have successfully established a foundation for the environmentally conscious manufacturing of materials that have historically been sourced from petrochemical sources. The practice not only serves to diminish the ecological impact linked to conventional manufacturing methods but also plays a role in fostering the establishment of a circular economy. This study examines case studies and ongoing research endeavors that exemplify the effective incorporation of biotechnology in advancing the energy and food sectors. This study examines the economic, environmental, and social consequences associated with the adoption of bio-based goods, with a particular focus on their capacity to facilitate a transformative change towards a future characterized by sustainability and resilience. In the context of a rapidly changing global environment, it is crucial to comprehend and exploit the capabilities of biotechnology within the energy and food industries. The objective of this study is to provide a scholarly contribution to the expanding field of research on the importance of biotechnology in designing a society that is more sustainable and efficient in its use of resources."
pub.1122523315,The Palgrave Handbook of Managing Fossil Fuels and Energy Transitions,"This Handbook is the first volume to comprehensively analyse and problem-solve how to manage the decline of fossil fuels as the world tackles climate change and shifts towards a low-carbon energy transition. The overall findings are straight-forward and unsurprising: although fossil fuels have powered the industrialisation of many nations and improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people, another century dominated by fossil fuels would be disastrous. Fossil fuels and associated greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to a level that avoids rising temperatures and rising risks in support of a just and sustainable energy transition. Divided into four sections and 25 contributions from global leading experts, the chapters span a wide range of energy technologies and sources including fossil fuels, carbon mitigation options, renewables, low carbon energy, energy storage, electric vehicles and energy sectors (electricity, heat and transport). Theycover varied legal jurisdictions and multiple governance approaches encompassing multi- and inter-disciplinary technological, environmental, social, economic, political, legal and policy perspectives with timely case studies from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America and the Pacific. Providing an insightful contribution to the literature and a much-needed synthesis of the field as a whole, this book will have great appeal to decision makers, practitioners, students and scholars in the field of energy transition studies seeking a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and challenges in managing the decline of fossil fuels.

Indonesia currently produces as high as 19 million tons of corn which contains 50% of biomass in the form of cob. Waste from harvesting and consumption of corn, namely, corn cob (CC) is left as waste. This CC is actually a sustainable, easily accessible, and renewable biomass energy source as an alternative to Indonesia’s depleting fossil fuel reserves. Hydrothermal treatment is a conversion method that has some consequential advantages compared to other methods; e.g. the ability to treat high-moisture biomass like CC and the possibility to use lower temperature. This research aims to produce and characterize liquid and solid fuel subsequent to hydrothermal treatment of CC obtained from Sleman, Yogyakarta. After size reduction, fine particles were mixed with water to form slurry. Slurry was heated in an autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at initial pressure of 2.0 MPa and was held for 200°C, 240°C, and 270°C in 30 minutes. The solid and liquid products were then separated. Liquid was analyzed using GC-MS and solid by using AAS. The result showed that, in comparison to raw material, solid product had higher carbon content which resulted in the increase of calorific value of the solid biofuel. The calorific value of solid product ranged from 19,59 -22,02 MJ/kg or 20,93-35,87% higher than raw materials and 4-17% higher than average coal used in Indonesia. Major component in liquid product are N, N-dimethyl formamide, furfural, and phenolic compound, with benzoic acid present as minor component. The potential of liquid products as organic preservatives are examined by testing the tenacity of wood against termite according to ASTM D3345-74 standard method. Result showed that liquid product were effective in exhibiting termiticidal activity and temperature 200°C showed the optimum condition.

pub.1164406023,Preface,"The International Conference on Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (ICNREC) is an annual event to discuss various topics and issues regarding the conservation of natural resources and the environment. The third year the ICNREC event was held on Oktober 27, 2023 through hybrid (both online and offline) due to COVID-19 pandemic. The offline session was held at IPB International Convention Center Bogor - West Java - Indonesia, which raised the theme: “Optimizing the roles of biodiversity in improving the economic and ecological aspects of oil palm plantation”. Indonesia is one of the countries that has started to move towards a green economy. In the 11th UNEP Special Session on Governing Council meeting in Bali, the Government of Indonesia declared a green economy paradigm. The oil palm plantation sector also plays a role in implementing a green economy through the production of environmentally friendly biofuel sources (biodiesel with a 2022 production of 8.6 million KL) and supporting the use of renewable electricity sources from biogas in CPO processing plants. Nowadays, the practice of using biodiversity for controlling pests in oil palm plantations has also been carried out, such as the use of owls, cobras, leopard cat, and macaques for natural predator. Several studies also shown the role of biodiversity as a natural pesticide in controlling caterpillar pests to replace synthetic chemical pesticides. Several companies have also started encouraging the use of biopesticides to maintain the health of the soil and palm trees. The use of organic fertilizers and biofertilizers has also been applied by national oil palm players in the last few years. Through this third ICNREC theme, with the gathering of competent and qualified experts from various disciplines and from around the world, it is hoped that discussions able to clarify the biodiversity’s role scientifically and objectively so that in the future the “best practice sustainable palm oil management” will be more applicable. The third ICNREC was held in collaboration with the Center for Study, Advocacy and Nature Conservation (PUSAKA KALAM), the Faculty of Forestry and Environment of the IPB University, and the French Agricultural Research for International Development (CIRAD) as well as for the support of sponsors {Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affair Indonesia; Indonesia Oil Palm Plantation Fund Management Agency (BPDPKS); Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI); Sinarmas Agribusiness and Food (PT SMART Tbk); PT.

pub.1157888137,Exploring the potential of Bacillus subtilis as cell factory for food ingredients and special chemicals,"Abstract  Background  Bacillus subtilis has been established as model microorganism for fundamental research in the laboratory on protein production/secretion and sporulation and as model bacterium for controlling spoilage in the food industry. It has also been used for production of (commercial) enzymes and several secondary metabolites such as vitamins. However, this doesn’t fully reflect the potential of B. subtilis as a cell-factory. Here, various strains of B. subtilis , including food-grade, spore-deficient strains and industrially used strains, were compared for their growth and metabolic potential. Industry-relevant parameters were analyzed for all strains under various aeration regimes, under anaerobic conditions, in various nutritious and nutrient-limited cultivation media, with and without organic nitrogen sources, and with and without sugar.    Results  Practical experiments were conducted to compare industrial relevant properties like growth rates, intracellular components and extracellular metabolite profile of different B. subtilis strains. Based on growth flexibility in different media, we found that some strains like NCIB3610 and DSM1092 are adapted to inorganic or organic nitrogen source utilization, which is highly relevant when considering a biorefinery approach using various cheap and abundant waste/sidestreams. Secondly, spore-deficient strains such as 3NA, 168S and PY79S, showed advantages in microbial protein and acetolactate pathway expression, which is associated with applications in food industry for protein supplement and diacetyl production. Lastly, WB800 and PY79S exhibited potential for fermentative production of Dipicolinic acid, 2,3-Butanediol and Lactic acid that could serve as precursors for biopolymers.    Conclusion  This study demonstrates the broad potential for more extensive industrial use of Bacillus subtilis in the (bio-based) chemical industry for use of sidestreams, in the personal care industry, in the food industry for food additive production, and in the bio-sustainable industry for biofuel and bio-degradable plastic precursors production. In addition, selecting different B. subtilis strains for specific purposes makes full use of the diversity of this species and increases the potential of B. subtilis in its contribution to the bio-based economy.

pub.1151524134,How does dolomite application affect the greenhouse gases emissions from the terrestrial environment? – A global synthesis,"Global climatic energy balance has been increasingly altered by massive emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), leading to a variety of natural disturbances in terrestrial ecosystems. Further, the increasing use of fossil fuels and the looming climate crisis have created an unprecedented urgency for the development of a biobased circular economy. Therefore, production of biofuels from plant biomass is currently seen as a promising source of renewable energy , ensuring sustainable development with minimal carbon footprint. Soil acidification is considered one of the major obstacles to crop production and a significant source of GHGs emissions, especially N2O, because acidification changes the physicochemical and biochemical properties of the soil. Dolomite (DM) is the most widely used countermeasure to neutralize soil acidity to improve crop productivity and control net fluxes of GHGs. Nevertheless, the extent of GHG emissions following the application of DM under different environmental conditions is still unclear. Therefore, in this context, we conducted a meta-analysis using 32 peer-reviewed publications to determine the effects of DM, climate zones, and soil properties on GHGs emissions. The results of the current meta-analysis show that DM application significantly increased CO2 emissions (30.34 %) and CH4 emissions (4.91 %), but reduced N2O emissions by 54.88 %. A significant effect of DM (>10 t ha−1) on CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions was also observed. Increasing soil pH increased CO2 and N2O emissions by 188.34 % and 49.78 %, respectively, while reducing CH4 emissions by 81.94 %. Most importantly, WFPS, soil textural class, soil C:N ratio, and climate zones were identified as key edaphic factors affecting the GHG emissions following the application of DM. Overall, this meta-analysis fills in the gaps regarding the impact of the application of DM on GHGs emissions in different climates, soil properties, and experimental conditions. In , a better understanding of the interactions between DM and GHGs flux in the terrestrial ecosystem can be used not only to avert climatic upheaval, but also to better predict these emissions from acidic soils."
pub.1105962955,"Evaluating the Link between Low Carbon Reductions Strategies and Its Performance in the Context of Climate Change: A Carbon Footprint of a Wood-Frame Residential Building in Quebec, Canada","The design and study of low carbon buildings is a major concern in a modern economy due to high carbon emissions produced by buildings and its effects on climate change. Studies have investigated (CFP) Carbon Footprint of buildings, but there remains a need for a strong analysis that measure and quantify the overall degree of GHG emissions reductions and its relationship with the effect on climate change mitigation. This study evaluates the potential of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector by evaluating the (CFP) of four hotpots approaches defined in line with commonly carbon reduction strategies, also known as mitigation strategies. CFP framework is applied to compare the (CC) climate change impact of mitigation strategies. A multi-story timber residential construction in Quebec City (Canada) was chosen as a baseline scenario. This building has been designed with the idea of being a reference of sustainable development application in the building sector. In this scenario, the production of materials and construction (assembly, waste management and transportation) were evaluated. A CFP that covers eight actions divided in four low carbon strategies, including: low carbon materials, material minimization, reuse and recycle materials and adoption of local sources and use of biofuels were evaluated. The results of this study shows that the used of prefabricated technique in buildings is an alternative to reduce the CFP of buildings in the context of Quebec. The CC decreases per m2 floor area in baseline scenario is up to 25% than current buildings. If the benefits of low carbon strategies are included, the timber structures can generate 38% lower CC than the original baseline scenario. The investigation recommends that CO2eq emissions reduction in the design and implementation of residential constructions as climate change mitigation is perfectly feasible by following different working strategies. It is concluded that if the four strategies were implemented in current buildings they would have environmental benefits by reducing its CFP. The reuse wood wastes into production of particleboard has the greatest environmental benefit due to temporary carbon storage."
pub.1155768106,Agricultural use of two bioproducts based on pistachio waste as source of nitrogen in a pepper crop,"The interest in developing sustainable agriculture is becoming increasingly relevant in recent times, seeking alternatives to synthetic chemical fertilizers and the revaluation of wastes through more environmentally friendly alternatives. During the last decade, the cultivated area of pistachio in Spain is growing very significantly, especially in Castilla-La Mancha (FAO, 2018). During the harvesting and processing of the fruit, residues such as shell and peel of the fruit are generated, remains of vegetables and water from the cleaning process, which have a marked phytotoxic character due to their high content of polyphenols. Therefore, the generation of pistachio wastes, which can reach 40% of the harvest, could be an environmental problem. For this reason, various research groups have used this waste to obtain different products such as active carbon, mulches, biofuels, etc. In the present study, we evaluate the effect of two bioproducts generated from the pistachio harvest residue and determine which of them has a greater agricultural interest (P1: product with less polyphenols, extracted by a thermal process, and P2: product with an additional Steam Explosion process). The bioproducts were evaluated in a pepper crop field with a randomized complete-block design, considering an unfertilized treatment as a control (T0 = Control, T1 = 50% of N needed with P1, T2 = 100% of N needed with P2, T3 = 50% of N needed with P2, and T4 = 100% of N needed with P2). The parameters controlled were: ETc calculated with the FAO methodology (ETc = ETo x Kc), irrigation water (NO3), soil (NO2, NO3, P, K, pH and texture), drainage water (NH4, NO3, P, K, Ca, Mg and pH), crop growth control (LAI and LAD) and dry matter composition of leaf, stem and fruit (N Kjeldahl, P and K). As preliminary results of the first experimental trial, no significant differences in the growth parameters measured between the control and the treatments have been found, although analytical results are still in progress and further research experiments will be stablished in the next years.Keywords: By-products, organic wastes, global warming, circular economy.Acknowledgements: Project INIA-2019-0007 (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness)."
pub.1176252059,Integrating environmental remediation with biodiesel production from toxic non-edible oil seeds (Croton bonplandianus) using a sustainable phyto-nano catalyst,"In the current situation of the environmental uprising toxicology, rising global temperature, and energy-depleting urges to explore and discover more renewable and greener ecological-benefiting energy resources. Biobased renewable fuels generated by using waste products can help in waste management, climate change mitigation, and a low-carbon future. The main objective of this research is to produce environment-friendly and cost-effective biofuel. The potentiality of the novel, toxic, waste, and inedible feedstock Croton bonplandianus was evaluated for biodiesel synthesis through transesterification utilizing a Phyto-nano catalyst of potassium oxide prepared by Croton bonplandianus floral stalk's aqueous extract focusing on waste management. Phyto-nano catalyst characterization was done through innovative tools such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Zeta Potential (ZP), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transformed Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS). The characterization results revealed that the potassium oxide phyto-nanocatalyst possesses an average nanoparticle size of 44.5 nm. This size is optimal for enhanced catalytic activity, indicating significant potential for efficient catalysis. The highest yield (94 %) of biodiesel was secured at optimized reaction conditions of catalyst quantity (0.50 wt%), reaction time (180 min), methanol: oil ratio (9:1), and reaction thermal point (70 °C). Transformation of triglycerides to methyl esters was confirmed by GC/MS, NMR, and FTIR techniques. A total of 21 methyl esters were observed in Croton bonplandianus biodiesel confirmed via GC/MS results. Evaluation of fuel properties was done and matched with international fuel standards. The conclusive remarks for the conducted research are that Croton bonplandianus has a high potential for biodiesel production by applying Phyto-nanocatalysts of potassium oxide while dealing with hazardous environmental conditions and waste management. Phyto nanocatalyst of potassium oxide can be reused and gives the same yield after several cycles of reusability, this reusability of heterogenous Phyto nanocatalyst can reduce to total cost of biodiesel production and can contribute towards circular economy."

Like many economies at its level, it is plagued with underdeveloped infrastructure. Owing to its rugged terrain, with about 75% classified as rural mountainous areas, it has suffered severe soil erosion leading to very deep gulleys in the lowlands making movements very challenging. Despite the Lesotho Energy Policy advocating for reduced consumption of biomass for energy, the energy sector still relies heavily on burning of biomass (about 80%) with a considerably small percentage accessing electricity albeit mostly in the urban areas (45%). Sources of biomass include firewood from wild vegetation including bushes and shrubs, animal dung and crop-waste the three of which account for almost 80% of total energy use for cooking and heating. The indiscriminate burning of grasslands by herdboys, poses a threat not only to biodiversity loss, but importantly to the main energy source biomass as the shrubs and bushes usually take longer time to grow than the grass that is often the reason for setting veld fires by the herdboys. The ever-increasing cost of electricity compounded with the low employment rate exacerbates the energy security scare. This has prompted many initiatives in exploring the other possible sources such as renewable energy, production of energy-efficient stoves, biogas generation, just to mention but a few. However, these strides are still stifled by poor to no funding and they still remain research areas than fully exploited areas for economic development. A call is made for a concerted effort to seek alternatives since not all citizens can be accessed by the grid owing to the rugged terrain of the country."
pub.1164063002,Beyond the Age of Oil,"This book offers a revealing picture of the myths and realities of the energy world by one of our most renowned energy experts and managers. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the human race finds itself caught in an ""energy trap."" Carbon-rich fossil fuels—coal, petroleum and natural gas—are firmly entrenched as the dominant sources of our energy and power. Their highly concentrated forms, versatility of use, ease of transport and storage, ready availability, and comparatively low costs combine to give fossil fuels an unassailable competitive advantage over all alternative sources of energy. This economic reality means that fossil fuels will inevitably continue to be the backbone of the global economy for the next quarter of a century, even while the adverse climate and environmental effects of our dependence on fossil fuels hurtle toward global crisis levels. To avert unacceptable environmental consequences, the world must deliberately and incrementally supplant fossil fuels with alternative energy sources, on a schedule that will have them overtake fossil fuels in the world's energy budget by 2035. To achieve this urgent goal without massive economic dislocation and reduction in standards of living, global investment in fossil fuel efficiency will be just as important as the development and massive deployment of alternative energy technologies and delivery systems. In this eagerly awaited sequel to his prize-winning bestseller, The Age of Oil, Leonardo Maugeri, the strategy director of one of the world's biggest energy companies, puts forward a hard-headed, concrete plan in simple everyday language for how to shift the world economy's primary energy dependence from fossil fuels to renewable energies by 2035. Assuming no specialized knowledge, the author walks the reader chapter by chapter through each of the fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas) and each of the alternative energy sources (nuclear, hydroelectric, biofuel, wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrogen). Drawing on the unparalleled data and analysis resources at his command, Maugeri assesses the problems and advantages of each energy source in turn in order to constrain the optimal mix of energy sources that the world should be aiming for in 2035. Critically, he lays out the arduous path for getting from here to there. Maugeri shows that the next 25 years will be a rocky marriage between the old and the new energy paradigms, during which we must dramatically improve the efficiency of our continuing use of fossil fuels, while driving ahead on all fronts to an energy future based on a suite of sustainable energy sources."

This work aims to provide a baseline for, and deeper insights into, the mass, energy, and economic performance of PEF production in integrated bioenergy self‐sufficient biorefineries. Alternative configurations for the production of PEF from A‐molasses (1G), sugarcane bagasse and trash (2G), or combinations of them (1G2G) were simulated as integrated sugarcane biorefineries – designed to be bio‐energy self‐sufficient – in Aspen Plus. Utilization of the existing boiler of the sugar mill accompanied by a small medium pressure boiler was sufficient to meet the energy demands of the combined sugar mill and biorefinery for the 1G scenario. Conversely, the increased energy demand of the 2G and 1G2G scenarios required replacement of the existing sugar mill boiler with a new combined heat and power plant. The profitability of each scenario was assessed in terms of the required minimum selling price (MSP) for an acceptable return on investment. The 2G PEF scenario was the least profitable with a MSP of 4.26 USD kg −1 , whereas the 1G2G scenario (MSP of 2.39 USD kg −1 ) was more profitable due to economies of scale and other synergistic benefits of feedstock co‐processing, such as increased sugar concentration, which reduced the energy demands and the cost of downstream recovery. The 1G PEF scenario was the most profitable due to low capital cost and energy requirements associated with 1G conversion, with an MSP of 1.82 USD kg −1 , approximately 77% higher than the market price of fossil‐based PET in 2019 (1.03 USD kg −1 ) to which PEF is functionally equivalent. The MSPs of PEF determined in this work is competitive with Avantium's forecast PEF market prices for mainstream and high value applications and the insights provided could encourage further development of sustainable PEF biorefineries. © 2022 The Authors.

pub.1163099882,Pre-Treatment of Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunches with Sea Water Improves the Qualities of Lignocellulose Biomass,"Oil palm is an essential crop commodity in Malaysia, and the country is home to one of the world’s major manufacturers of items derived from oil palm. The by-products of oil palm trees include a wealth of biomass resources, which enables them to be put to a variety of further productive uses. These include the production of bio-diesel, palm composite, pulp, and paper. In order to successfully execute a circular economy over the long term, biorefineries are an absolutely necessary component. They must be created extensively and reclaimed building blocks from items that have been converted because they are dependent on renewable resources. The utilization of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock results in significant value addition and is an essential component of a bio-based economy. The separation of the biomass’ substrate specificity enables the production of distinct product flows that were not previously conceivable. Despite the fact that biorefineries investigate biochemical, morphological, and physiological processes in order to perform fractionation, hydrolysis, and fermentation, the amount of fresh water that is used raises worries about the quality of the water as well as economic costs. In order for biorefineries to become financially and environmentally sustainable systems, it is vital for these facilities to implement technologies that make use of non-potable resources for biomass. In order to reduce the amount of fresh water needed, efforts are being undertaken to switch to using salt water instead. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to offer a comprehensive analysis of biorefineries that are supported by salt water, with an emphasis on the transformation of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel and other value-added products. Techniques such as ultrasonic irradiation, extraction of supercritical fluids (such as carbon dioxide, water, and ethanol), hydrodynamic cavitation, electromagnetic disturbance, and pre-treatment of base fluid are among those that are described in this book. Significant progress in research pertaining to the pre-treatment of biomass prior to the biological conversion process is still required before biorefineries that employ other water sources, such as salt water, can become economically viable in the future. In a similar manner, the addition of NaCl to the sugarcane bagasse that had been subjected to hydrothermal pre-treatment and artificial sea water led to an increase in the yield of XOS. It is well known that factors such as temperature and salinity can influence the effectiveness of pre-treatments that use sea water. Pre-treatment biomass hydrolysis is necessary for biorefineries that use lignocellulose monomer conversion methods. Halophilic enzymes negatively charged surface makes them beneficial in a variety of circumstances, including seawater-based biorefineries and ionic liquids prior to salt-catalyzed pre-treatments."
pub.1125265109,High Performance Bioelectrocatalytic Interconversion Between Formate and Carbon Dioxide,"An interconversion of HCOO-/CO2 is one of essential requirements for carbon-based sustainable energy economy. However, when CO2 is reduced and HCOO- is oxidized directly on electrodes, carbon monoxide is generated and quite high overpotential is required. One of the most promising strategies for solving these issues is the utilization of enzymes as catalysts. Enzymes allow the system to function in a specific biological reaction under mild conditions. The electro-enzymatic devices can be used as energy conversion system such as HCOO-/O2 biofuel cells and an efficient bioelectrochemical system of the CO2 reduction. We focused on the catalytic properties of tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (FoDH1; EC 1.2.1.2) from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 to construct a bioelectrochemical interconversion system of HCOO-/CO2. FoDH1 is a heterodimeric soluble enzyme and catalyzes the oxidation of HCOO- to CO2 in coupled reduction of NAD+ to NADH. In this study, we have found that FoDH1 catalyzes both of the HCOO- oxidation and the HCO3 - reduction with several artificial redox partners (mediators). The bi-molecular reaction rate constants between FoDH1 and mediators and show a linear free energy relationship. The reversible reaction between HCOO- and CO2 through FoDH1 has been realized on cyclic voltammetry by using methyl viologen (MV) as a mediator and by adjusting pH from the thermodynamic viewpoint. The steady-state voltammograms with two-way bioelectrocatalytic properties are interpreted on a simple model by considering the solution equilibrium. Furthermore, we have constructed a light driven HCOO- production system using a spinach thylakoid membrane, MV, and FoDH1. When the interconversion between HCOO- and CO2 is applied to the construction of efficient bioelectrochemical devices, a large current density should be realized at potentials close to the formal potential of the HCOO-/CO2 couple (E°'CO2). We show a great possibility of MET-type bioelectrocatalysis in the HCOO- oxidation and the CO2 reduction at high current densities and low overpotentials. For the HCOO- oxidation, a high limiting current density (j lim) of about 24 mA cm- 2 was realized with a half wave potential (E 1/2) of only 0.12 V more positive than E°'CO2 at 30 °C in the presence of MV2+ as a mediator. When a viologen-functionalized polymer was co-immobilized with FoDH1 on the porous electrode, j lim of about 30 mA cm- 2 was attained at 60 °C with E 1/2 = E°'CO2 + 0.13 V. On the other hand, the CO2 reduction was also realized at j lim of about 15 mA cm- 2 with E 1/2 = E°'CO2 – 0.04 V at pH 6.6 and at 60 °C in the presence of MV. This is the first report of the enzyme-based bioelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction at such low overpotential and a high j lim. The present results are very useful to construct an effective bioelectrochemical reaction for the CO2 reduction and HCOO-/O2 biofuel cells as effective energy conversion systems."
pub.1142416305,Effect of environmental variables on Green Buying Intention in different Purchase Situations,"Green Marketing acquired high importance due to governmental regulations applicable across sectors. These regulations follow global changes in economic relations, political alignments, environmental treaties and technological developments. As per Raju et al (2012), biofuel production in India increased from 0.01 million tonnes to 21.0 million tonnes in 2010. Different climate change conferences like the one concluded in Doha recently influence global view on sustainability. Industry also follows the global view and has embraced Green Marketing. Many firms have upgraded to environment friendly technology and have modified their promotions. This includes new greener products by Unilever, ITC, McDonalds, Whirlpool, Indian Oil, Wipro, and Nerolac. This also includes environment friendly services by Tata group, State Bank of India and others in India. Consumer research on analyzing effect of such factors on consumer purchase intention in different buying situations is yet to be done. This research aims to study effect of these environmental variables on Green Buying Intention in different Purchase Situations. Participants had to choose one out of six listed products that they can recall to have bought recently. Questions utilized Likert-type scale for six preference options. Elements of Marketing Mix varied were product quality (product), price, promotion and availability (place). Determination of factors is done by utilizing procedures (Bryant and Yarnold, 1995; Brown, 2009; Malhotra and Dash, 2009) of Percent of Cumulative Variance, Kaiser’s Stopping Rule, Scree Test, Number of non-trivial factors and Split-half reliability. Consumers’ preference towards green products is higher if these provide combination of societal benefit, environmental benefit, economic sense and improved technology. Example of this is usage of CNG driven vehicles in cities like Delhi, India. This required consumer to first incur expenses and then recover those by reduced cost of usage. In case of Extended PSBS, GovtRegulation has ‘very good’ factor loading on first component. Consumers have relatively high abundance of time and there is high involvement of consumer in case of Extended PSBS like buying of a car/house. Implications:Efforts in Green Marketing need to be differently focused in different buying conditions. On one hand, some factors affect both types of purchase situations. Companies need to ensure that Society, Environment, Economy, and Technology should be given due importance in their overall green marketing programs irrespective of the type of purchase situation. On the other hand, Quality and Govt Regulation behave differently in each purchase situation. In good economic conditions, a product of habitual PSBS having good quality and availability will be bought by consumers readily. Also, consumers in habitual PSBS intend to purchase a green product if regulation supports promotion and price. Contrast this with Extended PSBS, in which Quality combines with Tech"

pub.1155509404,Food Production and Amazon Preservation are Not Mutually Exclusive: Exploring Feasible Avenues from the Perspective of Land Use Related NDCs in Brazil,"The COP21 Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) have proven to be milestones in the operationalization of climate action at the country-level, particularly in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. In Brazil, AFOLU-related NDC actions in its first version envisaged the elimination of, for instance: illegal deforestation in the Amazon region, the restoration and reforestation of 12 million hectares of severely degraded lands, and the substantial expansion of sustainably produced biofuels by 2030. While Brazilian Government commitment to these NDC targets soon vanished, a specific analytical question concerns as to how far sustainable land use scenarios can contribute to non-climate benefits (i.e., socioeconomic development) despite their internal challenges of harmonizing them with environmental protection and climate change mitigation. In this paper, we analyse the potential socioeconomic and environmental synergies and trade-offs in NDC implementation, given the possibility of the demand for land in Brazil increase due to agricultural and livestock expansion. We focus our analysis on GDP growth, income distribution, and food security. We do so by integrating land-use with computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and running policy scenarios, emulating different levels of NDC and development policy implementation. Our analysis helps us to understand how social and economic outcomes do change under varying levels of commitment by decision-makers. It shows that NDC implementation in Brazil is preferable to a business-as-usual development pathway, particularly when climate change is taken into consideration. While GDP and household income appear unaffected by NDC implementation, reducing the pressure over Amazon deforestation along with other social benefits appears under more stringent NDC implementation. Those results are particularly important given the significant upward trend in Amazon deforestation recorded in the last few years and the loss of purchasing power of low-income classes observed since 2015 in Brazil. In the AFOLU sector, NDC implementation, as in its first version, could thus act as entry points for alternative development pathways. For instance, such as the ones discussed under green economy or low carbon growth paradigms - although, possible trade-offs between agricultural and other sectors will still need to be closely monitored."

Forest and forest products are used as raw materials, intermediate or final goods in different fields in many countries of the world and make an important contribution to economic indicators such as growth, employment, gross national product. Their preference is increasing day by day in terms of environment and human health, as well as economic and economic costs due to the natural and organic nature of these products used in different ways.

pub.1107839818,Chapter Ten Future Role of Bioenergy,"Bioenergy is the main source of renewable energy worldwide and it is expected to continue to play a significant role in the future energy system. Biomass availability, competition between the alternative uses of biomass, as well as the sustainability issues are major concerns for bioenergy deployment. Despite large uncertainties, most estimates show that biomass is likely to be sufficient to play a significant role in the global energy supply system. Bioenergy could expand from current 56 EJ to 145 EJ by 2060, with an increased role of modern bioenergy on behalf of traditional use of biomass. Bioenergy can have a particular contribution to decarbonizing certain sectors for which there are no other options or they are very limited, such as in the freight road transport, aviation, and maritime transport. The future contribution of bioenergy depends on the capacity to mobilize large amounts of biomass. Biomass trade (either direct or indirect) would play an increasing role in the future development of bioenergy. Policy support is needed to reach the energy and climate targets and to ensure a competitive, sustainable, and secure energy. The latest developments in renewables and technology improvements led to a major decrease in the investment costs (mostly for wind and solar photovoltaic) and thus to significant cost reduction. Bioenergy can be competitive in many cases, especially when cheap or even negative cost of biomass feedstock is available. Support needs to be tailored to the technology, feedstock, and plant size. An appropriate policy framework and strong policy measures are needed to support the bioenergy and to move toward low-carbon energy system, including targets for emissions reduction, shares of renewable energy, and policies phasing out fossil fuels. Support should be differentiated between technologies, feedstock, and plant size, taking into account specific circumstances to enable balanced market development, adequate energy mix, and ensure the deployment of technologies that are at different level of development. Ensuring sustainability of biomass is a key issue in the wider context of a bio-based economy. Most studies demonstrate that the majority of bioenergy pathways have lower GHG emissions than fossil energy systems if land use changes (direct or indirect) are avoided. GHG emissions will be lower and can be close to carbon neutrality if biomass is produced with low energy input or derived from residue streams, converted with high conversion efficiency and if the energy used is renewable, including for transport. The crucial factors appear to be the amount and type of fossil fuel used to produce, transport, and process the feedstock and the efficiency in the conversion process. Bioenergy production brings significant opportunities to deliver a number of social, environmental, and economic benefits in addition to the climate and energy goals. Bioenergy provides good opportunities for agricultural markets and has the capacity to"
pub.1120053653,Green Mobility Application (GMAP),"Broadly speaking, one of the most important aspects of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations is to increase awareness of people for sustainability related issues namely economic, environmental and social problems. In this direction, it can be concluded that there is a lack of awareness for individuals regarding their habits and their related impacts on sustainability. Especially in developed countries, it is well-known that people are linked to over consumption, overweight, over waste, over pollution and so on. However, most of them are not aware of the results which are caused from their daily activities in terms of pollution, waste, energy footprints and their related effects on global sustainability. Mobility is one such area resulting in that kind of problems especially in urban areas. Our current road-based transportation system which is mainly dependent on automobile use causes a wide range of formidable problems. These include traffic congestion, air pollution, noise, accidents and related fatalities, depletion of non-renewable resources and inaccessibility of amenities and services. To illustrate this, more than one-quarter of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector and light vehicles are responsible for 59% of transportation energy use (see Fig. 1). Due to the accidents on roads, approximately one million people dies except the millions of injuries (WHO, 2010). In addition to that, there are many cities suffering from traffic congestion which slows down daily businesses, causes unreliability in terms of time, results in unpleasant life in urban life and costs billions of dollars to the economies (Everyday Money, 2014; TomTom, 2013). These are just few figures to illustrate detrimental effects of transportation especially due to automobile use in urban areas. Transport demand, however, increases as economic growth increases (EU Energy, 2012) which will make the situation even worse in the upcoming years. Therefore, there are various dimensions of transport system which can be group into three categories: economic, environmental, and social (see Table 1). Given these problems, and their associated economic, environmental, and social impacts, the current transportation system especially in urban areas may be considered as unsustainable from various respects. To counter this challenge of moving towards sustainable transportation, much more effort is needed. According to World Business Council on Sustainable Development (2004), sustainable mobility is defined as ‘the ability to meet the needs of society to move freely, gain access, communicate, trade, and establish relationships without sacrificing other essential human or ecological values today or in the future’. To this end, there are certain areas to focus on to mitigate transport related problems and make a transition towards sustainable transport (C2ES, 2012). Firstly, on the fuels side, transitioning to low-carbon energy sources such as "
pub.1032186800,Enhanced Microbial Process in the Sustainable Fuel Production,"Abstract Various biomass sources, such as wood and other plant materials, animal wastes, food and other industry wastes, household wastes, sludge varieties, marine biomass, peat and other carbon‐rich organic reservoirs, offer raw materials for continuous recycling in sustainable bioindustries. The corresponding circulation of matter also maintains the balance in the ecosystems and is powered mainly by the solar energy. A substantial portion of this energy is stored in different forms of biomasses and is liberated by the microbes in “the economy of the nature.” In order to achieve the goals of sustainable development, human agriculture, industries, and other activities should fit into this framework set by the microbial degradation and the reuse of molecules. Those principles are adaptable into the production of energy and chemicals. Microbes constitute ecosystems of their own, for example, in the intestinal milieu, or in lake sediments. Everywhere, the microbial communities interact with their surroundings. The types of molecular communication in the microscopic level determine the functioning of larger scale ecosystems and also the bioprocesses. In both natural and industrial settings, the ecological principles are alike. Microbes circulate the elements and convert chemical energy into novel formations. If the microbial population is dense and versatile, different species often develop symbiotic forms of action.  Biotechnical processes consist of several steps. In order to achieve optimal biorefining results from a particular process, all these steps require careful consideration. Various biomasses could be combined with each other in order to obtain optimal starting material and conditions in the process. Physicochemical characteristics (dry weight, consistence, pH , etc.) need to be adjusted according to the process needs. Initial steps of sample preparation include homogenization, hydrolysis, and other pretreatments. In most biotechnical procedures, operation temperature plays a significant role. Controlling it becomes more challenging as the biomass volumes increase. Biorefineries could resemble “activity fields” where different substances flow and are then converted further into meaningful direction, adding value into the production process.   Biomass exploitation could be based on the vast potential of biocatalysis in designing processes with positive net energy balance. In microbial fermentations, carbon dioxide is one main product of the biochemical pathways. However, alternative routes for the production of some biochemicals, such as 2,3‐butanediol, with diminished carbon dioxide generation and more substantial recycling of carbon have been found using a testing system for enhanced microbial culturing, the portable microbe enrichment unit ( PMEU ). For example, in the conversion of food industry wastes, levels of 8–10 g/L/h of 2,3‐butanediol have been observed. Also, enhanced productions of organic acids, ethanol and butanol, as well as"

The study approach includes determination of location parameters (potential triticale land area, feedstock collection radius, and transportation distance), on-farm triticale yield, on-farm production cost, and feedstock chemical composition. Subsequently, SuperPro® Designer was used to develop and simulate two processes using both grain and straw: a) integrated process that ferments both pentose and hexose (Process I); b) single process involving fermentation of hexose sugars only, while pentose sugar is diverted for biogas production and then combined with lignin for power generation (Process II). Triticale on-farm yield is analyzed for the range 5.1–6.8 t ha−1 (which corresponds to 74–126 thousand ha of triticale area). Triticale on-farm production cost is $473 ha−1 with corresponding on-farm profit of $570–$1150 ha−1 from grain and straw sale. The integrated grain and straw processing model is developed and simulated for a 200–550 million L annum−1 ethanol biorefinery, with corresponding total capital investment cost of $140–$240 million. Fermenting both grain and straw and using hydrothermal pretreatment for straw resulted a lower equipment purchase cost per litre of ethanol ($0.12–$0.14 L−1) compared with cellulosic ethanol production using other pretreatment methods ($0.60–$1.24 L−1). The process involving fermentation of both pentose and hexose (Process I) is more profitable compared with a hexose-only process (Process II). Ethanol selling price, plant capacity, and feedstock cost all have high impact on net present value. All plants generate negative net present value at ethanol prices of $0.60 L−1 or less, while a price of at least $0.80 L−1 is required for plants with capacity higher than 250 million L to generate positive net present value. This study provides a basis for further articulation of Canada’s triticale biorefinery concept beyond the near-term goal of producing ethanol, namely, sustainable production of a wide array of bioproducts (bioenergy, biofuels, biomaterials, biochemicals, and biologics) to enhance the profitability of the triticale biorefinery and contribute to Canada’s environmental goals for a bio-based economy."
pub.1168712202,Electrochemical Valorization of Glycerol: Catalyst Development and Product Analysis,"The growing interest in biofuels as a substitute for traditional fossil fuels has raised environmental concerns about the extensive production of their by-products. Among these by-product, Glycerol, which accounts for over 10% of the total by-products, resulted in the production of nearly 4 billion liters in 2020. (1) Glycerol is a polyol organic molecule, viscous, and water-soluble liquid that if not disposed of properly, it can have detrimental impacts on the environment, including soil and water pollution, ultimately contributing to an increase in the carbon footprint. Hence, addressing this growing concern has prompted a surge of interest in developing sustainable and economically viable techniques for converting glycerol into value-added products. The electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a cost-effective and reliable method to enable circular economy practices by selectively producing highly value-added products such as dihydroxyacetone, glyceric acid, and glycolic acid from glycerol. However, it requires the development of active, selective, and stable electrocatalysts to steer GOR at low overpotentials. To date, catalysts based on platinum group metals (PGMs) have outperformed other GOR catalysts in terms of activity. However, in addition to the high cost of fabrication, these catalysts are susceptible to surface poisoning by glycerol intermediates, thereby impeding their commercialization due to the absence of long-term stability. (2) As a result, developing electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant element has become the focal point in GOR catalyst research. Here in, we highlight the latest advancements in the development of low-PGM content GOR catalysts. Our discussion focuses on the strategies for understanding how the type and concentration of PGM can influence selectivity, with a particular emphasis on the significance of GOR overpotentials. We also aim to highlight the inconsistencies in GOR product analyses, specifically regarding the use of H-NMR analysis, with an ultimate goal of advancing accurate GOR product quantification.

pub.1154912547,Chapter 4 Phytoremediation of endocrine disrupting pollutants in industrial wastewater,"Phytoremediation is one of the innovative soil/water remediation methods used more and more in complex environments, depending on the nature of the pollutants to be treated. Phytoremediation offers a real alternative, both ecological and landscaped and financial, facing traditional bioremediation techniques. Phytoremediation is plant biotechnology based on the capacity of plants to extract or block pollutants, both in porous, liquid, or gaseous media. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the application of phytoremediation process as the compulsory treatment of industrial wastewater compared to other biological/chemical treatments. Several socioeconomic advantages can be achieved by the use of this process, notably the environmental advantages of bioenergetics and economic and social benefits of the nonexpensive valorization of industrial treated wastewaters. In fact, the evaluation of the effect of phytoremediation on industrial wastewater must focus on three major axes, namely: an agricultural impact, an environmental impact, and a socioeconomic impact. Several socioeconomic advantages can be demonstrated when using this process, which consists of comparing the physicochemical and microbiological quality of wastewater before and after a phytoremediation process. The actors of phytoremediation are the plants, algae (macro- and microalgae), and this photosynthetic organism which can grow in an autotrophic or heterotrophic manner. In general, they are highly efficient in fixing CO2 and in using solar energy to produce biomass. In addition, these organisms absorb mineral nutrients such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium, trace elements (molybdenum, zinc, copper), and CO2 dissolved in water to produce their cellular constituents. These miracle photosynthetic organisms can accumulate, under certain growing conditions, fixed carbon, in the form of lipids called triglycerides. The stored lipids then constitute a carbon reserve for the photosynthetic organism/microorganism. These lipids can easily be transformed into biodiesel (third generation biofuel) by transesterification. Phytoremediation was also used to decontaminate water charged with organic matter or various contaminants such as the hydrocarbon metal, the organochlorines, and the heavy metals. In this chapter, we focused on the phytoremediation of EDCs process as an efficient, an economical process very relevant for the industrial wastewater. Likewise, the miracle role of the different actors (photosynthetic species) of phytoremediation has been highlighted. As a result, several socioeconomic advantages can be achieved by the phytoremediation process of industrial wastewater, notably the perfect harmony with recent developments in the economy of sustainable development and the environmental governance."

pub.1147959643,The Economic Impact of a Renewable Biofuels/Energy Industry Supply Chain Using the Renewable Energy Economic Analysis Layers Modeling System,"The University of Tennessee’s (UT) Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics models supply chains for both liquid and electricity generating technologies currently in use and/or forthcoming for the bio/renewable energy industry using the input–output model IMPLAN®. The approach for ethanol, biodiesel, and other liquid fuels includes the establishment and production of the feedstock, transportation of the feedstock to the plant gate, and the one-time investment as well as annual operating of the facility that converts the feedstock to a biofuel. This modeling approach may also include the preprocessing and storage of feedstocks at depots. Labor/salary requirements and renewable identification number (RIN) values and credits attributable to the conversion facility, along with land-use changes for growing the feedstock are also included in the supply chain analyses. The investment and annual operating of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation for wind, solar, and digesters are modeled as well. Recent modeling emphasis has centered on the supply chain for liquid fuels using the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s 179 economic trading areas as modeling regions. These various data layers necessary to estimate the economic impact are contained in UT’s renewable energy economic analysis layers (REEAL) modeling system. This analysis provides an example scenario to demonstrate REEAL’s modeling capabilities. The conversion technology modeled is a gasification Fischer–Tropsch biorefinery with feedstock input of 495,000 metric tons per year of forest residue transported to a logging road that is less than one mile in distance. The biorefinery is expected to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), diesel, and naphtha. An estimated one million tons of forest residue are required at fifty percent moisture content. Based on a technical economic assessment (TEA) developed by the Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) and the quantity of hardwood residues available in the Central Appalachian region, three biorefineries could be sited each utilizing 495,000 dry metric tons per year. Each biorefinery could produce 47.5 million liters of SAF, 40.3 million liters of diesel, and 23.6 million liters of naphtha. Annual gross revenues for fuel required for the biorefineries to break even are estimated at $193.7 million per biorefinery. Break-even plant gate fuel prices when assuming RINs and 12.2 percent return on investment are $1.12 per liter for SAF, $1.15 per liter for diesel, and $0.97 per liter for naphtha. Based on IMPLAN, an input–output model, and an investment of $1.7 billion, the estimated economic annual impact to the Central Appalachian region if the three biorefineries are sited is over a half a billion dollars. Leakages occur as investment dollars leaving the region based on the regions local purchase coefficients (i.e., LPPs), which totals $500 million. This results in an estimated $2.67 billion in economic activity with a multiplier o"

pub.1122072079,"Process Intensification, Design Methodologies","Process intensification (PI) can bring significant reductions not only in the equipment requirement but also in the associated energy demands, the inventory of hazardous materials, and waste streams handling. Although most of these goals are not new to chemical engineering, PI goes beyond the traditional approach, since it focuses on designing innovative process and equipment, as miniaturized units, multifunctional systems, hybrid separations, as well as in the integration of alternative energy sources. This chapter introduces the general principles of PI, comparing the different types of intensified processes. It discusses the potential exploitation of these new technologies and seeks to identify the major barriers for its industrial application. In the past few years, the application of process intensification strategies has attracted attention, since it leads to the development of production processes with reduced energy consumption and increased efficiency. In the production processes, reactors constitute a key element for the conversion of raw materials to products; therefore, the efforts have been focused on the proposal of novel and improved equipment. In particular, microreactors have small size, minor residence times, an efficient mass and heat transfer, and high yields. This technology has been applied for the generation of several products, such as organic compounds, nanoparticles, polymers, among others. In particular, the application of microreactors for the production of biofuels is a powerful technology to obtain competitive carburant, both technically and economically. Thus, in this chapter, a revision of the design methodologies for microreactors is presented, along with the applications and technological advances of microreactors for biofuels production. The enhancement of heat transfer consists of the augmentation of the rate of heat transfer to achieve a fixed heat duty in a smaller surface area within the limitations of pressure drop. The main feature of a suitable application is characterized by the maximization of the heat transfer with a minimum increase of pressure drop. Broadly speaking, heat transfer can be enhanced via the increase of fluid velocity, using new heat transfer surfaces or using turbulence promoters. This chapter describes each of these alternatives. It starts by analyzing the fundamental principles of single-phase heat transfer and the relation between velocity, heat transfer coefficient, and pressure drop. Next, the advent of new and compact heat transfer technologies is discussed, then the use of turbulence promoters and their thermohydraulic performance is covered. Finally, the extension to heat recovery networks and the application to multistream heat exchanger technology is described. Intensified processes where reaction and separation are simultaneously carried out in the same equipment represent an attractive option to substitute the traditional reaction-separation sequences. Reactive absorption is"
pub.1171655733,"BIOBUTANOL. PRODUCERS, SUBSTRATES, CULTIVATION AND RECOVERY","The rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves and unpredictable fluctuations in crude oil prices due to geopolitical instability and rising energy demand have spurred research and development of various alternative fuels, especially biomass fuels. This shift has also been fuelled by environmental concerns arising fromgrowing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, which have exacerbated the need for the most environmentally friendly type of fuel. In recent decades, several international projects focused on leveraging renewable energy sources for primary consumption have emerged. Notably, there has been a growing industrial focus on producing liquid biofuels like ethanol and butanol from specific renewable biomass sources such as agricultural residues, forest waste, or energy crops. While the term “biomass” has varied interpretations across different fields, Ukraine’s “Law on Alternative Fuels” provides a basic definition: it defines biomass as “a non-fossil biologically renewable organic substance, including products, waste, and residues from forestry, agriculture (plant and animal husbandry), fisheries, and related industries, as well as any industrial or household waste that can decompose biologically.”Biobutanol’s high energy density, low volatility, and potential for carbon neutrality make it a promising alternative to gasoline. It can be used as a fuel in road vehicles without any modifications to the internal combustion engine system. Many countries, including Ukraine, heavily rely on imported energy sources, driving a critical search for renewable alternatives. Over 50 countries now legally support developing renewable energy, switching to biofuels like biogas (produced from organic waste), bioethanol (e.g., from corn starch), biobutanol (from plant oils), and diesel biofuel, derived from various organic materials like agricultural and energy crops, forestry residues, and municipal waste. This transition is crucial for strengthening energy security, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting sustainable development. The monograph reflects the current state of development of various methods of biobutanol production, highlights the scientific basis of butanol production using microbiological synthesis in laboratory and industrial conditions, the history of its origin and development, the specifics and possibilities of its production, producers, substrates and equipment. Special attention in the monograph is paid to the history of industrial butanol production including recent advances in butanol production by ABE fermentation, highlighting its several new approaches. Thelatteris based on the search for inexhaustible and low-cost substrates and optimization of processes at the beginning and end of the technological chain. Since the production of butanol by ABE fermentation consists of several critical stages, the whole process in this monograph is described in five main phases: 1) selection of raw materials, 2) preliminary preparation of raw"
pub.1174889990,(Invited) Integrated Chemocatalytic Conversion of Cellulosic Biomass to Gasoline Blended Fuel Using a Multifunctional Nano-Catalysts,"The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in India has initiated several programs to promote effective ways of utilizing biomass energy to boost the country's economy. In order to improve the effective use of biomass resources, the initiative for biomass power and cogeneration has adopted the use of bagasse-based cogeneration and biomass power generation in sugar mills. Because of its remarkable characteristics, including its high-octane number, low cetane number, and significant heat of vaporization, bioethanol is considered as a desirable biofuel. In addition, the increased biofuel production, in particular bioethanol, satisfies the criteria of the energy demand. These criteria include the fuel's ability to be blended with gasoline and diesel, as well as standards for low-carbon fuels.  Chemocatalytic conversion using nanowire catalysts reduce side reactions caused on by an intermediate product while facilitating cascade reactions that lead to a desired product. In this work, metal oxide nanowires (TiO 2 and WO 3 ) were synthesised using a plasma-assisted method and metal nanoparticles (Pt and Ru) were impregnated on the as-synthesised NWs. In a high-pressure slurry batch reactor, reactions were carried out to obtain the optimal conditions for the desired product. The catalysts were characterised to reveal the catalysts-activity relationship. Various analytical techniques were used to quantify the liquid and gaseous products collected after the reactions.   The direct conversion of cellulose to C 2 -C 3 alcohols using tungsten-based co-catalysts was enhanced even at low temperatures. X-ray photoelectrons spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman analysis show the oxygen vacancy (Ov) enrichment on the surface of Pt/TiO 2 in presence of tungsten co-catalysts which improved their catalytic activity. The role of metallic platinum (Pt o ) was also investigated and found to have a linear relationship with the activity as follows: H 2 WO 4 > (NH 4 ) 6 H 2 W 12 O 40 .xH 2 O > H 3 PW 12 O 40 . Maximum yields of 32.33% and 51.52% of ethanol and propane-2-ol at optimum temperatures of 220℃ and 250℃, respectively, were obtained with H 2 WO 4 . Catalytic reaction performed using tandem catalytic system gives a high ethanol yield of 25.56%, which is low as compared to an integrated catalytic system. Based on the experimental results, the reaction pathway is proposed which elaborates the activation and cleavage of specific C-C and C-O bonds.   Moreover, the dual functionality of tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) nanorods as support and co-catalyst was also studied, enhances the catalytic behaviour, and the promotional study of W was studied for delivering a high yield of ethanol to 43.98% under optimum reaction conditions. The cellulose conversion was calculated to be 98.5%. The XPS study reveals the oxidation state of WO 3 employing the change in catalytic activity before and after the addition of co-catalysts. The electron-deficient state of the metallic component (Ru o ) is"
pub.1020926717,- From Biodiesel and Bioethanol to Liquid Hydrocarbon Fuels: New Hydrotreating and Advanced Microbial Technologies,"Petroleum, natural gas and coal, the so-called fossil fuels, supply most of the energy consumed worldwide and their exploitation has allowed our society to reach unprecedented levels of development during the past century. However, the large-scale consumption of these natural resources is associated with a number of important issues. First, combustion of fossil fuels for energy production releases large amounts of CO2 (a greenhouse gas, GHG) into the atmosphere. This anthropogenic CO2 cannot be fixed by plants at the current rates at which it is evolved thereby leading to accumulation and global warming. [1] In this sense, recent studies estimate that the burning of fossil fuels is responsible for 70% of the global warming problem. [2] Second, the uneven geographical distribution of fossil fuel reserves, which in some cases are located in socio-politically unstable regions, is the origin of multiple political and economic issues worldwide, and obligates transportation of the fossil fuel over long distances to ensure supply to non-producer countries. Third, fossil fuel reserves are becoming less accessible with time, and their current consumption rate-boosted by the growing needs of industrialized countries and the rapid development of emerging economies-is, by far, higher than the natural regeneration cycle which inevitably leads to depletion within a few decades. [3] In order to address these important concerns, a series of initiatives spurred by governments are trying to develop alternatives to fossil fuels which can progressively displace these nonrenewable resources in our current energy system. In this sense, a range of well-distributed carbonfree renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal activity can substitute natural gas and coal in the production of heat and electricity, while biomass, the only sustainable source of organic carbon in earth, has been pointed out as the perfect equivalent to petroleum for the production of fuels, chemicals and carbonbased materials. [4] Petroleum is the world’s primary source of energy and chemicals and, among fossil fuels, is the resource with the shortest expected lifetime. More than 80 millions of barrels are consumed worldwide on a daily basis, and projections indicate that demand for crude oil will increase by 30% within the next 20 years. [5] A large fraction of the extracted crude (7080%) ends up as fuels after processing in refi neries to cover the elevated demand of the transportation sector, which is the largest and fastest growing energy sector and it is responsible for almost one third of the total energy consumed worldwide. [1] An eventual replacement of oil by biomass will thus necessarily involve the development of new technologies for the large-scale production of fuels from this resource, the so-called biofuels."

pub.1003645694,Introduction to “Stopping Climate Change: The Case for Coal and Hydrogen”,"There are two grave threats to modern civilization: Climate Change, and Continued reliance on imported oil from the volatile Middle East. Both of these threats can be ameliorated by the development of hydrogen and particularly hydrogen made from coal as a major energy carrier to replace oil products such as gasoline and diesel fuel to power our motor vehicleswith electricity made by gasifying coal (rather than burning coal) with carbon capture and storage/sequestration (CCS). Most discussions of climate change emphasize extreme weather events, rising temperatures and rising sea levels. While these aspects of climate change may be very disruptive, the real catastrophic impact of climate change may be our inability to provide enough food for a growing world population due to the confluence of higher temperatures that reduce food production, coupled with increased global consumption of meat that requires more crop production than eating fruits, vegetables and grains as people aspire to the living standards in developed nations, and the production of biofuels from crops (Biofuels can also be produced from waste products such as municipal solid waste (MSW) without impacting crop production.) that limits farm land available for food production. Powering our light duty vehicles with hydrogen made from coal, and our electricity from a combination of nuclear energy, renewables and natural gas and coal gasification with carbon capture and storage/sequestration (In Carbon capture and sequestration, the carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) is recovered at the power plant, compressed, and shipped by pipeline to an underground storage cavern where it is buried underground, thereby preventing the CO2 from entering the atmosphere where it would have exacerbated the impact of climate change.) (CCS) would drastically reduce or even eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, (The U.S. petroleum production is sufficient to supply all non-transportation oil requirements.) and, if the rest of the world follows our lead, could eliminate the influence of OPEC and our dependence oil imported from the volatile Middle East, and this approach would allow us to meet the climate change goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 while relying primarily on our huge inventory of domestic coal to supply both hydrogen and electricity. Many advocates of using hydrogen as a zero-emission energy carrier envision a future where hydrogen is produced by electrolyzing water using renewable energy. While this vision of a renewable hydrogen economy may be a long-term goal for society, it might be too costly or take too long to make the transition from our current predominantly coal- and natural gas-based electricity generation system and our nearly total dependence on oil products for transportation to an all-renewable future in the next few decades. This book therefore explores a more plausible transition strategy using coal, natural gas, renewab"
pub.1037027429,Thermotolerant Yeasts for Bioethanol Production Using Lignocellulosic Substrates,"No other sustainable option for production of transportation fuels can match ethanol made from lignocellulosic biomass with respect to its dramatic environmental, economic, strategic and infrastructure advantages. Substantial progress has been made in advancing biomass ethanol (bioethanol) production technology to the point that it now has commercial potential, and several firms are engaged in the demanding task of introducing first-of-a-kind technology into the marketplace to make bioethanol a reality in existing fuel-blending markets. In order to lower pollution India has a long-term goal to use biofuels (bioethanol and biodiesel). Ethanol may be used either in pure form, or as a blend in petrol in different proportions. Since the cost of raw materials, which can account up to 50 % of the total production cost, is one of the most significant factors affecting the economy of alcohol, nowadays efforts are more concentrated on using cheap and abundant raw materials. Several forms of biomass resources exist (starch or sugar crops, weeds, oil plants, agricultural, forestry and municipal wastes) but of all biomass cellulosic resources represent the most abundant global source. The lignocellulosic materials include agricultural residues, municipal solid wastes (MSW), pulp mill refuse, switchgrass and lawn, garden wastes. Lignocellulosic materials contain two types of polysaccharides, cellulose and hemicellulose, bound together by a third component lignin. The principal elements of the lignocellulosic research include: i) evaluation and characterization of the waste feedstock; ii) pretreatment including initial clean up or dewatering of the feedstock; and iii) development of effective direct conversion bioprocessing to generate ethanol as an end product. Pre-treatment of lignocellulosic materials is a step in which some of the hemicellulose dissolves in water, either as monomeric sugars or as oligomers and polymers. The cellulose cannot be enzymatically hydrolyzed to glucose without a physical and chemical pre-treatment. The pre-treatment processes normally applied on the different substrates are acidic hydrolysis, steam explosion and wet oxidation. A problem for most pretreatment methods is the generation of compounds that are inhibitory towards the fermenting microorganisms, primarily phenols. Degradation products that could have inhibitory action in later fermentation steps are avoided during pre-treatment by wet oxidation. Followed by pre treatment, hydrolysed with enzymes known as cellulases and hemicellulases, which hydrolyse cellulose and hemicellulose respectively. The production of bioethanol requires two steps, fermentation and distillation. Practically all ethanol fermentation is still based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The fermentation using thermotolerant yeasts has more advantageous in that they have faster fermentation rates, avoid the cooling costs, and decrease the over all fermentation costs, so that ethanol can be made available at "
pub.1169591768,Growing perennial rhizomatous grasses on contaminated land: a strategy for combining phyto-management with sustainable biomass production?,"To investigate this strategy, 15 field scale trials were implemented in five countries [1].  These have evaluated the performance of Phalaris, Miscanthus, 2 x Saccharum and 2 x Pennisetum species for combined energy crop production, phyto-remediation and or phyto-management of contaminated land in Brazil and Europe.  Reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) is a native perennial rhizomatous C3 species suitable for non-agricultural or marginal lands and climatic zones such as Scotland (where C4 Miscanthus x giganteous cannot be grown effectively).  Our phytoremediation trials using Phalaris in Italy and Ukraine are the first we are aware of. Given the wide variety of non-agricultural marginal lands [2], species selection must combine significant biomass production on marginal land with acceptable levels of biomass contamination for subsequent use or energy conversion.  Whereas specialist hyperaccumulator plants may achieve higher absolute concentrations of contaminants and exhibit greater bioconcentration and translocation factors, their inherently lower biomass productivity means that both biomass, energy yield and total mass of contaminants removed per unit area will be relatively small.  In contrast, high yielding, low contaminant uptake characteristics, such as for conventional energy crop species, would result in greater energy production, economic viability and greater potential for biomass utilisation. In the UK the CERESiS project has utilised long-term field trials originally established during the BioReGen (Biomass, Remediation, re-Generation: Reusing Brownfield Sites for renewable energy crops) EU Life demonstration Project (LIFE05 ENV/UK/000128) in 2007.  These allowed direct comparison of the actual contaminant removal rates of three crop species:  Although the biomass of Miscanthus and short-rotation coppice Salix contained higher concentrations of certain elements, Phalaris far out-performed these in terms of biomass, ease and economy of production [3].  Surprisingly, despite lower contaminant concentrations in Phalaris, such was the increased biomass yield that the total mass removed was still greater than for Miscanthus or Salix.  Likewise Pennisetum (Napier and Capiaçu grasses) shows similar promise in Brazil as the most productive, resulting in the highest offtake of Cr from soils contaminated with this element.  This suggests that low-uptake phyto-excluding plants which can tolerate contaminated soils and grow productively might still represent the best and most economically viable option for clean-up of contaminated sites. Meanwhile this nature-based solution can simultaneously deliver a variety of wider societal and environmental benefits, such as greening-up derelict land or the enhanced storage of carbon in soil [4]. This paper will investigate this strategy by comparing biomass yield, biomass contamination and the calculated offtake of contaminants for a wide range of generic contaminants across all of the CERESiS trial sit"

decomposition of organic matter but replacement of base cations and
phosphorus, lost through harvesting of biomass/biofuels or leaching,
requires de novo supply of fresh nutrients released through weathering of soil
parent material (minerals and rocks). Weathering involves physical and
chemical processes that are modified by biological activity of plants,
microorganisms and animals. This article reviews recent progress made in
understanding biological processes contributing to weathering. A perspective
of increasing spatial scale is adopted, examining the consequences of
biological activity for weathering from nanoscale interactions, through in vitro and
in planta microcosm and mesocosm studies, to field experiments, and finally ecosystem
and global level effects. The topics discussed include the physical
alteration of minerals and mineral surfaces; the composition, amounts,
chemical properties, and effects of plant and microbial secretions; and the
role of carbon flow (including stabilisation and sequestration of C in organic
and inorganic forms). Although the predominant focus is on the effects of
fungi in forest ecosystems, the properties of biofilms, including bacterial
interactions, are also discussed. The implications of these biological
processes for modelling are discussed, and we attempt to identify some key
questions and knowledge gaps, as well as experimental approaches and areas
of research in which future studies are likely to yield useful results. A
particular focus of this article is to improve the representation of the
ways in which biological processes complement physical and chemical
processes that mobilise mineral elements, making them available for plant
uptake. This is necessary to produce better estimates of weathering that are
required for sustainable management of forests in a post-fossil-fuel
economy. While there are abundant examples of nanometre- and micrometre-scale
physical interactions between microorganisms and different minerals, opinion
appears to be divided with respect to the quantitative significance of these
observations for overall weathering. Numerous in vitro experiments and microcosm

the allocation of plant-derived carbon, mineral dissolution and plant

pub.1042236787,Landscape Hydrology of Rural Areas: Challenges and Tools,"Currently the world hosts seven billion people that require food. About one third of the earth’s land area is now intensively used by agriculture, and another third extensively. Agriculture inevitably depends on soil quality as well as on water resources. More than 70 % of human water use is due to irrigation. In addition, transpiration from rainfed agriculture comprises a substantial part of the earth’s water cycle. Thus, land use both highly depends and affects water availability and is intimately intertwined with water resources management. The term “landscape” is used here to account for a variety of feedback effects between natural resources, human land use, economy and demography. The world population continues to increase. In addition, growth of economic wealth in many countries increased demand for upmarket agricultural products, and there is increasing demand for biofuel production as well which increases pressure on soil and water at a global scale. During the last 50 years cultivated area per capita decreased by half and likely will continue to decrease. Thus there is urgent need for advanced concepts of sustainable use of water and soil resources. Already today groundwater and river water over-exploitation due to increasing irrigation is a matter of concern. In some regions groundwater levels have been decreasing by 1 m per year during the last decades. Even large rivers fell increasingly dry. This has severe implications for water resources further downstream, not to mention biodiversity aspects. For example, the Aral Sea has been shrinking by more than 90 % within a few decades, giving place to a hostile salt desert. Thus, inefficient water management and land degradation are closely connected to each other. Climate change is now considered an increasing threat on water resources. Increasing air temperature is often associated with increasing evapotranspiration and thus increasing utilization of rare water resources. However, this is an oversimplification. On the one hand, warmer air masses can transport more water vapour, and increasing temperature comes along with increasing energy for mass transport which could even increase precipitation. In addition, higher CO2 partial pressure likely will increase water use efficiency of plants and thus reduce water consumption. On the other hand, large scale atmospheric circulation patterns most probably will be affected by climate change and thus change spatial patterns of precipitation which is not trivial to predict. Correspondingly, climate change models are fraught with large uncertainties with respect to precipitation. However, experts agree that in general frequency and intensity of extreme events like floods and drought likely will increase which poses agricultural management and soil resources at increasing risk. Besides, melting of glaciers in mountainous regions currently increases water availability in the lowlands downstream, whereas the opposite is true in the long-term. Thus th"
pub.1129200195,Future Prospects for Brassica Oilseed Improvement through Genomics,"Among cultivated oilseed crops are several members of the Brassicaceae that are grown for seed oil, condiments and seed meal. The major cultivated species are, Brassica napus, Brassica juncea, Brassica rapa, Brassica carinata and Brassica nigra. In addition, there is signifi cant interest in the cultivation of Sinapis alba. Conventional breeding was the main approach to the early adaptation of these species to temperate and subtropical growth conditions and signifi cant improvement was made in yield and oil quality (Stefanson and Hougen 1964; Harvey and Downey 1964; Becker et al. 1999). Brassica napus is now the dominant cultivated species and is grown on more than 25 million hectares worldwide (Commodity Research Bureau 2005). There are several factors likely to increase future demand for vegetable oils from crops such as Brassica oilseeds. The two main drivers are likely to be consumer demand for high quality oils with demonstrable health benefi ts and the trend towards the use of renewable resources as industrial feedstock for manufacture of polymers, biofuels, lubricants and other products, which are now derived from non-renewable resources. To meet this demand, will require a much more effi cient system of crop production where yield is maximized while input of resources is minimized. In addition, Brassica oilseeds will be required to deliver products for a variety of use and this necessitates modifi cation of fatty acid profi le and the protein quality of the seed meal. Plant performance is negatively affected by various biotic and abiotic stresses and tolerance to these stresses is a determinant of yield. For sustained high yield in the future, plants must have the genetic diversity to tolerate these stresses as well as those which are likely to be imposed by climate change where variation in temperature, radiation, atmospheric gases and water limitation will pose major challenges to yield (Watkins 2008; Challinor et al. 2009). Although conventional plant breeding has made a signifi cant contribution to the development of Brassica oilseed cultivars, reliance on the availability of benefi cial alleles in species that allow ready introgression into established cultivars is often limiting. Also, with conventional breeding phenotypic selection is often conducted with little or no knowledge of the regulation or function of genes responsible for selected traits. Consequently, the breeding process is often time consuming and ineffi cient. However, the enormous body of knowledge arising from advances in molecular biology, basic plant biology and genomics is likely to accelerate the pace of Brassica oilseed crop improvement as genes and their functions can now be defi ned and their architecture detailed (Cooper et al. 2004). Therefore, modern plant breeding can now be conducted with a greater understanding of the factors determining phenotypic traits. As knowledge of the genetic control of the phenotype continues to accumulate through the applicati"

pub.1125261064,Bioelectrocatalytic Interconversion Between Formate and Carbon Dioxide By Tungsten-Containing Formate Dehydrogenase," The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to generate reduced carbon compounds for use as fuels and chemical feedstocks is an essential requirement for carbon-based sustainable energy economy. An interconversion system of formate (HCOO - )/CO 2 is one of the answers for the purpose. HCOO - is the first stable intermediate during the reduction of CO 2 to methanol or methane and is increasingly recognized as a new energy source. In addition, it can be easily be handled, stored, and transported. However, when CO 2 is reduced and HCOO - is oxidized directly on electrodes, carbon monoxide is generated and quite high overpotential is required. One of the most promising strategies for solving these issues is the utilization of enzymes as catalysts. Enzymes allow the system to function in a specific biological reaction under mild conditions. The electro-enzymatic devices can be used as energy conversion system such as HCOO - /O 2 biofuel cells and an efficient bioelectrochemical system of the CO 2  reduction.   Here, we have focused on the catalytic properties of tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (FoDH1; EC 1.2.1.2) from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 to construct a bioelectrochemical interconversion system of HCOO - /CO 2 . FoDH1 is a heterodimeric soluble enzyme and catalyzes the oxidation of HCOO - to CO 2 in coupled reduction of NAD + to NADH. In this study, we have found that FoDH1 catalyzes both of the HCOO - oxidation and the CO 2  reduction with several artificial redox partners (mediators). Mediators enable the enzymatic reaction to couple with an electrode reaction by shuttling electrons between enzymes and electrodes. This reaction is called mediated electron transfer (MET)-type bioelectrocatalysis. We have evaluated the bi-molecular reaction rate constants between FoDH1 and mediators and NAD + . They show the property called a linear free energy relationship (LFER), indicating that FoDH1 would have no specificity to NAD + . Similar LFER is also observed for the catalytic reduction of CO 2 . The reversible reaction between HCOO - and CO 2 through FoDH1 has been realized on cyclic voltammetry by using methyl viologen (MV) as a mediator and by adjusting pH from the thermodynamic viewpoint (Fig.1). Potentiometric measurements have revealed that the three redox couples, MV 2+ /MV · + , HCOO - / CO 2 , FoDH1 (ox/red), reach an equilibrium in the bulk solution when the two-way bioelectrocatalysis proceeds in the presence of FoDH1 and MV. The steady-state voltammograms with two-way bioelectrocatalytic properties are interpreted on a simple model by considering the solution equilibrium 1 . Furthermore, we have constructed a light driven HCOO -  production system using a spinach thylakoid membrane, MV, and FoDH1.   When the interconversion between HCOO - and CO 2 is applied to the construction of efficient bioelectrochemical devices, a large current density should be realized at potentials close to the formal potential of the HCOO - /CO 2 coupl"
pub.1033200364,Legumes for mitigation of climate change and the provision of feedstock for biofuels and biorefineries. A review,"Humans are currently confronted by many global challenges. These include achieving food security for a rapidly expanding population, lowering the risk of climate change by reducing the net release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere due to human activity, and meeting the increasing demand for energy in the face of dwindling reserves of fossil energy and uncertainties about future reliability of supply. Legumes deliver several important services to societies. They provide important sources of oil, fiber, and protein-rich food and feed while supplying nitrogen (N) to agro-ecosystems via their unique ability to fix atmospheric N2 in symbiosis with the soil bacteria rhizobia, increasing soil carbon content, and stimulating the productivity of the crops that follow. However, the role of legumes has rarely been considered in the context of their potential to contribute to the mitigation of climate change by reducing fossil fuel use or by providing feedstock for the emerging biobased economies where fossil sources of energy and industrial raw materials are replaced in part by sustainable and renewable biomass resources. The aim of this review was to collate the current knowledge regarding the capacity of legumes to (1) lower the emissions of the key greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) compared to N-fertilized systems, (2) reduce the fossil energy used in the production of food and forage, (3) contribute to the sequestration of carbon (C) in soils, and (4) provide a viable source of biomass for the generation of biofuels and other materials in future biorefinery concepts. We estimated that globally between 350 and 500 Tg CO2 could be emitted as a result of the 33 to 46 Tg N that is biologically fixed by agricultural legumes each year. This compares to around 300 Tg CO2 released annually from the manufacture of 100 Tg fertilizer N. The main difference is that the CO2 respired from the nodulated roots of N2-fixing legumes originated from photosynthesis and will not represent a net contribution to atmospheric concentrations of CO2, whereas the CO2 generated during the synthesis of N fertilizer was derived from fossil fuels. Experimental measures of total N2O fluxes from legumes and N-fertilized systems were found to vary enormously (0.03–7.09 and 0.09–18.16 kg N2O–N ha−1, respectively). This reflected the data being collated from a diverse range of studies using different rates of N inputs, as well as the large number of climatic, soil, and management variables known to influence denitrification and the portion of the total N lost as N2O. Averages across 71 site-years of data, soils under legumes emitted a total of 1.29 kg N2O–N ha−1 during a growing season. This compared to a mean of 3.22 kg N2O–N ha−1 from 67 site-years of N-fertilized crops and pastures, and 1.20 kg N2O–N ha−1 from 33 site-years of data collected from unplanted soils or unfertilized non-legumes. It was concluded that there was little evidence that biological"

Omasta 2 , William E. Mustain 1       1 College of Engineering and Computing, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, United States   2 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Connecticut, United States  Biomass resources prove an ideal alternate to fossil resources and function as the only sustainable source of organic compounds [1]. Today, biomass energy provides approximately 10% of the global total energy needs [2], and plays an important role in contributing to the world’s economy. Thermochemical methods to convert biomass such as gasification, pyrolysis and combustion have been widely used to convert biomass into chemicals and fuels [3]. However, thermochemical conversion methods are notorious for high capital cost, intensive energy consumption and negative environmental impacts [4]. Biological routes like anaerobic digestion for biomass conversion to fermentation products, ethanol and acetic acid, has received great research attention due to its reduced environment footprint and significantly lower energy consumption [5]. However, additional processing steps are needed to be developed in order to convert these liquid products to fuels with a high carbon efficiency and low environment footprint. Electrochemical approaches are ideal in both bases, as they allow for facile pairing with renewable energy and operate at low temperature and pressure. From a chemical processing perspective, acetic acid has not historically been a very attractive product – and nearly all of the biologically-derived acetic acid is sold as vinegar for food. However, biologically-inspired engineered systems that enable the efficient digestion and processing of lignocellulosic biomass may make acetic acid widely available in the near future and it will be imperative that catalytic pathways are established to convert this need feedstock into useful commodity chemicals and/or fuels. In this work, our team developed a two compartment three-electrode operando cell to study the acetate oxidation reaction mechanism. Pt was used as both working and counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was the reference electrode. The cell was designed to have a large electrode surface area with small electrolyte volume. There were 12 products of acetate partial oxidation detected in this work. Nine of these twelve products have been reported before: ethylene, ethane, methane, methanol, methyl acetate, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, hydrogen [6]. The three remaining products: formate, methyl formate, and formaldehyde have not been reported before to the best of our knowledge. By analyzing all of the products against potential, we propose a new complex reaction pathway that is able to account for the production of all the products detected in this study.

pub.1102430573,Addressing Climate Change Without Legislation - Volume 2: FERC,"A significant and growing body of scientific evidence indicates that human activities are contributing to rising temperatures and other climatic variations. The third National Climate Assessment, released on May 6, 2014, estimates that average temperatures in the U.S. have risen by 1.3 to 1.9oF since 1895, with the most recent decade being the hottest ever recorded. This rise has corresponded with a substantial increase in human-induced carbon dioxide emissions. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere has increased by more than forty percent since the Industrial Revolution, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (i.e., coal, oil, and natural gas) in energy production and other human activities. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are expected to cause continued warming, with average global temperatures forecast to rise by up to 10oF during the 21st century. Rising temperatures will lead to more variable precipitation patterns, causing prolonged droughts and flash floods. Other extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, will also become increasingly frequent and severe. Additional climatic changes are also anticipated, including reduced snow and ice cover, accelerated melting of glaciers, and rising sea levels. According to the third National Climate Assessment, these and other changes “will affect human health, water supply, agriculture, transportation, energy...and many other sectors of society, with increasingly adverse impacts on the American economy and quality of life.” The extent of these impacts will depend, in large part, on the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions over coming decades. Recent research suggests that, if all emissions were eliminated now, future temperature increases would be limited to just 0.5oF. This would avoid major changes in precipitation, minimize snow and ice loss, and reduce the risk of sea level rise. Recognizing this, governments around the world have taken steps to minimize carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. This has commonly been achieved by reducing the use of carbon-intensive fossil fuels in electricity generation and other activities. Seeking to encourage such reductions, President Obama has repeatedly called on Congress to enact legislation mitigating climate change. In the absence of Congressional action, the President has used existing executive powers to support climate change mitigation. In the 2013 State of the Union Address, delivered on February 12, President Obama indicated that he would take “executive actions...now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.” Fulfilling this commitment, on June 25, 2013, the President adopted a new Climate Action Plan directing the executive branch to, among other things: • establish carbon pollution standards for new and existing power plants; • encou"

The advantages of biomass and of liquid biofuels, including vegetable oils as fuel sources in the sustainable production of hydrogen gas are then presented. The bulk of this lecture is thereafter concerned with the thermo-chemical means of hydrogen production which are suitable to the conversion of vegetable oil into hydrogen gas. In particular, previous work on the catalytic steam reforming of vegetable oils is summarised and the advantages and drawbacks of conventional steam reforming exposed. The principles behind an exciting novel process of steam reforming called “unmixed steam reforming” (or USR) that is fuelflexible, insensitive to coking, and therefore suitable to unconventional gas and liquid fuels are outlined next. Based on the work carried out at the University of Leeds, preliminary results from tests of the USR process involving sunflower oil fuel are then presented and discussed. To conclude the lecture, future work planned in this area of investigation is outlined. En el trabajo, en breve se consideran los métodos que se utilizan en la producción de hidrógeno contemporánea para las necesidades de la industria de procesamiento del petróleo, tanto como de las futuras tecnologías que se desarrollan actualmente, como preparación de la economía global, basada en la utilización del gas hidrógeno. Luego se da el cuadro de las ventajas de la biomasa y de los biocombustibles líquidos, incluyendo los aceites de origen vegetal, como fuente de combustible en la producción sostenible del hidrógeno en forma de gas. La mayor parte del trabajo se dedica a los procesos termoquímicos en la producción del hidrógeno, que son apropiados para la transformación de aceites vegetales en el hidrógeno gaseoso. Especialmente se está considerando el trabajo que se ha hecho hasta el momento, en cuanto a la oxidación catalítica de carburo de hidrógeno mediante el vapor de agua, tanto como las ventajas y desventajas, en relación con los métodos convencionales. En continuación, está descrito el principio de un proceso de transformación de biogases totalmente nuevo, mediante el vapor de agua, llamado ‘unmixed steam reforming’ (USR), que es ajustable para todos los tipos de biogases, insensible a los problemas de índole termal, y por ello pertinente para la obtención de todos los tipos de biocombustibles gaseosos y líquidos no convencionales.

To achieve these multiple challenges, the bioeconomy has a key role to play, particularly in the deployment of biomass in higher value‐added industrial applications. To support evidence‐based policy modelling, the EU H2020 funded project BioMonitor represents a first step toward both improving data transparency, particularly in bio‐industrial activities, and the creation of a single toolbox for the purpose of performing integrated modelling assessments of the bioeconomy. Comparing with a baseline, this study presents results from a series of medium to long‐term bio‐based industry focused transition narratives. In particular, the focus is on the EU bio‐based chemicals sector employing results from an economy‐wide simulation model from the toolbox, called MAGNET. Publicly backed fiscal support policies, costing between 0.22–0.25% of EU GDP by 2050, generate notable improvements in EU bio‐based chemical sector production and employment generation, as well as synergetic production increases in advanced generation biofuels. There is evidence of decarbonisation in the EU bio‐based chemicals sector, although more tangible improvements are achieved with the implementation of accompanying climate‐ and sustainable bio‐energy policies.
Le Pacte vert de la Commission européenne définit une vision audacieuse pour relever les défis de la protection de la biodiversité et de la neutralité carbone, tout en ouvrant la voie à un modèle circulaire de croissance compétitive et de création d'emplois. Pour relever ces multiples défis, la bioéconomie a un rôle clé à jouer, notamment dans le déploiement de la biomasse dans des applications industrielles à plus forte valeur ajoutée. Pour soutenir la modélisation de politiques fondée sur des données probantes, le projet BioMonitor, financé par le programme Horizon 2020 de l'Union européenne (UE), représente une première étape vers l'amélioration de la transparence des données, en particulier dans les activités bio‐industrielles, et vers la création d'une boîte à outils unique dans le but de réaliser des évaluations de modélisation intégrées de la bioéconomie. Par rapport à une situation de référence, cette étude présente les résultats d'une série de récits de transition axés sur l'industrie biosourcée à moyen et long terme. L'accent est mis en particulier sur le secteur européen des produits chimiques d'origine biologique en utilisant les résultats d'un modèle de simulation à l'échelle de l'économie de la boîte à outils, appelé MAGNET. Les politiques publiques de soutien budgétaire, qui coûteront entre 0.22 et 0.25 % du PIB de l'UE d'ici 2050, génèrent des améliorations notables dans la production du secteur chimique d'origine biologique et la création d'emplois dans l'UE, ainsi que des augmentation"

This analysis is addressed to the study of a feasibility of the agro-industrial chain, including farms and industrial plants, to produce biofuel as though it were an “island economy”, i.e., a net energy exporter only if the energy and economic values of the biofuel and its co-products exceeds that of all direct and indirect energy inputs. More specifically, the analysis is dedicated to economic, energetic and ecological aspects of the energy cogeneration approach that complete the “Island Model”' and demonstrate to be more sustainable to afford competitively the economic and energetic problems. This model is based on sunflower crop used for production of biodiesel, while the co-product sunflower meal is used in the dairy production, the wastes are recycled in biogas production to generate electricity and heat, and the final residual compost is used for fertilization. This integrated farm energy cogeneration project (IFECO) requires to analyze the different steps of the agro-industrial chain and to afford investments in energy plants and operating costs; to manage the integrated agro-industrial energy chain more skilled labour is required; hence, the convenience to operate IFECO will depend on the capacity to organize and coordinate the many activities performed at different chain steps, with achievement of scale and scope economies. The macroeconomic targets as occupation, value added, import of energy products and inflation, justify the public intervention in programs directed to biodiel defiscalization and support of the energy crops such as soybean, sunflower and others. The results obtained from IFECO suggest that the total energy produced by sunflower chain is significantly superior to the energy spent, the economic gain is reflected in a considerable increase in the annual income and value of land from capitalization of permanent net farm income; finally, the life cycle GHG savings from displacing the fossil fuel (reduction in CO, VOC, PM10, SOx, Nox) are a valuable contribution that ameliorate the ecological conditions of the biosphere and must be considered as a market value if the Kyoto Protocol is to be applied. La necesidad creciente de energía, cada vez mayor falta de combustibles fósiles y el cuidado creciente del medio ambiente, han incitado los creadores de la política en los EE.UU. y en Europa, de iniciar una búsqueda de las fuentes de energía alternativas, y el sector agricultor podría ofrecer una solución eficaz para este problema. El objeto de este trabajo es la investigación de las posibilidades de producción de biocombustible en las granjas y en las plantas industriales, como si fueran ellos el ejemplo de la ""economía isleña"" es decir, de ser exportadores de la energa neta,"
pub.1031411635,10-year experience with the Thai national LCI database: case study of “refinery products”,"PurposeDue to various environmental pressures such as climate change and scarcity of natural resources, as well as nontariff barriers from trade partners, Thailand has established the Thai national life cycle inventory (LCI) database in 2006. In the 1st phase (2006–2007), three working groups were developed for natural gas, refinery, and petrochemical products. Another seven working groups were established in the 2nd phase (2007–2010) for ferrous and non-ferrous metals, utilities and transportation, construction materials, agricultural materials and products, basic chemicals, recycling and waste management, and others. In the 3rd phase (2010 to present), expansion of the number of data sets from the previous phases has been carried out. The purpose of this paper is to present the experiences on national database development in emerging countries with the example of Thailand on both strategic and technical levels using refinery products as the case study.MethodsData sets were developed according to ISO 14044:2006. The LCI data were managed and archived at the central facility known as the “central LCI database”. The Life Cycle Assessment lab (LCA lab) at MTEC, NSTDA, has been responsible for the central LCI database management. From 2008 to 2010, the “Thai national LCI database and its applications” project was granted a 3-year funding of over 50 million THB, and was operated under supervision of a steering committee set up by the Ministry of Industry (MoI). For this case study, to illustrate the development process, primary data of the refinery products were collected by Petroleum Institute of Thailand in the year 2005 from seven refineries covering more than 70 % of the production in the country. Attributional modelling has been used, with energy content as an allocation criterion.Results and discussionDuring the initial phase of the “Thai National LCI Database Development Project”, two key barriers have been faced. One was the lack of awareness from stakeholders as LCI and LCA were quite new tools for most people in Thailand. This problem was tackled by collaborating with the right strategic partners to drive the LCI national project and educating stakeholders with the training supports from Japan. The other hindrance was the lack of expertise of local experts on LCA. It took several years to continually build the capacity through seminars and workshops in Thailand and Japan, including “on the job training” on some pilot projects. As of May 2016, there were more than 700 data sets in the Thai national LCI database, considering only the data that MTEC acted as the project commissioner. However, only 515 data were certified as the national database. The other 211 data were qualified merely as the data from pilot projects. More details of the database list and how to access the data can be viewed in Thai language at the URL: http://www.thailcidatabase.net. Because the Thai national LCI data were mostly primary data from a core set of products for "

The key challenges faced by the oil and gas sector are mainly cutting the costs, introducing the cutting edge innovative technologies in the industry to explore more hydrocarbons to keep a balance between supply & demand, improving the environmental footprints, enhancing the life of already discovered sites, discovering new prospects to replace the depleting oil and gas reserves, and maintenance of industrial assets along with maximizing the efficiency of industry as a whole. In the recent years, the world is ramping up the oil and gas production with an aggressive exploration approach. As per different reports, the world achieved a new oil production record of 92.6 million barrels per day in 2017 which was the consecutive 8th year of an increased oil production globally with the United States of America becoming the largest oil producer in the 2017 overreaching 13 million barrels per day for the very first time, while in the same year Saudi Arabia and Russia were at second and third in the list of top oil producing nations with 12 million barrels per day and 11.3 million barrels per day respectively (British Petroleum's Energy Review 2017). As per current estimates the total oil reserves in the world stand at 1.64 – 1.66 trillion barrels of oil (including oil sands reserves) with the largest proven reserves situated in Venezuela (South America) and second largest oil reserves are situated in the Middle Eastern & North African countries (USGS & EIA). The total gas reserves in the world presently stand at 7490 trillion cubic feet of gas with the largest proven reserves situated in the Russian Federation, Caspian Sea, Ukraine, Belarus, Tajikistan and Armenia while the second largest proven reserves of natural gas are situated in the Middle Eastern & North African countries (USGS & EIA). Whereas, total reserves of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) are estimated 85.280 billion barrels approximately. Top 10 oil producing countries in the year of 2017 are United States of America, Russia, Saudi Arabia (OPEC), Iraq (OPEC), Iran (OPEC), China, Canada, United Arab Emirates (OPEC), Kuwait (OPEC) and Brazil respectively; according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Top 10 gas producing countries (estimates from year 2011 to 2015) are the United States of America, Russia, Iran, Qatar, Canada, China, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Turkmenistan respectively; according to The World Factbook. Total oil consumption in the year 2018 is 99.5580 million barrels per day according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and with this enhanced pace of oil consumption the total oil reserves of 1.66 trillion barrels "
pub.1102430980,Addressing Climate Change Without Legislation - Volume 1: DOI,"On May 6, 2014, the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program issued its third National Climate Assessment, declaring that human-induced climate change is already affecting the American people in far-reaching ways. The report talks about extreme weather events, melting glaciers, and sea level rise. It also emphasizes that the amount of future climate change will still largely be determined by choices society makes about emissions from this point forward. Changing climatic conditions are the result of rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased by more than twenty percent over the last forty years, reaching 396.48 parts per million in 2013. Carbon dioxide emissions primarily result from the burning of fossil fuels (i.e., coal, oil, and gas) in the energy and transportation sectors. Other large sources of carbon dioxide include manufacturing, agricultural production, and land clearing. These activities also emit methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere, resulting in the elevation of surface temperatures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) estimates that average global temperatures rose by more than 1.0oF during the 20th century and could rise a further 11.5oF by 2100. The third National Climate Assessment indicates that warming will occur across the U.S., with temperatures forecast to increase by 2.0 to 4.0oF in most areas within just a few decades. These temperature changes will be accompanied by shifts in the amount, timing, and distribution of precipitation. Regional differences in precipitation will increase, with wet areas expected to become wetter and dry areas expected to become drier. In all areas, precipitation will increasingly be concentrated into fewer heavy downpours with longer dry periods in between. Changing temperature and precipitation patterns will have profound impacts on the global environment. Higher temperatures will accelerate the melting of glaciers, leading to sea levels to rises that have the potential to damage or destroy land. Water resources will also be affected as higher temperatures reduce snow and ice cover and increase evaporation. These effects will be magnified by shifts in precipitation, including prolonged droughts and flash floods that cause further declines in water quantity and quality respectively. Other extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tornados may also become more frequent and severe, placing added stress on resources. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation and other sources will slow the pace of atmospheric warming and thereby delay or avoid other climatic changes. Similar benefits can also be achieved through carbon sequestration, whereby carbon dioxide is diverted from emissions sources and/or removed from the atm"
pub.1148614690,"Triangle of Environment, Water and Energy: A Sociological Appraisal","Modern sociology has a special look at the three associated variables of environment, water and energy. The three variables are not in a harmonial state in many parts of the globe. Some have access to two, or not sufficient to one. Only a few countries are in an equilibrium state of the three. For example, many African countries are in short fall of water and energy. What sociologists suggest is to bring about resources enough as far as the three parts are concerned. In the past, the threefold relationship was less considered and measured, but currently with the heavy weight of population over 7.8 billion world over (WPDS, 2020), balance between the three is inevitable. While population all over the world has increased considerably, water resources have not increased in the same way. Moreover, in the past, population dependency on energy was not that much. But, in the industrial age of today, man is highly in need of energy of different types to maintain life. However, waste and wastewater have become problematic in current age and in most parts of the world. The emerging situation is polluting environment, seas and water streams. It is more observable in less developed world than the developed world. Therefore, the water and energy crisis is wide and ongoing. It is discussed elaborately in the present article. However, national security could be accessible only if water-energy policies are there (Bauer et el. 2014).
Introduction
The threefold relationship of environment, water and energy is very important from a sociological point of view. Although in the past these three variables were less considered, and their relationship with each other has been less measured, at the same time, following the comprehensive development of modern societies, the tripartite relationship of these variables is inevitable today. To have a healthy environment, enough water resources and enough energy, you must always invest in it.
While energy is highly dependent on water, the supply and transfer of water, and the disposal and transfer of wastewater also require energy. Therefore, water and energy, while being necessary for each other, also ensure the health and safety of individuals. Existence of lakes, dams and other similar sources generate energy through and with the power of these elements. At the same time, energy itself transports water resources from one region to another. It also happens with the energy power of the waste disposal system or system. Otherwise, the health of individuals and the health of society in general will face irreparable risks. In the past, when such facilities were less available, many health problems arose that eventually led to an increase in mortality. Therefore, in order to have a healthy environment, providing water and energy resources is very vital and inevitable. Likewise, drinking water itself needs energy for purification and purification operations, and re-pumping to consumers. This means that any interaction regarding the "

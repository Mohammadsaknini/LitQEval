pub.1159732123,Overview of Inhaled Nanopharmaceuticals,"Nanopharmaceuticals represent a group of nanoparticles engineered for medical purposes. Nowadays, nanotechnology offers several possibilities to improve the safety and efficacy of medicines by designing advanced carrier systems which have been found to offer particular advantages when formulated in the nanoscale. Some of the initially marketed nano-formulations already demonstrate advantages over conventional formulations. Innovative delivery systems offer the possibility to not only control drug release but also to overcome biological barriers. For the translation of new drug products from bench to bedside, however, it is pivotal to test and prove their safety. This is of course also true for nanopharmaceuticals, where in particular the biocompatibility and also the clearance/biodegradation of the carrier material after drug delivery has to be demonstrated. The pulmonary route offers some great opportunities for noninvasive drug delivery but also implicates peculiar challenges. Advanced aerosol formulations with innovative drug carriers have already contributed to the significant progress of inhalation therapy. However, in spite of the large alveolar epithelial surface area, the respiratory tract still features diverse efficient biological barriers, primarily designed by nature to protect the human body against inhaled pollutants and pathogens. Only a thorough understanding of particle-lung interactions will allow the rational design of novel nanopharmaceuticals capable of overcoming these barriers, while of course always keeping in mind the strict demands for their safety. While the recent resurrection of inhaled insulin has already confirmed the potential of the pulmonary route for systemic delivery of biopharmaceuticals, inhaled nanopharmaceuticals, currently under investigation, promise to improve also local therapies like anti-infectives."

pub.1024688196,Subcellular behaviour evaluation of nanopharmaceuticals with aggregation-induced emission molecules,"Nanopharmaceuticals possess a myriad of advantages for disease treatment, not only in delivering therapeutic agents, but also in deciphering their innate intracellular or subcellular behaviours, providing detailed diagnostic and prognostic information, quantifying treatment efficacy and designing better therapeutics. To evaluate the subcellular behaviour of nanopharmaceuticals, colourful fluorescence is the most potential technique, because it is capable of painting the subcellular detail in three dimensions with high resolution. Furthermore, the fluorescence is switchable, and thus the subcellular details can be lightened specifically without the undesirable background. However, most nanopharmaceuticals lack a fluorescent report group, and its introduction requires extra steps. Moreover, the introduced fluorescent groups can suffer from concentration quenching or aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) when they are embedded in nanopharmaceuticals at a high concentration. The unique aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect provides a straightforward solution. The aromatic cores of AIE molecules are always hydrophobic and do not undergo the ACQ effect even at high concentrations. Hence, AIE molecules can be directly introduced as building blocks to provide the driving force for the self-assembly of nanopharmaceuticals and can allow us to develop label-free, ACQ-free and luminescent nanopharmaceuticals that can simultaneously implement drug delivery and subcellular behaviour evaluation. This review presents different types of AIE molecules-based nanopharmaceuticals and their biological properties and applications for imaging subcellular behaviours, including the drug releasing process, metabolism of nanopharmaceuticals, subcellular distributions of drug and carriers, and therapeutic effect. With detailed acquaintance of these subcellular behaviours, we anticipate that the research we discuss in this review can inspire other scientists to develop next generation nanopharmaceuticals that can be guided by fluorescence imaging and thus can realize concisely controllable drug delivery."

pub.1158308116,A hybrid nanopharmaceutical for specific-amplifying oxidative stress to initiate a cascade of catalytic therapy for pancreatic cancer,"BackgroundOxidative stress (OS) induced by an imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants is an important aspect in anticancer therapy, however, as an adaptive response, excessive glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) acts as an antioxidant against high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and prevents OS damage to maintain redox homoeostasis, suppressing the clinical efficacy of OS-induced anticancer therapies.ResultsA naturally occurring ROS-activating drug, galangin (GAL), is introduced into a Fenton-like catalyst (SiO2@MnO2) to form a TME stimulus-responsive hybrid nanopharmaceutical (SiO2-GAL@MnO2, denoted SG@M) for enhancing oxidative stress. Once exposed to TME, as MnO2 responds and consumes GSH, the released Mn2+ converts endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which together with the subsequent release of GAL from SiO2 increases ROS. The “overwhelming” ROS cause OS-mediated mitochondrial malfunction with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which releases cytochrome c from mitochondria, activates the Caspase 9/Caspase 3 apoptotic cascade pathway. Downregulation of JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation levels blocks the JAK2/STAT3 cell proliferation pathway, whereas downregulation of Cyclin B1 protein levels arrest the cell cycle in the G2/M phase. During 18 days of in vivo treatment observation, tumor growth inhibition was found to be 62.7%, inhibiting the progression of pancreatic cancer. Additionally, the O2 and Mn2+ released during this cascade catalytic effect improve ultrasound imaging (USI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively.ConclusionThis hybrid nanopharmaceutical based on oxidative stress amplification provides a strategy for multifunctional integrated therapy of malignant tumors and image-visualized pharmaceutical delivery.Graphical Abstract"

pub.1103168510,Transforming nanomedicine manufacturing toward Quality by Design and microfluidics,"Nanopharmaceuticals aim at translating the unique features of nano-scale materials into therapeutic products and consequently their development relies critically on the progression in manufacturing technology to allow scalable processes complying with process economy and quality assurance. The relatively high failure rate in translational nanopharmaceutical research and development, with respect to new products on the market, is at least partly due to immature bottom-up manufacturing development and resulting sub-optimal control of quality attributes in nanopharmaceuticals. Recently, quality-oriented manufacturing of pharmaceuticals has undergone an unprecedented change toward process and product development interaction. In this context, Quality by Design (QbD) aims to integrate product and process development resulting in an increased number of product applications to regulatory agencies and stronger proprietary defense strategies of process-based products. Although QbD can be applied to essentially any production approach, microfluidic production offers particular opportunities for QbD-based manufacturing of nanopharmaceuticals. Microfluidics provides unique design flexibility, process control and parameter predictability, and also offers ample opportunities for modular production setups, allowing process feedback for continuously operating production and process control. The present review aims at outlining emerging opportunities in the synergistic implementation of QbD strategies and microfluidic production in contemporary development and manufacturing of nanopharmaceuticals. In doing so, aspects of design and development, but also technology management, are reviewed, as is the strategic role of these tools for aligning nanopharmaceutical innovation, development, and advanced industrialization in the broader pharmaceutical field."

pub.1036563753,Nanopharmaceuticals (part 2): products in the pipeline,"In part I of this review we assessed nanoscience-related definitions as applied to pharmaceuticals and we discussed all 43 currently approved drug formulations, which are widely publicized as nanopharmaceuticals or nanomedicines. In continuation, here we review the currently ongoing clinical trials within the broad field of nanomedicine. Confining the definition of nanopharmaceuticals to therapeutic formulations, in which the unique physicochemical properties expressed in the nanosize range, when man-made, play the pivotal therapeutic role, we found an apparently low number of trials, which reflects neither the massive investments made in the field of nanomedicine nor the general hype associated with the term ""nano."" Moreover, after an extensive search for information through clinical trials, we found only two clinical trials with materials that show unique nano-based properties, ie, properties that are displayed neither on the atomic nor on the bulk material level.

pub.1032045833,Opportunities and obstacles to the development of nanopharmaceuticals for human use,"Pharmaceutical nanotechnology has generated breakthrough developments in improving health care and human life from its emergence. The biomaterials employed mainly aim at improving drug delivery systems, imaging and diagnostic technologies while the nanoscale materials are in widespread use in other industries such as electronics and optics. Such advancement may revolutionize the drug development and therapy with new and more efficient treatments. Although, nanotechnology assists humankind in improving its well being, it has certain limitations that entail thorough investigation by the regulatory and scientific authorities. To address concerns regarding the safety and toxicity profile of the nanopharmaceuticals, we have reviewed the challenges and solutions of nanopharmaceuticals use in human health and the related health risks. In this regard, regulatory and scientific bodies such as countries’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), European Medicine Agency (EMA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and World Health Organization (WHO) can participate in developing and reinforcing safety measures and regulatory frameworks to insure the public health. The regulatory authorities may enforce the nanopharmaceutical industries to conduct comprehensive toxicity tests and monitor the adverse drug reaction reports in close collaboration with the scientific community to act accordingly and inform the public as the implementation of the strategy.Graphical abstractNanopharmaceuticals have tremendous potential for human use as therapeutic or diagnostic agents. But their toxicity profile should be well addressed and the respective regulatory framework developed and reinforced by the authorities."
pub.1130828735,Emerging Nanopharmaceuticals and Nanonutraceuticals in Cancer Management,"Nanotechnology is the science of nanoscale, which is the scale of nanometers or one billionth of a meter. Nanotechnology encompasses a broad range of technologies, materials, and manufacturing processes that are used to design and/or enhance many products, including medicinal products. This technology has achieved considerable progress in the oncology field in recent years. Most chemotherapeutic agents are not specific to the cancer cells they are intended to treat, and they can harm healthy cells, leading to numerous adverse effects. Due to this non-specific targeting, it is not feasible to administer high doses that may harm healthy cells. Moreover, low doses can cause cancer cells to acquire resistance, thus making them hard to kill. A solution that could potentially enhance drug targeting and delivery lies in understanding the complexity of nanotechnology. Engineering pharmaceutical and natural products into nano-products can enhance the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Novel nano-formulations such as liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, quantum dots, nano-suspensions, and gold nanoparticles have been shown to enhance the delivery of drugs. Improved delivery of chemotherapeutic agents targets cancer cells rather than healthy cells, thereby preventing undesirable side effects and decreasing chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Nanotechnology has also revolutionized cancer diagnosis by using nanotechnology-based imaging contrast agents that can specifically target and therefore enhance tumor detection. In addition to the delivery of drugs, nanotechnology can be used to deliver nutraceuticals like phytochemicals that have multiple properties, such as antioxidant activity, that protect cells from oxidative damage and reduce the risk of cancer. There have been multiple advancements and implications for the use of nanotechnology to enhance the delivery of both pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment."
pub.1002887630,Nanopharmaceuticals (part 1): products on the market,"In 2000, the National Institute of Health launched the National Nanotechnology Initiative to support, coordinate, and advance research and development of nanoscale projects. The impact of this new program on health-science related research and development became quickly visible. Broad governmental financial support advanced the start of new, and the deepening of already existing, interdisciplinary research. The anticipated merger of nanoscience with medicine quickly instigated the conceptualization of nanomedicine. The adoption of nanoscience terminology by pharmaceutical scientists resulted in the advent of nanopharmaceuticals. The term ""nano"" became tantamount to ""cutting-edge"" and was quickly embraced by the pharmaceutical science community. Colloidal drug delivery systems reemerged as nanodrug delivery systems; colloidal gold became a suspension of nano gold particles. In this review, we first review nanoscience related definitions applied to pharmaceuticals, we then discuss all 43 currently approved drug formulations which are publicized as nanopharmaceuticals, and finally we analyze clinical aspects of selected drug formulations.

pub.1046830467,How do we develop nanopharmaceuticals under open innovation?,"It is incumbent on nanomedicine researchers to understand how to develop their ideas into commercial drugs; success to date has not been as good as funders would have liked. This article attempts to outline, perhaps for the first time, some of the expertise that the pharmaceutical sector has acquired to facilitate translation. It is hoped this explanation will start to improve the planning required at an early stage to develop nanopharmaceuticals and to encourage researchers and their institutions to devise a development plan."
pub.1126872733,Metal-organic Nanopharmaceuticals.,"Coordinative interactions between multivalent metal ions and drug derivatives with Lewis base functions give rise to nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) as delivery systems. As the pharmacologically active agent constitutes a main building block of the nanomaterial, the resulting drug loadings are typically very high. By additionally selecting metal ions with favorable pharmacological or physicochemical properties, the obtained NCPs are predominantly composed of active components which serve individual purposes, such as pharmacotherapy, photosensitization, multimodal imaging, chemodynamic therapy or radiosensitization. By this approach, the assembly of drug molecules into NCPs modulates pharmacokinetics, combines pharmacological drug action with specific characteristics of metal components and provides a strategy to generate tailorable multifunctional nanoparticles. This article reviews different applications and recent examples of such highly functional nanopharmaceuticals with a high 'material economy'. Lay Summary: Nanoparticles, that are small enough to circulate in the bloodstream and can carry cargo molecules, such as drugs, imaging or contrast agents, are attractive materials for pharmaceutical applications. A high loading capacity is a generally aspired parameter of nanopharmaceuticals to minimize patient exposure to unnecessary nanomaterial. Pharmaceutical agents containing Lewis base functions in their molecular structure can directly be assembled into metal-organic nanopharmaceuticals by coordinative interaction with metal ions. Such coordination polymers generally feature extraordinarily high loading capacities and the flexibility to encapsulate different agents for a simultaneous delivery in combination therapy or 'theranostic' applications."

pub.1027154403,Nanotechnology and the Treatment of HIV Infection,"Suboptimal adherence, toxicity, drug resistance and viral reservoirs make the lifelong treatment of HIV infection challenging. The emerging field of nanotechnology may play an important role in addressing these challenges by creating drugs that possess pharmacological advantages arising out of unique phenomena that occur at the ""nano"" scale. At these dimensions, particles have physicochemical properties that are distinct from those of bulk materials or single molecules or atoms. In this review, basic concepts and terms in nanotechnology are defined, and examples are provided of how nanopharmaceuticals such as nanocrystals, nanocapsules, nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanocarriers, micelles, liposomes and dendrimers have been investigated as potential anti-HIV therapies. Such drugs may, for example, be used to optimize the pharmacological characteristics of known antiretrovirals, deliver anti-HIV nucleic acids into infected cells or achieve targeted delivery of antivirals to the immune system, brain or latent reservoirs. Also, nanopharmaceuticals themselves may possess anti-HIV activity. However several hurdles remain, including toxicity, unwanted biological interactions and the difficulty and cost of large-scale synthesis of nanopharmaceuticals."
pub.1069224243,Patenting of nanopharmaceuticals in drug delivery: no small issue.,"Nanotechnology is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field based on the manipulation of matter on a submicron scale, encompassing matter between 1 and 100 nanometers (nm). The currently registered nanotechnology patents comprise 35 countries being involved in the global distribution of these patents. Close to 3000 patents were issued in the USA since 1996 with the term 'nano' in the patents, with a considerable number having application in nanomedicine. The large majority of therapeutic patents are focused on drug delivery systems, highlighting an important application globally. Nanopharmaceutical patents are centered mainly on non-communicable diseases, with cancer receiving the greatest focus, followed by hepatitis. Drug delivery systems employing nanotechnology have the ability to allow superior drug absorption, controlled drug release and reduced side-effects, enhancing the effectiveness of existing drug delivery systems. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems may be among the first types of products to generate serious nanotechnology patent disputes as the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry begins to adopt them. This review article aimed to locate patented nanopharmaceuticals in drug delivery online, employing pertinent key terms while searching the patent databases.

pub.1092247173,Targetable Clinical Nanoparticles for Precision Cancer Therapy Based on Disease-Specific Molecular Inflection Points,"Novel translational approaches based on clinical modular nanoplatforms are needed in order to treat solid cancers according to their discrete molecular features. In the present study, we show that the clinical nanopharmaceutical Ferumoxytol, which consists of a glucose-based coat surrounding an iron oxide core, could identify molecular characteristics of prostate cancer, corresponding to unique phases of the disease continuum. By affixing a targeting probe for the prostate-specific membrane antigen on its surface, the nanopharmaceutical was able to assess the functional state of the androgen receptor pathway via MRI, guiding therapy and delivering it with the same clinical nanoparticle. In order to simultaneously inhibit signaling from key oncogenic pathways of more advanced forms of prostate cancer, a single-agent therapy for early stage disease to inhibit DNA replication, as well as combination therapy with two drugs co-retained within the nanopharmaceutical's polymeric coating, were tested and resulted in complete tumor ablation. Recalcitrant and terminal forms of the disease were effectively treated with a nanopharmaceutical delivering a combination that upregulates endoplasmic reticulum stress and inhibits metastasis, thereby showing that this multifunctional nanoplatform can be used in the clinic for patient stratification, as well as precision treatment based on the individual's unique disease features."
pub.1132519039,Potential of Nanonutraceuticals in Increasing Immunity,"Nutraceuticals are defined as foods or their extracts that have a demonstrably positive effect on human health. According to the decision of the European Food Safety Authority, this positive effect, the so-called health claim, must be clearly demonstrated best by performed tests. Nutraceuticals include dietary supplements and functional foods. These special foods thus affect human health and can positively affect the immune system and strengthen it even in these turbulent times, when the human population is exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these special foods are supplemented with nanoparticles of active substances or processed into nanoformulations. The benefits of nanoparticles in this case include enhanced bioavailability, controlled release, and increased stability. Lipid-based delivery systems and the encapsulation of nutraceuticals are mainly used for the enrichment of food products with these health-promoting compounds. This contribution summarizes the current state of the research and development of effective nanonutraceuticals influencing the body's immune responses, such as vitamins (C, D, E, B<sub>12</sub>, folic acid), minerals (Zn, Fe, Se), antioxidants (carotenoids, coenzyme Q10, polyphenols, curcumin), omega-3 fatty acids, and probiotics."

We discuss this in relation to nanopharmaceutical development and the possible use of complement inhibitors to prevent related adverse reactions. We further call on initiation of genetic association studies to unravel the genetic basis of nanomedicine infusion-related adverse responses, since most of the polymorphic genes in the genome belong to the immune system.
FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In this paper, idiosyncratic reactions based on complement activation are discussed in the context of newly available complement inhibitors."

As a nanometer-scale drug carrier system, the cyclodextrin polymeric nanoparticle technology, referred to as ""CDP"", has unique design features and capabilities. Specifically, CRLX101 preclinical and clinical data confirm that CDP can address not only solubility, formulation, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic challenges associated with administration of CPT, but more importantly, can impart unique biological properties that enhance CPT pharmacodynamics and efficacy."
pub.1163681161,Research Progress in Nanopharmaceuticals with Different Delivery Routes in the Antivirus Field,"Human health is significantly threatened by infectious diseases caused by viral infection. Over the years, there have been numerous virus epidemics worldwide, causing millions of deaths. Traditional antiviral medications have many problems, including poor solubility and antiviral resistance. Additionally, because different drug delivery methods have different biological barriers to overcome, the drug's bioavailability will be significantly affected. Therefore, it is essential that researchers create more effective antiviral drugs. To serve as a guide for the future development of nanosized antiviral drugs with stronger and more precise therapeutic effects, research has been performed on nanotechnology in the field of antiviral therapy. This review summarizes the recent developments in antiviral nanopharmaceuticals with different delivery routes. Research on 7 typical viruses, including COVID-19, has been included in this review. After being loaded into nanoparticles, antiviral drugs can be delivered through several drug modes of delivery, overcoming biological barriers. Moreover, some nanoparticles themselves have the ability to combat infections, so they can be used in conjunction with antiviral medication. The use of nanoparticle medications through various routes of administration can result in their unique benefits. They can be capable of overcoming its limitations as well as retaining the advantages of this method of delivery. This will motivate researchers to conducted a new investigation on nanoparticle medicines from the standpoint of the route of administration in order to increase the practicability of antiviral medications."
pub.1148621210,Antiviral nanopharmaceuticals: Engineered surface interactions and virus‐selective activity,"The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired large research investments from the global scientific community in the study of viral properties and antiviral technologies (e.g., self-cleaning surfaces, virucides, antiviral drugs, and vaccines). Emerging viruses are a constant threat due to the substantial variation in viral structures, limiting the potential for expanded broad-spectrum antiviral agent development, and the complexity of targeting multiple and diverse viral species with unique characteristics involving their virulence. Multiple, more infectious variants of SARS-CoV2 (e.g., Delta, Omicron) have already appeared, necessitating research into versatile, robust control strategies in response to the looming threat of future viruses. Nanotechnology and nanomaterials have played a vital role in addressing current viral threats, from mRNA-based vaccines to nanoparticle-based drugs and nanotechnology enhanced disinfection methods. Rapid progress in the field has prompted a review of the current literature primarily focused on nanotechnology-based virucides and antivirals. In this review, a brief description of antiviral drugs is provided first as background with most of the discussion focused on key design considerations for high-efficacy antiviral nanomaterials (e.g., nanopharmaceuticals) as determined from published studies as well as related modes of biological activity. Insights into potential future research directions are also provided with a section devoted specifically to the SARS-CoV2 virus.

pub.1119822871,Free Radical Scavenging and Some Pharmaceutical Utilities of Nanoparticles in the Recent Scenario.,"BACKGROUND: Nanopharmaceuticals have rapidly emerged as a means to cure several diseases. There are numerous reports describing the development and application of nanopharmaceuticals. Here, we discussed nanoparticle synthesis and the mechanisms to scavenge free radicals. We also discuss their major properties and list several commercially available nanomedicines.
RESULTS: Reactive oxygen and hydrogen species are formed during normal metabolism, and excessive reactive species can damage proteins, lipids, and DNA and cause disease. Plant- and microbe-based nanoparticles, which can protect tissues from free radical damage, have recently gained research momentum because they are inexpensive and safe.
CONCLUSION: Synthetic and biocompatible nanoparticles exhibit antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, which can be used to treat several diseases. Further studies are needed to investigate their sizes, dose-dependent activities, and mechanisms of action."
pub.1163525317,Small-Angle X‑ray Scattering for PEGylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Drugs: An Analytical Model Comparison Study,"Liposomal delivery systems are recognized as efficient and safe platforms for chemotherapeutic agents, with doxorubicin-loaded liposomes being the most representative nanopharmaceuticals. Characterizing the structure of liposomal nanomedicines in high spatial and temporal resolution is critical to analyze and evaluate their stability and efficacy. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a powerful tool increasingly used to investigate liposomal delivery systems. In this study, we chose a Doxil-like PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) as an example and characterized the liposomal drug structure using synchrotron SAXS. Classical analytical models, including the spherical-shell or flat-slab geometries with Gaussian or uniform electron density profiles, were used to model the internal structure of the liposomal membrane. A cylinder model was applied to fit the scattering from the drug crystal loaded in the liposomes. The high-resolution structures of the original drug, Caelyx, and a similar research drug prepared in our laboratory were characterized using these analytical models. The structural parameters of PLDs, including the thickness of the liposomal membrane and morphology of the drug crystal, were further compared. The results demonstrated that both spherical-shell and flat-slab geometries with Gaussian electron density distribution were suitable to elucidate the structural features of the liposomal membrane under a certain range of scattering vectors, while models with uniform electron density distribution exhibited poor fitting performance. This study highlights the technical features of SAXS, which provides structural information at the nanoscale for liposomal drugs. The demonstrated methods are reliable and easy-to-use for the structural analysis of liposomal drugs, which are helpful for a broader application of SAXS in the production and regulation of nanopharmaceuticals."
pub.1168639353,State of the art in pediatric nanomedicines,"In recent years, the continuous development of innovative nanopharmaceuticals is expanding their biomedical and clinical applications. Nanomedicines are being revolutionized to circumvent the limitations of unbound therapeutic agents as well as overcome barriers posed by biological interfaces at the cellular, organ, system, and microenvironment levels. In many ways, the use of nanoconfigured delivery systems has eased challenges associated with patient differences, and in our opinion, this forms the foundation for their potential usefulness in developing innovative medicines and diagnostics for special patient populations. Here, we present a comprehensive review of nanomedicines specifically designed and evaluated for disease management in the pediatric population. Typically, the pediatric population has distinguishing needs relative to those of adults majorly because of their constantly growing bodies and age-related physiological changes, which often need specialized drug formulation interventions to provide desirable therapeutic effects and outcomes. Besides, child-centric drug carriers have unique delivery routes, dosing flexibility, organoleptic properties (e.g., taste, flavor), and caregiver requirements that are often not met by traditional formulations and can impact adherence to therapy. Engineering pediatric medicines as nanoconfigured structures can potentially resolve these limitations stemming from traditional drug carriers because of their unique capabilities. Consequently, researchers from different specialties relentlessly and creatively investigate the usefulness of nanomedicines for pediatric disease management as extensively captured in this compilation. Some examples of nanomedicines covered include nanoparticles, liposomes, and nanomicelles for cancer; solid lipid and lipid-based nanostructured carriers for hypertension; self-nanoemulsifying lipid-based systems and niosomes for infections; and nanocapsules for asthma pharmacotherapy.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1132944806,"Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation for measuring particle size, drug loading and (in)stability of nanopharmaceuticals. The joint view of European Union Nanomedicine Characterization Laboratory and National Cancer Institute - Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory","Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) has been recognized as an invaluable tool for the characterisation of particle size, polydispersity, drug loading and stability of nanopharmaceuticals. However, the application of robust and high quality standard operating procedures (SOPs) is critical for accurate measurements, especially as these complex drug nanoformulations are most often inherently polydisperse. In this review we describe a unique international collaboration that lead to the development of a robust SOP for the measurement of physical-chemical properties of nanopharmaceuticals by multi-detector AF4 (MD-AF4) involving two state of the art infrastructures in the field of nanomedicine, the European Union Nanomedicine Characterization Laboratory (EUNCL) and the National Cancer Institute-Nanotechnology Characterisation Laboratory (NCI-NCL). We present examples of how MD-AF4 has been used for the analysis of key quality attributes, such as particle size, shape, drug loading and stability of complex nanomedicine formulations. The results highlight that MD-AF4 is a very versatile analytical technique to obtain critical information on a material particle size distribution, polydispersity and qualitative information on drug loading. The ability to conduct analysis in complex physiological matrices is an additional very important advantage of MD-AF4 over many other analytical techniques used in the field for stability studies. Overall, the joint NCI-NCL/EUNCL experience demonstrates the ability to implement a powerful and highly complex analytical technique such as MD-AF4 to the demanding quality standards set by the regulatory authorities for the pre-clinical safety characterization of nanomedicines."
pub.1124484649,Nanopharmaceuticals: A focus on their clinical translatability,"Nanoscale materials have contributed changing the way biomedical researchers address the biological and therapeutic limitations of conventional drugs and diagnostic agents. Thanks to a plethora of different materials and synthetic routes, particulate carriers can be designed to modify the half-life of compounds, alter their biodistribution and control the drug release profile, eventually providing an overall clinical benefit to patients. While around 50 nanoformulations (excluding biologics) are already on the market, several challenges still withhold them from unlocking their full translational potential. This review discusses the advantages and current hurdles in the use of nanopharmaceuticals, and describes the most important nanotechnological approaches which have been investigated so far. A focus is given on the record of clinical success and failures and current clinical trends. In an effort to identify opportunities and problems associated with each specific nanosystem, this manuscript underlines the need of a more product-oriented research, that can foster the progress of nanomedicines to the clinic."
pub.1157931894,3D Printing Technology as a Promising Tool to Design Nanomedicine-Based Solid Dosage Forms: Contemporary Research and Future Scope,"3D printing technology in medicine is gaining great attention from researchers since the FDA approved the first 3D-printed tablet (Spritam<sup>®</sup>) on the market. This technique permits the fabrication of various types of dosage forms with different geometries and designs. Its feasibility in the design of different types of pharmaceutical dosage forms is very promising for making quick prototypes because it is flexible and does not require expensive equipment or molds. However, the development of multi-functional drug delivery systems, specifically as solid dosage forms loaded with nanopharmaceuticals, has received attention in recent years, although it is challenging for formulators to convert them into a successful solid dosage form. The combination of nanotechnology with the 3D printing technique in the field of medicine has provided a platform to overcome the challenges associated with the fabrication of nanomedicine-based solid dosage forms. Therefore, the major focus of the present manuscript is to review the recent research developments that involved the formulation design of nanomedicine-based solid dosage forms utilizing 3D printing technology. Utilization of 3D printing techniques in the field of nanopharmaceuticals achieved the successful transformation of liquid polymeric nanocapsules and liquid self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) to solid dosage forms such as tablets and suppositories easily with customized doses as per the needs of the individual patient (personalized medicine). Furthermore, the present review also highlights the utility of extrusion-based 3D printing techniques (Pressure-Assisted Microsyringe-PAM; Fused Deposition Modeling-FDM) to produce tablets and suppositories containing polymeric nanocapsule systems and SNEDDS for oral and rectal administration. The manuscript critically analyzes contemporary research related to the impact of various process parameters on the performance of 3D-printed solid dosage forms."
pub.1138716770,Use of Protamine in Nanopharmaceuticals—A Review,"Macromolecular biomolecules are currently dethroning classical small molecule therapeutics because of their improved targeting and delivery properties. Protamine-a small polycationic peptide-represents a promising candidate. In nature, it binds and protects DNA against degradation during spermatogenesis due to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged DNA-phosphate backbone and the positively charged protamine. Researchers are mimicking this technique to develop innovative nanopharmaceutical drug delivery systems, incorporating protamine as a carrier for biologically active components such as DNA or RNA. The first part of this review highlights ongoing investigations in the field of protamine-associated nanotechnology, discussing the self-assembling manufacturing process and nanoparticle engineering. Immune-modulating properties of protamine are those that lead to the second key part, which is protamine in novel vaccine technologies. Protamine-based RNA delivery systems in vaccines (some belong to the new class of mRNA-vaccines) against infectious disease and their use in cancer treatment are reviewed, and we provide an update on the current state of latest developments with protamine as pharmaceutical excipient for vaccines."

The limitations of conventional therapeutic platforms used for skin cancer therapy have been largely overcome by the use of nanoplatforms. This review discusses various nanotechnological approaches experimented for the treatment of skin cancer. The review describes various polymeric, lipidic and inorganic nanoplatforms for efficient therapy of skin cancer. The stimuli-responsive nanoplatforms such as pH-responsive as well as temperature-responsive platforms have also been reviewed. Different strategies for potentiating the nanoparticles application for cancer therapy such as surface engineering, conjugation with drugs, stimulus-responsive and multimodal effect have also been discussed and compared with the available conventional treatments. Although, nanopharmaceuticals face challenges such as toxicity, cost and scale-up, efforts put-in to improve these drawbacks with continuous research would deliver exciting and promising results in coming days."
pub.1084537693,Bypassing adverse injection reactions to nanoparticles through shape modification and attachment to erythrocytes,"Intravenously injected nanopharmaceuticals, including PEGylated nanoparticles, induce adverse cardiopulmonary reactions in sensitive human subjects, and these reactions are highly reproducible in pigs. Although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, roles for both the complement system and reactive macrophages have been implicated. Here, we show the dominance and importance of robust pulmonary intravascular macrophage clearance of nanoparticles in mediating adverse cardiopulmonary distress in pigs irrespective of complement activation. Specifically, we show that delaying particle recognition by macrophages within the first few minutes of injection overcomes adverse reactions in pigs using two independent approaches. First, we changed the particle geometry from a spherical shape (which triggers cardiopulmonary distress) to either rod- or disk-shape morphology. Second, we physically adhered spheres to the surface of erythrocytes. These strategies, which are distinct from commonly leveraged stealth engineering approaches such as nanoparticle surface functionalization with poly(ethylene glycol) and/or immunological modulators, prevent robust macrophage recognition, resulting in the reduction or mitigation of adverse cardiopulmonary distress associated with nanopharmaceutical administration."
pub.1142736741,Bioinspired In Vitro Brain Vasculature Model for Nanomedicine Testing Based on Decellularized Spinach Leaves,"Animal testing is often criticized due to ethical issues and complicated translation of the results obtained to the clinical stage of drug development. Existing alternative models for nanopharmaceutical testing still have many limitations and do not significantly decrease the number of animals used. We propose a simple, bioinspired <i>in vitro</i> model for nanopharmaceutical drug testing based on the decellularized spinach leaf's vasculature. This system is similar to human arterioles and capillaries in terms of diameter (300-10 μm) and branching. The model has proven its suitability to access the maneuverability of magnetic nanoparticles, particularly those composed of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Moreover, the thrombosis has been recreated in the model's vasculature. We have tested and compared the effects of both a single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator (scuPA) and a magnetically controlled nanocomposite prepared by heparin-mediated cross-linking of scuPA with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles. Compositions were tested both in static and flow conditions."

pub.1153412007,Reaction mechanism of nanomedicine based on porphyrin skeleton and its application prospects,"Research on porphyrin-based photosensitizing drugs is becoming increasingly popular. They possess unique diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic effects that have gained wide recognition in oncology drug development. In recent years, the rapid growth of nanotechnology has brought great hope for nanopharmaceutical formulations. By combining porphyrins with various nanomaterials, people have improved the properties of porphyrin compounds, making drug delivery easier. Porphyrin-based nanoparticles can enhance the effect of photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment, providing opportunities for achieving complex targeting strategies and versatility with promising applications in drug carriers, tumor imaging, and treatment.

It also discusses the drawbacks as well as the prospects for development."
pub.1142564512,Current trends in chitosan based nanopharmaceuticals for topical vaginal therapies,"Large surface area, rich vascularisation, well defined mucous membrane, balanced pH and relatively low enzymatic activity makes vagina a suitable site for drugs associated with women's health issues like Urinary tract infection (UTI) and vaginal infections. Therapeutic performance of intravaginal dosage forms largely depends on the properties of polymers and drugs. Chitosan (CS) because of its unique physical, chemical, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical properties have received a great deal of attention as an essential component in vaginal drug delivery systems. Further the presence of free amino and hydroxyl groups on the chitosan skeleton allows easy derivatization under mild conditions to meet specific application requirements. Moreover, CS-based nanopharmaceuticals like nanoparticles, nanofiber, nanogel, nanofilm, liposomes and micelles are widely studied to improve therapeutic performance of vaginal formulations. However, susceptibility of CS to the acidic pH of vagina, poor loading of hydrophobic drugs, rapid mucosal turn over are the key issues need to be addressed for successful outcomes. In this review, we have discussed the application of CS and CS derivatives in vaginal drug delivery and also highlight the recent progress in chitosan based nanocarrier platforms in terms of their limitations and potentials."
pub.1016563828,Ethics and Nanopharmacy: Value Sensitive Design of New Drugs,"Although applications are being developed and have reached the market, nanopharmacy to date is generally still conceived as an emerging technology. Its concept is ill-defined. Nanopharmacy can also be construed as a converging technology, which combines features of multiple technologies, ranging from nanotechnology to medicine and ICT. It is still debated whether its features give rise to new ethical issues or that issues associated with nanopharma are merely an extension of existing issues in the underlying fields. We argue here that, regardless of the alleged newness of the ethical issues involved, developments occasioned by technological advances affect the roles played by stakeholders in the field of nanopharmacy to such an extent that this calls for a different approach to responsible innovation in this field. Specific features associated with nanopharmacy itself and features introduced to the associated converging technologies- bring about a shift in the roles of stakeholders that call for a different approach to responsibility.

Solid-state fermentation of soybean with Bacillus subtilis was performed to produce different metabolites (nattokinase, daidzin, genistin and glycitin and menaquinone-7). Intoxication of rats with colchicine caused impairment in learning and memory which was demonstrated in neurobehavioral paradigms (Morris water maze and passive avoidance) linked with decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). NN treatment led to a significant increase in TLT in the retention trials as compared to acquisition trial TLT suggesting an improved learning and memory in rats. Further, treatment of NN caused an increase in the activity of AChE (42%), accompanied with a reduced activity of glutathione (42%), superoxide dismutase (43%) and catalase (41%). It also decreased the level of lipid peroxidation (28%) and protein carbonyl contents (30%) in hippocampus as compared to those treated with colchicine alone, suggesting a possible neuroprotective efficacy of NN. Interestingly, in silico studies also demonstrated an effective amyloid-β and BACE-1 inhibition activity. These findings clearly indicated that NN reversed colchicine-induced behavioral and neurochemical alterations through potent antioxidant activity and could possibly impart beneficial effects in cognitive defects associated with Alzheimer’s disease."
pub.1104412249,"Formulation aspects of nanopharmaceuticals and nanotechnology I Introduction, biopharmaceutical aspects.","Active pharmaceutical ingredients may have unique properties when applied as nanoparticles or in nanostructured carrier systems due to the size and shape, as well as to the high surface to volume ratio. Therefore nanopharmaceuticals are surrounded by huge expectations on the part of nanomedicine and today nanotechnology is crucial for the development of pharmaceutical products. Nanopharmaceuticals have several benefits such as improved dissolution and bioavailability, targeted drug delivery, and they allow the introduction of nanotheranos tics. All these advantages offer an unprecedented opportunity for personalized therapy, aiding also the patient-centered formulation in order to ensure the efficacy and tolerability. Nanoparticle or nano-structured drugs offer unique advantages, but on the other hand the formulation could be a challenge which can be compared to their specific characteristics."
pub.1023494982,Solid Phase Extraction as an Innovative Separation Method for Measuring Free and Entrapped Drug in Lipid Nanoparticles,"ABSTRACTPurposeContrary to physical characterization techniques for nanopharmaceuticals (shape, size and zeta-potential), the techniques to quantify the free and the entrapped drug remain very few and difficult to transpose in routine analytical laboratories. The application of Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) technique was investigated to overcome this challenge.MethodsThe separation of free and entrapped drug by SPE was quantitatively validated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The developed protocol was implemented to characterize cyclosporine A-loaded 120 nm-sized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs, Lipidot®) dispersed in aqueous buffer. The colloidal stability was assessed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS).ResultsValidation experiments demonstrated suitable linearity, repeatability, accuracy and specificity to quantify residual free, entrapped and total drug. For the investigated LNPs, the method revealed a very limited shelflife of the formulation when stored in an aqueous buffer at 5°C and even more at elevated temperature. Nevertheless, the DLS measurements confirmed the stability of nanoparticles during SPE in a suitable concentration range.ConclusionsSPE, when successfully validated, represents a valuable tool for drug development and quality control purposes of lipid-based nanopharmaceuticals in an industrial environment."
pub.1148439807,Nano-Based Approved Pharmaceuticals for Cancer Treatment: Present and Future Challenges,"Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide. To date, and despite the advances in conventional treatment options, therapy in cancer is still far from optimal due to the non-specific systemic biodistribution of antitumor agents. The inadequate drug concentrations at the tumor site led to an increased incidence of multiple drug resistance and the appearance of many severe undesirable side effects. Nanotechnology, through the development of nanoscale-based pharmaceuticals, has emerged to provide new and innovative drugs to overcome these limitations. In this review, we provide an overview of the approved nanomedicine for cancer treatment and the rationale behind their designs and applications. We also highlight the new approaches that are currently under investigation and the perspectives and challenges for nanopharmaceuticals, focusing on the tumor microenvironment and tumor disseminate cells as the most attractive and effective strategies for cancer treatments."
pub.1004620762,Continuous and sustainable granulation of nanopharmaceuticals by spray coagulation encapsulation in alginate,"Nanopharmaceuticals (NPs) have emerged as an attractive formulation strategy for bioavailability enhancement of poorly soluble drugs. Their oral solid dosage form preparation requires them to undergo granulation before they can be processed into tablets. Existing NP granulation methods (e.g., spray drying, spray granulation), however, are lacking in sustainability due to their high energy expense and low mass efficiency. Herein we developed a one-step continuous NP granulation process via encapsulation by spray coagulation (ESC) in alginate, which transforms the NP immediately upon their preparation, thus removing the need for NP recovery prior to granulation, resulting in a highly sustainable process. Moreover, unlike spray-dried NP granules, the ESC-prepared granules are readily compacted into tablets owed to their larger size, thus further enhancing the overall sustainability of the solid dosage form preparation. Crystalline fenofibrate nanoparticles prepared by confined impinging jet crystallization were used as the model NP. Granules containing 25% NPs by mass with size ≈ 300 ± 100 μm were successfully prepared at >80% yield. The NPs maintain their fast dissolution (relative to native microcrystalline fenofibrate) after granulation. The tableted NP granules, having uniform dosage, exhibit similar drug release profiles as the free granules indicating complete granule disassociation from the tablets."

While a first generation of products has been successfully commercialized and has significantly contributed to enhance patient's life, recent advances in material design and the emergence of new therapeutics are contributing to the development of more sophisticated systems. As the field matures, it is important to comprehend the challenges related to nanoparticle commercial development for a more efficient and predictable path to the clinic. Areas covered: The review provides an overview of nanoparticle-based delivery systems currently on the market and in clinical trials, and discuss the principal challenges for their commercial development, both from a manufacturing and regulatory perspective, to help gain understanding of the translational path for these systems. Expert opinion: Clinical translation of nanoparticle-based delivery systems remains challenging on account of their 3D nanostructure and requires robust nano-manufacturing process along with adequate analytical tools and methodologies.

For this purpose, two commercially available nanosimilar formulations of Doxil and their respective carriers were compared as a case study. Although the two formulations were ""similar"", we detected different toxicological effects (profiles) in terms of in vitro toxicity and immunological responses at the level of cytokines release and complement activation (iC3b fragment), that could be correlated with the differences in the physicochemical properties of the formulations. Shedding light on nanosimilar key quality attributes of liposome-based materials and the need for an accurate characterization, including investigation of the immunological effects, is of fundamental importance considering their great potential as delivery system for drugs, genes, or vaccines and the growing market demand."
pub.1103426628,Towards potent but less toxic nanopharmaceuticals – lipoic acid bioconjugates of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with an anticancer drug and addressing unit,"Modification of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with the lipoic acid derivative of folic acid was found to enhance their accumulation in the cancer cell, as compared to AuNPs without addressing units. The application of lipoic acid enabled the control of the gold nanoparticle functionalities leading to enhanced solubility and allowing for attachment of both the folic acid and the cytotoxic drug, doxorubicin. More robust attachment of doxorubicin to the nanoparticle through the amide bond resulted in toxicity comparable with that of the drug alone, opening a new perspective for designing more potent, but less toxic nanopharmaceuticals. The increased uptake was accompanied by pronounced nuclear accumulation and observable cytotoxicity. Doxorubicin binding <i>via</i> covalent amide bonds enhanced stability of the whole drug vehicle and provided much better control over doxorubicin release in the cell environment, as compared to physical adsorption or pH sensitive bonding commonly used for anthracycline carriers. Confocal microscopy revealed that the bond was stable in the cytoplasm for 22 h. The ability to slow down the rate of drug release may be crucial for the application in sustained anticancer drug delivery. Biological analyses performed using MTT assay and confocal microscopy confirmed that the ultrasmall AuNPs with the lipoic acid derivative of folic acid exhibit relatively low cytotoxicity, however when loaded with a chemotherapeutic, they cause a significant reduction in the cell viability."
pub.1047062664,Reversal of multidrug resistance by the inhibition of ATP-binding cassette pumps employing “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS) nanopharmaceuticals: A review,"Pumps of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (ABCs) regulate the access of drugs to the intracellular space. In this context, the overexpression of ABCs is a well-known mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer and infectious diseases (e.g., viral hepatitis and the human immunodeficiency virus) and is associated with therapeutic failure. Since their discovery, ABCs have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets and the search of compounds that inhibit their genetic expression and/or their functional activity has gained growing interest. Different generations of pharmacological ABC inhibitors have been explored over the last four decades to address resistance in cancer, though clinical results have been somehow disappointing. ""Generally Recognized As Safe"" (GRAS) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration designation for substances that are accepted as safe for addition in food. Far from being ""inert"", some amphiphilic excipients used in the production of pharmaceutical products have been shown to inhibit the activity of ABCs in MDR tumors, emerging as a clinically translatable approach to overcome resistance. The present article initially overviews the classification, structure and function of the different ABCs, with emphasis on those pumps related to drug resistance. Then, the different attempts to capitalize on the activity of GRAS nanopharmaceuticals as ABC inhibitors are discussed."

In order to evaluate them as potential nutraceuticals, the obtained nanosystems were characterized in terms of size distribution, shape, zeta potential, stability in different media, gastrointestinal bioaccessibility and biocompatibility. Systems with a unimodal size distribution of spherical particles were obtained, with average diameters ranging from 53.3 nm to 181.7 nm, depending on the type of coating agent used and the presence of OPE in the reaction mixture. The nanosystems were significantly affected by the gastrointestinal conditions. Bioaccessibility ranged from 33.57% to 56.93% and it was significantly increased by functionalization of with OPE. Biocompatibility was investigated in the HepG2 and Caco2 cell models, proving that they had significantly lower toxicity in comparison to sodium selenite. Significant differences were observed in cellular responses depending on the type of cells used, indicating differences in the mechanisms of toxicity induced by SeNPs. The obtained results provide new insight into the possibilities for the utilization of valuable food-waste extracts in the sustainable development of nanonutraceuticals."

The assessment of the performance of nanopharmaceuticals designed for controlled drug release may result in a complex analytical issue and multidisciplinary studies focused on the evaluation of physicochemical, morphological and textural properties of the products may be required. The determination of the drug content as well as the detection of impurities and solvent residues are often carried out by chromatography. Assays on solid state samples relying on X-ray, vibrational and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies are of great interests to study the composition and structure of pharmaceutical forms. The morphology and size of particles are commonly checked by microscopy and complementary chemical information can be extracted in combination with spectroscopic accessories. Regarding the thermal behavior, calorimetric and thermogravimetric techniques are applied to assess the thermal transitions and stability of the samples. The evaluation of drug release profiles from the nanopharmaceuticals can be based on various experimental set-ups depending on the administration route to be considered. Kinetic curves showing the evolution of the drug concentration as a function of time in various physiological conditions (e.g., gastric, plasmatic or topical) are recorded commonly by UV-vis spectroscopy and/or chromatography. Representative examples are commented in detail to illustrate the characterization strategies."
pub.1171411493,Nano-nutraceuticals to Combat Oxidative Stress: Unlocking Newer Paradigms in Adjuvant Therapy,"Nutraceuticals are products that provide both nutritional and therapeutic benefits. These compounds can slow the aging process and provide physiological effects shielding individuals from acute and chronic diseases. People's interests have shifted from allopathic to Ayurvedic to nutraceuticals in recent years. These are often common dietary supplements that have drawn customers worldwide because of their high nutritional safety and lack of adverse effects when used for a long time. Although conventional dosage forms, including pills, tablets, and semi-solids, are still available, they nevertheless have poorer bioavailability, less stability, and less effectiveness for targeted delivery of bioactives. The use of effective nanocomplex systems as nano-antioxidants using nanotechnology has become a promising field. Among its many uses, nanotechnology is mostly used to create foods and nutraceuticals that are more bioavailable, less toxic, and more sustainable. Additionally, it has been emphasized how precisely nano-pharmaceuticals for oxidative stress produce the desired effects. These improvements show improved antioxidant delivery to the target region, reduced leakage, and increased targeting precision. The outcomes demonstrated that oxidative stress-related illnesses can be effectively treated by lowering ROS levels with the use of nanonutraceuticals. The major ideas and uses of nano-nutraceuticals for health are outlined in this review, with an emphasis on reducing oxidative stress."
pub.1165774333,Activation of the complement system by nanoparticles and strategies for complement inhibition,"The complement system is a multicomponent and multifunctional arm of the innate immune system. Complement contributes to non-specific host defence and maintains homeostasis through multifaceted processes and pathways, including crosstalk with the adaptive immune system, the contact (coagulation) and the kinin systems, and alarmin high-mobility group box 1. Complement is also present intracellularly, orchestrating a wide range of housekeeping and physiological processes in both immune and nonimmune cells, thus showing its more sophisticated roles beyond innate immunity, but its roles are still controversial. Particulate drug carriers and nanopharmaceuticals typically present architectures and surface patterns that trigger complement system in different ways, resulting in both beneficial and adverse responses depending on the extent of complement activation and regulation as well as pathophysiological circumstances. Here we consider the role of complement system and complement regulations in host defence and evaluate the mechanisms by which nanoparticles trigger and modulate complement responses. Effective strategies for the prevention of nanoparticle-mediated complement activation are introduced and discussed."

The focus of this work is nanoprebiotics and nanoprobiotics, terms which stand for the loading of a set of compounds (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics) in nanoparticles that work as absorption enhancers in the gastrointestinal tract. In this manuscript, the main features of prebiotics and probiotics are highlighted, together with the discussion of emerging applications of nanotechnologies in their formulation. Current research strategies are also discussed, in particular the promising use of nanofibers for the delivery of probiotics. Synbiotic-based nanoparticles represent an innovative trend within this area of interest. As only few experimental studies on nanoprebiotics and nanoprobiotics are available in the scientific literature, research on this prominent field is needed, covering effectiveness, bioavailability, and safety aspects."

The six parameters measured were functions of liposomal integrity (size and number), drug payload (loading efficiency), targeting peptide integrity (conjugation efficiency and specific avidity), and echogenicity (ultrasound-dependent controlled drug release), which were considered most relevant to the product's intended use. At 4 °C, liposome diameter trended upward, indicative of aggregation, while liposome number per mg lipid and echogenicity trended downward. At 24 °C, peptide conjugation efficiency (CE) and targeting efficiency (TE, specific avidity) trended downward. At 37 °C, CE and drug (pioglitazone) loading efficiency trended downward. At 4 °C, the intended storage temperature, echogenicity, and liposome size reached their practical tolerance limits at 6 months, fixing the product expiration at that point. Arrhenius analysis of targeting peptide CE and drug loading efficiency decay at the higher temperatures indicated complete stability of these characteristics at 4 °C. The results of this study underscore the storage stability challenges presented by complex nanopharmaceutical formulations."

Prostate cancer is one of the suspicious type of cancer spreading very fast around the world, it is reported that in 2018, 29430 patients died of prostate cancer in the United State of America (USA), and hence it is expected that one out of nine men diagnosed with this severe disease during their lives. Medical science has identified cancer at several stages and indicated genes mutations involved in the cancer cell progressions. Genetic implications have been studied extensively in cancer cell growth. So most efficacious drug for prostate cancer is highly required just like other severe diseases for men. So nutraceutical companies are playing major role to manage cancer disease by the recommendation of best natural products around the world, most of these natural products are isolated from plant and mushrooms because they contain several chemoprotective agents, which could reduce the chances of development of cancer and protect the cells for further progression. Some nutraceutical supplements might activate the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic effects by the mechanism of cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation procedures and changes in the redox states, but in other, it also elevate the levels of effectiveness of chemotherapeutic mechanism and in results, cancer cell becomes less reactive to chemotherapy. In this review, we have highlighted the prostate cancer and importance of nutraceuticals for the control and management of prostate cancer, and the significance of nutraceuticals to cancer patients during chemotherapy."

pub.1055120124,Tumor Selective Silencing Using an RNAi-Conjugated Polymeric Nanopharmaceutical,"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics have potential advantages over traditional small molecule drugs such as high specificity and the ability to inhibit otherwise ""undruggable"" targets. However, siRNAs have short plasma half-lives in vivo, can induce a cytokine response, and show poor cellular uptake. Formulating siRNA into nanoparticles offers two advantages: enhanced siRNA stability against nuclease degradation beyond what chemical modification alone can provide; and improved site-specific delivery that takes advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Existing delivery systems generally suffer from poor delivery to tumors. Here we describe the formation and biological activity of polymeric nanopharmaceuticals (PNPs) based on biocompatible and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) conjugated to siRNA via an intracellular cleavable disulfide linker (PLGA-siRNA). Additionally, these PNPs contain (1) PLGA conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) for enhanced pharmacokinetics of the nanocarrier; (2) a cation for complexation of siRNA and charge compensation to avoid high negative zeta potential; and (3) neutral poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to stabilize the PNPs and support the PEG shell to prevent particle aggregation and protein adsorption. The biological data demonstrate that these PNPs achieve prolonged circulation, tumor accumulation that is uniform throughout the tumor, and prolonged tumor-specific knockdown. PNPs employed in this study had no effect on body weight, blood cell count, serum chemistry, or cytokine response at doses >10 times the effective dose. PNPs, therefore, constitute a promising solution for achieving durable siRNA delivery and gene silencing in tumors."
pub.1181589802,Replenishing Cation‑π Interactions for the Fabrication of Mesoporous Levodopa Nanoformulations for Parkinson Remission,"Directly assembling drugs into mesoporous nanoformulations will be greatly favored due to the combination of enhanced drug delivery efficiency and mesostructure-enabled nanobio interactions. However, such an approach is hindered due to the lack of understanding of polymer nanoparticles' formation mechanism, especially the relationship between polymerization, self-assembly, and the nucleation process. Here, by investigating the levodopa and dopamine polymerization process, we identify π-cation interaction as pivotal in the self-assembly and nucleation control of dopa molecules. Thus, through manipulation of the π-cation interaction, we present the direct assembly of a commercial drug, levodopa, into mesoporous nanoformulations. The synthesized nanospheres, approximately 200 nm in diameter, exhibit uniform mesopores of around 8 nm. These nanoformulations, abundant in mesopores, enhance chiral phenylalanine interaction with α-synuclein (Syn), curbing aggregation, safeguarding neurons, and alleviating Parkinson's pathology. When combating α-synuclein, the nanoformulation achieved ∼100% inhibition of protein aggregation and sustained neuron viability up to 300%. We believe that this study may advance mesoscale self-assembly knowledge, guiding future nanopharmaceutical developments."

Utilizing the shared characteristics of tumors, such as an acidic environment, enzymes and hypoxia, researchers have developed a promising cancer therapy strategy known as responsive release of nano-loaded drugs, specifically targeted at tumor tissues or cells. In this comprehensive review, we provide an in-depth overview of the current fundamentals and state-of-the-art intelligent strategies of TME-responsive nanoplatforms, which include acidic pH, high GSH levels, high-level adenosine triphosphate, overexpressed enzymes, hypoxia and reductive environment.

Advanced materials, nanomedicine and the environment","Advanced materials, and nanomaterials, are promising for healthcare applications and are in particular in the spotlight of medical innovation since rapidly developed nano-formulated vaccines provide relief in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Further increased rapid growth is to be expected as more and more products are in development and reach the market, beneficial for human health. However, the human body is not a dead end and these products are likely to enter the environment, whereas their fate and effects in the environment are unknown. This part of the life-cycle of advanced medicinal products tends to be overlooked, if the perspective is human-centered and excludes the connectedness of human activity with, and consequences for our environment. Gaps are reviewed that exist in awareness, perspective taking, inclusion of environmental concerns into research and product development and also in available methodologies and regulatory guidance. To bridge these gaps, possible ways forward start to emerge, that could help to find a more integrative way of assessing human and environmental safety for advanced material medicinal products and nanomedicines."

Confined liquid impinging jets (CLIJ) were employed in this study to evaluate the feasibility and limitations in the production of nanodrugs (i.e., particle size in the nanorange). Four drugs from different pharmaceutical classes and water solubilities - salbutamol sulfate, mannitol, ibuprofen, and cyclosporine - were examined.

pub.1171283199,Targeting HIF‐1α with Specific DNA Yokes for Effective Anticancer Therapy,"Hypoxia, a ubiquitous hallmark in cancer, underscores the significance of targeting HIF-1α, the principal transcriptional factor of hypoxic responses, for effective cancer therapy. Herein, DNA yokes, a novel class of DNA nanomaterials harboring specific HIF-1α binding sequences (hypoxia response elements, HREs), are introduced as nanopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. Comprising a basal tetrahedral DNA nanostructure and four HRE-bearing overhanging chains, DNA yokes exhibit exceptional stability and prolonged intracellular retention. The investigation reveals their capacity to bind HIF-1α, thereby disrupting its interaction with the downstream genomic DNAs and impeding transcriptional activity. Moreover, DNA yokes facilitate HIF-1α degradation via the ubiquitination pathway, thereby sequestering it from downstream targets and ultimately promoting its degradation. In addition, DNA yokes attenuate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion under hypoxic conditions, while also displaying preferential accumulation within tumors, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. This study pioneers a novel approach to cancer therapy through the development of DNA-based drugs characterized by high stability and low toxicity to normal cells, positioning DNA yokes as promising candidates for cancer treatment."
pub.1145142888,Gel-Forming of Self-Assembling Peptides Functionalized with Food Bioactive Motifs Modulate DPP-IV and ACE Inhibitory Activity in Human Intestinal Caco-2 Cells,"Food bioactive peptides are increasingly used for formulating food products, nutraceuticals, and functional food, since they are generally considered safe for human consumption and metabolic syndrome prevention. They are also becoming popular as sustainable sources of novel functional biomaterials such as hydrogels, edible nanonutraceuticals, delivery systems, and packing materials. However, such food peptides are mostly unstable, and degrade during food processing, or in a gastrointestinal environment, thus resulting in low bioavailability precluding their practical applications. Here, we decided to functionalize the well-known and characterized self-assembling peptide RADA16 with two synthetic analogues of food bioactive peptides deriving from the hydrolysis of soybean glycinin and lupin β-conglutin (namely IAVPTGVA and LTFPGSAED) for control of and improvement in their gel-forming nanostructures, biomechanics, and biological features. Extensive characterization was performed via Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay, rheological measurements, and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis. Lastly, since self-assembling peptides (SAPs) can be co-assembled with diluent SAPs (without a bioactive epitope) as an approach to control the density of biological signals and therefore attain enhanced bioactivity, we investigated the effect of the co-assembly of RADA16 and functionalized food bioactive SAPs (dubbed cAP-Soy1 and cAP-Lup1) for the growth of Caco-2 human intestinal cells and contextually we characterized their biological activities as DPP-IV and ACE inhibitors, in order to demonstrate their potential use for the prevention of metabolic syndrome."

Cyclodextrins have unique properties that can enhance drug solubility, stability, and bioavailability, making them an attractive option for drug delivery. The use of cyclodextrin-based nanoparticles can potentially reduce toxicity and increase the therapeutic index compared to conventional chemotherapy. CRLX101 has shown promise in preclinical studies, demonstrating enhanced tumor targeting and prolonged drug release. This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, assessing the efficacy and toxicity of CRLX101 in cancer treatment using clinical trials. Studies from January 2010 to April 2023 were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, using specific search terms. The risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I and Cochrane risk-of-bias tools. After screening 6018 articles, 9 were included in the final review. These studies, conducted between 2013 and 2022, focused on patients with advanced or metastatic cancer resistant to standard therapies. CRLX101 was often combined with other therapeutic agents, resulting in improvements such as increased progression-free survival and clinical benefit rates. Toxicity was generally manageable, with common adverse events including fatigue, nausea, and anemia."
pub.1013424397,Development of an in vitro reproductive screening assay for novel pharmaceutical compounds,"An in vitro reproductive cell-based toxicity assay was developed using MLTC-1 (murine Leydig tumour cell line) in order to examine the reproductive toxicity of two novel nanopharmaceutical compounds, namely ethylene glycol mono allyl ether and poly(ethylene glycol) octa-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane. Three commonly used cytotoxicity assays, namely the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide], MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] and Crystal Violet assays, were compared, and the MTT assay proved to be the most accurate and reproducible for the MLTC-1 cell line. The doubling rate of the MLTC-1 cells was 30+/-3.5 h and the optimal seeding density for the MTT assay was 20000 cells per well, and the optimized MTT assay utilized a 4 h cell adherence followed by incubation with 0.5 mg/ml MTT for 1 h. The intra- and inter-assay CV (coefficient of variation) values were 12.3 and 11% respectively. MLTC-1 cells only produce the reproductive hormone progesterone in response to hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), which stimulated progesterone production dose-dependently from 0 to 100 m.i.u.

The two nanopharmaceutical compounds were cytotoxic at concentrations > or =0.1 microg/ml, but hCG decreased cytotoxicity to > or =1000 microg/ml (P<0.001). hCG-stimulated progesterone synthesis afforded some protection against the cytotoxic effects of the two novel nanotechnology compounds; therefore doses < or =100 microg/ml and an exposure period of 1 h would be recommended for testing in in vivo animal reproductive assays."

pub.1036806950,Nanotechnology in Agri-Food Sector,"The emergence of nanotechnology developments using nanodevices/nanomaterials opens up potential novel applications in agriculture and food sector. Smart delivery systems, biosensors, and nanoarrays are being designed to solve the problems faced in agriculture sector. Similarly, food sector is also benefited through the use of smart biosensors, packaging materials, and nanonutraceuticals. Despite the great potential of nanotechnology in agri-food sector, people are ambiguous about use in food applications because of suspected potential health risks and environmental concerns. Nanoparticles, due to their unique characteristics, including small size, shape, high surface area, charge, chemical properties, solubility and degree of agglomeration can cross cell boundaries or pass directly from the lungs into the blood stream and ultimately reach to all of the organs in the body. This is the reason why they may pose higher risk than the same mass and material of larger particles. In this paper, we have made an attempt to give an overview of nanotechnology developments in agri-food sector, risks associated with nanomaterials and toxicity regulations for policy framework."

The use of nanotechnology to tailor treatments according to the genetic and immunophenotypic characteristics of a patient's tumor, and to allow its targeted release, can meet this need, improving the efficacy of treatment and minimizing side effects. Nanomedicine-based approach for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer is a rapidly evolving field. Several nanoformulations are currently in clinical trials, and some have been approved and marketed. However, their large-scale production and use are still hindered by an in-depth debate involving ethics, intellectual property, safety and health concerns, technical issues, and costs.

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined at 15 mg/m2 bi-weekly, and an expansion phase 2a study was completed. Patient samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments. Response was evaluated per RECIST criteria v1.0 every 8 weeks. Sixty-two patients (31 male; median age 63 years, range 39–79) received treatment. Bi-weekly dosing was generally well tolerated with myelosuppression being the dose-limiting toxicity. Among all phase 1/2a patients receiving the MTD (n = 44), most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia and fatigue. Evidence of systemic plasma exposure to both the polymer-conjugated and unconjugated CPT was observed in all treated patients. Mean elimination unconjugated CPT Tmax values ranged from 17.7 to 24.5 h, and maximum plasma concentrations and areas under the curve were generally proportional to dose for both polymer-conjugated and unconjugated CPT. Best overall response was stable disease in 28 patients (64 %) treated at the MTD and 16 (73 %) of a subset of NSCLC patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated at the MTD was 3.7 months and for the subset of NSCLC patients was 4.4 months. These combined phase 1/2a data demonstrate encouraging safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy results. Multinational phase 2 clinical development of CRLX101 across multiple tumor types is ongoing."

Reliable nanomaterial toxicity and mechanistic insights are required for health and toxicity risk assessments. Much in vitro toxicological data is inconclusive in designating whether nanomaterials for drug delivery and medical device implants are truly safe. A critique is presented to analyze the interface between toxicology and nanopharmaceuticals. Deficiencies of existing practices in toxicology are reviewed and useful emerging techniques (e.g., lab-on-a-chip, tissue engineering, atomic force microscopy, high-content analysis) are highlighted. Cross-fertilization between disciplines will aid development of biocompatible delivery and implant platforms while improvements are being suggested for better translation of nanotoxicology. "

Whereas iron, gold, silver and platinum nanoarchitectures have largely dominated this field to date, several hurdles impede the widespread application of those nanopharmaceuticals in a clinical context. Therefore, technologies based on alternative metals are now being evaluated for their potential in medical applications. Palladium nanostructures are characterized by remarkable catalytic and optical properties. However, until recently, very few studies have taken advantage of these unique characteristics for applications in the biomedical field. Very recently, palladium nanostructures have been reported as prodrug activator, as photothermal agents and for anti-cancer/anti-microbial therapy.

Focusing on this observation, this article highlights the controversies in projecting in vitro C assay data to in vivo conditions and applying data on polystyrene particles to therapeutic nanopharmaceuticals. Based on overwhelming evidence of a role of anaphylatoxins in hypersensitivity reactions, the need to further explore the role of C activation in the reported and other reactions is highlighted.

The management of DN focuses on mainly four regions: reduction of cardiovascular risks, control of blood glycemic levels, control of the blood pressure (BP) profile, and the use of therenin-angiotensin system (RAS). Although BP management and RAS-acting agents can postpone the onset of DN, they cannot prevent it. In the modern era, nanotechnological interventions have spread rapidly in the field of medicine. Patient defiance is considered important in diabetes management when long-term or continuous management is required. Nano pharmaceuticals have been shown to increase compliance of diabetic patients by providing multiple ways of drug delivery, controlling release profile, increasing biological steadiness, targeting efficacy, and decreasing toxic profile. Nanoscale formulations of botanical antidiabetic molecules improve clinical efficacy and treatment compliance by overcoming associated biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic barriers. Therefore, the development of nanopharmaceuticals can be considered to be a possible answer to attain the finest scientific effect of the plant-based anti-diabetic molecule. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to create clinical research-based and therapeutically effective nanoforms of antidiabetic plant-based molecules to combat the most dreaded disease of diabetes and its known present complications."
pub.1092667459,Nanomedicine safety in preclinical and clinical development: focus on idiosyncratic injection/infusion reactions,"Injection/infusion reactions to nanopharmaceuticals (and particulate drug carriers) are idiosyncratic and well documented. The molecular basis of nanoparticle-mediated injection reactions is debatable, with two hypotheses as front-runners. The first is complement-activation-related 'pseudoallergy', where a causal role for nanoparticle-mediated complement activation in injection/infusion reactions is considered. However, the second hypothesis (the rapid phagocytic response hypothesis) states a transitional link from robust clearance of nanoparticles (NPs) from the blood by strategically placed responsive macrophages to adverse hemodynamic and cardiopulmonary reactions, regardless of complement activation. Here, I critically examine and discuss these hypotheses. Current experimentally derived evidence appears to be more in support of the rapid phagocytic response hypothesis than of the 'pseudoallergy' hypothesis."

Preliminary screening trials were conducted, along with systemic risk analysis, in order to identify the critical method attributes, namely injection volume, pH and acetonitrile content, that influence critical quality attributes. The Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the tailing factor as a response to pregabalin and naringin in a short run time. The chromatographic conditions were improved by running 17 experimental runs generated by design expert software. After analysing the optimized zone within the confines of the design space, the following chromatographic conditions were chosen: mobile phase water-acetonitrile adjusted to pH 6.9 with phosphate buffer (80:20, %v/v), at flow rate of 1.0 ml/min using a C<sub>18</sub> analytical column at an isobestic wavelength of 212 nm. Furthermore, the optimized method was validated in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and was found to be within the prescribed limits.

pub.1157090379,Improved Local Anesthesia at Inflamed Tissue Using the Association of Articaine and Copaiba Oil in Avocado Butter Nanostructured Lipid Carriers,"Unsuccessful anesthesia often occurs under an inflammatory tissue environment, making dentistry treatment extremely painful and challenging. Articaine (ATC) is a local anesthetic used at high (4%) concentrations. Since nanopharmaceutical formulations may improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, we encapsulated ATC in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) aiming to increase the anesthetic effect on the inflamed tissue. Moreover, the lipid nanoparticles were prepared with natural lipids (copaiba (<i>Copaifera langsdorffii</i>) oil and avocado (<i>Persia gratissima</i>) butter) that added functional activity to the nanosystem. NLC-CO-A particles (~217 nm) showed an amorphous lipid core structure according to DSC and XDR. In an inflammatory pain model induced by λ-carrageenan in rats, NLC-CO-A improved (30%) the anesthetic efficacy and prolonged anesthesia (3 h) in relation to free ATC. In a PGE2-induced pain model, the natural lipid formulation significantly reduced (~20%) the mechanical pain when compared to synthetic lipid NLC. Opioid receptors were involved in the detected analgesia effect since their blockage resulted in pain restoration. The pharmacokinetic evaluation of the inflamed tissue showed that NLC-CO-A decreased tissue ATC elimination rate (ke) by half and doubled ATC's half-life. These results present NLC-CO-A as an innovative system to break the impasse of anesthesia failure in inflamed tissue by preventing ATC accelerated systemic removal by the inflammatory process and improving anesthesia by its association with copaiba oil."

The primary goal was to recognize the chromatographic conditions wherein propitious segregation of the integrants with quality peaks can be attained. An attempt to expound the target analytical profile was made to accomplish this goal, and critical method attributes (CMAs), viz. percentage acetonitrile content, injection volume and pH, which affect critical quality attributes (CQAs), were identified using systemic risk analysis. Box-Behnken design was employed to develop a relationship between CMAs and CQAs, which engenders an analytical design space. Efficient chromatographic separation for pregabalin and piperine was attained using an analytical C<sub>18</sub> column and mobile phase comprising acetonitrile-water (pH 6.9; 70:30%, v/v) in an isocratic elution mode with a 1 ml/min flow rate. The elution was descried at an isosbestic wavelength of 221 nm using a photodiode array detector. The International Conference on Harmonization guidelines were adopted for the developed HPLC method. The validated HPLC method can be further utilized for the simultaneous quantification and detection of pregabalin and piperine in other lipid-based nanopharmaceuticals such as polymeric nanoparticles, nanocrystals, solid-lipid nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, etc., in in vitro and in vivo studies."

Many of the said characteristics are provided by the covalent bonding between the drug and the polymer. However, their clinical development has been slow and only one polymer-drug conjugate has reached the market, thus there remains an urgent need for the development of new and smart polymeric systems. Desirable characteristics of these new systems include higher molecular weight and degree of homogeneity, predictable conformations in solution, multivalency, and increased drug loading capacity, amongst others. With these aims in mind, branched polymers are ideal candidates due to their unique rheological, mechanical, and biomedical properties derived from their structure, inaccessible for linear polymers. Within this review, the synthetic strategies developed and the main efforts towards branched polymer implementation as carriers for polymer-drug conjugates will be addressed. "
pub.1069169652,Targeted drug delivery across the blood brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease.,"The discovery of drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy that can also permeate the blood brain barrier (BBB) is very difficult owing to its specificity and restrictive nature. The BBB disruption or the administration of the drug directly into the brain is not an option due to toxic effects and low diffusion of the therapeutic molecule in the brain parenchyma. A promising approach for drug systemic delivery to the central nervous system is the use of nanosized carriers. The therapeutic potential of certain nanopharmaceuticals for AD has already been demonstrated in vivo after systemic delivery. They are based on i) conjugates of drug and monoclonal antibodies against BBB endogenous receptors; ii) cationized or end terminal protected proteins/peptides; iii) liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80, cationic macromolecules or antibodies against BBB receptors/amyloid beta-peptides.

pub.1152069684,Characterization of the Interaction of Polymeric Micelles with siRNA: A Combined Experimental and Molecular Dynamics Study,"The simulation of large molecular systems remains a daunting challenge, which justifies the exploration of novel methodologies to keep computers as an ideal companion tool for everyday laboratory work. Whole micelles, bigger than 20 nm in size, formed by the self-assembly of hundreds of copolymers containing more than 50 repeating units, have until now rarely been simulated, due to a lack of computational power. Therefore, a flexible amphiphilic triblock copolymer (mPEG<sub>45</sub>-α-PLL<sub>10</sub>-PLA<sub>25</sub>) containing a total of 80 repeating units, has been emulated and synthesized to embody compactified nanoconstructs of over 900 assembled copolymers, sized between 80 and 100 nm, for siRNA complexing purposes. In this study, the tailored triblock copolymers containing a controlled number of amino groups, were used as a support model to address the binding behavior of STAT3-siRNA, in the formation of micelleplexes. Since increasingly complex drug delivery systems require an ever more optimized physicochemical characterization, a converging description has been implemented by a combination of experimentation and computational simulations. The computational data were advantageous in allowing for the assumption of an optimal N/P ratio favoring both conformational rigidifications of STAT3-siRNA with low competitive phenomena at the binding sites of the micellar carriers. These calculations were consistent with the experimental data showing that an N/P ratio of 1.5 resulted in a sufficient amount of complexed STAT3-siRNA with an electrical potential at the slipping plane of the nanopharmaceuticals, close to the charge neutralization."

Because it is a complex disease with a complex genetic and environmental pathophysiology, advanced therapeutic strategies are needed. Nanotechnology presents a potential solution that may maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing negative effects by enabling personalized delivery of anticancer drugs. This review focuses on recent developments in colorectal drug delivery systems based on nanotechnology. Numerous nanomaterials, including liposomes, dendrimers, micelles, exosomes, and gold nanoparticles, are developed and used. Distinctive characteristics of mentioned nanocarriers are discussed along with strategies that can be employed for enhancing the delivery of drugs to colorectal cancer cells. The review also quotes the most relevant preclinical and clinical studies that show how these nanomaterials improve drug solubility, stability, and targeted delivery while overcoming the shortcomings of conventional therapies. Nanotechnology has made CRC treatment very efficient and advanced, which has opened up new possibilities for targeted drug delivery. Preclinical and clinical studies have also proved that the use of nano-formulations in colon-specific delivery systems have significant results, indicating potential for better patient outcomes. Future research can be done in order to overcome the hurdles regarding biocompatibility, expansion, and regulatory challenges.

pub.1136549849,Nanonutraceuticals: The New Frontier of Supplementary Food,"In the last few decades, the combination between nanotechnology and nutraceutics has gained the attention of several research groups. Nutraceuticals are considered as active compounds, abundant in natural products, showing beneficial effects on human health. Unfortunately, the uses, and consequently the health benefits, of many nutraceutical products are limited by their unsuitable chemico-physical features. For example, many nutraceuticals are characterized by low water solubility, low stability and high susceptibility to light and oxygen, poor absorption and potential chemical modifications after their administration. Based on the potential efficacy of nutraceuticals and on their limiting features, nanotechnology could be considered a revolutionary innovation in empowering the beneficial properties of nutraceuticals on human health, thus enhancing their efficacy in several diseases. For this reason, nanotechnology could represent a new frontier in supplementary food. In this review, the most recent nanotechnological approaches are discussed, focusing on their ability to improve the bioavailability of the most common nutraceuticals, providing an overview regarding both the advantages and the possible limitations of the use of several nanodelivery systems. In fact, although the efficacy of smart nanocarriers in improving health benefits deriving from nutraceuticals has been widely demonstrated, the conflicting opinions on the mechanism of action of some nanosystems still reduce their applicability in the therapeutic field."

In the present work, we analyzed the epigenetic effects induced by citrate- and PEG-coated 20 nm silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a model consisting of 4T1 breast cancer tumors in mice. Animals were administered with AgNPs intragastrically (1 mg/kg b.w. daily-total dose 14 mg/kg b.w.) or intravenously (administration twice with 1 mg/kg b.w.-total dose 2 mg/kg b.w.). We observed a significant decrease in 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) level in tumors from mice treated with citrate-coated AgNPs regardless of the route of administration. For PEG-coated AgNPs, a significant decrease in DNA methylation was observed only after intravenous administration. Moreover, treatment of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with AgNPs decreased histone H3 methylation in tumor tissue. This effect was the most pronounced for PEG-coated AgNPs administered intravenously. No changes in histone H3 Lys9 acetylation were observed. The decrease in methylation of DNA and histone H3 was accompanied by changes in expression of genes encoding chromatin-modifying enzymes (Setd4, Setdb1, Smyd3, Suv39h1, Suv420h1, Whsc1, Kdm1a, Kdm5b, Esco2, Hat1, Myst3, Hdac5, Dnmt1, Ube2b, and Usp22) and genes related to carcinogenesis (Akt1, Brca1, Brca2, Mlh1, Myb, Ccnd1, and Src). The significance of the observed changes and the mechanisms responsible for their development are unclear, and more research in this area is warranted. Nevertheless, the present work points to the epigenetic effects as an important level of interaction between nanomaterials and biological systems, which should always be taken into consideration during analysis of the biological activity of nanomaterials and development of nanopharmaceuticals."

pub.1153204351,The Flavonoid Components of Scutellaria baicalensis: Biopharmaceutical Properties and their Improvement using Nanoformulation Techniques,"Scutellaria baicalensis georgi, known as ""Huangqin"" in its dried root form, is a herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for ""clearing away heat, removing dampness, purging fire and detoxification"". Baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, and wogonoside are the main flavonoid compounds found in Scutellaria baicalensis. Scutellaria baicalensis flavonoid components have the potential to prevent and treat a host of diseases. The components of S. baicalensis have limited clinical application due to their low water solubility, poor permeability, and microbial transformation in vivo. Nanopharmaceutical techniques can improve their biopharmaceutical properties, enhance their absorption in vivo, and improve their bioavailability. However, due to the limited number of clinical trials, doubts remain about their toxicity and improvements in human absorption as a result of nanoformulations. This review summarizes the latest and most comprehensive information regarding the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the Scutellaria baicalensis components in vivo. We examined the main advantages of nanodrug delivery systems and collected detailed information on the nanosystem delivery of the Scutellaria baicalensis components, including nanosuspensions and various lipid-based nanosystems. Lipid-based systems including liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and self-micro emulsifying drug delivery systems are introduced in detail. In addition, we make recommendations for related and future research directions. Future research should further examine the absorption mechanisms and metabolic pathways of nanoformulations of the components of Scutellaria baicalensis in vivo, and accurately track the in vivo behavior of these drug delivery systems to discover the specific reasons for the enhanced bioavailability of nanoformulations of the scutellaria baicalensis components. The development of targeted oral administration of intact nanoparticles of Scutellaria baicalensis components is an exciting prospect."
pub.1163597883,In vitro antioxidant activity of alginate nanoparticles encapsulating the aqueous extract of Coccinia grandis L.,"Bioactive compounds in medicinal plants are more susceptible to preventing oxidative stress. Encapsulation of herbal extracts has empowered the properties and characteristics of bioactive compounds. Nanoencapsulation allows the enhancement of the stability of extracts and targeted drug delivery. The present study aims to determine the antioxidant activity of alginate nanoparticles encapsulating the aqueous extract of <i>Coccinia grandis</i> L. (Family: Cucurbitaceae). The aqueous extract of <i>C. grandis</i> (AqCG) was prepared by using ultrasonication (40 °C, 20 min, 40 kHz) followed by refluxing (2½ h). The prepared AqCG (1-5 mg/mL) encapsulated alginate nanoparticles were synthesized by ionic gelation with the addition of extracts and CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Characterization of nanoparticles was performed via encapsulation efficiency (EE%), loading capacity (LC%), particle size (PS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. The antioxidant activity of the nanoparticles was evaluated in vitro by the ferric reducing antioxidant (FRAP) assay, 2,2-di-phenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assay. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's posthoc test was used to analyze the data. Maximum LC% (3.07 ± 0.11) and average particle size (71 nm from SEM) were obtained for alginate nanoparticles encapsulated at 4 mg/mL extract concentration. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP were 6.49 ± 0.10 mg/mL, 0.24 ± 0.01 mg/mL, and 20.63 ± 0.28 mg Trolox equivalent/g of extract respectively for alginate nanoparticles encapsulating the AqCG. Nanoparticles have shown a significant difference in IC<sub>50</sub> values compared to Trolox (p &lt; 0.05). The successful encapsulation of the AqCG in the alginate matrix was evidenced by FTIR and SEM analysis. Encapsulation contributed to enhancing the antioxidant activity in terms of ABTS assay when compared to the AqCG. However, in vitro release and stability studies are warranted to facilitate the development of a commercially viable nanonutraceutical using alginate nanoparticles encapsulating the AqCG."
pub.1086134097,Updated Regulatory Considerations for Nanomedicines.,"BACKGROUND: Nanomedicine is a branch which deals with medicinal products, devices, nonbiological complex drugs and antibody-nanoparticle conjugates and general health products that are manufactured using nanotechnology.
OBJECTIVE: Nano-medicine provides the same efficacies as traditional medicines owing to their improved solubility and bioavailability with reduced dosages. However, there are currently safety concerns due to the difficulties related to nanomaterial characterization; this might be the reason for unawareness of such medicines among the patients. The absence of clear regulatory guidelines further complicates matters, as it makes the path to registering them with regulatory bodies difficult. However, some products have overcome these obstacles and have been registered. While there are many international initiatives to harmonize the regulatory requirements and helps the industry to determine the most important characteristics that influence in vivo product performance.
CONCLUSION: This review focuses on the various types of nanopharmaceuticals, and developments process with strategies tailored to upcoming regulations may satisfy the patients' needs."
pub.1181591828,Development of FK506-loaded maleimide-functionalized cationic niosomes for prolonged retention and therapeutic efficacy in dry eye disease,"Tacrolimus (FK506) is widely used in ocular diseases such as corneal transplantation-host disease, uveitis, conjunctivitis, and dry eye disease (DED). However, its low aqueous solubility and poor ocular retention pose challenges for its application in the eye diseases. This study developed a novel FK506-loaded maleimide-functionalized cationic niosomes (FK506 M-CNS), aiming to prolong the retention time of FK506 in the eye and enhance its therapeutic efficacy. FK506 M-CNS had a particle size of 87.69 ± 1.05 nm and zeta potential of 22.06 ± 1.01 mV. Results of histological evaluation through H&E staining and in vitro cytotoxicity of human corneal epithelial cells consistently revealed the excellent biocompatibility of FK506 M-CNS. FK506 M-CNS exhibited superior ocular retention compared to the market product Talymus®. FK506 M-CNS significantly alleviated the symptoms of DED and promoted the recovery of corneal epithelia. FK506 M-CNS group had the lowest expression levels of inflammatory factors associated with DED. These superiorities might be due to the electrostatic interaction between cationic niosomes and negatively charged mucin in the eye, and the covalent binding of maleimide with the thiol group in the mucin. The maleimide group improved the ocular retention and efficacy of FK506, but did not increase the toxicity. Results indicated that FK506 M-CNS had great potential as a nanopharmaceutical in the treatment of ocular diseases, and M-CNS could be a promising drug carrier for ophthalmic drug delivery systems.Graphical Abstract"
pub.1154300967,Application of QbD based approach in development and validation of RP‐HPLC method for simultaneous estimation of methotrexate and baicalin in dual‐drug‐loaded liposomes,"The present study delineates the development of a novel, rugged and sensitive stability-indicating risk-based HPLC method for the concurrent estimation of methotrexate (MTX) and baicalin (BCL) in dual-drug-loaded-nanopharmaceuticals based on an analytical quality-by-design approach. Preliminary screening trials along with systemic risk analysis were performed, endeavouring to explicate the critical method attributes, namely pH, percentage of orthophosphoric acid and percentage of acetonitrile, that influence the critical quality attributes. Box-Behnken design was utilized for the optimization of the tailing factor as the response for MTX and BCL in a short run time. The chromatographic conditions were optimized by performing 17 experimental runs using design expert software. The chromatographic conditions were selected after the analysis of the optimized zone within the confines of the design space: water:acetonitrile adjusted to a pH of 3.0 with 0.05% orthophosphoric acid (60:40, %v/v) was the mobile phase, the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and an analytical C<sub>18</sub> column was used at an isobestic wavelength of 282 nm. Furthermore, the optimized method was validated in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines and was found to be within the prescribed limits. Therefore, the developed reversed-phase-high-performance liquid chromatography method has a high degree of practical utility for synchronous detection of MTX and BCL in pharmaceutical nano-dosage forms such as protein-based nanoparticles, nanocrystals, polymeric nanoparticles and metallic nanoparticles in in vivo and in vitro studies."
pub.1029247127,"Carbon nanotubes: Properties, biomedical applications, advantages and risks in patients and occupationally-exposed workers","Since the beginning of the 21st century, carbon-based nanomaterials (CNTs) have been introduced in pharmacy and medicine for drug delivery system in therapeutics. CNTs have proved able to transport a wide range of molecules across membranes and into living cells; therefore, they have attracted great interest in biomedical applications such as advanced imaging, tissue regeneration, and drug or gene delivery. Although there are many data on the advantages in terms of higher efficacy and less adverse effects, several recent findings have reported unexpected toxicities induced by CNTs. The dose, shape, surface chemistry, exposure route, and purity play important roles in these differential toxicities. Mapping these risks as well as understanding their molecular mechanisms is a crucial step in the development of any CNT-containing nanopharmaceuticals. This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of all articles published on cellular response to CNTs, underlining their therapeutic applications and possible toxicity in patients and occupationally exposed workers.

pub.1083861719,Nanopharmaceuticals as a solution to neglected diseases: Is it possible?,"The study of neglected diseases has not received much attention, especially from public and private institutions over the last years, in terms of strong support for developing treatment for these diseases. Support in the form of substantial amounts of private and public investment is greatly needed in this area. Due to the lack of novel drugs for these diseases, nanobiotechnology has appeared as an important new breakthrough for the treatment of neglected diseases. Recently, very few reviews focusing on filiarasis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, malaria, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis, and tuberculosis, and dengue virus have been published. New developments in nanocarriers have made promising advances in the treatment of several kinds of diseases with less toxicity, high efficacy and improved bioavailability of drugs with extended release and fewer applications. This review deals with the current status of nanobiotechnology in the treatment of neglected diseases and highlights how it provides key tools for exploring new perspectives in the treatment of a wide range of diseases."

Here, we report the efficient entrapment of two clinically used single-agent drugs, doxorubicin and sorafenib, against hepatocellular carcinoma. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles provide a promising approach for controlled drug release. In this study, doxorubicin and sorafenib with completely different chemical characteristics were simultaneously entrapped by the same polymeric carrier, namely poly(d,l-lactide-<i>co</i>-glycolide) (PLGA) and polyethylene glycol-poly(d,l-lactide-<i>co</i>-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA), respectively, using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method. The typical mean diameters of the nanopharmaceuticals were 142 and 177 nm, respectively. The PLGA and PEG-PLGA polymers encapsulated doxorubicin with efficiencies of 52% and 69%, respectively, while these values for sorafenib were 55% and 88%, respectively. Sustained drug delivery under biorelevant conditions was found for doxorubicin, while sorafenib was released quickly from the PLGA-doxorubicin-sorafenib and PEG-PLGA-doxorubicin-sorafenib nanotherapeutics."
pub.1035548299,Danshen diversity defeating dementia,"Salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) is widely used for the clinical treatment of cerebral ischemia and cardiovascular diseases. Its diverse molecular makeup of simple and poly hydroxycinnamic acids and diterpenoid quinones are also associated with its beneficial health effects such as improved cognitive deficits in mice, protection of neuronal cells, prevention of amyloid fibril formation and preformed amyloid fibril disaggregation related to Alzheimer's disease. Whilst the in vitro studies have therapeutic promise, the anti-dementia effect/impact of danshen however depends on its absorbed constituents and pharmacokinetic properties. Both the water and lipid danshen fractions have been shown to have low oral bioavailability and at physiological pH, the polyphenolic carboxylate anions are not brain permeable. To tap into the many neuroprotective and other biological benefits of danshen, the key challenge resides in developing danshen nanopharmaceuticals, semi-synthetic pro-drug forms of its constituents to improve its biocompatability, that is, absorption, circulation in bloodstream and optimization of BBB permeability.

pub.1150492762,Nanoemulsified Genistein and Vitamin D Mediated Epigenetic Regulation to Inhibit Osteoporosis,"The imbalance in the bone remodeling process with more bone resorption by osteoclasts compared to bone formation by osteoblasts results in a metabolic bone disorder known as osteoporosis. This condition reduces the bone mineral density and increases the risk of fractures due to low bone mass and disrupted bone microarchitecture. Osteoclastogenesis increases when the receptor activator NFκB ligand (RANKL) on the osteoblast surface binds to the receptor activator NFκB (RANK) on the osteoclast surface and the function of the decoy receptor of RANKL, osteoprotegrin, is compromised due to external stimuli such as heparin and lipopolysaccharides. The RANK/RANKL axis promotes the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) expression, which in turn increases the histone methyltransferase activity of EzH2 and EzH1 for the epigenetic regulation of osteoclastogenesis-related genes. Genistein counteracts NFκB-induced osteoclastogenesis and downstream signaling through the direct regulation of histone methyltransferase, EzH2 and EzH1, transcription. However, genistein possesses limitations like low bioavailability, low water solubility, high estrogen activity, and thyroid side effects, which obstruct its therapeutic usage. Here, the nanoemulsified formulation of genistein with vitamin D was utilized to circumvent the limitations of genistein so that it can be utilized for therapeutic purposes in osteoporosis management. The nanoemulsification of genistein and vitamin D was performed through the spontaneous emulsification using Tween 80 and medium chain triglyceride oil as an organic phase. The physiologically stable and biocompatible combination of the genistein and vitamin D nanoemulsion (GVNE) exhibited the controlled release pattern of genistein with Korsmeyer-Peppas and Higuchi models under different pH conditions (7.4, 6.5, and 1.2). The GVNE potentially enhanced the therapeutic efficacy under <i>in vitro</i> osteoporosis models and helped restore disease parameters like alkaline phosphatase activity, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, and the formation of multinuclear giant cells. Molecularly, the GVNE overturned the LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis by downregulation of NFκB expression along with its binding on EzH2 and EzH1 promoters. GVNE effects on the osteoporosis model established it as an efficient antiosteoporotic therapy. This nanonutraceutical-based formulation provides an epigenetic regulation of osteoporosis management and opens new avenues for alternate epigenetic therapies for osteoporosis."
pub.1041812689,Docosahexaenoic acid liposomes for targeting chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer: an in vitro assessment,"Inflammation, oxidative stress, and uncontrolled cell proliferation are common key features of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and cancer. ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; also known as omega3 fatty acids or fish oil) have beneficial effects against inflammation upon dietary consumption. However, these effects cannot be fully exploited unless diets are enriched with high concentrations of fish oil supplements over long periods of time. Here, a nanomedicine-based approach is presented for delivering effective levels of PUFAs to inflammatory cells. Nanoparticles are internalized by immune cells, and hence can adequately deliver bioactive lipids into these target cells. The ω3 FA docosahexaenoic acid was formulated into liposomes (ω-liposomes), and evaluated for anti-inflammatory effects in different types of immune cells. ω-Liposomes strongly inhibited the release of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species from human neutrophils and murine macrophages, and also inhibited the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and MCP1. Moreover, ω-liposomes inhibited tumor-cell proliferation when evaluated in FaDu head and neck squamous carcinoma and 4T1 breast cancer cells in in vitro cultures. We propose that ω-liposomes are a promising nanonutraceutical formulation for intravenous delivery of fish oil FAs, which may be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and cancer."
pub.1077609353,Nanotechnological medical devices and nanopharmaceuticals: the European regulatory framework and research needs.,"The European regulatory framework is examined in relation to nanotechnology based medical devices and medicinal products. Medical applications of nanotechnology will have to comply with the requirement for a high level of public health, safety, consumer, and environmental protection. An evaluation of the possible health or environmental risks of nanoparticles must therefore be carried out and it is important to ensure that particle size and chemistry are taken into account when investigating possible adverse effects. Further research is needed on the toxicological and ecotoxicological properties of nanoparticles, their uptake in the body, accumulation in tissues and organs, transport characteristics, exposure and dose-response data, and their distribution and persistence in the environment. The existing regulations appear adequate to manage the risks of nanotechnology at its current stage of development but continuous review of the regulatory regime will be needed to determine whether it is sufficient to protect human health and the environment. Modification of the legislation may prove necessary as new scientific evidence emerges regarding the effects of nanoparticles on living organisms and in the ecosystems."

Those cases would be considered as nanopharmaceuticals. The development of inorganic systems is opening the pharmaceutical nanotechnology novel horizons for diagnosis, imaging and therapy mainly because of their nanometer-size and their high surface area to volume ratios which allow for specific functions that are not possible in the micrometer-size particles. This review will focus on pharmaceutical forms that are based on inorganic nanoparticles where the nanosize of the inorganic component provides unique characteristics to the pharmaceutical form. Several examples of these systems that are either in pre-clinical investigation and under examination by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or that have been already approved by the FDA and are in clinical practice today like Gastromark, NanoTherm, Colloidal Gold for Lateral Flow tests, HfO-NPs, BioVant will be described and reviewed."
pub.1069191323,Nanomedicines as cancer therapeutics: current status.,"As of 21st century, cancer is arguably the most complex and challenging disease known to mankind and an inevitable public health concern of this millennium. Nanotechnology, suitably amalgamated with cancer research, has ushered an era of highly personalized and safer medicines which can improve cancer diagnosis and therapy. A wide variety of nanomedicines are currently under investigation, including polymeric/non-polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, lipid- and micelle-based nanoparticles. The bases of these nanomedicines in reducing toxicity associated with cancer therapy are their ability to carry a large payload and multivalent-ligand targeting. This imparts specificity for targeting the tissues as well as bypass resistance mechanisms. The major hurdles on these future medicines are potential toxicity of nanoparticles, which imposes the need of extensive regulatory evaluation before nanomedicines could be utilized as cancer therapeutics. This review highlights nanopharmaceuticals that have been investigated in oncology for various applications (diagnosis, therapeutic delivery and theranostics). It also discusses the effects of nano-sized materials on tissues/organ functions, the possibility of overcoming multi-drug resistance by using nanomedicines and their current clinical status."
pub.1023149249,Perspectives on carbon nanotube-mediated adverse immune effects,"Carbon nanotubes are entities of different morphology and aspect ratios with anisotropic character. Due to their unique electronic, photonic, mechanical and chemical properties, carbon nanotubes are receiving increasing attention in nanomedicine research where examples include site-specific drug and nucleic acid delivery, photodynamic therapy and photoacoustic molecular imaging. The interaction of carbon nanotubes with the immune system, which plays a key role in the recognition and elimination of foreign materials, and consequential responses, is of central importance for the proposed successful biomedical applications of nanotubes. Research in this avenue, however, is scant and the limited available data are rather contradictory. In this progress article we have collected some of the most important experimental results obtained thus far on carbon nanotube-mediated immune toxicity with an emphasis on cardiovascular exposure, including activation of the complement system, macrophage recognition and clearance, and overall effects on the functionality of different immune cells. Mapping these immune-related risks as well as understanding their molecular mechanisms is a crucial step in the development of any carbon nanotube-containing nanopharmaceuticals."
pub.1141120231,Inhalable nanoparticles delivery targeting alveolar macrophages for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis,"Pulmonary tuberculosis is a highly prevalent respiratory disease that affects approximately a quarter of the world's population. The drug treatment protocol for tuberculosis is complex because the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) invades macrophages and begins to infect. Thus treatment usually includes combination therapy with several drugs such as rifampicin, pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol over a long dosing period. Therefore, drug-delivery technologies have been developed to improve patient compliance with medication, reduce adverse effects, and increase effectiveness of the treatment. In the present review, we have discussed recent inhalable nanopharmaceutical systems for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and investigated their design and effectiveness. We examined the underlying processes and characteristics of spray-drying technology and studied the formulation of a dry carrier using spray-drying method. Moreover, we reviewed various research articles on pulmonary delivery of nanoparticles using these carriers, and studied their alveolar macrophage targeting ability and therapeutic effects. Further, we appraised the effectiveness of nanoparticle inhalation therapy for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and its potential as a treatment strategy for lung diseases."
pub.1043804518,A structurally diverse library of safe-by-design citrem-phospholipid lamellar and non-lamellar liquid crystalline nano-assemblies,"Non-lamellar liquid crystalline aqueous nanodispersions, known also as ISAsomes (internally self-assembled 'somes' or nanoparticles), are gaining increasing interest in drug solubilisation and bio-imaging, but they often exhibit poor hemocompatibility and induce cytotoxicity. This limits their applications in intravenous drug delivery and targeting. Using a binary mixture of citrem and soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC) at different weight ratios, we describe a library of colloidally stable aqueous and hemocompatible nanodispersions of diverse nanoarchitectures (internal self-assembled nanostructures). This engineered library is structurally stable in human plasma as well as being hemocompatible (non-hemolytic, and poor activator of the complement system). By varying citrem to lipid weight ratio, the nanodispersion susceptibility to macrophage uptake could also be modulated. Finally, the formation of nanodispersions comprising internally V2 (inverse bicontinuous cubic) and H2 (inverse hexagonal) nanoarchitectures was achieved without the use of an organic solvent, a secondary emulsifier, or high-energy input. The tunable binary citrem/SPC nanoplatform holds promise for future development of hemocompatible and immune-safe nanopharmaceuticals."

IR spectroscopy was used to follow the dynamic structural transitions of the transfection competent 100 nm DNA-divalent metal cation-phospholipid ternary complex upon recognition of individual molecules engaged. The selection of small charged metal ions as complexing agents and zwitterionic L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine as an alternative to the currently used problematic cationic lipids in gene transfection is emphasized. Spectra of unbound components were compared with those of nucleic acid-lipid and lipid-metal ion binary mixtures, as well as with the ternary complex. Data obtained for carbonyl, phosphate, choline and CH groups was used for deductions of DNA-phospholipid recognition profiles, induced by Mn(2+). Ion effects were considered as dehydrations of phosphates and H-bonding of carbonyls. The possible structure of the ternary complex is discussed with its further potential to be utilized as a nonviral gene delivery formulation.

pub.1009006488,Recent advances in targeted nanoparticles drug delivery to melanoma,"Melanoma is one of the most aggressive skin cancers, notorious for its high multidrug resistance and low survival rate. Conventional therapies (e.g., dacarbazine, interferon-alpha-2b and interleukin-2) are limited by low response rate and demonstrate no overall survival benefit. Novel targeted therapies (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib and trametinib) have higher initial response rate and clear impact on the overall survival, but relapse usually occurs within 6 to 9 months. Although immunotherapy (e.g., ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab) can achieve long-term and durable response, rate of adverse events is extremely high. With the development of nanotechnology, the applications of nanocarriers are widely expected to change the landscape of melanoma therapy for foreseeable future. In this review, we will relate recent advances in the application of multifunctional nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery to melanoma, in melanoma nanotheranostics and combination therapy, and nanopharmaceutical associated melanoma clinical trials, followed by challenges and perspectives.

The present study investigated the anticancer effects of COS against the human colon (HCT116) and breast (MDA-MB-231-Luc) cancer cell lines. Inhibition of cell lines viability and IC50 of COS were assessed via an MTT assay. Furthermore, the apoptotic rate was detected by assessment of Bcl2-associated X (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein levels by flow cytometry. Xenograft mice model of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231-Luc were carried out to determine the effect of COS and its nanoparticles (COS-NPs). The results demonstrated that COS inhibited the viability of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231-Luc cells, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration value (IC50) of 39.92 µM and 100.57 µM, respectively. COS significantly increased Bax and decreased Bcl2 levels in treated cells. COS and COS-NPs, in combination with doxorubicin (DOX), significantly decreased the tumor growth of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231-Luc implants in mice. Furthermore, oral administration of COS and COS-NPs significantly decreased the viable cells and increased necrotic/apoptotic cells of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231-Luc implants. Interestingly, both COS and COS-NPs protected the cardiac muscles against DOX's cardiotoxicity. The current results indicated the promising anticancer and cardiac muscles protection of COS and COS-NPs when administered with chemotherapy."

pub.1059302439,Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Improve Outcome after In Vitro and In Vivo Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,"Mild traumatic brain injury results in aberrant free radical generation, which is associated with oxidative stress, secondary injury signaling cascades, mitochondrial dysfunction, and poor functional outcome. Pharmacological targeting of free radicals with antioxidants has been examined as an approach to treatment, but has met with limited success in clinical trials. Conventional antioxidants that are currently available scavenge a single free radical before they are destroyed in the process. Here, we report for the first time that a novel regenerative cerium oxide nanoparticle antioxidant reduces neuronal death and calcium dysregulation after <i>in vitro</i> trauma. Further, using an <i>in vivo</i> model of mild lateral fluid percussion brain injury in the rat, we report that cerium oxide nanoparticles also preserve endogenous antioxidant systems, decrease macromolecular free radical damage, and improve cognitive function. Taken together, our results demonstrate that cerium oxide nanoparticles are a novel nanopharmaceutical with potential for mitigating neuropathological effects of mild traumatic brain injury and modifying the course of recovery."
pub.1142590070,Development of oral curcumin based on pH-responsive transmembrane peptide-cyclodextrin derivative nanoparticles for hepatoma,"Herein, a pH-responsive cyclodextrin derivative (R6H4-CMβCD) with cell-penetrating ability was successfully synthesized, and curcumin-loaded nanoparticles (R6H4-CMβCD@CUR NPs, RCCNPs) were developed to improve its efficacy in hepatoma. RCCNPs could improve the cell uptake compared with CMβCD@CUR NPs (CCNPs) and were internalized into cells mainly through endocytosis mediated by reticulin and macropinocytosis. Furthermore, the accumulation of RCCNPs in hepatoma cells at pH 6.4 was higher than that at pH 7.4, indicating a pH-responsive uptake. Additionally, RCCNPs could escape from the lysosomes via the ""proton sponge effect"", and a high apoptosis rate was detected. Importantly, in vivo experiments revealed that orally administered RCCNPs could exert excellent anti-cancer effects in tumor-bearing mice. Hematoxylin-eosin staining did not show significant histological changes in the major organs. Thus, our findings indicate the potential of R6H4-CMβCD as a nanopharmaceutical material, and RCCNPs as an effective delivery system for oral curcumin in cancer management."

After passing all the ethical and biological assessments, and satisfying the investors as to future profitability, only a handful of these nanoformulations, successfully obtained marketing approval. We survey the range of nanomedicines that have received regulatory approval and are marketed. We discuss ethics, costs, commercial development and possible market failure. We estimate the global nanomedicine market size and future growth. Our goal is to summarize the different approved nanoformulations on the market, and briefly cover the challenges and future outlook."
pub.1069170475,(Phospho)lipid-based Nanosystems for Skin Administration.,"Nanotechnology and nanomedicine provide a platform for advanced therapeutic strategies for dermal and transdermal drug delivery. The focus of this review is on the current state-of-art in lipid-based nanotechnology and nanomedicine for (trans)dermal drug therapy. Drug delivery nanosystems based on the (phospho)lipid constituents are characterized and compared, with the emphasis on their ability to assure the controlled drug release to the skin and skin appendages, drug targeting and safety. Different types of liposomes, biphasic vesicles, particulate lipid-based nanosystems and micro- and nano-emulsions are discussed in more details. Extensive research in preclinical studies has shown that numerous parameters including the composition, size, surface properties and their combinations affect the deposition and/or penetration of carrier-associated drug into/through the skin, and consequently determine the therapeutic effect. The superiority of the most promising nanopharmaceuticals has been confirmed in clinical studies. We have selected several common skin disorders and provided overview over promises of nanodermatology in antimicrobial skin therapy, anti-acne treatment, skin oncology, gene delivery and vaccines. We addressed the potential toxicity and irritation issues and provided an overview of registered lipid-based products. "
pub.1173713169,Transforming Albumin into a Trojan Horse of Immunotherapy-Resistant Colorectal Cancer with a High Microsatellite Instability,"The therapeutic response of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is indeed surprising; however, the emergence of acquired resistance poses an even greater threat to the survival of these patients. Herein, bioinformatics analysis of MSI-H CRC samples revealed that Wnt signaling pathway represents a promising target for acquired immune reactivation, while subsequent analysis and biochemical testing substantiated the inclination of Wnt-hyperactive CRC cells to engage in macropinocytosis with human serum albumin (HSA). These findings have inspired us to develop an engineered HSA that not only possesses the ability to specifically target cancer cells but also effectively suppresses the Wnt/β-catenin cascade within these malignant cells. In pursuit of this objective, a comprehensive screening of reported Wnt small-molecule inhibitors was conducted to evaluate their affinity with HSA, and it was discovered that Carnosic acid (CA) exhibited the highest affinity while simultaneously revealing multiple binding sites. Further investigation revealed that CA HSA the capability to engineer HSA into spherical and size-tunable nanostructures known as eHSA (Engineering HSA particle), which demonstrated optimized macropinocytosis-dependent cellular internalization. As anticipated, eHSA effectively suppressed the Wnt signaling pathway and reactivated the acquired immune response in vivo. Furthermore, eHSA successfully restored sensitivity to Anti-PD1's anticancer effects in both subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse homograft models of MSI-H CRC, as well as a humanized hu-PBMC patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse model of MSI-H CRC, all while maintaining a favorable safety profile. The collective implementation of this clinically viable immune reactivation strategy not only enables the delivery of Wnt inhibitors for CRC therapy, but also serves as an exemplary demonstration of precision-medicine-guided nanopharmaceutical development that effectively harnesses specific cellular indications in pathological states."
pub.1158180386,Formulation Strategies of Nanosuspensions for Various Administration Routes,"Nanosuspensions (NSs), which are nanosized colloidal particle systems, have recently become one of the most interesting substances in nanopharmaceuticals. NSs have high commercial potential because they provide the enhanced solubility and dissolution of low-water-soluble drugs by means of their small particle sizes and large surface areas. In addition, they can alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug and, thus, improve its efficacy and safety. These advantages can be used to enhance the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs in oral, dermal, parenteral, pulmonary, ocular, or nasal routes for systemic or local effects. Although NSs often consist mainly of pure drugs in aqueous media, they can also contain stabilizers, organic solvents, surfactants, co-surfactants, cryoprotectants, osmogents, and other components. The selection of stabilizer types, such as surfactants or/and polymers, and their ratio are the most critical factors in NS formulations. NSs can be prepared both with top-down methods (wet milling, dry milling, high-pressure homogenization, and co-grinding) and with bottom-up methods (anti-solvent precipitation, liquid emulsion, and sono-precipitation) by research laboratories and pharmaceutical professionals. Nowadays, techniques combining these two technologies are also frequently encountered. NSs can be presented to patients in liquid dosage forms, or post-production processes (freeze drying, spray drying, or spray freezing) can also be applied to transform the liquid state into the solid state for the preparation of different dosage forms such as powders, pellets, tablets, capsules, films, or gels. Thus, in the development of NS formulations, the components/amounts, preparation methods, process parameters/levels, administration routes, and dosage forms must be defined. Moreover, those factors that are the most effective for the intended use should be determined and optimized. This review discusses the effect of the formulation and process parameters on the properties of NSs and highlights the recent advances, novel strategies, and practical considerations relevant to the application of NSs to various administration routes."
pub.1135425757,Co-delivery of imidazolium Zn(II)salen and Origanum Syriacum essential oil by shrimp chitosan nanoparticles for antimicrobial applications,"This study reports preparation and physicochemical characterization of natural antimicrobials (Origanum Syriacum essential oil (OSEO), shrimp chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs)) and new imidazolium ionic liquid-supported Zn(II)Salen. These antimicrobials were separately or co-encapsulated by CSNPs to fabricate novel antimicrobial nanoplatforms ""NPFs"" (OSEO-loaded CSNPs (NPF-1), Zn(II)Salen-loaded CSNPs (NPF-2), and Zn(II)Salen@OSEO-loaded CSNPs (NPF-3)). The finding of loading, encapsulation, and antimicrobial release studies confirm the suitability of CSNPs for nanoencapsulation of Zn(II)Salen and OSEO. All NPFs can significantly suppress the growth of microbial species with performances dependent upon the microbial strain and nanoplatform concentration. The susceptibility of microbes toward new antimicrobials was as follows; Gram-positive bacteria > Gram-negative bacteria > fungi. The amazing physicochemical features of new nanoplatforms and their bioactive ingredients (Zn(II)Salen, OSEO, and CSNPs) signify the importance of our designs for developing a new generation of nanopharmaceuticals supported both natural products and biogenic ionic metal cofactors, targeting the multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens."
pub.1047881474,TAT-modified nanosilver for combating multidrug-resistant cancer,"A nanopharmaceutical system using TAT-enhanced cell/tissue penetration strategy was developed for multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer treatment, in which nanocrystalline silver with mean size of 8 nm modified with TAT cell-penetrating peptide (termed AgNP-TAT) displayed extraordinary antitumor activity in both MDR cells and non-resistant cells at an indiscriminating manner. Such anti-MDR effect is presumably due to the size-exclusion effect, by which the nanoparticles are too large to be pumped out. Of note, AgNP-TAT showed significant enhancement in killing tumor cells, e.g. up to 24 fold higher compared to its counterpart without TAT-modification. The animal studies further confirmed the success of our strategy that AgNP-TAT was able to effectively inhibit the tumor growth in the mice bearing malignant melanoma at a dose of 1 nmol/kg, compared with the effective dose (4.3 μmol/kg) of doxorubicin. AgNP-TAT also showed significantly reduced adverse toxicity in vivo. It indicates AgNP-TAT could be a class of nano drug for MDR cancer treatment."
pub.1125108136,Active matter therapeutics,"Nanotherapies based on micelles, liposomes, polymersomes, nanocapsules, magnetic nanoparticles, and noble metal nanoparticles have been at the forefront of drug delivery in the past few decades. Some of these nanopharmaceuticals have been commercially applied to treat a wide range of diseases, from dry eye syndrome to cancer. However, the majority involve particles that are passive, meaning that they do not change shape, and they lack motility; the static features can limit their therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we take a critical look at an emerging field that seeks to utilize active matter for therapeutics. In this context, active matter can be broadly referred to as micro or nanosized constructs that energetically react with their environment or external fields and translate, rotate, vibrate or change shape. Essentially, the recent literature suggests that such particles could significantly augment present-day drug delivery, by enhancing transport and increasing permeability across anatomical barriers by transporting drugs within solid tumor microenvironments or disrupting cardiovascular plaque. We discuss examples of such particles and link the transport and permeability properties of active matter to potential therapeutic applications in the context of two major diseases, namely cancer and heart disease. We also discuss potential challenges, opportunities, and translational hurdles."
pub.1111003920,Immunoglobulin deposition on biomolecule corona determines complement opsonization efficiency of preclinical and clinical nanoparticles,"Deposition of complement factors (opsonization) on nanoparticles may promote clearance from the blood by macrophages and trigger proinflammatory responses, but the mechanisms regulating the efficiency of complement activation are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that opsonization of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoworms with the third complement protein (C3) was dependent on the biomolecule corona of the nanoparticles. Here we show that natural antibodies play a critical role in C3 opsonization of SPIO nanoworms and a range of clinically approved nanopharmaceuticals. The dependency of C3 opsonization on immunoglobulin binding is almost universal and is observed regardless of the complement activation pathway. Only a few surface-bound immunoglobulin molecules are needed to trigger complement activation and opsonization. Although the total amount of plasma proteins adsorbed on nanoparticles does not determine C3 deposition efficiency, the biomolecule corona per se enhances immunoglobulin binding to all nanoparticle types. We therefore show that natural antibodies represent a link between biomolecule corona and C3 opsonization, and may determine individual complement responses to nanomedicines."
pub.1032344299,Perceptive solutions to anti-filarial chemotherapy of lymphatic filariasis from the plethora of nanomedical sciences,"INTRODUCTION: Growing interest in the application of nanotechnology to treat lymphatic filariasis (LF) implies that the imminent medical arsenal of this interesting technology is attractive for health authorities. Currently, they are completely dependent on friendly oral mass drug (anti-filarials) administration to eliminate this morbid disease and are now looking for new alternatives to bring about further improvements.
AREAS COVERED: A plethora of issues affecting the oral bioavailability of the mainstay human lymphatic filarial drugs, leading to meager pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics issues in anti-filarial chemotherapy are identified. Various important nanomedical drug delivery systems are highlighted and their solutions provided. A conceptual resolution to strictly arrest the transmission of LF in endemic areas is also presented.
FUTURE PERSPECTIVES: Unless the solutions for pharmacokinetic tribulations and the measurement of factual pharmacodynamic endpoints for the existing anti-filarial drugs are evaluated using relevant approaches, health authorities will not be able to devise optimal treatment regimens for affected patients. Contemporary therapeutic paradigms need to be shifted toward the upcoming schemes of nanopharmaceutical sciences, which have enormous potential to advance the community-directed management of this tropical disease by improving the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the filaricidal agents."
pub.1049679216,Genomic perspectives in inter-individual adverse responses following nanomedicine administration: The way forward,"The underlying mechanism of intravenous infusion-related adverse reactions inherent to regulatory-approved nanomedicines still remains elusive. There are substantial inter-individual differences in observed adverse reactions, which may include cardiovascular, broncho-pulmonary, muco-cutaneous, neuro-psychosomatic and autonomic manifestations. Although nanomedicine-mediated triggering of complement activation has been suggested to be a significant contributing factor to these adverse events, complement activation may still proceed in non-responders. Whether these reactions share similar immunological mechanisms and underpinning genetic factors with drug hypersensitivity syndrome remains to be investigated. Genetic association studies could be a powerful tool to dissect causative factors and reveal the multiple molecular pathways that induce infusion related adverse reactions. It is envisaged that such research may lead to the design of reliable in vitro profiling tests for risk assessment and treatment decisions, thereby revolutionizing the practice of medicine with nanopharmaceuticals. Such procedures may further improve regulatory approval processes for nanomedicines currently in the pipeline and decrease the overall cost of health care. Here we discuss some key innate immunity genes and their polymorphisms in relation to nanomedicine infusion-mediated symptomatic responses."
pub.1016011304,Nanopharmaceutical approach using pelargonidin towards enhancement of efficacy for prevention of alloxan-induced DNA damage in L6 cells via activation of PARP and p53,"Alloxan is an environmental food contaminant that causes DNA damage in living cells and induces hyperglycemia. Pelargonidin (PG), an active ingredient found in extract of various fruits and vegetables, has been nanoencapsulated (NPG) with poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) and tested for efficacy in prevention of alloxan (ALX)-induced DNA damage in L6 cells in vitro. Glucose uptake, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, glucose transporter 4, glucokinase levels and mechanism of activation of DNA repair proteins (PARP and p53) have been studied in ALX-induced L6 cells. Drug-DNA interaction has been analyzed using calf thymus DNA as target through circular dichroism and melting temperature profile. NPGs were physico-chemically characterized by standard protocols using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Pre-treatment with both PG and/or NPG was effective in reducing ALX-induced oxidative stress and showed favourable effects for protection against DNA damage by activating DNA repair cascades. Results suggested ∼10-fold increase in efficacy of NPG than PG in prevention of alloxan-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage. "
pub.1131000527,An Elucidative Review to Analytically Sieve the Viability of Nanomedicine Market,"The advent of the twenty-first century marked a paradigm shift in the healthcare sector with coming of automated, sensitive, targeted medicines and technologies having diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic effects. Nanomedicines also attained wide acclamation in their initial years, but the transformation from being the proof of concept to successfully marketed products seems very daunting. Although the reason for this may be attributed to slow but incremental character of many present-day technologies, the review asserts that there are other significant facets that may purvey a thorough explanation of this scenario. The article elaborately discusses the hurdles hindering clinical translation of nanomedicines including scale-up challenges, in vitro in vivo cascade of toxicology assays, along with unrefined manufacturing guidelines, inadequate regulatory approvals, competitive conventional market, etc., leading to hesitant investments by pharmaceutical giants. The paper also explores the economic viability of nanobiotechnology sector through an empirical investigation of the revenue data of various pharmaceutical industries manufacturing nano-based drugs, which indicates minor commercial importance of these medicines. We also laid down a comprehensive set of recommendations to smoothen the translational pathway of nanomedicines from an idea to reality, efface the consumer distrust and push boundaries for development and launching of safe, efficient and commercially successful products.Graphical abstract"
pub.1046961400,Facile route to versatile nanoplatforms for drug delivery by one-pot self-assembly,"There is still unmet demand for developing powerful approaches to produce polymeric nanoplatforms with versatile functions and broad applications, which are essential for the successful bench-to-bedside translation of polymeric nanotherapeutics developed in the laboratory. We have discovered a facile, convenient, cost-effective and easily scalable one-pot strategy to assemble various lipophilic therapeutics bearing carboxyl groups into nanomedicines, through which highly effective cargo loading and nanoparticle formation can be achieved simultaneously. Besides dramatically improving water solubility, the assembled nanopharmaceuticals showed significantly higher bioavailability and much better therapeutic activity. These one-pot assemblies may also serve as nanocontainers to effectively accommodate other highly hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel (PTX). PTX nanomedicines thus formulated display strikingly enhanced in vitro antitumor activity and can reverse the multidrug resistance of tumor cells to PTX therapy. The special surface chemistry offers these assembled entities the additional capability of efficiently packaging and efficaciously transfecting plasmid DNA, with a transfection efficiency markedly higher than that of commonly used positive controls. Consequently, this one-pot assembly approach provides a facile route to multifunctional nanoplatforms for simultaneous delivery of multiple therapeutics with improved therapeutic significance."
pub.1013162246,Cerium oxide nanoparticles in neuroprotection and considerations for efficacy and safety,"Cerium oxide nanoparticles have widespread use in the materials industry, and have recently come into consideration for biomedical use due to their potent regenerative antioxidant properties. Given that the brain is one of the most highly oxidative organs in the body, it is subject to some of the greatest levels of oxidative stress, particularly in neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, cerium oxide nanoparticles are currently being investigated for efficacy in several neurodegenerative disorders and have shown promising levels of neuroprotection. This review discusses the basis for cerium oxide nanoparticle use in neurodegenerative disease and its hypothesized mechanism of action. The review focuses on an up-to-date summary of in vivo work with cerium oxide nanoparticles in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, we examine the current state of information regarding biodistribution, toxicity, and safety for cerium oxide nanoparticles at the in vivo level. Finally, we discuss future directions that are necessary if this nanopharmaceutical is to move up from the bench to the bedside.

pub.1144339017,Biodegradable nanoparticles combining cancer cell targeting and anti-angiogenic activity for synergistic chemotherapy in epithelial cancer,"A biodegradable engineered nanoplatform combining anti-angiogenic activity and targeting of cancer cells to improve the anticancer activity of docetaxel (DTX) is here proposed. Indeed, we have developed biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone), exposing on the surface both folate motifs (Fol) for recognition in cells overexpressing Folate receptor-α (FRα) and the anti-angiogenic hexapeptide aFLT1. NPs showed a size around 100 nm, the exposure of 60% of Fol moieties on the surface, and the ability to entrap DTX and sustain its release with time. NPs were stable in simulated biological fluids and slightly interacted with Fetal Bovine serum, especially in the formulation decorated with Fol and aFLT1. The presence of Fol on NPs did not impair the anti-angiogenic activity of aFLT1, as assessed by in vitro tube formation assay in HUVEC endothelial cells. In both 2D and 3D KB cell cultures in vitro, the cytotoxicity of DTX loaded in NPs was not significantly affected by Fol/aFLT1 double decoration compared to free DTX. Remarkably, NPs distributed differently in 3D multicellular spheroids of FRα-positive KB cancer cells depending on the type of ligand displayed on the surface. In particular, NPs unmodified on the surface were randomly distributed in the spheroid, whereas the presence of Fol promoted the accumulation in the outer rims of the spheroid. Finally, NPs with Fol and aFLT1 gave a uniform distribution throughout the spheroid structure. When tested in zebrafish embryos xenografted with KB cells, NPs displaying Fol/aFLT1 reduced DTX systemic toxicity and inhibited the growth of the tumor mass and associated vasculature synergistically. Overall, nanotechnology offers excellent ground for combining therapeutic concepts in cancer, paving the way to novel multifunctional nanopharmaceuticals decorated with bioactive elements that can significantly improve therapeutic outcomes.Graphical abstract"
pub.1042059323,Cadmium-containing nanoparticles: Perspectives on pharmacology and toxicology of quantum dots,"The field of nanotechnology is rapidly expanding with the development of novel nanopharmaceuticals that have potential for revolutionizing medical treatment. The rapid pace of expansion in this field has exceeded the pace of pharmacological and toxicological research on the effects of nanoparticles in the biological environment. The development of cadmium-containing nanoparticles, known as quantum dots, show great promise for treatment and diagnosis of cancer and targeted drug delivery, due to their size-tunable fluorescence and ease of functionalization for tissue targeting. However, information on pharmacology and toxicology of quantum dots needs much further development, making it difficult to assess the risks associated with this new nanotechnology. Further, nanotechnology poses yet another risk for toxic cadmium, which will now enter the biological realm in nano-form. In this review, we discuss cadmium-containing quantum dots and their physicochemical properties at the nano-scale. We summarize the existing work on pharmacology and toxicology of cadmium-containing quantum dots and discuss perspectives in their utility in disease treatment. Finally, we identify critical gaps in our knowledge of cadmium quantum dot toxicity, and how these gaps need to be assessed to enable quantum dot nanotechnology to transit safely from bench to bedside."
pub.1020181288,Preserving the supersaturation generation capability of amorphous drug-polysaccharide nanoparticle complex after freeze drying,"While the supersaturation generation capability of amorphous nanopharmaceuticals (NPs) in their aqueous suspension form has been well established, their supersaturation generation is adversely affected after drying. Herein we investigated the effects of freeze drying on the supersaturation generation capability of a new class of amorphous NPs referred to as drug nanoplex prepared and stabilized by electrostatic complexation of drug molecules with polysaccharides (dextran sulfate). Using ciprofloxacin as the model drug, two types of freeze-drying adjuvants were investigated, i.e., (1) highly water-soluble excipient (trehalose, mannitol), whose role was to prevent irreversible NPs aggregations upon drying, and (2) crystallization inhibitor (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC)), whose role was to suppress crystallization of the dissolved drug and the remaining solid phase. The results showed that dual-adjuvant formulations (i.e. trehalose-HPMC and mannitol-HPMC) were required to preserve the supersaturation generation capability of the drug nanoplex suspension after drying. Freeze drying with only one adjuvant type, or incorporating HPMC as physical mixtures with the freeze-dried nanoplex, were ineffective in preserving the supersaturation. The dual-adjuvant formulations produced prolonged supersaturation levels over 240min at ≈6-8× of the saturation solubility with comparable area under the curve (AUC) in the concentration versus time plot as that exhibited by the suspension form.

pub.1128054031,Non-Functionalized Fullerenes and Endofullerenes in Aqueous Dispersions as Superoxide Scavengers,"Endohedral metal fullerene are potential nanopharmaceuticals for MRI; thus, it is important to study their effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Superoxide anion radical is one of the key ROS. The reactivity of aqueous dispersions of pristine (non-functionalized) fullerenes and Gd@C<sub>82</sub> endofullerene have been studied with respect to superoxide in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase chemiluminescence system. It was found that C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub> in aqueous dispersions react with superoxide as scavengers by a similar mechanism; differences in activity are determined by cluster parameters, primarily the concentration of available, acting molecules at the surface. Gd endofullerene is characterized by a significantly (one-and-a-half to two orders of magnitude) higher reactivity with respect to C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub> and is likely to exhibit nanozyme (SOD-mimic) properties, which can be accounted for by the nonuniform distribution of electron density of the fullerene cage due to the presence of the endohedral atom; however, in the cell model, Gd@C<sub>82</sub> showed the lowest activity compared to C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub>, which can be accounted for by its higher affinity for the lipid phase."
pub.1047479475,Cytokines as biomarkers of nanoparticle immunotoxicity,"Nanoscale objects, whether of biologic origin or synthetically created, are being developed into devices for a variety of bionanotechnology diagnostic and pharmaceutical applications. However, the potential immunotoxicity of these nanomaterials and mechanisms by which they may induce adverse reactions have not received sufficient attention. Nanomaterials, depending on their characteristics and compositions, can interact with the immune system in several ways and either enhance or suppress immune system function. Cytokines perform pleiotropic functions to mediate and regulate the immune response and are generally recognized as biomarkers of immunotoxicity. While the specificity and validity of certain cytokines as markers of adverse immune response has been established for chemicals, small and macromolecular drugs, research on their applicability for predicting and monitoring the immunotoxicity of engineered nanomaterials is still ongoing. The goal of this review is to provide guidelines as to important cytokines that can be utilized for evaluating the immunotoxicity of nanomaterials and to highlight the role of those cytokines in mediating adverse reactions, which is of particular importance for the clinical development of nanopharmaceuticals and other nanotechnology-based products. Importantly, the rational design of nanomaterials of low immunotoxicity will be discussed, focusing on synthetic nanodevices, with emphasis on both the nanoparticle-forming materials and the embedded cargoes."
pub.1122018966,Host immune response to anti-cancer camptothecin conjugated cyclodextrin-based polymers,"IntroductionEfficacy and safety are critical concerns when designing drug carriers. Nanoparticles are a particular type of carrier that has gained recent attention in cancer therapeutics.MethodsIn this study, we assess the safety profile of IT-101, a nanoparticle formed by self-assembly of camptothecin (CPT) conjugated cyclodextrin-based polymers. IT-101 delivers CPT to target cancer cells in animal models of numerous human cancers and in humans. Previous data from preclinical and clinical trials indicate that IT-101 has no notable immunological side effects. However, there have been no published studies focused on evaluating the effects of IT-101 on host immune systems.ResultsIn this work, we demonstrate that IT-101 diminished initial host immune response following first injection of the nanopharmaceutical and induced NK cell activation and T cell proliferation upon further IT-101 exposure. Additionally, IT-101 could attenuate tumor growth more efficiently than CPT treatment only.ConclusionsDrugs administration in whole-body circulation may lead to poorly bioavailable in central nervous system and often has toxic effects on peripheral tissues. Conjugated with cyclodextrin-based polymers not only reduce adverse effects but also modulate the immune responses to elevate drug efficacy. These immune responses may potentially facilitate actions of immune blockage, such as PD1/PDL1 in cancer treatment."

Based on its chemical composition, Compritol 888 ATO is a blend of different esters of behenic acid with glycerol.
AREAS COVERED: Recently, there has been great interest in the multiple roles that Compritol 888 ATO plays in various pharmaceutical delivery systems. Accordingly, this review aimed at summarizing the current and potential applications of Compritol 888 ATO in various drug delivery areas.
EXPERT OPINION: Different researches have highlighted the feasibility of using Compritol 888 ATO as a lubricant or coating agent for oral solid dosage formulations. It has also been explored as a matrix-forming agent for controlling drug release. At present, the most common pharmaceutical application of Compritol 888 ATO is in lipid-based colloidal drug delivery system such as solid lipid microparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers.

pub.1135479823,Nanomedicine promotes ferroptosis to inhibit tumour proliferation in vivo,"miR-101-3p may play a therapeutic role in various tumours. However, its anti-tumour mechanism remains unclear, and a definitive strategy to treat tumour cells in vivo is lacking. The objective of this study was to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of miR-101-3p on tumour cells and to develop relevant nanomedicines for in vivo therapy. The expression levels of miR-101-3p and its target protein TBLR1 in tumour tissues and cells were detected, and their relationship with ferroptosis was clarified. Furthermore, the efficacy of nanocarriers in achieving in vivo therapeutic gene delivery was evaluated. Nanomedicine was further developed, with the anti-proliferative in vivo therapeutic effect validated using a subcutaneous xenograft cancer model. The expression level of miR-101-3p negatively correlated with clinical tumour size and TNM stage. miR-101-3p restores ferroptosis in tumour cells by directly targeting TBLR1, which in turn promotes apoptosis and inhibits proliferation. We developed nanomedicine that can deliver miR-101-3p to tumour cells in vivo to achieve ferroptosis recovery, as well as to inhibit in vivo tumour proliferation. The miR-101-3p/TBLR1 axis plays an important role in tumour ferroptosis. Nanopharmaceuticals that increase miR-101-3p levels may be effective therapies to inhibit tumour proliferation."

Zebrafish has long been considered as the ""gold standard"" for biosafety assessments of chemicals and pollutants due to its high fecundity, cost-effectiveness, well-characterized developmental stages, optical transparency, and so forth. Thus, zebrafish holds great potential for high-throughput nanotoxicity screening. In this review, we summarize the in vivo toxicological profiles of different nanomaterials, including Ag nanoparticles (NPs), CuO NPs, silica NPs, polymeric NPs, quantum dots, nanoscale metal-organic frameworks, etc, in zebrafish and focus on how the physicochemical properties (e.g., size, surface charge, and surface chemistry) of these nanomaterials influence their biosafety. In addition, we also report the recent advances of the in vivo delivery of nanopharmaceuticals using zebrafish as the model organism for therapeutic assessment, biodistribution tracking, and the controlled release of loaded drugs. Limitations and special considerations of zebrafish model are also discussed. Overall, zebrafish is expected to serve as a high-throughput screening platform for nanotoxicity and drug delivery assessment, which may instruct the design of safe nanomaterials and more effective nanomedicines."
pub.1130923745,"Nano-ellagic acid: inhibitory actions on aldose reductase and α-glucosidase in secondary complications of diabetes, strengthened by in silico docking studies","Increased blood sugar levels in prolonged diabetes lead to secondary complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, which gradually end in death. Synthesis of nano-phytomedicines from active phytoconstituents for novel emerging applications in the field of pharmaceuticals is of huge interest among researchers. In the present investigation, encapsulated ellagic acid (NEA) was synthesized at four different concentrations (0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%) using ZnO nanoparticles as encapsulating agent. The surface morphology (fiber-like structures) of the nanoparticles were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and particle size (161–297 nm) and zeta potential (− 54.9–38.4 mV) were determined by dynamic light scattering technique. Further, the α-glucosidase and aldose reductase enzymes were significantly inhibited by the 0.4% of NEA compared to the other concentrations which strengthened our studies in overcoming the secondary complications of diabetes. The interaction analysis between ellagic acid and insulin receptor found Hit 1 among 10 executed ∆G score and energy of − 5.76, − 4.63 kcal/mol and formed polar bond with Arg 113 with − 1.175 Å distance. The residues Arg115, Lys116, Phe118, Ile115, Arg1131, Arg1155, Ile1157, Lys1165 and Phe1186 were found in ligand–protein interactions. ADME/T analysis of hit 1 was within the acceptable range without any toxic functional groups, providing a framework for developing novel therapeutics."
pub.1020915928,Delivery of siRNA into breast cancer cells via phage fusion protein-targeted liposomes,"Efficacy of siRNAs as potential anticancer therapeutics can be increased by their targeted delivery into cancer cells via tumor-specific ligands. Phage display offers a unique approach to identify highly specific and selective ligands that can deliver nanocarriers to the site of disease. In this study, we proved a novel approach for intracellular delivery of siRNAs into breast cancer cells through their encapsulation into liposomes targeted to the tumor cells with preselected intact phage proteins. The targeted siRNA liposomes were obtained by a fusion of two parental liposomes containing spontaneously inserted siRNA and fusion phage proteins. The presence of pVIII coat protein fused to a MCF-7 cell-targeting peptide DMPGTVLP in the liposomes was confirmed by Western blotting. The novel phage-targeted siRNA-nanopharmaceuticals demonstrate significant down-regulation of PRDM14 gene expression and PRDM14 protein synthesis in the target MCF-7 cells. This approach offers the potential for development of new anticancer siRNA-based targeted nanomedicines.
FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In this study, the authors report a novel approach for targeted intracellular delivery of siRNAs into breast cancer cells through encapsulation into liposomes targeted to the tumor cells with preselected intact phage proteins."

The recommended preclinical safety tests for therapeutic liposomes of nanometer size include the in vitro assessment of complement activation and the evaluation of the associated risk of complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (CARPA) in vivo. For this reason, we measured complement activation by Pad-PC-Pad formulations in human and porcine sera, along with the nanopharmaceutical-mediated cardiopulmonary responses in pigs. The evaluated formulations comprised of Pad-PC-Pad liposomes, with and without polyethylene glycol on the surface of the liposomes, and nitroglycerin as a model vasodilator. The nitroglycerin incorporation efficiency ranged from 25% to 50%. In human sera, liposome formulations with 20mg/mL phospholipid gave rise to complement activation, mainly via the alternative pathway, as reflected by the rises in SC5b-9 and Bb protein complex concentrations. Formulations having a factor of ten lower phospholipid content did not result in measurable complement activation. The weak complement activation induced by Pad-PC-Pad liposomal formulations was confirmed by the results obtained by performing an in vivo study in a porcine model, where hemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously. Our study suggests that, compared to FDA-approved liposomal drugs, Pad-PC-Pad exhibits less or similar risks of CARPA."
pub.1042014192,Development and Validation of Liquid Chromatographic Method for Estimation of Naringin in Nanoformulation,"A simple, precise, accurate, rapid, and sensitive reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection has been developed and validated for quantification of naringin (NAR) in novel pharmaceutical formulation. NAR is a polyphenolic flavonoid present in most of the citrus plants having variety of pharmacological activities. Method optimization was carried out by considering the various parameters such as effect of pH and column. The analyte was separated by employing a C18 (250.0 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column at ambient temperature in isocratic conditions using phosphate buffer pH 3.5: acetonitrile (75 : 25% v/v) as mobile phase pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. UV detection was carried out at 282 nm. The developed method was validated according to ICH guidelines Q2(R1). The method was found to be precise and accurate on statistical evaluation with a linearity range of 0.1 to 20.0 μg/mL for NAR. The intra- and interday precision studies showed good reproducibility with coefficients of variation (CV) less than 1.0%. The mean recovery of NAR was found to be 99.33 ± 0.16%. The proposed method was found to be highly accurate, sensitive, and robust. The proposed liquid chromatographic method was successfully employed for the routine analysis of said compound in developed novel nanopharmaceuticals. The presence of excipients did not show any interference on the determination of NAR, indicating method specificity. "
pub.1120828807,Systematic Meta-Analysis Identifies Co-Expressed Kinases and GPCRs in Ovarian Cancer Tissues Revealing a Potential for Targeted Kinase Inhibitor Delivery,"The use of many anticancer drugs is problematic due to severe adverse effects. While the recent clinical launch of several kinase inhibitors led to tremendous progress, these targeted agents tend to be of non-specific nature within the kinase target class. Moreover, target mediated adverse effects limit the exploitation of some very promising kinase targets, including mitotic kinases. A future strategy will be the development of nanocarrier-based systems for the active delivery of kinase inhibitors using cancer specific surface receptors. The G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest cell surface receptor family and some members are known to be frequently overexpressed in various cancer types. In the presented study, we used ovarian cancer tissues as an example to systematically identify concurrently overexpressed GPCRs and kinases. The rationale of this approach will guide the future design of nanoparticles, which will dock to GPCRs on cancer cells via specific ligands and deliver anticancer compounds after receptor mediated internalization. In addition to this, the approach is expected to be most effective by matching the inhibitor profiles of the delivered kinase inhibitors to the observed kinase gene expression profiles. We validated the suggested strategy in a meta-analysis, revealing overexpression of selected GPCRs and kinases in individual samples of a large ovarian cancer data set. The presented data demonstrate a large untapped potential for personalized cancer therapy using high-end targeted nanopharmaceuticals with kinase inhibitors."
pub.1008453418,High speed electrospinning for scaled-up production of amorphous solid dispersion of itraconazole,"High speed electrospinning (HSES), compatible with pharmaceutical industry, was used to demonstrate the viability of the preparation of drug-loaded polymer nanofibers with radically higher productivity than the known single-needle electrospinning (SNES) setup. Poorly water-soluble itraconazole (ITRA) was formulated with PVPVA64 matrix polymer using four different solvent-based methods such as HSES, SNES, spray drying (SD) and film casting (FC). The formulations were assessed in terms of improvement in the dissolution rate of ITRA (using a ""tapped basket"" dissolution configuration) and analysed by SEM, DSC and XRPD. Despite the significantly increased productivity of HSES, the obtained morphology was very similar to the SNES nanofibrous material. ITRA transformed into an amorphous form, according to the DSC and XRPD results, in most cases except the FC samples. The limited dissolution of crystalline ITRA could be highly improved: fast dissolution occurred (>90% within 10min) in the cases of both (the scaled-up and the single-needle) types of electrospun fibers, while the improvement in the dissolution rate of the spray-dried microspheres was significantly lower. Production of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) with the HSES system proved to be flexibly scalable and easy to integrate into a continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing line, which opens new routes for the development of industrially relevant nanopharmaceuticals.

pub.1136822166,Effect and mechanism of action in vitro of cyclodextrin derivative nanoparticles loaded with tyroserleutide on hepatoma,"In this study, a cyclodextrin derivative (R6RGD-CM<i>β</i>CD) nanoparticle with tumor targeting and cell penetration ability was successfully synthesized and loaded with tyroserleutide (YSL) to obtain YSL-loaded nanoparticles (YSL/R6RGD-CM<i>β</i>CD NPs). The characterization of these NPs revealed a smooth surfaces and an average diameter of approximately 170 nm. YSL/R6RGD-CM<i>β</i>CD NPs increased the NP uptake in Caco-2 cells. As regard the mechanism of action, the cell uptake was related to endocytosis mediated by reticulin and megacytosis. In addition, YSL/R6RGD-CM<i>β</i>CD NPs induced significantly higher cytotoxicity on tumor cells and better tumor targeting compared with the effect of CM<i>β</i>CD NPs. Most importantly, the good anti-cancer effect of YSL/R6RGD-CM<i>β</i>CD NPs might be due to the interference with the function of mitochondria. On the other hand, YSL/R6RGD-CM<i>β</i>CD NPs were not toxic for normal cells. Taken together, our results indicated that R6RGD-CM<i>β</i>CD could be considered as a nanopharmaceutical material with good tumor targeting abilities, and their combination with YSL could represent an effective anti-cancer system."
pub.1010338371,Preclinical to clinical development of the novel camptothecin nanopharmaceutical CRLX101,"Camptothecin (CPT) is a potent broad-spectrum anticancer agent that acts through inhibition of topoisomerase 1. Clinical development of CPT was unsuccessful due to poor drug solubility, insufficient in vivo stability of the active form, and toxicity. In order to address these issues, a polymeric nanoparticle comprised of cyclodextrin-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymer (CDP) conjugated to CPT (CRLX101) has been developed and Phase 2 clinical studies are ongoing. Camptothecin is conjugated to the polymer in its active form at 10-12 wt.% loading. CRLX101 self-assembles in solution into nanoparticles with an apparent solubility increase of >1000-fold as compared to the parent drug camptothecin. Preclinical studies exhibited CRLX101 pharmacokinetics superior to the parent drug. Drug concentration in tumor relative to plasma and other major organs is consistent with the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) anticipated from a nanoparticle. Significant anti-tumor activity was observed that is superior when compared to irinotecan across a broad range of xenograft models. Pharmacokinetic data are consistent with the prolonged half-life and increased AUC. The CRLX101 preclinical and clinical data confirm that CDP can address not only solubility, formulation, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic challenges associated with administration of CPT, but more importantly, can impart unique biological properties, that enhance pharmacodynamics and efficacy of camptothecin."
pub.1130416702,A structurally diverse library of glycerol monooleate/oleic acid non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanodispersions stabilized with nonionic methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG)-lipids showing variable complement activation properties,"Pluronic F127-stabilized non-lamellar liquid crystalline aqueous nanodispersions are promising injectable platforms for drug and contrast agent delivery. These nanodispersions, however, trigger complement activation in the human blood, where the extent of complement activation and opsonization processes may compromise their biological performance and safety. Here, we introduce a broad family of nanodispersions from glycerol monooleate (GMO) and oleic acid (OA) in different weight ratios, and stabilized with a plethora of nonionic methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG)-lipids of different PEG chain length and variable lipid moiety (monounsaturated or saturated diglycerides or D-α-tocopheryl succinate). Through an integrated biophysical approach involving dynamic light scattering, synchrotron small-angle scattering, and cryo-transmission electron microscopy, we examine the impact of nonionic mPEG-lipid stabilization on size, internal self-assembled architecture, and gross morphological characteristics of nanodispersions. The results show how the nonionic mPEG-lipid type and concentration, and dependent on GMO/OA weight ratio, can variably modulate the internal architectures of nanoparticles. Assessment of complement profiling from selected nanodispersions with diverse structural heterogeneity further suggests a variable modulatory role for the lipid type of the nonionic mPEG-lipid in the extent of complement activation, which span from no activation to moderate to high levels. We comment on plausible mechanisms driving the observed complement activation variability and discuss the potential utility of these nanodispersions for future development of injectable nanopharmaceuticals."
pub.1128583708,Formation of Antihyperlipidemic Nano-Ezetimibe from Volatile Microemulsion Template for Enhanced Dissolution Profile,"Nanostructures play an important role in targeting sparingly water-soluble drugs to specific sites. Because of the structural flexibility and stability, the use of template microemulsions (μEs) can produce functional nanopharmaceuticals of different sizes, shapes, and chemical properties. In this article, we report a new volatile oil-in-water (o/w) μE formulation comprising ethyl acetate/ethanol/brij-35/water to obtain the highly water-dispersible nanoparticles of an antihyperlipidemic agent, ezetimibe (EZM-NPs), to enhance its dissolution profile. A pseudoternary phase diagram was delineated in a specified brij-35/ethanol ratio (1:1) to describe the transparent, optically isotropic domain of the as-formulated μE. The water-dilutable μE formulation, comprising an optimum composition of ethyl acetate (18.0%), ethanol (25.0%), brij-35 (25.0%), and water (32.0%), showed a good dissolvability of EZM around 4.8 wt % at pH 5.2. Electron micrographs showed a fine monomodal collection of EZM-loaded μE droplets (∼45 nm) that did not coalesce even after lyophilization, forming small spherical EZM-NPs (∼60 nm). However, the maturity of nanodrug droplets observed through dynamic light scattering suggests the affinity of EZM to the nonpolar microenvironment, which was further supported through peak-to-peak correlation of infrared analysis and fluorescence measurements. Moreover, the release profile of the as-obtained EZM-nanopowder increased significantly >98% in 30 min, which indicates that a reduced drug concentration will be needed for capsules or tablets in the future and can be simply incorporated into the multidosage formulation of EZM."
pub.1092867140,Recent Patents and Formulation of Nanopharmaceuticals Using Ultrasonication Technique.,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound (US) has the ever-rising role in the delivery of therapeutic agents that includes chemotherapeutic agents, proteins, and genetic material. The microbubbles are the cavitating gas bodies that act as the mediators through which the energy of relatively non-interactive pressure waves is accumulated to produce forces that can permeabilize cell membranes and disrupt the vesicles that carry the therapeutic agent. This shows that the microbubbles greatly enhance the delivery of smaller chemical agents, proteins and genetic material.
METHOD: Various databases of online literature and patented reports based on sonication were reviewed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The literature reveals that US-assisted drug delivery is used in the delivery of therapeutic agents into various tissues including vascular, cardiac, tumor, skeletal muscle and fetal tissue. US-assisted delivery of proteins has been studied in the application in transdermal delivery of insulin, hormones and small proteins. Cavitation effect occurring during the sonication reversibly disrupts the stratum corneum structure to allow the transport of the large molecules. Cavitation disrupts the structure of the carrier vesicle and releases the drug. But there still remains a need for better understanding the physics of cavitation of microbubbles and the impact of cavitation on drug-carrying vesicles and cells. Ultrasonic technology has been proven effective at creating encapsulating particles and droplets with specific physical and functional properties. This article provides an overview of the factors influencing ultrasonication and various nanosystems formulated by using this technology."
pub.1069162385,Nanotechnology based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neuroscience with special emphasis on ischemic stroke.,"Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide, for which no effective therapies are available. The increasing prevalence of ischemic stroke and related health risks, combined with the lack of effective therapies, highlight the desperate need for continued research for exploring the safe and effective drugs, which favourably influence multiple pathways leading to neuroprotection and extend the benefit to a larger number of patients diagnosed with stroke. Numerous preclinical studies have reported very promising results using ""neuroprotectants"", all of which have failed at clinical trials because of either safety issues or lack of efficacy. The delivery of many potentially therapeutic neuroprotectants and diagnostic compounds to specific areas of the brain is restricted by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nanoparticles (NPs) have colossal applications that could revolutionize the treatment of ischemic stroke. NPs can readily transmigrate across the BBB without compromising its integrity. Recent striking developments in nanotechnology have produced a great deal of nano-devices, which could be used for the treatment and neuronal regeneration following ischemic stroke. This article attempts to convey the untapped potentials of nanopharmaceuticals for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Looking towards the future, this review focuses on the potential applications of nanoparticulate systems for the delivery of therapeutic cargo into the brain for imparting neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. This review also provides an overview of targeted NPs, which are being used for imaging, neuroprotection and regeneration of ischemic brain."

Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies were carried out in normal human fibroblast and cancerous (PC-3 and MCF-7) cells, respectively. The efficacy of detecting cancerous cells was monitored using a photoacoustic technique. In vivo biodistribution was studied after IV injection of Cin-AuNPs in mice, and also a CT phantom model was generated.ResultsBiocompatible Cin-AuNPs were synthesized with high purity. Significant uptake of these gold nanoparticles was observed in PC-3 and MCF-7 cells. Cin-AuNPs internalized in cancerous cells facilitated detectable photoacoustic signals. In vivo biodistribution in normal mice showed steady accumulation of gold nanoparticles in lungs and rapid clearance from blood. Quantitative analysis of CT values in phantom model revealed that the cinnamon-phytochemical-coated AuNPs have reasonable attenuation efficiency.ConclusionsThe results indicate that these non-toxic Cin-AuNPs can serve as excellent CT/ photoacoustic contrast-enhancement agents and may provide a novel approach toward tumor detection through nanopharmaceuticals."
pub.1138691121,Spray-dried lactose-leucine microparticles for pulmonary delivery of antimycobacterial nanopharmaceuticals,"Pulmonary delivery of nanocarriers for novel antimycobacterial compounds is challenging because the aerodynamic properties of nanomaterials are sub-optimal for such purposes. Here, we report the development of dry powder formulations for nanocarriers containing benzothiazinone 043 (BTZ) or levofloxacin (LVX), respectively. The intricacy is to generate dry powder aerosols with adequate aerodynamic properties while maintaining both nanostructural integrity and compound activity until reaching the deeper lung compartments. Microparticles (MPs) were prepared using vibrating mesh spray drying with lactose and leucine as approved excipients for oral inhalation drug products. MP morphologies and sizes were measured using various biophysical techniques including determination of geometric and aerodynamic mean sizes, X-ray diffraction, and confocal and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Differences in the nanocarriers’ characteristics influenced the MPs’ sizes and shapes, their aerodynamic properties, and, hence, also the fraction available for lung deposition. Spay-dried powders of a BTZ nanosuspension, BTZ-loaded silica nanoparticles (NPs), and LVX-loaded liposomes showed promising respirable fractions, in contrast to zirconyl hydrogen phosphate nanocontainers. While the colloidal stability of silica NPs was improved after spray drying, MPs encapsulating either BTZ nanosuspensions or LVX-loaded liposomes showed the highest respirable fractions and active pharmaceutical ingredient loads. Importantly, for the BTZ nanosuspension, biocompatibility and in vitro uptake by a macrophage model cell line were improved even further after spray drying.Graphical abstract"
pub.1077043237,Preliminary Results of Nanopharmaceuticals Used in the Radioimmunotherapy of Ovarian Cancer,"PURPOSE: The treatment of late stage ovarian cancer presents an unmet clinical need for women around the world. A multistep radioimmunotherapeutic (RIT) approach, exploiting the combination of a bispecific monoclonal antibody (BsMAb) with 90Y labelled biotinylated long-circulating liposomes was tested as a potential adjuvant treatment for epithelial ovarian carcinomatosis in an attempt to meet this need. This approach was used to overcome some of the major obstacles associated with conventional strategies, in particular, to increase the amount of radioactivity delivered to the tumor site compared with conventional monoclonal antibody (MAb) radionuclide delivery. We hypothesize that sequential intraperitoneal administration of the targeting and therapeutic moieties provides the basis for an enhanced therapeutic ratio.
METHODS: A BsMAb, with anti-CA 125 and anti-biotin epitopes was engineered for use with PEGylated liposomes coated with biotin to deliver the cytotoxic radionuclide 90Y to tumor sites. An in vivo therapy trial was used to test this RIT protocol with Balb/c nude mice (n=29) xenografted with the NIH:OVCAR-3 (CA 125+) human ovarian cancer cell line.
RESULTS: A median tumor growth delay of 91 days for the combined treatment group versus 77.7 days for the control group was observed.
CONCLUSION: An ongoing tumor growth delay/control study using this model has indicated an appreciable delay in progress of tumor and ascites development in treated vs. control populations."
pub.1045164995,Pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenomic study of the nanoparticle conjugate of camptothecin CRLX101 for the treatment of cancer,"CRLX101 is a nanopharmaceutical consisting of cyclodextrin-based polymer molecule and camptothecin. The CRLX101 nanoparticle is designed to concentrate and slowly release camptothecin in tumors over an extended period of time. Tumor biopsy and blood samples collected from patients with advanced solid malignancies before and after CRLX101 treatment are subjected to immunohistochemistry and pharmacogenomics. The expression of Topoisomerase-1, Ki-67, CaIX, CD31 and VEGF decreased after CRLX101 treatment. The expressions of these proteins are inversely proportional with survival duration of the patients. The Drug Metabolism Enzymes and Transporters (DMET) array shows an allele frequency in patients similar to global populations with none of the SNPs associated with toxicity. The results suggest that the observed lower toxicity is not likely to be due to different genotypes in SNPs. CRLX101 demonstrates a promising anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated or treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies presumably by inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis correlating with tumor growth inhibition. From the clinical editor: In this cancer treatment study clinical samples collected from patients were subjected to immunohistochemistry and pharmacogenomics. The expressions of key proteins that are inversely proportional with survival duration of the patients decreased after treatment with CRLX101, a camptothecin slow-release nanoparticle conjugate. This anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated and treatment resistant solid tumors, promises a novel therapeutic approach."
pub.1055147256,TPGS2k/PLGA Nanoparticles for Overcoming Multidrug Resistance by Interfering Mitochondria of Human Alveolar Adenocarcinoma Cells,"In this study, we successfully synthesized d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 2000 succinate (TPGS2k) and prepared TPGS2k-modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (TPGS2k/PLGA NPs) loaded with 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), designated TPGS2k/PLGA/SN-38 NPs. Characterization measurements showed that TPGS2k/PLGA/SN-38 NPs displayed flat and spheroidal particles with diameters of 80-104 nm. SN-38 was encapsulated in TPGS2k emulsified PLGA NPs with the entrapment efficiency and loading rates of SN-38 83.6 and 7.85%, respectively. SN-38 could release constantly from TPGS2k/PLGA/SN-38 NPs in vitro. TPGS2k/PLGA/SN-38 NPs induced significantly higher cytotoxicity on A549 cells and the multidrug resistance (MDR) cell line (A549/DDP cells and A549/Taxol cells) compared with free SN-38. Further studies on the mechanism of the NPs in increasing the death of MDR cells showed that following the SN-38 releasing into cytoplasm the remaining TPGS2k/PLGA NPs could reverse the P-gp mediated MDR via interfering with the structure and function of mitochondria and rather than directly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of P-gp ATPase. Therefore, TPGS2k/PLGA NPs can reduce the generation of ATP and the release of energy for the requisite of P-gp efflux transporters. The results indicated that TPGS2k/PLGA NPs could become the nanopharmaceutical materials with the capability to reversal MDR and improve anticancer effects of some chemotherapy drugs as P-gp substrates.

pub.1125425698,Nanopharmaceutics: Part II—Production Scales and Clinically Compliant Production Methods,"Due the implementation of nanotechnologies in the pharmaceutical industry over the last few decades, new type of cutting-edge formulations-nanopharmaceutics-have been proposed. These comprise pharmaceutical products at the nanoscale, developed from different types of materials with the purpose to, e.g., overcome solubility problems of poorly water-soluble drugs, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of known drugs but also of new biomolecules, to modify the release profile of loaded compounds, or to decrease the risk of toxicity by providing site-specific delivery reducing the systemic distribution and thus adverse side effects. To succeed with the development of a nanopharmaceutical formulation, it is first necessary to analyze the type of drug which is to be encapsulated, select the type matrix to load it (e.g., polymers, lipids, polysaccharides, proteins, metals), followed by the production procedure. Together these elements have to be compatible with the administration route. To be launched onto the market, the selected production method has to be scaled-up, and quality assurance implemented for the product to reach clinical trials, during which in vivo performance is evaluated. Regulatory issues concerning nanopharmaceutics still require expertise for harmonizing legislation and a clear understanding of clinically compliant production methods. The first part of this study addressing ""Nanopharmaceutics: Part I-Clinical trials legislation and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) of nanotherapeutics in the EU"" has been published in Pharmaceutics. This second part complements the study with the discussion about the production scales and clinically compliant production methods of nanopharmaceutics."
pub.1021785826,Nanoparticle-Based Medicines: A Review of FDA-Approved Materials and Clinical Trials to Date,"ABSTRACTIn this review we provide an up to date snapshot of nanomedicines either currently approved by the US FDA, or in the FDA clinical trials process. We define nanomedicines as therapeutic or imaging agents which comprise a nanoparticle in order to control the biodistribution, enhance the efficacy, or otherwise reduce toxicity of a drug or biologic. We identified 51 FDA-approved nanomedicines that met this definition and 77 products in clinical trials, with ~40% of trials listed in clinicaltrials.gov started in 2014 or 2015. While FDA approved materials are heavily weighted to polymeric, liposomal, and nanocrystal formulations, there is a trend towards the development of more complex materials comprising micelles, protein-based NPs, and also the emergence of a variety of inorganic and metallic particles in clinical trials. We then provide an overview of the different material categories represented in our search, highlighting nanomedicines that have either been recently approved, or are already in clinical trials. We conclude with some comments on future perspectives for nanomedicines, which we expect to include more actively-targeted materials, multi-functional materials (“theranostics”) and more complicated materials that blur the boundaries of traditional material categories. A key challenge for researchers, industry, and regulators is how to classify new materials and what additional testing (e.g. safety and toxicity) is required before products become available."
pub.1011454607,"Irinophore C™, a lipid-based nanoparticulate formulation of irinotecan, is more effective than free irinotecan when used to treat an orthotopic glioblastoma model","Given compelling evidences supporting the therapeutic potential of irinotecan (IRN) for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the present study evaluated the activity of Irinophore C™ (IrC™), a lipid-based nanopharmaceutical formulation of IRN, in GBM. The levels of IRN and SN-38 were determined in plasma and brain after a single intravenous dose of IRN or IrC™ in tumor-free mice. Treatment with IrC™ significantly increased the plasma AUC(0-24h) of the active (lactone) forms of IRN and SN-38 when compared to free drug (760 and 30-fold increase, respectively). Levels of IRN and SN-38 in brain tissue were also increased significantly (compared to IRN treatment) following IrC™ administration. A tolerability study revealed that IrC™ is better tolerated than IRN. The efficacy of IrC™ and IRN was assessed in an orthotopic model of GBM. The therapeutic efficacy of IrC™ given at 25mg/kg weekly was comparable to the efficacy achieved using twice the dose of IRN. At the maximum tolerated dose, IrC™ (100mg/kg) increased the survival time of tumor-bearing mice of 83% compared to untreated animals. Ki67 immunostaining analysis of IrC™-treated tumors revealed a transient increase in cell proliferation after treatment. The results justify further studies evaluating the use of IrC™ for treating GBM."
pub.1000815975,Do HPMA copolymer conjugates have a future as clinically useful nanomedicines? A critical overview of current status and future opportunities,"N-(2-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer conjugates containing doxorubicin designed in the late 1970s/early 1980s as anticancer polymer therapeutics were the first synthetic polymer-based anticancer conjugates to enter clinical trial beginning in 1994. Early clinical results were promising, confirming activity in chemotherapy refractory patients and the safety of HPMA copolymers as a new polymer platform in this setting. Subsequent Phase I/II trials have investigated conjugates containing paclitaxel (PNU 166945), camptothecin (PNU 166148) (both failed in clinical trials underlining the importance of rational design), and most recently HPMA-copolymer platinates (AP5280 and then AP5346-ProLindac(TM)) entered Phase II clinical development. There are a growing array of second generation HPMA copolymer-based systems involving combination therapy, incorporating putative targeting ligands, having an ever more complex architecture, and both drug and protein conjugates are being proposed as novel treatments for diseases other than cancer. Despite their promise, and the success of polymeric drugs and polymer-protein conjugates, no polymer-drug conjugate (HPMA copolymer-based or otherwise) has yet entered routine clinical use. It is timely to reflect on the progress made over the last 30 years, the relative merits of HPMA copolymers as a platform compared to other polymeric carriers, and comment on their future potential as polymer-based nanomedicines into the 21st century in comparison with the many alternative strategies now emerging for creation of nanopharmaceuticals."

pub.1025041684,Nanopharmaceuticals to target antifilarials: a comprehensive review,"INTRODUCTION: Currently emphasized conventional chemotherapies for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) are imperfect due to unfocused targeting of poorly water-soluble antifilarial drugs. The profound location of drug targets (filarial parasites or wolbachia) within the complex anatomy of lymphatic tissues often necessitates prolonged treatment schedules with high doses leading to undesired side effects and poor patient compliance. Therefore, we need to reformulate antifilarial drugs taking the advantages of nanotechnology through a wide range of nanomedical carriers, which improve drug efficacy, increase bioavailability, and diminish toxicity.
AREAS COVERED: Connotations of drug delivery systems (DDSs) to target lymphatic filaroids or wolbachia and systemic microfilaria have been discussed. The potentials of liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles for the treatment of LF are highlighted. Various critical factors, viz optimal size range, surface properties, preferred pH, mechanism of reticuloendothelial avoidance, and control of the release of antifilarial agents for safe elimination of parasites, are enclosed to design a novel DDS for LF. The review of nanotechnological approaches to improve antifilarial chemotherapy will help to resolve existing technological gaps.
EXPERT OPINION: Precincts in the antifilarial discovery programs can never be overcome by conventional methods. Nanomedicine encompasses wide-range solution for each single problem (i.e., from poor solubility to nonspecific targeting of antifilarial agents) for the cure of LF at low costs and may reduce the economic burden of LF diseases. Advances in nanotechnology loom will certainly come forward as silver bullets in the near future for quick diagnosis, control, and elimination of this tropically neglected disease."
pub.1142228398,Nanopharmaceuticals (Au-NPs) after use: Experiences with a complex higher tier test design simulating environmental fate and effect,"The current environmental hazard assessment is based on the testing of the pristine substance. However, it cannot be excluded that (nano)pharmaceuticals are excreted into sewage during the use phase followed by entry into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Sorption to sewage sludge or release via effluent can result in modified ecotoxicological effects which possibly can only be detected with a modified test approach. The objective of our study was to investigate a realistic exposure scenario for metallic nanoparticles (NPs) in pharmaceutical products, excreted into effluent, and released into the environment after treatment in WWTPs. The test approach was illustrated by using gold (Au) NPs. Effluent from model WWTPs were investigated in aquatic tests (Daphnia magna, fish cell lines). Sewage sludge was used as a sole food source (Eisenia fetida) or mixed with soil and used as test medium (soil microorganisms, Folsomia candida, Enchytraeus crypticus). To cover the aspect of regulation, the test systems described in OECD-test guidelines (OECD TG 201, 211, 220, 232, 249, 317) were applied. Modifications and additional test approaches were included to meet the needs arising out of the testing of nanomaterials and of the exposure scenarios. The results were assessed regarding the suitability of the test design and the toxicity of Au-NPs. Except for activated sludge as a sole food source for E.fetida, the selected test approach is suitable for the testing of nanomaterials. Additional information can be gained when compared to the common testing of the pristine nanomaterials in the standardized test systems. Effects of Au-NPs were observed in concentrations exceeding the modeled environmental."
pub.1129999467,"Nanotherapeutics in Neuropathologies: Obstacles, Challenges and Recent Advancements in CNS Targeted Drug Delivery Systems","Neurology and associated nanotherapeutics are a complex field in terms of therapeutics and neurological disorder complexity. The brain is an intricate appendage and requires more precise embattled treatment for the particular diseases and hence it is a broad scale for developing more targeted drug deliveries. The brain is one of the most inaccessible tissues of the body due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus delivery of drugs inside the brain is a striking dare and it is also tricky to treat central nervous system (CNS) complications pharmacologically. The therapeutic aspiration is to accomplish the lowest drug meditation in the brain tissues so as to gain favoured therapeutic results. To devastate this obstacle, nanotechnology is engaged in the field of targeted brain drug delivery and neuropathology targeting. These carriers hold myriad abilities as they may augment the drug delivery into the brain by shielding them from degradation and prolonging their transmission in the blood, as well as promoting their transport through the BBB. Nanopharmaceuticals are quickly sprouting as a new avenue that is engaged with the drug-loaded nanocarriers to demonstrate unique physicochemical properties and tiny size range for penetrating the central nervous system. The enchantment behind their therapeutic achievement is the condensed drug dose and inferior toxicity, whereby restricting the therapeutic compound to the specific site. Therefore, in this article, we have tried to recapitulate the advances of the novel scopes for the brain targeted drug delivery for complex neurological disorders."
pub.1051014283,Cytotoxicity of Paclitaxel Incorporated in PLGA Nanoparticles on Hypoxic Human Tumor Cells,"PurposeThe aim of this work was to prepare paclitaxel-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and determine cytotoxicity of released paclitaxel for two hypoxic human tumor cell lines: breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and carcinoma cervicis (HeLa).MethodsPoly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles containing paclitaxel were prepared by o/w emulsification-solvent evaporation method. Physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles were studied. Cellular uptake of nanoparticles was evaluated by transmission electronic microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Flow cytometry quantified the number of cells held in G2/M phase. Cell viability was determined by the ability of single cell to form colonies. Biodistribution of nanoparticles in mice was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy.ResultsThe nanoparticles were spherical with average diameter 318 ± 5.1 nm. The encapsulation efficiency was 88.52%. The drug release profile in vitro exhibited a biphasic pattern. Cellular uptake was observed. Co-culture of tumor cells with paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles demonstrated that released paclitaxel retained its bioactivity to block cells in G2/M phase. Paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles exhibited cytotoxic effect on both hypoxic MCF-7 and HeLa cells and its cytotoxicity was more significant than that of free paclitaxel. Fluorescent nanoparticles were mainly distributed to liver and spleen of mice.ConclusionsPaclitaxel-loaded PLGA nanoparticles may be considered a promising drug delivery system to eradicate hypoxic tumor cells."
pub.1140182017,Cell medium-dependent dynamic modulation of size and structural transformations of binary phospholipid/ω-3 fatty acid liquid crystalline nano-self-assemblies: Implications in interpretation of cell uptake studies,"Lyotropic non-lamellar liquid crystalline (LLC) nanoparticles, with their tunable structural features and capability of loading a wide range of drugs and reporter probes, are emerging as versatile injectable nanopharmaceuticals. Secondary emulsifiers, such as Pluronic block copolymers, are commonly used for colloidal stabilization of LLC nanoparticles, but their inclusion often compromises the biological safety (e.g., poor hemocompatibility and enhanced cytotoxicity) of the formulation. Here, we introduce a library of colloidally stable, structurally tunable, and pH-responsive lamellar and non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanoparticles from binary mixtures of a phospholipid (phosphatidylglycerol) and three types of omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), prepared in the absence of a secondary emulsifier and organic solvents. We study formulation size distribution, morphological heterogeneity, and the arrangement of their internal self-assembled architectures by nanoparticle tracking analysis, synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The results show the influence of type and concentration of ω-3 PUFAs in nanoparticle structural transitions spanning from a lamellar (L<sub>α</sub>) phase to inverse discontinuous (micellar) cubic Fd3m and hexagonal phase (H<sub>2</sub>) phases, respectively. We further report on cell-culture medium-dependent dynamic fluctuations in nanoparticle size, number and morphology, and simultaneously monitor uptake kinetics in two human cell lines. We discuss the role of these multiparametric biophysical transformations on nanoparticle-cell interaction kinetics and internalization mechanisms. Collectively, our findings contribute to the understanding of fundamental steps that are imperative for improved engineering of LLC nanoparticles with necessary attributes for pharmaceutical development."
pub.1032661736,Nanopharmaceutical Approach of Epiisopiloturine Alkaloid Carried in Liposome System: Preparation and In Vitro Schistosomicidal Activity,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. This disease control has been widely made by praziquantel-reference drug, but resistance to this drug has already been found. There has been the finding of an imidazole alkaloid in jaborandi leaves-epiisopiloturine, which has known activity against adult, young and egg forms of Schistosoma mansoni. This alkaloid is an apolar molecule with difficult solubility; therefore, the liposomal structure of epiisopiloturine was proposed. Liposomes are carrying structures of drugs that may enhance solubility of compounds such as epiisopiloturine. In this work, we report in vitro epiisopiloturine-loaded liposomes effect formed by different concentrations of lipids 9:1 (weight ratio) dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:cholesterol and 8:2 (weight ratio) dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:cholesterol. Results have showed that epiisopiloturine extraction and isolation have been successful through high-performance liquid chromatography-HPLC and its purity confirmed through mass spectrometry has showed 287 Da molecular mass. Formulations from 9:1 DPPC:cholesterol and 8:2 DPPC:cholesterol with loaded EPI (300 microg/ml) have killed parasites at 100% after incubation 96 h and 120 h, respectively. Confocal microscopy employed to observe morphological alterations in the tegument of adult form of Schistosoma mansoni. Details from interaction, between epiisopiloturine and liposome, have been achieved by semi-empirical AM1 calculations, which have showed that epiisopiloturine inside is more stable than the outside form, at least 10 kcal. This is first time that schistosomicidal activity has been reported for epiisopiloturine-loaded into liposome."

Particle size, surface morphology and surface chemistry, in vitro drug release and cellular uptake of NPs were characterized. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic effects of the nanoparticle formulation were evaluated in comparison with Taxol®.ResultsThe PLA–TPGS NP formulation exhibited significant advantages in in vivo pharmacokinetics and xenograft tumor model versus the PLGA NP formulation and the pristine drug. Compared with Taxol®, the PLA–TPGS NP formulation achieved 27.4-fold longer half-life in circulation, 1.6-fold larger area-under-the-curve (AUC) with no portion located above the maximum tolerance concentration level. For the first time in the literature, one shot for 240 h chemotherapy was achieved in comparison with only 22 h chemotherapy for Taxol® at the same 10 mg/kg paclitaxel dose. Xenograft tumor model further confirmed the advantages of the NP formulation versus Taxol®.ConclusionsThe PLA–TPGS NP formulation can realize a way of controlled and sustained drug release for more than 10 days, which relieves one of the two major concerns on cancer nanotechnology, i.e. feasibility."

pub.1112629809,Drug Delivery From Polymer-Based Nanopharmaceuticals—An Experimental Study Complemented by Simulations of Selected Diffusion Processes,"The success of medical therapy depends on the correct amount and the appropriate delivery of the required drugs for treatment. By using biodegradable polymers a drug delivery over a time span of weeks or even months is made possible. This opens up a variety of strategies for better medication. The drug is embedded in a biodegradable polymer (the ""carrier"") and injected in a particular position of the human body. As a consequence of the interplay between the diffusion process and the degrading polymer the drug is released in a controlled manner. In this work we study the controlled release of medication experimentally by measuring the delivered amount of drug within a cylindrical shell over a long time interval into the body fluid. Moreover, a simple continuum model of the Fickean type is initially proposed and solved in closed-form. It is used for simulating some of the observed release processes for this type of carrier and takes the geometry of the drug container explicitly into account. By comparing the measurement data and the model predictions diffusion coefficients are obtained. It turns out that within this simple model the coefficients change over time. This contradicts the idea that diffusion coefficients are constants independent of the considered geometry. The model is therefore extended by taking an additional absorption term into account leading to a concentration dependent diffusion coefficient. This could now be used for further predictions of drug release in carriers of different shape. For a better understanding of the complex diffusion and degradation phenomena the underlying physics is discussed in detail and even more sophisticated models involving different degradation and mass transport phenomena are proposed for future work and study."
pub.1112560969,Nanomaterials for Drug Delivery to the Central Nervous System,"The intricate microstructure of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is responsible for the accurate intrinsic regulation of the central nervous system (CNS), in terms of neuronal pathophysiological phenomena. Any disruption to the BBB can be associated with genetic defects triggering or with local antigenic invasion (either neurotoxic blood-derived metabolites and residues or microbial pathogens). Such events can be further related to systemic inflammatory or immune disorders, which can subsequently initiate several neurodegenerative pathways. Any degenerative process related to the CNS results in progressive and yet incurable impairment of neuronal cells. Since these particular neurons are mostly scanty or incapable of self-repair and regeneration processes, there is tremendous worldwide interest in novel therapeutic strategies for such specific conditions. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD, respectively) are conditions found worldwide, being considered the most rampant degenerative pathologies related to CNS. The current therapy of these conditions, including both clinical and experimental approaches, mainly enables symptom management and subsidiary neuronal protection and even less disease regression. Still, a thorough understanding of the BBB pathophysiology and an accurate molecular and sub-molecular management of AD and PD will provide beneficial support for more specific and selective therapy. Since nanotechnology-derived materials and devices proved attractive and efficient platforms for modern biomedicine (including detection, imaging, diagnosis, medication, restoration and regeneration), a particular approach for AD and PD management relies on nanoparticle-based therapy. In this paper we will discuss relevant aspects related to the BBB and its impact on drug-based treatment and emphasize that nanoparticles are suitable and versatile candidates for the development of novel and performance-enhanced nanopharmaceuticals for neurodegenerative conditions therapy."
pub.1141864336,Bombesin Peptide Conjugated Water-Soluble Chitosan Gallate—A New Nanopharmaceutical Architecture for the Rapid One-Pot Synthesis of Prostate Tumor Targeted Gold Nanoparticles,"PURPOSE: We report herein bombesin peptide conjugated water-soluble chitosan gallate as a template for rapid one-pot synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with capabilities to target receptors on prostate cancer cells.
METHODS: Water-soluble chitosan (WCS), anchored with gallic acid (GA) and LyslLys3 (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo dodecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) bombesin 1-14 (DBBN) peptide, provides a tumor targeting nanomedicine agent. WCS nanoplatforms provide attractive strategies with built-in capabilities to reduce gold (III) to gold nanoparticles with stabilizing and tumor-targeting capabilities. WCS-GA-DBBN encapsulation around gold nanoparticles affords optimum in vitro stability.
RESULTS: The DBBN content in the WCS-GA-DBBN sample was ~27%w/w. The antioxidant activities of WCS-GA and WCS-GA-DBBN nanocolloids were enhanced by 12 times as compared to the nascent WCS. AuNPs with a desirable hydrodynamic diameter range of 40-60 nm have been efficiently synthesized using WCS-GA and WCS-GA-DBBN platforms. The AuNPs were stable over 4 days after preparation and ~3 days after subjecting to all relevant biological fluids. The AuNPs capped with WCS-GA-DBBN peptide exhibited superior cellular internalization into prostate tumor (PC-3) cells with evidence of receptor mediated endocytosis.
CONCLUSION: The AuNPs capped with WCS-GA-DBBN exhibited selective affinity toward prostate cancer cells. AuNPs conjugated with WCS-GA-DBBN serve as a new generation of theranostic agents for treating various neoplastic diseases, thus opening-up new applications in oncology."
pub.1132595323,Evaluation of the Efficacy and Performance of a New Nano-Drug Carrier in the Treatment of Recurrent Oral Ulcerper,"Recurrent oral ulcer is a common oral mucosal disease. Due to its periodic and recurrent characteristics, the onset of burning pain is unbearable, which brings great inconvenience to the patient's life and seriously affects the patient's quality of life. There are certain limitations to conventional drug therapy. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the obvious advantages of nanotechnology such as targeting, controlled release, biocompatibility is obviously shown. The combination of nanotechnology and medical research has led to the emergence of polymer nanoparticles and ligands. Nano-drugs for gene therapy, and many other new nano-drug carriers, polymer micelle is a new type of nano drug carrier that has appeared in recent years. It has both a hydrophilic shell and a hydrophobic core, and has a variety of excellent properties, such as higher stability <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, and poorly soluble drugs.

pub.1011867797,Nanomedicines for dental applications-scope and future perspective,"Nanotechnology is directed at manipulating matter at the nanometer level and the application of the same to medicine is called nanomedicine. Over the past few years researchers have developed various nanomedicines for diagnosis, prevention as well as cure of various ailments both locally and systemically. In dentistry, drug loaded nanopharmaceuticals based on nanomaterials have been utilized extensively over the past few years to cure dental problems and facilitate attainment of a near-perfect oral hygiene. Although various drug delivery systems have already been investigated for treating periodontitis, research is currently focused on nanodelivery systems for efficient targeted delivery of drugs to the periodontal pocket. In this context a few nanodelivery systems explored include nanocomposite hydrogels, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion etc. A number of herbal and synthetic drugs examples of which include trichlosan, tetracycline, Harungana madagascariensis leaf extract, minocycline, metronidazole, chlorhexidine have been encapsulated into nanodelivery systems for treating periodontitis. A few examples of polymers investigated as matrices for the delivery of drugs to the periodontal pocket include chitosan, Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid copolymer, poly e caprolactone, polylactic acid, polypropylene, cellulose acetate propionate and ethyl vinyl acetate. In the near future also nanotechnology is expected to find its application in all the specializations of dentistry ranging from diagnosis and treatment of oral cancers to development of colloidal suspension containing millions of active analgesic micron-size dental robots resulting in anesthesia in patients. In the light of the above facts the current editorial focuses on the applications of nanotechnology based nanomedicines which cannot be undermined in the improvement of dental health and hygiene both, in the current as well as in future scenario.

pub.1136479209,Improved multidetector asymmetrical-flow field-flow fractionation method for particle sizing and concentration measurements of lipid-based nanocarriers for RNA delivery,"Lipid-based nanoparticles for RNA delivery (LNP-RNA) are revolutionizing the nanomedicine field, with one approved gene therapy formulation and two approved vaccines against COVID-19, as well as multiple ongoing clinical trials. As for other innovative nanopharmaceuticals (NPhs), the advancement of robust methods to assess their quality and safety profiles-in line with regulatory needs-is critical for facilitating their development and clinical translation. Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation coupled to multiple online optical detectors (MD-AF4) is considered a very versatile and robust approach for the physical characterisation of nanocarriers, and has been used successfully for measuring particle size, polydispersity and physical stability of lipid-based systems, including liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles. However, the unique core structure of LNP-RNA, composed of ionizable lipids electrostatically complexed with RNA, and the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating, is more prone to destabilization during focusing in MD-AF4 than previously characterised nanoparticles, resulting in particle aggregation and sample loss. Hence characterisation of LNP-RNA by MD-AF4 needs significant adaptation of the methods developed for liposomes. To improve the performance of MD-AF4 applied to LNP-RNA in a systematic and comprehensive manner, we have explored the use of the frit-inlet channel where, differently from the standard AF4 channel, the particles are relaxed hydrodynamically as they are injected. The absence of a focusing step minimizes contact between the particle and the membrane, reducing artefacts (e.g. sample loss, particle aggregation). Separation in a frit-inlet channel enables satisfactory reproducibility and acceptable sample recovery in the commercially available MD-AF4 instruments. In addition to slice-by-slice measurements of particle size, MD-AF4 also allows to determine particle concentration and the particle size distribution, demonstrating enhanced versatility beyond standard sizing measurements."
pub.1130690411,Toward understanding the purely geometric effects of silver nanoparticles on potential application as ocular therapeutics via treatment of bacterial keratitis,"Understanding a complex interaction between therapeutic nanoparticles and biological entities is crucially important for the development of effective disease treatments in the modern nanopharmaceuticals and nanomedicines. Herein, we present a strategy to thoroughly assess geometrical impacts of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, one of the most promising nanotherapeutic agents) on their biological activities toward treatment of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced keratitis. Specifically, three types of differently shaped AgNPs including silver nanorods (R-Ag), silver nanotriangles (T-Ag), and silver nanospheres (SAg) are employed and interferences of particle surface area and functionality are eliminated to reflect purely geometric effects. Ocular biocompatibility studies on rabbit corneal keratocytes reveal that SAg is the least cytotoxic agent while R-Ag, because of its strongest cellular uptake, induces highest cytotoxic levels. Moreover, SAg is demonstrated to outperform R-Ag and T-Ag in killing S. aureus, possibly due to a predominance of specific particle density and high-atom-density {111} facets of the SAg when interacting with the bacteria. In contrast, owing to its predominance of sharp-tip effects on vascular endothelial cells, R-Ag can suppress blood vessel development in cornea at a greatest extent. In a rabbit model of S. aureus-induced keratitis, intrastromal administration of the differently shaped AgNPs exhibits critical roles of the particle geometry at comparable conditions (i.e., total surface area and functionality) in attenuating progression of S. aureus-induced keratitis. As a compromise among ocular biocompatibility, anti-bacterial activity, and anti-angiogenic capability, SAg shows as the most effective agent that could repair infectious corneal tissues 1.2 and 4-fold greater than the anisotropic counterparts (R-Ag and T-Ag). These findings therefore suggest a promising strategy for a clear-cut evaluation on geometric effects of therapeutic nanoparticles toward preclinical treatment of eye-related microbial infections."
pub.1005906395,Development and evaluation of vitamin E D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate-mixed polymeric phospholipid micelles of berberine as an anticancer nanopharmaceutical,"Berberine (Brb) is an active alkaloid occurring in various common plant species, with well-recognized potential for cancer therapy. Brb not only augments the efficacy of antineoplastic chemotherapy and radiotherapy but also exhibits direct antimitotic and proapoptotic actions, along with distinct antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activities in a variety of tumors. Despite its low systemic toxicity, several pharmaceutical challenges limit the application of Brb in cancer therapy (ie, extremely low solubility and permeability, very poor pharmacokinetics (PKs), and oral bioavailability). Among lipid-based nanocarriers investigated recently for Brb, stealth amphiphilic micelles of polymeric phospholipid conjugates were studied here as a promising strategy to improve Brb delivery to tumors. Specifically, physicochemically stable micelles made of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethyleneglycol)-2000] (PEG-PE) mixed with d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) (PEG-succinate ester of vitamin E), in a 3:1 M ratio, increased Brb solubilization by 300%. Our PEG-PE/TPGS-mixed micelles firmly retained the incorporated Brb, displaying extended-release profile in simulated media, with up to 30-fold projected improvement in simulated PKs of Brb. Owing to the markedly better uptake of Brb-containing mixed micelles in vitro, our Brb-mixed micelles nanoformulation significantly amplified apoptosis and overall cytotoxic effectiveness against monolayer and spheroid cultures of human prostate carcinomas (16- to 18-fold lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration values in PC3 and LNPaC, respectively), compared to free Brb. Mixed PEG-PE/TPGS micelles represent a promising delivery platform for the sparingly soluble anticancer agent, Brb, encouraging further pharmaceutical development of this drug for cancer therapy. "
pub.1078150805,[Nanomedicine as a part of nanotechnology].,"In the general sense, nanomedicine is defined as the application of nanotechnologies including nanobiothechnologies in medicine. Under conditions of current rapid development of nanotechnologies, many terms and definitions lack clarity and precision and boundaries between traditional and nanotechnologies are equally poorly determined. Evidently, dimensional parameters alone are insufficient to refer someone or other work to the field of nanotechnology (e.g., nanomedicine). Fundamental novelty of nanomedicine as a branch of knowledge and technology is exemplified by the developments in pharmacology and design of medicinal products that brought about new nanomedical (nanopharmacological, nanopharmaceutical) drugs. These products are multicomponent supramolecular compounds designed for a specific purpose whose intricate structure is intended not so much to impart new properties as to properly deliver the active ingredient to the biological target. Accordingly, nanomedicine should be regarded as the use of supramolecular complexes with a well differentiated surface manufactured by purposeful assembly of selected components for diagnostic and/or therapeutic application."

pub.1016219093,Novel kojic acid-polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites for medical applications,"Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized by the coprecipitation of iron salts in sodium hydroxide followed by coating separately with chitosan (CS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to form CS-MNPs and PEG-MNPs nanoparticles, respectively. They were then loaded with kojic acid (KA), a pharmacologically bioactive natural compound, to form KA-CS-MNPs and KA-PEG-MNPs nanocomposites, respectively. The MNPs and their nanocomposites were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, vibrating sample magnetometry, and scanning electron microscopy. The powder X-ray diffraction data suggest that all formulations consisted of highly crystalline, pure magnetite Fe3O4. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the presence of both polymers and KA in the nanocomposites. Magnetization curves showed that both nanocomposites (KA-CS-MNPs and KA-PEG-MNPs) were superparamagnetic with saturation magnetizations of 8.1 emu/g and 26.4 emu/g, respectively. The KA drug loading was estimated using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, which gave a loading of 12.2% and 8.3% for the KA-CS-MNPs and KA-PEG-MNPs nanocomposites, respectively. The release profile of the KA from the nanocomposites followed a pseudo second-order kinetic model. The agar diffusion test was performed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity for both KA-CS-MNPs and KA-PEG-MNPs nanocomposites against a number of microorganisms using two Gram-positive (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and one Gram-negative (Salmonella enterica) species, and showed some antibacterial activity, which could be enhanced in future studies by optimizing drug loading. This study provided evidence for the promise for the further investigation of the possible beneficial biological activities of KA and both KA-CS-MNPs and KA-PEG-MNPs nanocomposites in nanopharmaceutical applications.

pub.1119863977,Pseudo-anaphylaxis to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)-Coated Liposomes: Roles of Anti-PEG IgM and Complement Activation in a Porcine Model of Human Infusion Reactions,"Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated nanopharmaceuticals can cause mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), which can occasionally be life threatening or even lethal. The phenomenon represents an unsolved immune barrier to the use of these drugs, yet its mechanism is poorly understood. This study showed that a single i.v. injection in pigs of a low dose of PEGylated liposomes (Doxebo) induced a massive rise of anti-PEG IgM in blood, peaking at days 7-9 and declining over 6 weeks. Bolus injections of PEG-liposomes during seroconversion resulted in anaphylactoid shock (pseudo-anaphylaxis) within 2-3 min, although similar treatments of naı̈ve animals led to only mild hemodynamic disturbance. Parallel measurement of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and sC5b-9 in blood, taken as measures of HSR and complement activation, respectively, showed a concordant rise of the two variables within 3 min and a decline within 15 min, suggesting a causal relationship between complement activation and pulmonary hypertension. We also observed a rapid decline of anti-PEG IgM in the blood within minutes, increased binding of PEGylated liposomes to IgM<sup><b>+</b></sup> B cells in the spleen of immunized animals compared to control, and increased C3 conversion by PEGylated liposomes in the serum of immunized pigs. These observations taken together suggest rapid binding of anti-PEG IgM to PEGylated liposomes, leading to complement activation <i>via</i> the classical pathway, entailing anaphylactoid shock and accelerated blood clearance of liposome-IgM complexes. These data suggest that complement activation plays a causal role in severe HSRs to PEGylated nanomedicines and that pigs can be used as a hazard identification model to assess the risk of HSRs in preclinical safety studies."
pub.1002575916,"Novel multi-component nanopharmaceuticals derived from poly(ethylene) glycol, retro-inverso-Tat nonapeptide and saquinavir demonstrate combined anti-HIV effects","BackgroundCurrent anti-AIDS therapeutic agents and treatment regimens can provide a dramatically improved quality of life for HIV-positive people, many of whom have no detectable viral load for prolonged periods of time. Despite this, curing AIDS remains an elusive goal, partially due to the occurrence of drug resistance. Since the development of resistance is linked to, among other things, fluctuating drug levels, our long-term goal has been to develop nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems that can improve therapy by more precisely controlling drug concentrations in target cells. The theme of the current study is to investigate the value of combining AIDS drugs and modifiers of cellular uptake into macromolecular conjugates having novel pharmacological properties.ResultsBioconjugates were prepared from different combinations of the approved drug, saquinavir, the antiviral agent, R.I.CK-Tat9, the polymeric carrier, poly(ethylene) glycol and the cell uptake enhancer, biotin. Anti-HIV activities were measured in MT-2 cells, an HTLV-1-transformed human lymphoid cell line, infected with HIV-1 strain Vbu 3, while parallel studies were performed in uninfected cells to determine cellular toxicity. For example, R.I.CK-Tat9 was 60 times more potent than L-Tat9 while the addition of biotin resulted in a prodrug that was 2850 times more potent than L-Tat9. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies suggest that variations in intracellular uptake and intracellular localization, as well as synergistic inhibitory effects of SQV and Tat peptides, contributed to the unexpected and substantial differences in antiviral activity.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that highly potent nanoscale multi-drug conjugates with low non-specific toxicity can be produced by combining moieties with anti-HIV agents for different targets onto macromolecules having improved delivery properties."
pub.1027446921,"Irinophore C, a Novel Nanoformulation of Irinotecan, Alters Tumor Vascular Function and Enhances the Distribution of 5-Fluorouracil and Doxorubicin","PURPOSE: To examine the antitumor effects of Irinophore C, a nanopharmaceutical formulation of irinotecan, on the tissue morphology and function of tumor vasculature in HT-29 human colorectal tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fluorescence microscopy was used to map and quantify changes in tissue density, tumor vasculature, hypoxia, and the distribution of Hoechst 33342, a perfusion marker, and the anticancer drug, doxorubicin. Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify Ktrans, the volume transfer constant of a solute between the blood vessels and extracellular tissue compartment of the tumor, as a measure of vascular function. Following treatment with Irinophore C, 19F magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor the delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to the tumor tissue, whereas scintigraphy was used to quantify the presence of bound [14C]5-FU.
RESULTS: Irinophore C decreased cell density (P = 8.42 x 10(-5)), the overall number of endothelial cells in the entire section (P = 0.014), tumor hypoxia (P = 5.32 x 10(-9)), and K(trans) (P = 0.050). However, treatment increased the ratio of endothelial cells to cell density (P = 0.00024) and the accumulation of Hoechst 33342 (P = 0.022), doxorubicin (P = 0.243 x 10(-5)), and 5-FU (P = 0.0002) in the tumor. Vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8, two proangiogenic factors, were down-regulated, whereas the antiangiogenic factor TIMP-1 was up-regulated in Irinophore C-treated tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Irinophore C treatment improves the vascular function of the tumor, thereby reducing tumor hypoxia and increasing the delivery and accumulation of a second drug. Reducing hypoxia would enhance radiotherapy, whereas improving delivery of a second drug to the tumor should result in higher cell kill."
pub.1118098064,A high-loading drug delivery system based on magnetic nanomaterials modified by hyperbranched phenylboronic acid for tumor-targeting treatment with pH response,"To overcome the limited drug loading capacity of magnetic nanopharmaceuticals arising from the relatively large mass of the metal core, a high-loading drug delivery system based on amino-functionalized Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanospheres modified by hyperbranched phenylboronic acid (HPBA-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) were prepared for the first time. The obtained nanomaterials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, zeta potential, elemental analysis, vibrating sample magnetometry and X-ray diffraction analysis, and the results showed that hyperbranched phenylboronic acid (HPBA) were successfully grafted onto the surface of the magnetic nanospheres.

pub.1071443382,Nanopharmaceutical Approach for Enhanced Anti-cancer Activity of Betulinic Acid in Lung-cancer Treatment via Activation of PARP: Interaction with DNA as a Target,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relative efficacies of a derivative of betulinic acid (dBA) and its poly (lactide- co-glycolide) (PLGA) nano-encapsulated form in A549 lung cancer cells in vivo and in co-mutagen [sodium arsenite (SA) + benzo]undefined[a]pyrene (BaP)]-induced lung cancer in mice in vivo.
METHODS: dBA was loaded with PLGA nanoparticles by using the standard solvent displacement method. The sizes and morphologies of nano-dBA (NdBA) were determined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and their intracellular localization was verified by using confocal microscopy. The binding and interaction of NdBA with calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid (CT-DNA) as a target were analyzed by using conventional circular dichroism (CD) and melting temperature (Tm) profile data. Apoptotic signalling cascades in vitro and in vivo were studied by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the ability of NdBA to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was also examined. The stage of cell cycle arrest was confirmed by using a fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) data analysis.
RESULTS: The average size of the nanoparticles was ~ 110 nm. Confocal microscopy images confirmed the presence of NdBA in the cellular cytoplasm. The bio-physical properties of dBA and NdBA ascertained from the CD and the Tm profiles revealed that NdBA had greater interaction with the target DNA than dBA did. Both dBA and NdBA arrested cell proliferation at G0/G1, NdBA showing the greater effect. NdBA also induced a greater degree of cytotoxicity in A549 cells, but it had an insignificant cytotoxic effect in normal L6 cells. The results of flow cytometric, cytogenetial and histopathological studies in mice revealed that NdBA caused less nuclear condensation and DNA damage than dBA did. TEM images showed the presence of NdBA in brain samples of NdBA fed mice, indicating its ability to cross the BBB.
CONCLUSION: Thus, compared to dBA, NdBA appears to have greater chemoprotective potential against lung cancer."

Here we assessed the effects of CPT on the HIF/p53 pathway. CPT demonstrated striking inhibition of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α accumulation in von Hippel–Lindau (VHL)-defective ccRCC cells, but surprisingly failed to inhibit protein levels of HIF-2α-dependent target genes (VEGF, PAI-1, ET-1, cyclin D1). Instead, CPT induced DNA damage-dependent apoptosis that was augmented in the presence of pVHL. Further analysis revealed CPT regulated endothelin-1 (ET-1) in a p53-dependent manner: CPT increased ET-1 mRNA abundance in VHL-defective ccRCC cell lines that was significantly augmented in their VHL-expressing counterparts that displayed increased phosphorylation and accumulation of p53; p53 siRNA suppressed CPT-induced increase in ET-1 mRNA, as did an inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling, suggesting a role for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 in the induction of ET-1. Finally, we demonstrate that p53 phosphorylation and accumulation is partially dependent on mTOR activity in ccRCC. Consistent with this result, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1/2 kinase inhibited CPT-mediated ET-1 upregulation, and p53-dependent responses in ccRCC. Collectively, these data provide mechanistic insight into the action of CPT in ccRCC, identify ET-1 as a p53-regulated gene and demonstrate a requirement of mTOR for p53-mediated responses in this tumor type."
pub.1107528213,Involvement of complement activation in the pulmonary vasoactivity of polystyrene nanoparticles in pigs: unique surface properties underlying alternative pathway activation and instant opsonization,"BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that many hypersensitivity reactions to nanopharmaceuticals represent complement (C)-activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA), and that pigs provide a sensitive animal model to study the phenomenon. However, a recent study suggested that pulmonary hypertension, the pivotal symptom of porcine CARPA, is not mediated by C in cases of polystyrene nanoparticle (PS-NP)-induced reactions.
GOALS: To characterize PS-NPs and reexamine the contribution of CARPA to their pulmonary reactivity in pigs.
STUDY DESIGN: C activation by 200, 500, and 750 nm (diameter) PS-NPs and their opsonization were measured in human and pig sera, respectively, and correlated with hemodynamic effects of the same NPs in pigs in vivo.
METHODS: Physicochemical characterization of PS-NPs included size, ζ-potential, cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and hydrophobicity analyses. C activation in human serum was measured by ELISA and opsonization of PS-NPs in pig serum by Western blot and flow cytometry. Pulmonary vasoactivity of PS-NPs was quantified in the porcine CARPA model.
RESULTS: PS-NPs are monodisperse, highly hydrophobic spheres with strong negative surface charge. In human serum, they caused size-dependent, significant rises in C3a, Bb, and sC5b-9, but not C4d. Exposure to pig serum led within minutes to deposition of C5b-9 and opsonic iC3b on the NPs, and opsonic iC3b fragments (C3dg, C3d) also appeared in serum. PS-NPs caused major hemodynamic changes in pigs, primarily pulmonary hypertension, on the same time scale (minutes) as iC3b fragmentation and opsonization proceeded. There was significant correlation between C activation by different PS-NPs in human serum and pulmonary hypertension in pigs.
CONCLUSION: PS-NPs have extreme surface properties with no relevance to clinically used nanomedicines. They can activate C via the alternative pathway, entailing instantaneous opsonization of NPs in pig serum. Therefore, rather than being solely C-independent reactivity, the mechanism of PS-NP-induced hypersensitivity in pigs may involve C activation. These data are consistent with the ""double-hit"" concept of nanoparticle-induced hypersensitivity reactions involving both CARPA and C-independent pseudoallergy."
pub.1129355890,Photosensitizer-Doped and Plasma Membrane-Responsive Liposomes for Nuclear Drug Delivery and Multidrug Resistance Reversal,"Clinically approved doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded liposomes (e.g., Doxil) guarantee good biosafety, but their insufficient nuclear delivery of Dox (<0.4%) after cellular uptake significantly hampers their final anticancer efficacy. Here, we report that simply doping protoporphyrin IX (PpIX, a commonly used hydrophobic photosensitizer) into the lipid bilayers of Dox-loaded liposomes (the resultant product is termed PpIX/Dox liposomes) is a feasible way to promote the nuclear delivery of Dox. This facile strategy relies on a unique property of PpIX-it presents considerably higher affinity for the real plasma membrane over its liposomal carrier, which drives the doped PpIX molecules to detach from the liposomes when encountering cancer cells. We demonstrate that this process can trigger the efficient release of the loaded Dox molecules and allow them to enter the nuclei of MCF-7 breast cancer cells without being trapped by lysosomes. Regarding the drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells, the aberrant activation of the efflux pumps in the plasma membranes expels the internalized Dox. However, we strikingly find that the robust drug resistance can be reversed upon mild laser irradiation because the photodynamic effect of PpIX disrupts the drug efflux system (e.g., P-glycoprotein) and facilitates the nuclear entry of Dox. As a proof-of-concept, this PpIX doping strategy is also applicable for enhancing the effectiveness of cisplatin-loaded liposomes against both A549 and A549/DDP lung cancer cells. In vivo experimental results prove that a single injection of PpIX/Dox liposomes completely impedes the growth of MCF-7 tumors in nude mice within 2 weeks and, in combination with laser irradiation, can synergistically ablate MCF-7/ADR tumors. Biosafety assessments reveal no significant systemic toxicity caused by PpIX/Dox liposomes. This work exemplifies a facile method to modulate the subcellular fate of liposomal drugs and may inspire the optimization of nanopharmaceuticals in the near future."
pub.1132034710,The Critical Choice of Animal Models in Nanomedicine Safety Assessment: A Lesson Learned From Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers,"Intravenous injection of nanopharmaceuticals can induce severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) resulting in anaphylactoid shock in a small percentage of patients, a phenomenon explicitly reproducible in pigs. However, there is a debate in the literature on whether the pig model of HSRs can be used as a safety test for the prediction of severe adverse reactions in humans. Given the importance of using appropriate animal models for toxicity/safety testing, the choice of the right species and model is a critical decision. In order to facilitate the decision process and to expand the relevant information regarding the pig or no pig dilemma, this review examines an ill-fated clinical development program conducted by Baxter Corporation in the United States 24 years ago, when HemeAssist, an αα (diaspirin) crosslinked hemoglobin-based O<sub>2</sub> carrier (HBOC) was tested in trauma patients. The study showed increased mortality in the treatment group relative to controls and had to be stopped. This disappointing result had far-reaching consequences and contributed to the setback in blood substitute research ever since. Importantly, the increased mortality of trauma patients was predicted in pig experiments conducted by US Army scientists, yet they were considered irrelevant to humans. Here we draw attention to that the underlying cause of hemoglobin-induced aggravation of hemorrhagic shock and severe HSRs have a common pathomechanism: cardiovascular distress due to vasoconstrictive effects of hemoglobin (Hb) and reactogenic nanomedicines, manifested, among others, in pulmonary hypertension. The main difference is that in the case of Hb this effect is due to NO-binding, while nanomedicines can trigger the release of proinflammatory mediators. Because of the higher sensitivity of cloven-hoof animals to this kind of cardiopulmonary distress compared to rodents, these reactions can be better reproduced in pigs than in murine or rat models. When deciding on the battery of tests and the appropriate models to identify the potential hazard for nanomedicine-induced severe HSR, the pros and cons of the various species must be considered carefully."
pub.1029578325,New trends in guided nanotherapies for digestive cancers: A systematic review,"Digestive tract tumors are among the most common and deadliest malignancies worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis and lack of efficient therapeutics. Current treatments essentially rely on surgery associated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy agents. Despite an upfront response, conventional drugs often fail to eliminate highly aggressive clones endowed with chemoresistant properties, which are responsible for tumor recurrence and disease dissemination. Synthetic drugs also present severe adverse systemic effects, hampering the administration of biologically effective dosages. Nanoencapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents within biocompatible polymeric or lipid matrices holds great potential to improve the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of conventional chemotherapy while reducing systemic toxicity. Tagging nanoparticle surfaces with specific ligands for cancer cells, namely monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments, has provided means to target more aggressive clones, further improving the selectivity and efficacy of nanodelivery vehicles. In fact, over the past twenty years, significant research has translated into a wide array of guided nanoparticles, providing the molecular background for a new generation of intelligent and more effective anti-cancer agents. Attempting to bring awareness among the medical community to emerging targeted nanopharmaceuticals and foster advances in the field, we have conducted a systematic review about this matter. Emphasis was set on ongoing preclinical and clinical trials for liver, colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers. To the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic and integrated overview on this field. Using a specific query, 433 abstracts were gathered and narrowed to 47 manuscripts when matched against inclusion/exclusion criteria. All studies showed that active targeting improves the effectiveness of the nanodrugs alone, while lowering its side effects. The main focus has been on hepatocarcinomas, mainly by exploring glycans as homing molecules. Other ligands such as peptides/small proteins and antibodies/antibody fragments, with affinity to either tumor vasculature or tumor cells, have also been widely and successfully applied to guide nanodrugs to gastrointestinal carcinomas. Conversely, few solutions have been presented for pancreatic tumors. To this date only three nanocomplexes have progressed beyond pre-clinical stages: i) PK2, a galactosamine-functionalized polymeric-DOX formulation for hepatocarcinomas; ii) MCC-465, an anti-(myosin heavy chain a) immunoliposome for advanced stage metastatic solid tumors; and iii) MBP-426, a transferrin-liposome-oxaliplatin conjugate, also for advanced stage tumors. Still, none has been approved for clinical use. However, based on the high amount of pre-clinical studies showing enthusiastic results, the number of clinical trials is expected to increase in the near future.

pub.1092694907,Designing Dendron–Polymer Conjugate Based Targeted Drug Delivery Platforms with a “Mix-and-Match” Modularity,"Polymeric micellar systems are emerging as a very important class of nanopharmaceuticals due to their ability to improve pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of chemotherapy drugs, as well as to reduce related systemic toxicities. While these nanosized delivery systems inherently benefit from passive targeting through the enhanced permeation and retention effect leading to increased accumulation in the tumor, additional active targeting can be achieved through surface modification of micelles with targeting groups specific for overexpressed receptors of tumor cells. In this project, nontoxic, biodegradable, and modularly tunable micellar delivery systems were generated using two types of dendron-polymer conjugates. Either an AB type dendron-polymer construct with 2K PEG or an ABA type dendron-polymer-dendron conjugate with 6K PEG based middle block was used as primary construct; along with an AB type dendron-polymer containing a cRGDfK targeting group to actively target cancer cells overexpressing α<sub>υ</sub>β<sub>3</sub>/α<sub>υ</sub>β<sub>5</sub> integrins. A set of micelles encapsulating docetaxel, a widely employed chemotherapy drug, were prepared with varying feed ratios of primary construct and targeting group containing secondary construct. Critical micelle concentrations of all micellar systems were in the range of 10<sup>-6</sup> M. DLS measurements indicated hydrodynamic size distributions varying between 170 to 200 nm. An increase in docetaxel release at acidic pH was observed for all micelles. Enhanced cellular internalization of Nile red doped micelles by MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells suggested that the most efficient uptake was observed with targeted micelles. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and A549 lung carcinoma cell lines showed improved toxicity for RGD containing micelles. For A549 cell line EC<sub>50</sub> values of drug loaded micellar sets were in the range of 10<sup>-9</sup> M whereas EC<sub>50</sub> value of free docetaxel was around 10<sup>-10</sup> M. For MDA-MB-231 cell line EC<sub>50</sub> value of free docetaxel was 6 × 10<sup>-8</sup> M similar to EC<sub>50</sub> of nontargeted AB type docetaxel doped micellar constructs whereas the EC<sub>50</sub> value of its targeted counterpart decreased to 5.5 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M. Overall, in this comparative study, the targeting group containing micellar construct fabricated with a 2 kDa PEG based diblock dendron-polymer conjugate emerges as an attractive drug delivery vehicle due to the ease of synthesis, high stability of the micelles, and efficient targeting."
pub.1145748269,Nanonutraceuticals in Chemotherapy of Infectious Diseases and Cancer,"Nanotechnology, an upcoming field of science dealing with nanoparticles (109), has a wide range of biomedical applications in prophylaxis, diagnosis, and therapy of infectious diseases and cancer. Similarly, nutraceuticals (nutritional and pharmaceutical hybrid) play a key role as immunomodulators, thereby acting as a defense mechanism to fight against microbial pathogens and cancer. Owing to nonspecificity and major adverse reactions of the conventional antimicrobial and anticancer drugs, there exists a pertinent search for novel naturally occurring nutraceuticals that are target specific and devoid of toxicity. Hence, recent research focus is on the combination of nutraceutical with nanotechnology to produce nanonutraceuticals. This chapter deals with nanonutraceutical classification, formulations in drug designing, its delivery to the target site, mechanism involved in immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory effect, utilization in medical imaging, and chemotherapy of cancer and infectious diseases. Additionally, pharmacological and toxicological aspects of nanonutraceuticals and its possible utilization in COVID-19 therapy, with special emphasis on its advantages over repurposing drugs, will be explored."
pub.1150528631,Chapter 17 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanopharmaceuticals,"Nanopharmaceuticals is an umbrella term which encompasses nanobased technologies dependent drug-delivery systems to deliver pharmaceuticals in human body as particles ranging in nanometers range. By virtue of its size and technologies, nanopharmaceuticals may impart unique pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties than the traditional drug-delivery systems. This chapter discusses the PK, factors affecting pharmacokinetics and PK/PD modeling in the development of nanopharmaceuticals. In general, the biodistribution and elimination of nanopharmaceuticals are more complex and depends on the type, size, composition, charge, and surface chemistry of nanopharmaceuticals. Systemically available nanopharmaceuticals undergo opsonization followed by phagocytosis by reticuloendothelial system. Due to the complexity in modeling of nanopharmaceuticals, lack of appropriate data, limited examples of PK/PD modeling work have been reported. However, recently a greater number of PK/PD modeling have been reported yet there is an immense untapped potential of PK/PD modeling in the development of nanopharmaceuticals which can be utilized with concerted and collaborative efforts."

It is therefore important that research is sustainable and does not just serve the career development of individuals. The aim of this article is to discuss what sustainable research in radiology is, how it can be organised and, above all, to show that it is possible.There are various approaches to achieving sustainability, ranging from purely gaining knowledge to translated devices and contrast agents, and to new clinical applications. The first step is to clarify exactly what is intended to be achieved with the research and critically weigh up the novelty value and the expected impact. This should be followed by careful, long-term planning of the project over a period of 5-15 years with the definition of clear sub-steps. Securing funding is just as important here as regular communication of the results. It often makes sense to involve the regulatory authorities and commercialisation partners in the project at an early stage.Academic radiology should not limit itself to serving as a test platform for imaging devices and contrast agents from industry, but should try to realise its own ideas and developments. Many academic centres around the world have shown that this is possible. Examples from my own research, particularly in relation to the development and translation of super-resolution ultrasound imaging and the development of diagnostics and nanopharmaceuticals, are explained in this article and challenges at various stages of development are discussed. Young radiologists are encouraged to set bigger and more long-term goals in order to influence and develop our field in a sustainable way. · Sustainable research requires creativity and careful planning. · Sustainable research can start at several stages of the technical readiness level. · Long-term planning of the overall concept (5-15 years) with clear intermediate steps is essential. · Cooperation with industry is often useful. · Acquisition of third-party funding must be ensured at the same time."

Nutraceuticals – a conjoint word made up of “Nutrition” and “Pharmaceuticals” defines a new category which plays a pivotal role as functional food between drugs and food to promote health and prevent diseases. Nanomaterials have permeated all domains of medical sciences including therapeutics and diagnostics. Nutraceuticals are increasingly replacing the prescription drugs, reflecting the paradigm shift in the healthcare scenario. Oral route being the most favored route of administration for the nutraceuticals has limitations due to the high lipophilicity, low solubility, and hence low bioavailability. Researchers have endeavored to overcome these obstacles by a plethora of methods designed for specific nutraceuticals with solubility –enhancement approaches, majority of which use nanotechnology. Nanonutraceuticals have made notable impact in prime areas like cancer, CNS disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, orthopedic diseases, immunological disorders, and infection control. The increasing number of federally approved nanomedicines and/or nanonutraceuticals and many more in clinical trials pipeline is a strong proof of the paramount applications of these. Nanonutraceuticals offer unique advantages over conventionally available systems like improved bioaccesibility and efficacy, tailored release, faster onset of action, and site‐specific targeting. Therapeutic agents are formulated using biocompatible/biodegradable nanocomposites. However, little evidence exists to establish the safety of these materials and their biological fate in living systems. The toxicity of nanoparticles is a summation of physical properties and surface chemistry. It is important that novel nanomaterials be made using biodegradable polymers and green approach.

By using nanomaterials as drug delivery carriers, the pharmacological properties of drugs can be improved by changing their pharmacokinetic properties and distribution in the biological environment. This approach is particularly useful in delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into tumor tissues. Due to their characteristics, nanopharmaceuticals have many advantages over preparations used in conventional chemotherapy. The greatest advantage is the targeted drug delivery to tumor tissues, resulting in reduced systemic toxicity, which is the most prominent disadvantage of conventional chemotherapy.

Nutraceuticals have been explored as an innovative strategy to overcome chemotherapy drawbacks.However, the clinical utility of nutraceuticals is restricted due to their complex structures, less water solubility, reduced stability, decreased bioavailability and more obstacles in the gastrointestinal tract. Nanonutraceuticals are nanosized nutraceutical particles having enhanced solubility, improved bioavailability, stability, and targeted delivery to specific cells. Nutraceuticals can be co-delivered with other chemotherapeutic drugs in nanocarriers to elicit synergistic effects. The targeting of nutraceuticals against cancer cells can be enabled by coupling ligands with the nanocarriers, which direct to the overexpressed receptors found at the surface of the cancer cells. Transitioning a nanonutraceutical from pre-clinical research to clinical trials is a pivotal step. This focus on advancing their application holds great potential for impacting clinical research and improving the treatment landscape for cancer patients. This review focuses on the role of nutraceuticals for cancer treatment, various nanocarriers for the efficient delivery of nutraceuticals along with co-administration of nutraceuticals with chemotherapeutic drugs using nanocarriers. Also, emphasize the targeting of ligands coupled nanocarriers to the cancer cells along with patents and clinical trials for nanonutraceuticals."

pub.1078489809,Novel strategy for subretinal delivery in Xenopus.,"PURPOSE: The subretinal space, which borders the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, and Müller cells, is an ideal location to deliver genetic vectors, morpholino oligos, and nanopharmaceuticals. Unfortunately, materials injected into the space tend to stay localized, and degenerative changes secondary to retinal detachment limit its usefulness. Furthermore, such injection requires penetration of the sclera, RPE/choroid, or the retina itself. Here, we developed a strategy in Xenopus to utilize the continuity of the brain ventricle and optic vesicle lumen during embryogenesis as a means to access the subretinal space.
METHODS: Wild-type and transgenic embryos expressing green fluorescent protein under the rod-opsin promoter were used for optic vesicle and brain ventricle injections. For injection directly into the optic vesicle, embryos were laid on one side in clay troughs. For brain ventricle injections, embryos were placed standing in foxholes cored from agarose dishes. Linear arrays with each embryo positioned dorsal side toward the micromanipulator facilitated high throughput injections. Twenty-five micrometer micropipettes, which were positioned with a micromanipulator or by hand, were used to pressure inject ~1.0 nl of test solution (brilliant blue, India ink, fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran, or 0.04 µm of latex polystyrene microspheres [FluoSpheres®]). FluroSpheres® were particularly useful in confirming successful injections in living embryos. Anesthetized embryos and tadpoles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected for frozen sections, or dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in methacrylate resin compatible with the microspheres.
RESULTS: Direct optic vesicle injections resulted in filling of the brain ventricle, contralateral optic vesicle, and central canal. Stages 24 and 25 gave the most consistent results. However, even with experience, the success rate was only ~25%. Targeting the vesicle was even more difficult beyond stage 26 due to the flattening of the lumen. In contrast, brain ventricle injections were easier to perform and had a ~90% success rate. The most consistent results were obtained in targeting the diencephalic ventricle, which is located along the midline, and protrudes anteriorly just under the frontal ectoderm and prosencephalon. An anterior midline approach conveniently accessed the ventricle without disturbing the optic vesicles. Beyond stage 30, optic vesicle filling did not occur, presumably due to closure of the connection between the ventricular system and the optic vesicles. Securing the embryos in an upright position in the agarose foxholes allowed convenient access to the frontal cephalic region. On methacrylate sections, the RPE-neural retina interphase was intact and labeled with the microspheres. As development continued, no distortion or malformation of the orbital structures was detected. In green fluorescent protein (GFP), transgenic embryos allowed to develop to stage 41, re"

pub.1129353174,Natural Products and Nanopharmaceuticals,"Drug discovery has faced many challenges, and the diversity of natural products offers a huge number of opportunities for new drug findings. Most of the potential candidates result from plants since plants have several and interesting biological activities. However, the in vivo efficacy of such candidates is frequently limited due to their low absorption. Thus, enhancing the bioavailability of natural products through the improvement of their pharmacokinetic and biodistribution features, as well as their targeting efficacy, is a crucial step in the development of new therapeutic strategies.Here, we reviewed nanotechnology as a rising approach for drug delivery, presenting smart nanocarriers that can selectively deliver appropriate levels of a therapeutic agent. Moreover, in order to deliver the therapeutic agent to target cells, nanocarriers can also be efficient targeting systems. Another benefit here discussed in the use of nanocarriers to deliver natural products is the controlled drug release.This review describes many types of nanocarriers with structural and functional differences between them which can be chosen accordingly to the encapsulated drug characteristics, to the specific target, or even to the desired release rate. With regard to natural products, we highlight several natural products that are already being commercialized or in clinical study phase with impressive therapeutic improvements using these nanocarriers. On the other hand, there are also a large number of natural products that are being used as encapsulant material in pioneering nanocarriers. This review aims to summarize the development in several key areas relevant to natural products in nanopharmaceuticals. Besides the potential beneficial use, also attention is drawn to the question how we should proceed with the safety and efficacy evaluation of the nanopharmaceuticals for natural product delivery. Nonetheless, research into sophisticated, science-driven solutions is still continuing; expectations related to therapeutic efficacy are high to meet clinical needs, but the progress made has been noticeable."

Imaging advancement made with nanotechnology has a massive impact in cardiology. Nanoparticles can be assembled into different shapes, i.e., nanocapsules or nanospheres, depending on the method of preparation and the drug targets. There is always a risk factor associated with the multiple drug usage which cannot be ignored. Treatments for cardiovascular diseases involve invasive surgeries that require highly trained and skilled physicians. All the drawbacks along with the low water solubility, low biological efficacies, and nontargeting of the conventional medications and therapies reinforce the requirement of advancements in the cardiovascular medicines and drug delivery systems."
pub.1150883417,Nanopharmaceuticals,"One of the specific applications of nanotechnology has been in the creation of advanced drug‐delivery systems, which have given rise to the term “nanopharmaceuticals”. Liposomes are a submicron and vesicular system for the transport and release of drugs; they are composed of a bilayer or multiple layers of natural or synthetic lipids with a central aqueous compartment.

Efficiency of nutraceuticals is usually challenged due to its poor bioavailability, safety, and toxicity-related issues. The major concerns of nutraceutical’s bioefficiency is the bioavailability of the nutraceuticals, which includes endogenous factors at different stages of the gastrointestinal tract (mouth, stomach, and intestine), physicochemical and enzymatic reactions involved in that, release of nutraceuticals from the food matrices or nanocarriers in gastrointestinal fluids, solubility of the nutraceuticals, their interaction with other components of the gastrointestinal tract, absorption of nutraceuticals by the epithelial layer, and the chemical and biochemical transformations into epithelial cells. Exogenous factors affecting the bioavailability are physicochemical properties of the food sample, their food matrix, processing, and storage of the food materials. Bioaccessibility or bioavailability assessment of nutraceuticals can be assessed by in vitro, in vivo, in situ, and ex situ methods. Assessment of bioaccessibility or bioavailability of different nutraceuticals like carotenoids, polyphenols, glucosinolates, and vitamin E have been done in different food matrices and shows wide variation. Among them, the percentage bioavailability of polyphenols is comparatively better. To improve the bioavailability of these nutraceuticals nanotechnology is applied, which enhances nutraceutical delivery systems through formulation of nanoemulsion, nanoliposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), and polymer nanoparticles.Graphical Abstract"

The central question is whether the regulatory responses are appropriate to cope with the regulatory problems nanomedicinal development is posing. The article explores whether the medical product regulations are robust enough, whether there are certain regulatory gaps, and whether the competent bodies have the expertise to evaluate nanomedicinal products when approval is applied for. Based on a social‐constructive approach, the article identifies significant regulatory actors, their ideas on regulatory problems, and preliminary governance responses to them.

As a consequence of these deficiencies legal certainty, a principle of high priority in European medical regulation policy, cannot be sufficiently provided."
pub.1129348185,Recent Advances on Nanostructured Materials for Drug Delivery and Release,"Nanomedicine has become a hot field of research, as it has the potential for developing several innovations in healthcare and, in particular, new pharmaceutical formulations. The need of innovative ways for drug transportation and delivery has accelerated the advances in the field of nanomaterials for pharmaceutical applications. The ultimate purpose of designing nanomaterials for drug delivery must be to ensure that the drug to be released exerts its pharmacological effect at the lowest possible dose, with the least number of side effects and equal benefits to a high dose. These so-called “nanopharmaceuticals” may possess distinctive features useful to improve the stability of the drugs, extend their systemic half-lives, enhance efficiency, increase bioavailability, and delay clearance. There is no doubt that nanopharmaceuticals are a promising strategy to overcome traditional pharmacokinetic limitations. Researchers around the world have been making important efforts to design and test novel nanoformulations, especially in in vitro and in vivo model studies. Virtually, all routes of drug administration have been investigated at this level. Compared to the high number of nanoformulations that are currently in the discovery and preclinical stages of the development pipeline, there are still very few nanopharmaceuticals in clinical trials and even less already in the market. This current scenario points to the need to accelerate nanomedicine endeavors in order to spur these formulations through the drug discovery pipeline.In this chapter, we will present some of the several opportunities for the design and use of nanomaterials (nanoliposomes, micelles, carbon nanostructures, dendrimers, polymeric, and inorganic nanoparticles) for pharmaceutical formulations. The experimental challenges, associated with moving from bench to bedside, will be addressed, as well as concerns about the precise control of drug release, their biodistribution or fate, and their toxicity, especially when they do not biodegrade. The need to validate and standardize protocols for early detection of toxicity, as well as an in depth understanding of the interaction among nanoparticles and tissues, organs, cells, and biomolecules, will be stated. Finally, the importance of developing a close interaction between scientists, regulators, institutions, and industry in order to help accelerate the efforts in the field will be indicated.

While efficacious, the therapeutic benefits of docetaxel are often compromised by immunosuppression and neurotoxicity, incurring a discontinuation rate of over 25%. Cerulean has developed a novel class of tumor-targeted nanopharmaceuticals designed to enhance both efficacy and tolerability. CRLX301, a self-assembling docetaxel nanopharmaceutical, possesses significantly enhanced efficacy and improved pharmacokinetics compared to the parent drug. IND-enabling toxicity studies for CRLX301 are currently underway. Compared to docetaxel, CRLX301 showed a superior PK profile, with a significantly longer half-life and a >20-fold higher drug concentration in tumor tissue 7 days after a single administration. The improved PK and biodistribution of CRLX301 docetaxel translated into superior antitumor activity in murine syngeneic and human xenograft models. In the murine B16.F10 tumor model, median survival at the MTD exceeded 100 days for CRLX301 compared to 38 days for the parent drug docetaxel. CRLX301 also demonstrated superior efficacy over docetaxel in tumor models representative of other cancer types as well, including cure rates between 50 and 83% in xenograft models representing triple-negative breast and squamous non-small cell lung cancer tumors, compared to no cures for docetaxel. Further, in the human prostate xenograft tumor model DU-145, CRLX 301 achieved a 100% cure rate compared to a relatively poor cure rate of 25% with docetaxel, 146 days after three weekly doses at the MTD. In summary, CRLX301 represents a new and potent anticancer therapeutic that has the potential to be a best-in-class taxane. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

pub.1039761105,Lessons Learned from Pharmaceutical Nanomaterials,"These days there are many controversial discussions about nanoparticles. The term nanoparticles stands for numerous objects in the nanoscale range including particle manufactured for medical use, particle generated at the industrial scale for surface coatings, electronics, energy, or consumer products, and last but not least pollution particles. Searching for “nanoparticles” via Scopus, the big citation and abstract database, presents approximately 180,000 publications of the last few decades. Only 45,000 of these publications are in medical, pharmaceutical, or biological journals. The unspecic vocabulary is not helpful in this discussion as it implies that size would be the main crucial property. The particle size is decisive for the interaction potential with biological surroundings, by determining the accessibility and the interaction surface. Other physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, however, contribute in terms of their hazard potential. Hence, being more precise in denition makes it easier to reach a realistic appreciation of both, the promises and fears connected to nanotechnology. Studies on the impact of combustion particles on environment or human health are important for risk assessment. Some of them are worst case scenarios of intoxication with nanoparticles not intended for human use. These results should not be extrapolated to particles for deliberate use in humans as is for nanomedicine. Applying nanotechnology for medical purposes means raw materials, manufacturing processes, and quality control are chosen and designed to achieve safest possible products. Nanomedicine, which is dened by the European Technology Platform on NanoMedicine as the application of nanotechnology in health care, exploits the improved and often novel physical, chemical, and biological properties of materials at the nanometric scale (NanoMedicine 2005). As nanomedicine also includes devices for medical use we term the nanoformulated drug delivery systems as “nanopharmaceuticals,” which offer many advantages such as enhanced solubility, higher bioavailability, reduction of side effects, targeting specic tissues, or protection of unstable drugs. When this chapter is reporting about nanopharmaceuticals, it aims to deliver some examples of how the potential of nanotechnology can be harnessed for pharmaceutical applications. A brief description and appraisal of the current usability of nanopharmaceuticals is presented in section 6.1. Few considerations regarding the chances and risks depending on the application route are given in section 6.2. Translation into safe medicine needs careful evaluation of particle characteristics (section 6.3.1) and their biological effects (section 6.3.2), which can bring us closer to the goal of safety prediction based on physicochemical particle properties as it would be needed for quality/safety by design approaches (section 6.4).

The huge wave that started during the 1990s in the United States has drastically changed the market trends for nutraceuticals. Consumers have started subscribing to diet regimens that reduce the risk of chronic diseases. People are using nutraceuticals and functional foods more for prevention than for the cure of diseases. After the industrial and communication revolutions, the lifestyles of humans are changing significantly. Everyone feels the scarcity of time, whether a young child or a retired adult. Earlier it was normal for a person to walk regularly a few miles; now lifestyles have changed, and there are fewer opportunities for people to walk or take regular exercise. Everyone is looking for alternative ways to keep healthy and trying to change their current lifestyles, leading to much healthier lifestyles. This is very well reflected in the growth of the nutraceutical and functional food market in the past decade. The growth of the nutraceutical food market from 2007 to 2013 was almost 142%, while that of nutraceutical supplements is estimated to increase by 125%, and nutraceutical beverages may increase by a whopping 185%. The nutraceutical market is predicted to record a revenue of USD 671.30 billion by 2024.

pub.1169143774,Nutraceutical and Nanonutraceutical in the Management of CVD and Hypertension,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality on the global level. World Health Organization (WHO) stated that an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, which accounted for 32% of all global deaths. Over three quarters of CVD deaths took place in low- and middle-income countries and about two-third of hypertensive population also lives in low- and middle-income countries. In 2019 17 million premature deaths below the age of 70 were due to noncommunicable diseases out of which 38% were caused by CVDs. CVDs are a group of disorders that affect heart and blood vessels. There are various risk factors associated to it and many are modifiable in nature. There are several food items that contains medicinal compounds occurring naturally, which we call as nutraceuticals. These could be very helpful in preventing the diseases as CVDs. These nutraceuticals compounds occur in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, nuts, oilseeds, etc. Nutraceuticals could be classified based on their source of origin as exogenous and endogenous. However, several bioactive compounds are subjected to low bioavailability and poor solubility, which leads to their inadequate absorption. This results in reduced biological activity and is considered to be a major concern for researchers. Hence, to enhance bioavailability of these compounds, the attention of researchers shifted from macroscopic to nanoscale. The efficient encapsulation of nutraceuticals by nanoformulation is beneficial in this regard. Principles of nanotechnology when incorporated increase the bioavailability of nutraceuticals, which could help prevent actions and undesirable interactions between active components of food.

pub.1138212324,Chapter 13 FDC in nanotechnology regulatory landscape,"Despite an emerging interest in nanotechnology-based formulations, it’s evident merits and promising clinical potentials, it yet faces a backlog in becoming a commercially viable entity. It is evident from the fact that very few nanopharmaceuticals (only single molecule-based) have received marketing authorization (MA) till date. One key reason for this limited success could be the lack of clear and lucid regulations, which makes the development trajectory for such nanopharmaceuticals even more difficult and complex. Although the different agencies (USFDA, EMA, TGA, MHLW, CDSCO, etc.) have provided guidelines encompassing general perspectives of nanotechnology-based products, most favor a “case-by-case approach” for the products under evaluation and suggest a pathway in alignment with the latitude of “abbreviated studies” (like 505b 2) in the USFDA). Fixed-dose combination (FDC)–based nanoproducts or NanoFDCs are still under noncommercial development, waiting for standards to be established and specific guidelines to be in place. This chapter addresses this pertinent issue and brings forth the probable formulation trajectory for an approved NanoFDC with relevant MA and enormous commercial exploitation from the regulatory landscape perspective. Different aspects of product development such as critical quality attributes, scale-up, and characterization have also been discussed in this chapter. Applicable guidelines, approved product’s dossier, clinical trial, and other databases on FDC and nanoproducts have also been referred."

pub.1042239189,Mitigating the adverse effect of spray drying on the supersaturation generation capability of amorphous nanopharmaceutical powders,"Amorphous nanopharmaceuticals (NP) have emerged as a highly effective bioavailability enhancement formulation strategy of poorly soluble drugs owed to their supersaturation generation capability. Spray drying, which is regularly employed in solid dosage form preparation of amorphous NP, adversely affects the supersaturation generation. The adverse effect is caused by the high crystallization propensity of the spray-dried products resulted from poor disassociation of the spray-dried nanoparticle aggregates. Herein, we developed adjuvant formulations to mitigate the adverse effect of spray drying on the supersaturation generation capability of amorphous NP. Two types of water-soluble adjuvants were investigated, i.e., (1) fast-dissolving mannitol and trehalose and (2) crystallization inhibiting hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). The supersaturation generation was evaluated in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) of the supersaturation versus time plot. The results showed that co-spray drying of amorphous NP with two adjuvant types were mandatory to have a prolonged supersaturation profile, which significantly improved the AUC (≈70% larger) compared to spray drying without adjuvants. Using only one adjuvant type resulted in either stagnant or high yet short-lived supersaturation profiles manifested in less than 20% improvement in the AUC. Furthermore, physically mixing the two adjuvant types (instead of co-spray drying) led to inferior supersaturation generation. Thus, adjuvant formulations targeted only at effective disassociation of the nanoparticle aggregates were ineffective if the improved supersaturation generation rate was not accompanied by crystallization inhibition of both the supersaturated solution and the remaining solid phase."

Various nanoformulations like nanoemulsions, micelles, nanocapsules, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanochelates, liposomes, self-assembled nanoparticles, etc., have been synthesized for the efficient delivery of the nutraceuticals. Nutraceuticals are components of feed and foods which provide nutritional, functional, and therapeutic benefits to the body. Nutraceuticals are proven to enhance human health prevent chronic diseases and even to have therapeutic benefits. The most common and widely used nutraceuticals are omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, carotenoids, polyphenols, and probiotic bacteria. Delivery systems should be appropriately fashioned to save value-added nutraceuticals from undesirable cross-interactions with other chemical ingredients and physical entities like pH, light, temperature, or oxygen during nutraceutical processing, storage, and transport. Polysaccharide-based delivery systems are preferable for nutraceutical applications due to their biocompatible and biodegradable nature and can be easily manipulated to achieve the required properties."

pub.1030199508,Interfacial micellar phase transfer using amphiphilic invertible polymers,Micelles formed from new amphiphilic invertible polymers (AIPs) can sequester hydrophobic molecules in water and transfer their payload to a non-polar phase. The amount of material transferred depends primarily on micellar loading capacity. Increasing the lipophilicity of the AIP composition increases the amount of material transferred. The obtained data indicate that AIPs have the potential to serve as an alternative for administration of polymer-based nanopharmaceuticals. Invertible polymeric micelles can potentially facilitate controlled release of poorly water-soluble agents incorporated within the micellar interior when compared to release by thermodynamically stable conventional (non-invertible) micelles.
pub.1129351005,On-Chip Drug Screening Technologies for Nanopharmaceutical and Nanomedicine Applications,"Conventional drug discovery and screening processes have important drawbacks particularly in preclinical phase which include in vitro drug screening test, namely, 2D cell culture, and in vivo test on animal models. It is known that 2D cell cultures are insufficient to indicate drug response of real tissues and organs. Animal models also mislead about drug response with the same reason, and there are some ethical issues about animal models as well. These drawbacks lead to failure of drug candidate at later phases or after approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since the drug development phases are very costly processes, this failure means time and money consumption to drug companies. More importantly if the drug fails after approval, many patients will be exposed and be affected by its side effects.Recently, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems have been started to be used in drug discovery and development in order to develop more realistic and more predictive models for in vivo tests. Advances in tissue engineering, cell biology, biomaterials, microfabrication, and microfluidic technologies have enabled to mimic the functions of varied tissues and organs on a single chip. Recent developments in microfabrication techniques lead to more precise fabrication of microfluidic chips that provides miniaturization of the conventional process. It also leads to development of cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) platforms that are known as “organ-on-a-chip” systems. Currently, organ-on-a-chip technologies are the most promising experimental platforms to reduce animal tests and to improve the efficiency of preclinical prediction of drugs. Compared to conventional systems, these platforms are used to reduce sample volume. Besides, combination of 3D cell culture with microfluidic platform makes it possible to mimic biochemical and biomechanical microenvironment of real tissues. In other words, more physiologically relevant and realistic models can be created. This potential use of microfluidic systems in drug discovery has created their own market which is estimated to reach $3.6–5.7 billion by 2018, and drug discovery is the second largest market area in microfluidic applications. In this manuscript on-chip drug screening models were reviewed which aim to improve drug discovery and development. On-chip drug screening studies from the nanopharmaceutical point of view were reviewed under the following sections: (1) microfabrication of microfluidics; (2) utilization of microfluidics for drug screening, in particular organ-on-a-chip drug screening technologies; and (3) commercialization, marketing, and challenges of microfluidic drug screening platforms."

This field of study is based on three powerful molecular technologies: nanoscale-structured materials and devices; molecular medicine via genomics, proteomics, and artificially engineered microorganisms; and molecular machine systems. A significant number of applications in nanomedicine are being discovered and used such as Nano-ophthalmology, Nanocardiology, Nanopharmaceuticals, Nanodermatology. Nanopharmaceuticals consist of discovery, development, and delivery of drugs (highly branched polymer). Nano-ophthalmology has been used for a decade to improve the delivery and safety of drugs used for treating disorders of the eye. The areas of Nano-ophthalmology include: ocular drug delivery, topical drug application to the eye, and nanotechnology-based therapeutics for eye diseases. Ophthalmic drug delivery through nanoparticles in contact lenses, DNA nanoparticles for nonviral gene transfer to the eye, nanobiotechnology for regeneration of the optic nerve are some of the common applications of nano-ophthalmology. Nanotechnology plays an integral role in creating materials and structures for tissue regeneration to match the nanoscale structures of biological cells. Tissue engineering can be applied in different parts of the human body (e.g., exosomes for drug-free organ transplants, nanobiotechnology and organ-assisting devices, tissue engineering and cardiology). Nanocomposites, particularly hydroxyapatite and collagen-based composites, have gained much recognition as bone grafts due to their compositional and structural similarity with natural bone. Carbon nanofibers-reinforced polycarbonate urethane composites, nanoscale molecular scaffolding, single-walled carbon nanotubes, artificial joints, and antibacterial implants (silver nanoparticle-modified titanium (Ti-nAg) plates) all have been studied and approved as good applications of bone engineering."

pub.1063229046,"Abstract PR09: Synergistic activity of CRLX101, a nanopharmaceutical in Phase II clinical trials, with antiangiogenic therapies mediated through HIF-1alpha inhibition: A translational research program.","Abstract Background: Antiangiogenic drugs reduce blood flow to tumors and thereby inhibit tumor growth by starving tumors of oxygen and nutrients. However, antiangiogenic drugs have achieved limited success as monotherapies, in part because of their induction of hypoxia and the concomitant up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), now well implicated in the promotion of tumor angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and cancer stem cell formation. We describe here a translational research program to investigate whether the efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs can be improved through combination with CRLX101, a camptothecin (CPT) containing nanopharmaceutical that inhibits both topoisomerase-1 and HIF-1α. Material and methods: We will present preclinical and clinical projects conducted across several major research institutions intended to demonstrate the anti-HIF-1α activity of CRLX101, the capacity of this drug to block the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the formation of cancer stem cells, and the synergistic activity of CRLX101 given in combination with antiangiogenic drugs. We will further describe two ongoing clinical trials evaluating these hypotheses, one at the University of Pennsylvania in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and one at the Massachusetts General Hospital in relapsed ovarian cancer following progression through prior platinum-containing chemotherapy. Results: A single dose of CRLX101 durably inhibits HIF-1α protein levels across multiple tumor types. Evaluation of CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab, aflibercept or pazopanib in the A2780 ovarian xenograft tumor model demonstrates synergistic inhibition of tumor growth inhibition as well as increases in the rate of long-term survivorship. While all three antiangiogenic drugs alone increased HIF-1α protein levels, levels were inhibited in response to combination with CRLX101. In clinical evaluations, a CRLX101-bevacizumab combination appears safe and well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities observed to date. Notable tumor decreases and long periods of progression free survival have been noted among patients treated with CRLX101-based mono and combination therapy. Conclusions: Results generated through this translational research program suggest that CRLX101 can overcome HIF-1α-mediated acquired resistance to antiangiogenic drugs, supporting the use of CRLX101 in combination with antiangiogenic drugs as an exciting new paradigm for the treatment of cancer.

pub.1033054521,8 Advanced nanocarriers for nutraceuticals based on structured lipid and nonlipid components,"There is currently immense interest in the development of food-grade delivery systems such as nanocarriers containing nutraceuticals. Nutraceuticals basically consist of a broad group of food products including antioxidants, dietary supplements, and so forth, which provide an improved lifestyle and prevent diseases. A chief drawback of the nutraceuticals is their limited bioavailability, which can be overcome by the application of nanotechnology, to develop nanocarriers containing these bioactive components. In fact a successful formulation of a new nanonutraceutical product is essential to acquire potential health benefits. Several such novel products are being designed today in different forms. However in such cases a change in the physical and biochemical properties of the nutraceuticals can be expected. Hence a thorough characterization of the synthesized products is essential to evaluate the quality of the compounds at the nanolevel. Nanoscale technologies also help in controlling product stability of these engineered products, which are the demands of today."

<p> The contamination of water bodies and water pollution with pharmaceuticals are global issues receiving increasing attention, stemming from population growth and the resultant rises in pharmaceutical consumption, disposal, and excretion. However, little is known about how emerging classes of pharmaceuticals, in particular nanopharmaceuticals, influence water bodies and organisms living in them. In this work, we investigate the interactions of paclitaxel-loaded nanomedicine with freshwater algae Raphidocelis subcapitata and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . For a given paclitaxel concentration, the nanomedicine form of paclitaxel led to a higher localization of paclitaxel on/in algal cell surfaces and inhibited algal growth more than molecular (free) paclitaxel. In addition, while the molecular paclitaxel at the solubility limit in water could not significantly hinder algal growth to reach an IC <sub>50</sub> level, the nanomedicine form had a 120 h IC <sub>50</sub> value of 1.1 ± 0.1 μg paclitaxel ml <sup>−1</sup> for C. reinhardtii and a 72 h IC <sub>50</sub> value of 1.6 ± 0.1 μg paclitaxel ml <sup>−1</sup> for R. subcapitata . In the case of paclitaxel-loaded nanomedicine, concentrations above 16.2 μg paclitaxel mL <sup>−1</sup> for R. subcapitata and above 5.4 μg paclitaxel mL <sup>−1</sup> for C. reinhardtii resulted in an algaecidal effect, i.e. algal necrosis and complete stoppage of algal growth. The presence of paclitaxel-loaded nanomedicine also hindered the photosynthetic activity while free-paclitaxel caused no significant effect on it. These findings indicate that nanopharmaceuticals can cause ecotoxic effects on freshwater algae, which is otherwise not possible with traditional pharmaceuticals, owing to their ability to solubilize water-insoluble drug molecules in them. </p>"

Breast carcinoma is the most common cancer in women worldwide and the most common cause of deaths associated with malignancies. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is the main molecule binding to CD44 and has proved to be a significant ally in the development of nanotransporters that demonstrate preferential accumulation of tumors and increased cellular uptake. Objective: Carry out a systematic review of the main treatments to reduce or prevent the proliferation of breast cancer. Methods: A total of 59 articles have found and after the selection process 20 articles have included and discussed in this study. PUBMED, EMBASE, OVID, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY databases were searched. Results: cationic liposomes containing the conjugate hyaluronic acid-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (HA-DOPE) mediated good transfection in cell lines that express CD44 in culture. Still, other results suggested that the formulation of lapatinib (LPT) coated with HA increases the activity of LPT against triple-negative breast cancer. In addition, compared to free doxorubicin (DOX), superior in vivo antitumor efficacy of modified carbon spots (HA HA-CD) and (p-CBA-DOX) was observed in heterotopic and orthotopic 4T1 cell tumor models. In addition, hematological and biochemical analysis of blood showed that HA-CD and p-CBA-DOX did not induce noticeable toxicity, which further confirmed the good biocompatibility of HA-CD and p-CBA-DOX. Also, it was found that CD44v expression can negatively influence HA uptake and, instead, when cells expressed mainly CD44s, a positive correlation between expression and uptake was observed. Other findings point to the potential clinical utility of recombinant human proteoglycan 4 (rhPRG4) as a therapeutic treatment for invasive and metastatic breast cancer. Conclusion: The development of nanopharmaceuticals delivery systems are able to control the development of tumors and represent a promising strategy to overcome issues related to the non-specific effects of conventional anticancer therapies."

Owing to the biodiversity of plant biomasses, the actual mechanism by which the plant constituents have contributed to the synthetic process is yet to be fully known. Although the feasibility of controlling, the size and shape of nanoparticles by variation in reaction conditions have been demonstrated in many studies. Conventionally, nanoparticles are synthesized by chemicals and physicochemical methods using several chemicals which later on become accountable for various risk due to their general toxicity, so that solving the objective biological approaches is coming up to fill these gaps.

pub.1165610788,Anaphylactic Reactions Caused by the Covid-19 Vaccine Comirnaty in Anti-PEG Hyperimmune Pigs: Implications for the Safety of mRNA-LNP-based Vaccines and Other PEGylated Nanopharmaceuticals,"Background: mRNA-containing, PEGylated Covid-19 vaccines can cause hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), or rarely, life-threatening anaphylaxis in a small fraction of immunized people. A causal role of anti-PEG antibodies (Abs) has been proposed but not yet proven in a large animal model. Methods: Domestic pigs (n=6) were immunized with 0.1 mg/kg PEGylated liposome (Doxebo) i.v., and the rise of anti-PEG IgG and IgM were measured in serial blood samples with ELISA. During the plateau of seroconversion, in the 1-3 weeks postvaccination period, the animals were injected i.v. with 1/3 human dose of the PEGylated mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty, and the hemodynamic (PAP, SAP, pulse pressure), cardiopulmonary (HR, EtCO2,), hematological (WBC, granulocyte, lymphocyte and platelet counts) parameters and blood immune mediators (anti-PEG IgM and IgG antibodies, thromboxane B2, C3a) were measured as endpoints of anaphylaxis. Results: In about a week, the level of anti-PEG IgM and IgG rose 5-10-thousand-fold in all of 6 pigs immunized with Doxebo, after which time all animals developed anaphylactic shock to i.v. injection of 1/3 human dose of Comirnaty. The reaction, starting within 1 min, involved maximal pulmonary hypertension, decreased systemic pulse amplitude, tachycardia, granulopenia and thrombocytopenia. These physiological changes were paralleled by C3a and TXB2 rises in blood and were absent in non-immunized pigs. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies, these data show a causal role of anti-PEG Abs in the anaphylaxis to Comirnaty. Based on the involvement of C activation and identity of symptoms with those observed in pseudoallergy to PEGylated liposomes, the reaction represents C activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA). The applied sensitization of the porcine CARPA model may help better understand these reactions, and, thus, make Comirnaty and other mRNA-LNP-based Vaccines and PEGylated Nanopharmaceuticals safer."

pub.1063250672,"Abstract 376: CRLX101, a nanopharmaceutical in phase 2 clinical trials, is synergistic with antiangiogenic treatment through HIF-1α inhibition in an ovarian cancer xenograft model.","Abstract Antiangiogenic drugs reduce blood flow to tumors and thereby inhibit tumor growth by starving tumors of oxygen and nutrients. However, antiangiogenic agents have achieved limited success as monotherapies. This may be in part because the reduced blood flow that follows this therapy induces tumor hypoxia and up-regulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), well implicated in the promotion of tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. We investigated whether the efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs could be improved by combining them with an inhibitor of HIF-1α. Previous investigators showed that HIF-1α can be inhibited by camptothecin (CPT). Therefore, we sought to demonstrate that CRLX101, a self-assembling nanopharmaceutical that delivers the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor CPT, is an inhibitor of HIF-1α and that CRLX101 efficacy is synergistic with antiangiogenic treatment. CRLX101 is designed to deliver therapeutically relevant concentrations of CPT to tumors over an extended period of time. We have previously presented data demonstrating dramatic CRLX101-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in 20 different xenograft models and CRLX101 is currently being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials as a monotherapy for NSCLC, ovarian and gastric cancer and in combination with bevacizumab in renal cell carcinoma. First, we demonstrated that CRLX101 is an inhibitor of HIF-1α. A single administration of CRLX101 inhibited HIF-1α protein in 7/8 different xenograft models tested, representing ovarian, lung, renal, colorectal and prostate tumor types. In the HCT-116 colon xenograft tumor, for example, HIF-1α was inhibited up to 90% for at least 7 days. Treatment by CRLX101 also decreased the mRNA of all HIF-1α-regulated genes analyzed, including VEGF, CA9, GLUT-1, GLUT-3 and CD31. Inhibition of these genes occurred only in tumors in which HIF-1α levels were inhibited. Second, combining CRLX101 with bevacizumab (BEV) demonstrated a synergistic effect on tumor growth inhibition and improved survival in the A2780 ovarian xenograft tumor model. Specifically, CRLX101 alone, at a sub-maximal dose of 5 mg/kg, produced 2/10 complete responses (CRs), BEV alone at 5 mg/kg produced 2/10 CRs and the combination of the two resulted in 6/9 CRs. BEV alone increased HIF-1α protein, consistent with BEV-induced hypoxia, whereas CRLX101 alone inhibited HIF-1α protein. When the two drugs were combined, inhibition of HIF-1α was significantly greater than CRLX101 monotherapy. The synergistic activity of CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab suggests that CRLX101 may be able to overcome HIF-mediated acquired resistance to antiangiogenic drugs through inhibition of HIF-1α, in addition to its topoisomerase 1 inhibition. These findings support the use of CRLX101 in combination with antiangiogenic drugs as an exciting new paradigm for the treatment of cancer.

pub.1063259190,Abstract CT340: Phase 1b/2a study of the nanopharmaceutical CRLX101 with bevacizumab (bev) in the treatment of patients (pts) with refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC): results from the planned interim analysis,"Abstract
                  Introduction: The inactivation of VHL occurs in most clear cell RCC (ccRCC) tumors and gives rise to the HIF hypoxia response program and to tumor angiogenesis. While antiangiogenic therapies are active in ccRCC, resistance develops in all pts. We hypothesize that dual inhibition strategies will be useful in overcoming resistance. CRLX101 (Cerulean Pharma, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), a novel tumor-targeted nanopharmaceutical platform containing camptothecin as its payload, has been shown in pre-clinical models to target HIF and is synergistic with bevacizumab (bev). We combined CRLX101 with bev in refractory mRCC in order to determine the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination, and to determine its preliminary therapeutic activity in this setting. Experimental Procedures: Pts with mRCC of all histologic subtypes refractory to conventional antiangiogenic therapies were treated every 2 weeks with bev 10 mg/kg and escalating doses of CRLX101 (12 mg/m2, 15 mg/m2) in a standard 3+3 design with an expansion at the RP2D. Pts were treated until progression, death, or prohibitive toxicity. Adverse events were classified (CTCAE v 4.0), and radiographic results were assessed (RECIST v 1.1). Results Summary: 10 pts were enrolled on study with histologies of the following distribution - 6 clear cell, 2 papillary, 2 chromophobe. Pts had a median of 2 prior therapies. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. CRLX101 at its single-agent RP2D (15 mg/m2) was safely combined with standard bev. Two (2) episodes of grade 3 non-infectious cystitis and 1 episode of grade 3 hypertension were observed. All other toxicities were grade 1 or 2. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 7.6 months. One third of evaluable pts (33%) achieved a confirmed partial response (PR) including 1 patient with papillary mRCC; 4 pts (44%) had stable disease, and 2 had progressive disease as their best overall response. Prior therapies in the 3 PRs included sunitinib (all) and everolimus (all). PFS results from the stage 1 cohort exceeded the pre-specified threshold and have triggered 2nd stage accrual. Conclusions: CRLX101 can be safely combined with standard doses of bev in pts with refractory mRCC at a RP2D of 15 mg/m2 q2w of CRLX101. Preliminary outcomes to date are superior to historical controls in refractory ccRCC and suggest potential for clinical benefit across histologic subtypes of mRCC.

Water-soluble fullerene derivatives are of particular interest due to their ability to regulate intracellular metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by direct oxidation or effects on oxidative and signaling enzymes. Here, we studied the effect of a water-soluble chlorine-containing derivative of C60 fullerene on human embryonic lung fibroblasts. MTT tests, intracellular ROS visualization, detection of the ROS-associated gene and protein expression, repair, cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation, and quantitation of oxidative DNA damage were used. Within the first three hours after exposure, antioxidant effects were revealed. Later, oxidative damage appeared. Thus, the studied compound had an ambiguous effect on ROS metabolism associated with a switch in the regulatory effect, which must be taken into account when assessing its biological activity and toxicity."

pub.1129336077,Exploration of Nanonutraceuticals in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Longer life span has led to rise of debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, primarily Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease; thereby posing a remarkable socioeconomical burden. These diseases involve complex multifactorial neurodegenerative events leading to cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Chronic neuroinflammation, free radical generation, and the oxidative stress are the foremost propeller for neurodegeneration. Food-based nutraceuticals have recently gained global importance owing to their multifaceted effects and better tolerance. These food-based approaches target multiple pathways in a slow but more physiological manner without causing severe adverse effects and therefore, are favorable for long-term consumption. The nutraceuticals exert their neuroprotective action via diverse mechanisms, namely, free radical scavenging, chelation of transition metals, improvement in antioxidant reserve, and anti-inflammatory effects. 174Nutraceuticals also regulate several signaling pathways that play a vital role in the cell survival and stress response, thereby improving overall neuronal health. However, metabolism, poor solubility and bioavailability and inadequate blood–brain permeability, limit the efficiency of nutraceuticals in exerting neuroprotective action. Nanointerventions are therefore employed to overcome these limitations and improve therapeutic response. This chapter will provide an insight into the application of nutraceuticals in maintaining neurophysiology along with various scientific nanotechno-logical interventions to improve neuroprotective efficacy of nutraceuticals."

Nutraceuticals containing plant-derived compounds have excellent benefits on human health but suffer less patient compliance due to some physical and chemical problems, including water solubility issues, stability and poor absorption inside the human body. Some of them are photosensitive, undergo chemical modifications and are easily attacked by oxygen, making them vulnerable to prolonged and safe use for humans. Therefore, nanotechnology can be a pivotal tool that can address all of these issues and will make Nutraceuticals patient-driven to take on a major portion of the disease with safety. Effective nanonutraceuticals delivery must contain different parameters that need to be assessed and checked prior to delivery, as there are some contradictory opinions from some researchers about the exact mechanism for nanotechnology-based systems and the risk of toxicity evoked by them.

pub.1136279101,Practicality Assessment of a Frugal Nanoparticle Generator: Opening Doors to Nano Pharmaceuticals for the Researchers and Students of Underprivileged Academic Institutions,"
                    Background:
                    Probe sonication and High-speed homogenizer are comparatively costly equipment to fabricate the nanoparticles. Many academic and research institutions cannot afford the procurement and maintenance of such sophisticated equipment. In the present work, a newer idea is conceptualized, which can be adopted by the underprivileged research institutions to fabricate solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) in the absence of sophisticated equipment. The current work describes the pilot-level trials of this novel approach. This study represents the preliminary proof-of-concept trials for which the Indian patent application (3508/MUM/2015) is filed.
                  
                  
                    Method:
                    A frugal piece of equipment was made using a 50 ml centrifuge tube with conical bottom and a piezoelectric mist maker or humidifier. SLNs were prepared by combining the quasi-emulsion solvent evaporation approach and ultrasonic vibration approach. A quasi-emulsion was composed by the dropwise mixing of the organic solvent containing drug & lipid with an aqueous solution containing surfactant under continuous ultrasonic vibration in the piezoelectric chamber. The size of the droplets was significantly reduced due to piezoelectric ultrasonic vibration. Under the provision of mild vacuum and heat generated by vibration, the organic solvent was evaporated, which leaves behind a suspension of SLN. In the present work, albendazole was selected as a model drug. Various trials with Compritol 888 ATO® and Precirol ATO 5® as a lipid carrier and Tween 80 and Poloxamer 188 as a surfactant were performed. Zeta potential of SLNs was improved by the addition of polyelectrolytes like K2SO4 and Na4P2O7.
                  
                  
                    Result and Conclusion:
                    The ratio of drug to lipid was optimized to 1:4 for the most favorable results. SLN with a minimum Z-average diameter of 98.59 nm, -21 mV zeta potential, and 34.064 % (SD 10.78, n=9) entrapment efficiency were developed using the Precirol ATO 5 ® as a lipid carrier. The proof of concept for this novel approach is established through the development of Albendazole SLNs. This approach must also be evaluated for the development of polymeric nanoparticles and vesicular formulations. The further sophistication of the frugal equipment may allow more control over the quality of SLN. This approach will enable underprivileged researchers to prepare Nanopharmaceuticals. Researchers and students of such institutions can focus on the application of SLN by resolving the constraint of sophisticated equipment with this novel approach. This novel approach should also be tried for polymeric and vesicular nanopharmaceuticals.

Most of these surfactants in use are synthetic or semi‐synthetic having toxic and hazardous effects thus created the demand for safe sustainable plant‐based natural surfactants. Saponins, triterpenoid glycosides, possess the characteristics of a typical surfactant by bearing both lipophilic (aliphatic terpenoids unit) and hydrophilic (attached sugars) moieties to stabilize an emulsion. Bearing surfactant like properties, saponins act at the interface of two immiscible phases to reduce surface tension resulting in a uniformly dispersed homogenous system. The current chapter highlights the recent advancement/development of saponins stabilized micro, nanoemulsion, and future application in drug delivery."

pub.1130380014,Ethics and Naeopharmacy: Value Sensitive Design of New Drugs,"Although applications are being developed and have reached the market, nanopharmacy to date is generally still conceived as an emerging technology. Its concept is ill-defined. Nanopharmacy can also be construed as a converging technology, which combines features of multiple technologies, ranging from nanotechnology to medicine and ICT. It is still debated whether its features give rise to new ethical issues or that issues associated with nanopharma are merely an extension of existing issues in the underlying fields. We argue here that, regardless of the alleged newness of the ethical issues involved, developments occasioned by technological advances affect the roles played by stakeholders in the field of nanopharmacy to such an extent that this calls for a different approach to responsible innovation in this field. Specific features associated with nanopharmacy itself and features introduced to the associated converging technologies- bring about a shift in the roles of stakeholders that call for a different approach to responsibility. We suggest that Value Sensitive Design is a suitable framework to involve stakeholders in addressing moral issues responsibly at an early stage of development of new nanopharmaceuticals."

pub.1033009720,Chapter 6 Nanotechnology from particle size reduction to enhancing aqueous solubility,"The solubility of a substance greatly influences its ability to penetrate biological membranes and give the desired action. The presence of the solid particles in the nanorange influences the solubility because as a particle becomes smaller, the surface area to volume ratio increases. This chapter highlights the correlation between a drug’s aqueous solubility and its particle size. The production of drug particles in nanoscale for enhancing drug aqueous solubility, dissolution rate, as well as bioavailability, is also discussed. In addition, some enhancing solubility processes that are commonly used for the production of nanoparticles are also explained including: wet milling, high-pressure homogenization, emulsification technology, precipitation with an antisolvent-compressed fluid, fast expansion from a solution liquefied gas, liquid by spray freezing, and evaporative precipitation into aqueous solution. The application of nanotechnology as a solubility-enhancing technique in the development of pharmaceutical formulations is also surveyed. Moreover, the stability aspects of nanotechnology and relationship to solubility are illustrated. Furthermore, some selected nanopharmaceutical products currently on the market and their benefits are demonstrated."
pub.1129355481,An Overview on Ionic Liquids: A New Frontier for Nanopharmaceuticals,"Background: The pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries are constantly trying to develop new and more efficient delivery systems, as well as new functional ingredients, to overcome drawbacks, such as poor drug solubility, loading and release, as well as reduced stability. These challenges, namely, low drug solubility in water, usually lead to an insufficient systemic exposure and, consequently, low drug bioavailability.Several applications of ionic liquids have been widely studied due to their valuable physicochemical properties. In consequence of this broad applicability, ionic liquids have recently been studied in the pharmaceutical field, particularly as functional excipients to improve the efficiency of drug delivery systems. Despite the potential utility of ionic liquids in drug delivery, concerns about their toxicity have been raised, since some of these salts are more toxic than certain organic solvents. Hence, studies concerning the safety of ionic liquids are fundamental.Nanoparticles have also been studied to improve the efficiency of drug delivery. The main interest in nanosystems is due to the many advantages these systems may confer, particularly in terms of drug safety and efficiency.In consequence of the valuable characteristics that both ionic liquids and nanoparticles hold, there has been an emergent interest in the synergetic effects arising from the combination of ionic liquids and nanoparticles. This approach may be key to develop more stable systems, with improved performance. However, for the preparation of these ionic liquid–nanoparticle systems, environmentally friendly procedures need to be developed, and the toxicity of the prepared systems needs to be carefully assessed.Major advances: Herein, we reviewed the main characteristics and applicabilities of ionic liquids, as well as the impact of the synthesis and use of these salts on humans and the environment. Moreover, we also discuss recent developments in the use of ionic liquids in drug delivery. Finally, the prospective combination of ionic liquids and nanosystems towards drug delivery is also explored. In this matter, several studies are presented, showing that the combination of ionic liquids with nanoparticles to produce more efficient delivery systems has great potential. It is shown that ionic liquids improve the chemical and thermal stability of the particles and may change their size and morphology. Finally, some concerns about the combination of ionic liquids with nanoparticles, such as regulation gaps and the research needed for the widespread application of these combined systems in pharmaceuticals, are also addressed."

As reactive oxygen species homeostasis plays a vital role in cells, the study of their effect on genes involved in oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory response is of particular importance. Methods: Human fetal lung fibroblasts were incubated with aqueous dispersions of C60, C70, and Gd@C82 in concentrations of 5 nM and 1.5 µM for 1, 3, 24, and 72 hours. Cell viability, intracellular ROS, NOX4, NFκB, PRAR-γ, NRF2, heme oxygenase 1, and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 expression have been studied. Results & conclusion: The aqueous dispersions of C60, C70, and Gd@C82 fullerenes are active participants in ROS homeostasis. Low and high concentrations of AFDs have similar effects. C70 was the most inert substance, C60 was the most active substance. All AFDs have both a “prooxidant” and “antioxidant” effect, but with a different balance. Gd@C82 was a substance with more pronounced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, while C70 had more pronounced “prooxidant” properties."
pub.1063228057,Abstract C38: CRLX101 shows significant tumor penetration and superior activity compared to first- and second-line agents in NSCLC xenograft tumor models.,"Abstract Introduction: CRLX101 is a tumor-targeted nanopharmaceutical designed to localize and accumulate in tumors. A randomized Phase 2 study is ongoing evaluating safety and efficacy of CRLX101 as a second- and third-line single agent therapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CRLX101 has previously demonstrated broad spectrum anti-tumor activity in xenograft tumor models of lung, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, breast and lymphoma. Here we present efficacy data of CRLX101 in NSCLC tumor models representative of clinical subgroups with limited therapeutic options, including squamous cell, and KRAS and EGFR mutants. Additionally, we present microscopy data illustrating that CRLX101 penetrates tumor tissues and is taken up by cancer cells. Experimental procedures: CRLX101 is composed of camptothecin, a highly potent topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, conjugated to a cyclodextrin-poly(ethylene glycol) co-polymer and self-assembles into nanoparticles of 20–50 nm in diameter. For in vivo efficacy, tumor-bearing mice were administered either CRLX101 or a comparator at their respective maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and schedule, and tumor growth inhibition and survival were measured. For tumor localization studies, xenograft tumors were excised and CRLX101 was visualized with standard staining methods. Summary of data: In H1299 NSCLC model, CRLX101 showed superior activity over approved 1st and 2nd line agents resulting in 100% (10/10) cures. Gemcitabine and topotecan achieved 50% (5/10) or 10% (1/10) cures, respectively; and no cure (0/10) was observed with docetaxel, erlotinib or pemetrexed. In H520 squamous-type NSCLC model, CRLX101 showed a greater median survival and tumor growth delay than carboplatin, docetaxel or gemcitabine. Finally, CRLX101 showed significant tumor growth delay activity and survival improvements in G12C and G12S KRAS mutation models (H2122 and A549 respectively) and in a T790M EGFR mutation model (H1975). BrdU staining of tumor sections from H1299 NSCLC xenografts treated with CRLX101 demonstrated that the nanoparticle penetrated deep and uniformly in the tumor tissues and inhibited cell proliferation. Conclusions: CRLX101 is a novel nanopharmaceutical that has shown encouraging activity in advanced NSCLC patients in a Phase 1/2b clinical trial. Our preclinical data suggests that CRLX101 may be efficacious in patient population harboring mutations and drug resistance that render them refractory to currently approved agents. Our imaging data further support that CRLX101 can potentially achieve superior anti-tumor activity by localizing and penetrating deep into tumor tissues and releasing camptothecin inside tumor cells. In sum, our pre-clinical and clinical data together support that CRLX101 is potentially a versatile therapeutic option for the management of advanced NSCLC patients.

pub.1155075919,Research on the Targeted Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Nanographene Drug Delivery System,"In order to find an effective cure for squamous cell carcinoma, we innovatively used nano-graphene oxide as a pharmaceutical delivery system, overcoming resistance to cisplatin-targeted anti-squamous carcinoma. For this purpose, we prepared a nano-graphene oxide using an oxidation method, functionally modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) and loaded with the antitumor drug cisplatin (CDDP), a compound with preliminary anticancer efficacy. Then, anti-human squamous cell carcinoma monoclonal antibody was combined to construct a target graphene nanopharmaceutical system. The administration system was applied to nude mice carrying human squamous cell carcinoma. Through the detection of frozen tissue slices, the anti-squamous cell carcinoma effect and targeting of the graphene nanoloaded system were analyzed. The safety of the pharmaceutical system was confirmed through further experiments. Results showed that the NGO-PEG-BPEI-CDDP-Antibody complex had a significant antitumor effect and was able to enter the nude mice and targeted squamous cell carcinoma cell and effectively kill squamous cell carcinoma cells, thus reducing the use of clinical chemotherapeutic drugs, improving the efficacy and providing a new answer for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma."
pub.1147964607,Nanotechnology: An approach to overcome bioavailability challenges of nutraceuticals,"Nutraceuticals are food varieties and food constituents that give medicinal advantages along with nourishment. Most organic compounds such as tannins, and flavonoids are easily soluble in water but face difficulty in absorption, as they cannot pass the cell's lipid film, have an abnormally large magnitude that results in bioavailability and adequacy loss. Nanotechnology provides opportunities in all sectors of scientific investigation including health. Nutraceuticals address a quickly developing/emerging field in nano-research. In this study, extensive literature search was carried out on application of nanotechnology to overcome the bioavailability issues related to nutraceuticals in various scientific databases and compiled. The exclusive properties of nanoparticles such as their small size and high surface/volume ratio make it a best approach in the health sector. Nutraceuticals can be combined with nanotechnology because nanostructured frameworks may have the ability of enhancing the effectiveness of plant extracted product, reduce required quantity, reduce the adverse effects, as well as increase biological action. Nanoliposomes, nano-emulsions, lipid nanocarriers, micelles, and polylactide co-glycolide nanoparticles are some of the most common biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles. The quick development of nutraceutical and nanoscience has immense impact on diverse fields of science like medicine and food sector. In this review article, we constrain to elaborate nanonutraceuticals with enhanced bioavailability, solubility, stability improved encapsulation, sustained and targeted delivery with improved therapeutic activity, characterization, safety studies, regulatory issues and their applications in health sector as well."
pub.1039842180,- Implantable Infusion Pumps Incorporating Nanotechnology,"Advancements in drug discovery and development have led to novel nanoparticles incorporating biologics, biosimilars, and small molecules. Some of these nanoparticles require special dosing schemes (constant, pulsatile, or metronomic) to maintain sufcient therapeutic concentration for the required drug residence time to achieve optimal drug effectiveness. Certain nanopharmaceuticals cannot be administered orally since they are often digested before they can reach their target site. Others cannot be applied topically because drug size, charge, and chemistry hinder skin penetration at a rate sufcient to enable any therapeutic effect for deeper tissue targets. For these and other agents, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a formidable defensive barrier that prevents entry into targeted neural tissue. Delivery of nanomedicines directly to the targeted treatment site at the desired therapeutic concentration can overcome these physical, anatomic, and chemical obstacles regarding targeted drug delivery. Implantable drug delivery technologies have steadily advanced, so they can be used clinically to restrict drug delivery to the infused tissue, thereby avoiding systemic drug side effects. This chapter focuses on microtechnologies and nanotechnologies that enable implantable infusion pumps with advanced drug administration capabilities to treat chronic conditions for which localized drug infusion is required."

Capuli) cherry extract was used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the presence of white/visible solar and blue light-emitting diode (LED) light. For the characterization of the extract and the AgNPs, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy were employed, along with hydrodynamic particle size analysis, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The Ag nanospheres obtained using white light were 40–100nm in diameter and exhibited an absorption peak at λmax=445nm, whereas those obtained using blue LED light were 20–80nm in diameter with an absorption peak at λmax=425nm. Thermal analysis revealed that the content of biomolecules surrounding the AgNPs was about 55–65%, and it was also found that blue LED light AgNPs (56.28%, 0.05mM) had a higher antioxidant efficacy than the white solar light AgNPs (33.42%, 0.05mM) against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl. The results indicate that obtaining AgNPs using a blue LED light may prove to be a simple, cost-effective and easily reproducible method for creating future nanopharmaceuticals."
pub.1163035996,Simulation of nanocarrier-based targeted delivery of an antidepressant for major depressive disorder,"Although Depression or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) affects nearly 15% of the adult population, yet, common antidepressants that work through the monoamine hypothesis of depression are not effective against all types of MDD. The other hypothesis, blocking N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDAR) with antagonists to promote antidepressant effects, is not very useful because of the adverse side effects of the NMDA antagonists. In this study, we have proposed a method involving the specific drug delivery of an antidepressant, using nanocarriers. The introduction of nanocarrier encapsulated potent NMDAR antagonist, R-ketamine, in the target neuronal environments of varying membrane potentials of the central nervous system was studied using in-silico coarse grain simulation of hollow spherical polypyrrole nanocarriers or increasing size. The membrane potential ruptures the nanocarrier and releases the drug R-ketamine, which has a high-binding affinity for NMDAR. Such coarse grain simulations are an interesting and emerging field of study and shed preliminary light on the theoretical behaviour of nanopharmaceuticals in vivo. The results of these in silico findings need to be validated with in vivo experimentation to develop an improved antidepressant delivery nanoformulation."
pub.1147719520,Nanonutraceuticals — Challenges and Novel Nano-based Carriers for Effective Delivery and Enhanced Bioavailability,"Nutraceuticals, the active compounds found abundant in most of the natural products, have shown beneficial effects on human health. Their absorption when consumed is limited owing to their poor solubility and unsuitable chemical and physical properties. In order to empower the beneficial properties and enhance the efficacy of nutraceuticals, nanotechnological approaches have ventured in as a frontier to improve the bioavailability. An updated overview on this area is the need of the hour to explore the importance of nanocarriers in delivering the nutraceuticals more effectively. This overview initially started with the introduction of nutraceuticals their importance, limitations and challenges encountered during their absorption. Traditional route of delivering nutraceuticals and limitations have been described. Different types of nano-based systems for effectively delivering the nutraceuticals at the targeted site have also been highlighted. Finally, some of the novel nano-based carrier systems used in effectively encapsulating the nutraceuticals both at in vitro and in vivo animal models have also been critically reviewed with additional data toward their synthesis and other characteristics. From the overview, it was clear that the nutraceuticals with potential health benefits could not be absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract owing to their bioavailability and stability. Nano-based delivery systems such as niosomes, nanogels, nanocapsules etc. showed effective loading of these labile nutraceuticals protecting them from various pH conditions thereby delivering them at the targeted site. Further, the nanocarriers were found effective in delivering the anticancer bioactives at the damaged site leaving the surrounding environment unaffected. Finally, the limitations pertaining to toxicity need to be addressed by framing effective guidelines and policies prior to human and animal use."
pub.1125302984,Nanomaterials for Skin Delivery of Cosmeceuticals and Pharmaceuticals,"Skin aging is described as dermatologic changes either naturally occurring over the course of years or as the result of the exposure to environmental factors (e.g., chemical products, pollution, infrared and ultraviolet radiations). The production of collagen and elastin, the main structural proteins responsible for skin strength and elasticity, is reduced during aging, while their role in skin rejuvenation can trigger a wrinkle reversing effect. Elasticity loss, wrinkles, dry skin, and thinning are some of the signs that can be associated with skin aging. To overcome skin aging, many strategies using natural and synthetic ingredients are being developed aiming to reduce the signs of aging and/or to treat age-related skin problems (e.g., spots, hyper- or hypopigmentation). Among the different approaches in tissue regeneration, the use of nanomaterials loaded with cosmeceuticals (e.g., phytochemicals, vitamins, hyaluronic acid, and growth factors) has become an interesting alternative. Based on their bioactivities and using different nanoformulations as efficient delivery systems, several cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical products are now available on the market aiming to mitigate the signs of aged skin.

The aim of this study was to determine the toxicity effect of snakehead fish powder (SFP), formulate it into liposome and in vitro study using sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells. Methods: Dried powder of snakehead fish was made using the atomizer then made a test solution which was divided into 7 treatment groups in different concentrations. They were exposed to zebrafish embryos then observed for 72 h post fertilization (hpf). After acquiring the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and lethal concentration (LC50) of SFP, these concentrations were used to formulate SFP into liposome by extrusion method. SFP-liposomes were characterized and stable tested. Afterwards, SFP-liposomes were evaluated in vitro using sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells. Results: The maximum allowed toxicant concentration of SFP was 0.0543 mg/mL meaning slight toxic symptoms, IC50 = 0.0945 mg/mL showing the growth inhibition of zebrafish embryos, and LC50 = 0.1549 mg/mL meaning very toxic category that has killed zebrafish embryos. The characterization results showed that size of SFP-liposome were 121 nm ± 0.29, polydispersity index 0.06 ± 0.02, zeta-potential -10.15 mV ± 0.36 and % entrapment efficiency (EE) 85.75% ± 2.24. Six weeks of stability study showed that size profile was stable at 25°C and 37°C. Moreover, SFP-liposomes inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation when evaluated with 4T1 and MDA-MB231-sensitive and resistant cells. Conclusion: SFP has bioactive compounds based on toxicity effect and can be formulated into liposome as a promising nanonutraceutical formulation."
pub.1167317090,Challenges in Stability and Safety Evaluation of Nutraceutical and Nanonutraceutical Formulations,"The global prevalence of nutraceuticals is noticeably high with a large market share but minimal regulation compared to traditional drugs. The global market is flooded with nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals claiming to be of natural origin and sold with a therapeutic claim. In contrast to drugs, which are usually well-defined chemical entities, botanicals are complex ingredients containing multiple chemical components, and often several classes of compounds are present in a single product. Many of these compounds are unstable to heat, light, oxygen, alkaline pH, and elevated humidity. Thus, successful development of nutraceuticals requires knowledge of the fundamental aspects of the physical and chemical properties of the various forms of the ingredients, the use of adequate techniques of manufacturing, selection of the right excipients, and the addition of suitable manufacturing overages based upon critical stability studies. In the recent past, a deluge of interest has developed in the field of nutraceuticals as an alternative source of health. Nanoscale delivery systems have numerous potential applications in the food industry for encapsulating, protecting, and releasing bioactive agents, such as nutraceuticals and vitamins. Nutrients in the form of small solids or droplets improve bioavailability. However, a number of challenges are associated with the enhancement of these dietary supplements from concept to commercialization. The greatest hurdles experienced are the limited shelf life, proper delivery to the targeted sites, and most importantly, ascertaining the overall safety of the nutraceuticals on consumption.

Understanding the involvement of multifactorial components, neuroinflammation coupled with oxidative stress and enhanced acetylcholinesterase activity, in the disease pathogenesis is a step toward alternative drug development therapy. Inadequacy of the currently available treatments to provide a complete cure, as a result of complex events involved in AD, calls for exploration of novel drug delivery agents. Utility of nutraceuticals-based drug delivery for AD has long been realized, but their compromised physicochemical properties (poor solubility, permeability, and unstable nature) prevent their clinical translations. In lieu of this, nanotailored formulations are sought after for their enhanced permeability and targetability across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). This chapter unveils the scope of nanonutraceuticals as potentially vital therapeutics in AD.

Understanding the involvement of multifactorial components, neuroinflammation coupled with oxidative stress and enhanced acetylcholinesterase activity, in the disease pathogenesis is a step toward alternative drug development therapy. AD is the most common cause of dementia, which affects approximately 18 million cases, and thus displays a dramatic epidemic owing to the phenomenal immense growth of the aged population around the world. The pathogenesis of AD is a complex linkage of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, amplified cholesterol levels, and modulation in acetylcholinesterase activity. Advances in nanotechnology have provided excellent opportunities for management of AD. Role of phytochemicals of nutraceutical significance in AD is well-supported with definitive evidence."

Indeed, we have developed biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone), exposing on the surface both folate motifs (Fol) for recognition in cells overexpressing Folate Receptor- a (FRa) and the anti-angiogenic hexapeptide aFLT1. The presence of Fol on NPs did not impair the anti-angiogenic activity of aFLT1, as assessed by in vitro tube formation assay in HUVEC endothelial cells. In both 2D and 3D KB cell cultures in vitro , the cytotoxicity of DTX loaded in NPs was not significantly affected by Fol/aFLT1 double decoration as compared to free DTX. Remarkably, NPs distributed differently in 3D multicellular spheroids of FRa-positive KB cancer cells depending on the type of ligand displayed on the surface. When tested in vivo in zebrafish embryos xenografted with KB cells, NPs displaying Fol/aFLT1 reduced DTX systemic toxicity and inhibited in a synergistic way the growth of the tumor mass and associated vasculature. Overall, nanotechnology offers excellent ground for combining therapeutic concepts in cancer, paving the way to the development of novel multifunctional nanopharmaceuticals where surface decoration with bioactive elements can significantly improve therapeutic outcomes."
pub.1170272725,Breaking the barriers in management of Alzheimer's disease through cationic nanoformulation: A review,"Neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to cognitive and behavioral decline. The current crop of FDA-approved treatments for AD can only reduce symptoms and postpone the disease's progression by facilitating communication between neurons in brain of AD patient. Any potential treatment for Alzheimer's should reduce inflammation, prevent acetylcholine hydrolysis, and act as an antioxidant. Traditional treatments, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, frequently fall short of their intended effects due to solubility, bioavailability, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) bridging. Therapy failure is frequently caused due to inadequate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of commonly used medications. Systemic delivery to the central nervous system using cationic nanosized carriers is a promising area of research. Adsorption-mediated translocation refers to their ability to interrelate electrostatically with cell membranes that are negatively charged and cross the BBB through endocytosis or adsorption-mediated transcytosis. Cationic nanopharmaceuticals (CNPs) showed potential for treating AD in-vivo following systemic administration. Adsorption-mediated transcytosis across the BBB can be easily facilitated by cationic lipids, increasing mucoadhesion in the nasal cavity by enhancing electrostatic interactions with mucus. Nano-cationic formulations' dimensions, elasticity, hydrophobicity, surface charge, chemistry, and morphology significantly impact their in-vivo journey. In this review the current state of cationic nanoformulation for targeting AD and promising future directions for this approach have been briefly discussed with dricption that fill the gap in knowledge."
pub.1166981345,Light-activation of molecular motors in polymersomes,"Light-activated molecular motors rotate at a similar frequency in polymersomes and in solution.
 Light-activated synthetic organic molecular motors are emerging as an excellent prospect to actuate supramolecular assemblies such as polymersomes with spatiotemporal precision. The influence on these materials depends on the motor's frequency of rotation and concentration. Therefore, we determined the rotation frequency of a motor in a poly(dimethyl siloxane)- b -poly(ethylene glycol) (PDMS 13 - b -PEG 13 ) polymersome and compared it to the frequency observed in different organic solvents. Using UV-vis spectrophotometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we measured the rate of the thermal helix inversion step, which is the rate-determining step of the rotary cycle, and obtained the activation parameters. We found that the investigated motor's frequency of rotation did not significantly change in the polymersomes and remains at around 1 mHz. Moreover, dynamic light scattering results indicate that the rotation of the motors does not cause a significant change in the structure of this type of polymersome when used at a diblock copolymer : motor molar ratio of up to 100 : 2. Our findings provide a first insight into the effect of the polymersome on the motor's frequency of rotation and vice versa . Enhancing the polymersome composition with motors can lead to novel concepts, including light-activated nanopharmaceuticals, nanoreactors, and biomimetic artificial organelles and cells. "

In this study, we prepared donepezil drug-loaded nanoparticles (DZP) with cholesterol-modified pullulan (CHP) as the nanocarrier (DZP-CHP) and surface modified the drug-loaded nanoparticles to improve the water solubility of donepezil while enhancing its targeting and sustained release. We determined the drug loading and encapsulation efficiency of DZP-CHP nanoparticles at different feed ratios. The mean ± SD drug loading and entrapment efficiency were high: 13.52 ± 2.03 and 86.54 ± 1.31. On dynamic light-scattering measurement, mean ± SD particle size was 260.7 ± 1.76 nm, polydispersity index 0.123 ± 0.004, and zeta potential −5.75 ± 0.64 mV. DZP-CHP nanoparticles prepared with the optimal feed ratio (DZP : CHP = 1 : 5) were coated with polysorbate 80, and the adsorption process was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. We found good affinity between polysorbate 80 and DZP-CHP, with mean ± SD coverage 2.7 ± 0.372. The mean ± SD drug loading and entrapment efficiency of polysorbate 80-emulsified DZP-CHP nanoparticles were 8.25 ± 1.80 and 91.28 ± 4.57, respectively, and the proportion of drug released by 72 h was 42.71%. Compared to DZP-CHP alone, PS-DZP-CHP can enhance the release of donepezil."
pub.1172143466,Synthesis and characterization of new rotaxanes from related crown compounds,"Physical manipulation can be carried out on molecules and cells through the utilization of nanomachines which are machines with nano dimensions. There are different types of nanomachines. Among them, rotaxanes stand out as the most well-known. The term of rotaxane originates from the combination of the Latin words wheel and axis. The application of nanomachines is identifying and measuring the concentration of toxic substances in the environment, targeted drug delivery and cancer diagnosis. The objective of this study is to synthesize and identify several new nanomachines in the form of rotaxanes (internally locked molecules) with nanopharmaceutical properties from the corresponding crown compounds.

Bisphenol compound (1) was converted into methyl diester compound (2) in reaction with methyl chloroacetate. The methyl diester compound (2) reacts with the appropriate diamine to form the diamide macrocycle compound (3). Rod (4) is prepared from the reaction of diethylene glycol ditosylate, 4,4-bipyridine and a bulk phenol such as 4-tert-butylphenol in DMF. Each of the rings in the presence of the prepared rod leads to the corresponding rotaxane compound (5). Chemical structure of the obtained compounds were established by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, FT-IR and SEM spectroscopic methods."
pub.1181905418,Current Nanotechnological Strategies for Delivery of Anti-Retroviral Drugs: Overview and Future Prospects," Abstract: Globally, over forty million people are living with Human Immunodeficiency Viral (HIV) infections. Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) consists of two or three Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and has been used for more than a decade to prolong the life of AIDS-diagnosed patients. The persistent use of HAART is essential for effectively suppressing HIV replication. Frequent use of multiple medications at relatively high dosages is a major reason for patient noncompliance and an obstacle to achieving efficient pharmacological treatment. Despite strict compliance with the HAART regimen, the eradication of HIV from the host remains unattainable. Anatomical and Intracellular viral reservoirs are responsible for persistent infection. Elimination of the virus from these reservoirs is critical for successful long-term therapy. Therefore, innovative approaches are required to design safe and effective therapies. Nanotechnology has revolutionized HIV drug delivery by addressing key challenges, including improving drug solubility, targeting specific cells, extending drug release, protecting drugs from degradation, overcoming biological barriers, enabling combination therapy, and enhancing vaccine delivery. Several nanocarrier systems, such as dendrimers, nanoemulsions, liposomes, solid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers, have been proposed to treat HIV infection. Additionally, nanosuspensions of antiretroviral drugs offer promising strategies for improving treatment outcomes. While these advancements have significantly improved HIV management strategies, challenges remain, including unexpected toxicity, avoiding harmful biological interactions, and costs associated with the large-scale production of nanopharmaceuticals.

MDA-MB-231 cell was cultured and DJ-1 and PTEN mRNA level was detected by qRT-PCR along with analysis of cell viability by CCK-8 and apoptosis by means of flow cytometry. The rats were assigned into control group, nuclear-targeted pshHIF-1 α nanopharmaceutical system treatment group, and nuclear-targeted pshHIF-1 α nano-pharmaceutical system+PTEN inhibitor SF1670 group, followed by analysis of cell proliferation by EdU staining, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry, and the levels of DJ-1, PTEN, and p-AKT. Compared with MDA-MB-231 cells treated with NPNCS, cells without intervention showed decreased PTEN and increased DJ-1 level. NPNCS induced cell apoptosis. Administration of nuclear-targeted pshHIF-1 α nano-drug delivery system down-regulated DJ-1 and up-regulated PTEN. Combined treatment with SF1670 promoted p-AKT level and decreased the inhibitory effect of NPNCS on p-AKT level. In conclusion, the nuclear-targeted pshHIF-1 α nano-drug delivery system down-regulated DJ-1 and exerted a tumor suppressor and pro-apoptotic effect, which wasrelated to p-AKT phosphorylation and up-regulation of PTEN.

pub.1063249211,Abstract 2419: A phase Ib-IIa study evaluating the nanopharmaceutical CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab in the treatment of patients (pts.) with advanced renal cell carcinoma.,"Abstract Background: Topoisomerase-1 (topo-1)-inhibiting agents demonstrate activity across multiple cancer types but use of these agents remains limited by insufficient tumor exposure and toxicity. CRLX101, a novel cyclodextrin-containing polymer conjugate of camptothecin (CPT) that self-assembles into nanoparticles, delivers sustained levels of active CPT into cancer cells while substantially reducing systemic exposure. In vitro and in vivo data suggest superior activity of CRLX101 compared to approved agents in multiple animal tumor models. A monotherapy maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 15 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks (wks.) was reported previously and over 100 cancer pts. have now been treated with CRLX101 across three ongoing phase 2 clinical trials. To be presented separately at this conference, CRLX101 further appears to inhibit HIF1α, a hypoxia-induced transcription factor implicated in tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. We hypothesize that observed synergistic activity between CRLX101 and the VEGF-inhibiting monoclonal antibody bevacizumab occurs as a result of overcoming HIF-mediated resistance to VEGF-inhibition. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), accounting for approximately 85% of RCC, provides an ideal clinical setting in which to evaluate the potential of this drug-drug combination. The most commonly observed genetic abnormality in ccRCC results in higher intracellular levels of HIF1α. Bevacizumab was chosen as a combination partner here because of its proven activity in the treatment of RCC as well as a history of successful combination with chemotherapy partners including topo-1 inhibitors. Methods: This clinical trial examines the combination of bevacizumab and CRLX101 in the treatment of pts. with advanced metastatic RCC. The primary objective is to determine the RP2D of CRLX101 administered in ombination with bevacizumab. In a preliminary stage 1b, a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design is being employed and no fewer than 6 pts. will be evaluated at the MTD. A secondary objective is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). Based on a preliminary test for futility, the study will be terminated if ≤ 3 of the initial 12 pts. survive without progression to 16 wks. Otherwise, an additional 10 pts. will be enrolled for a total of 22 pts. and the combination will be viewed as active and worthy of further examination if the PFS rate at 16 wks. is ≥ 50%. Additional exploratory endpoints include a comparison of bone marrow histology and molecular features among pts. treated with 12 mg/m2 vs. 15 mg/m2 of CRLX101. Finally, tumor expression of CAIX, a well-studied surrogate for HIF1α activity, will be measured using 124I-cG250, a CAIX antibody, with real-time PET imaging employed to determine the degree of CRLX101-mediated HIF1α modulation.

Richard Feynman, regarded as the father of modern nanotechnology, and Nadrian Seeman, the father of DNA nanotechnology, served as key figures in bridging the gap between nanotechnology and medicine. This modernized discipline has brought about a revolutionary transformation in various industries, notably the pharmaceutical sector, through the precise manipulation of materials at the nanoscale (10–999nm). Nanoscale materials often possess advantageous chemical, physical, and biological qualities that set them apart from their bulk counterparts. Scientists have utilized the unique properties of these materials to advance pharmaceuticals, unveiling strategies that enhance drug bioavailability and efficacy, diminish adverse effects, amplify through enhanced permeation and retention (EPR), and facilitate precise targeted therapies. As per the definition of Rivera et al., nanopharmaceuticals are drugs engineered on the nanoscale, where nanosystems play a vital therapeutic role to enhance the properties of the original compound. To be classified as such, two main criteria must be met: substantial use of nanoengineering in the manufacturing process and the nanosystem contributing to improve therapeutic activity of the active drug molecule. In this chapter we have briefly described different types of nanosytems used in pharmaceutical formulations, their uptake, distribution and clearence. We have also covered the use of nanosystems in cancer therapy and in combating drug resistance infectious diseases."
pub.1127902121,Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Reduce Free Radical‐Mediated Toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster,"According to The Free Radical Theory of Aging, cellular damage induced by oxidative stress is associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Prior studies portray cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONP) as potent free radical scavengers and neuroprotective agents. These studies were designed to evaluate an effective dosing regimen for CeONP in achieving lifespan extension and motor function preservation in Drosophila. We also determined the efficacy of CeONP when challenged with the toxic redox cycling agent paraquat (PQ), often used in Parkinson's disease modeling. Cohorts of 100 flies were fed with varying concentrations of CeONP (0–100μM) throughout adulthood or the larval stage. For PQ studies, flies were starved for 3 hours, and exposed to PQ for 24 hours. Motor function was evaluated by measuring activity in a Trikinetics monitoring system at various lifespan or post‐PQ intervals. In females, treatment with CeONP increased median lifespan by 18 days, or 32% (p<0.001), maximum lifespan by 19 days, or 25.3% (p <0.001), and overall activity in aged females increased by 150%. When exposed to PQ, average survival was prolonged 8 days, or 31% (p = 0.002), and females were 40 times more active than control flies. Male lifespan responded poorly to neuroprotective effects, and yet motor function was increased up to 900%! Our results suggest that nanoparticles may provide effective future treatment for free radical‐mediated disorders, opening a new realm of nanopharmaceutical development."

They are able to both generate and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, like some other nanomaterials, may induce autophagy. Controversy exists regarding their potential for toxicity. Systemic administration of hydroxylated fullerene nanoparticles to fish has been reported to result in renal accumulation and nephropathy, as well as impairment of innate immune responses. To better characterize biocompatibility and the potential for adverse systemic effects, we administered the water soluble fullerenol, C 60 (OH) 24, to fathead minnows ( Pimephales promelas ), a model organism for environmental toxicology studies. Briefly, adult minnows were injected intraperitoneally with 20 micrograms/g, the lowest lethal dose observed in a preliminary study. Fish died or were euthanized moribund within 36 hours post‐injection. Sections of whole fish from control and treatment groups were evaluated using a four‐category scoring system comprising 31 different histologic features. Statistically significant tissue changes were observed in the kidney and sensory system and included renal edema, degeneration of tubular epithelium, pigment accumulation and loss of hematopoietic tissue in the trunk kidney and degeneration or death of ciliated sensory cells in the ear.

The impressive findings showed that ZnO nanodrug caused changes in blood factors, having the most effectiveness at 40 μg/ml concentration after two weeks of oral treatments. The significant increase in white blood cells (WBC) neutrophils and meaningful decreases in lymphocytes and especially cholesterol were powerful simultaneous impacts, successfully treating malignant breast cancer masses. In this significant animal model research for breast cancer, the sick mice recovered entirely and even had a safe space to mate. Histopathological results showed no evidence of breast tumor formation or metastasis in the group treated with nanodrug and their children.

pub.1134690651,Scalable Electrochemical Synthesis of Novel Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles and Its Application to High‐Sensitive Detection of 4‐Nitrophenol in Aqueous System,"This study reports a scalable green electrochemical synthesis of novel biogenic silver nanoparticles colloid (biogenic AgNPs) in large scale up to 5 liters using the bulk silver bar and the green tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) extract (GTE) as reducing agent during the electrochemical process. Under a direct-current voltage source, the biomolecules in GTE can release electrons to promote the reducing process of Ag+ to Ag0. More interestingly, the formation of the intermediate complex helps to cap on the nanoparticles, which leads to stabilizing AgNPs. The as-synthesized biogenic AgNPs with the size of 34 nm exhibit the outstanding electrochemical properties due to the presence of biomolecules on the biogenic AgNPs surface, which facilitates the effective attaching of AgNPs on the carbon surface of the screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE) through the formation of the strong C-O coordinate bonds between O atom of oxygen functional groups and C atom of SPE. The electrochemical properties of the biogenic AgNPs-modified SPE are enhanced significantly in comparison with bare SPE and pure AgNPs-SPE. The biogenic AgNPs-SPE is applied successfully to the detection of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The electrochemical sensor using biogenic AgNPs can reliably detect 4-NP in the linear range from 0.1 to 25 μM with the sensitivity about 6.69 μA μM-1 cm-2.

Nanoparticulates are particulates with at least one dimension less than 100nm. The number and complexity of nanoparticulates is rapidly increasing due to improvements in nanotechnology, the technology that allows engineering in the nanoscale, often from the atom up. Recently, nanotechnology has expanded to include medical products and the new products of nanomedicine include nanopharmaceuticals. Nanotoxicology, the study of the toxic effects of the new products of nanotechnology, lags far behind developments in nanotechnology and nanomedicine. Even fewer studies have investigated the toxicologic pathology of the products of nanotechnology. Nanoparticulates are generally more toxic on a mass basis than larger particles with the same composition. Nanoscaling of particulates increases surface area and thereby increases the dissolution rate of soluble particulates and increases inflammation associated with poorly soluble particulates. Nanosizing also facilitates movement between tissues and across intracellular barriers. In particular, nanoscaling can enable extracellular transport in lymphatics, neuronal transport, and use of endocytic pathways for cell entry and intracellular transport. Some NPs are similar in size and shape to subcellular structures, permitting critical interactions with these subcellular structures that are not possible with larger particulates. However, some of these unique features can be harnessed for new therapeutic and diagnostic products that allow targeted drug delivery and advanced imaging. Toxicologic pathologists will increasing evaluate the safety of these new products of nanotechnology. An understanding of the toxicologic pathology of nanoparticulates plays a critical role in the safe development of nanotechnology."

This study demonstrated the need to use quantum-mechanical descriptors to explain the toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles, capable of characterizing the electronic state of nanostructures. Regularization methods based on LASSO and Ridge regression have been employed in the model selection and validation. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for toxicological effects applicable to a relevant group of nanoparticles, as well as their generalization to other toxicity studies not available in the literature, with potential nanopharmaceutical applications.Graphical abstract"
pub.1162267796,Chapter 3 Challenges in delivery of plant actives,"Bioactive compound discovery has faced many challenges and the diversity of natural products offers a huge number of opportunities for new lead candidates. Plants are the source of most of the potential candidates since they have several and interesting biological activities. However, their in vivo efficacy is recurrently limited due to low permeation through the biological barriers and also to low or very low water solubility. Thus, enhancing the bioavailability of natural products through the improvement of their biopharmaceuticals features, as well as their targeting efficacy, are crucial steps in the development of these new products. In this chapter, we reviewed the most representative examples as a rising approach for delivery systems, presenting smart carriers, mostly in nanometric range that can selectively deliver appropriate levels of a bioactive agent. This overview also describes many types of carriers with structural and functional differences between them which can be chosen according to the encapsulated bioactive agent characteristics, the specific target or even accordingly to the desired release rate. Regarding natural products, we also highlight several examples that are already commercialized or in clinical studies phase with impressive progresses. On the other hand, this review also describes examples or natural products that are being used as encapsulant materials in these pioneering systems. In addition, a special focus is also drawn to the questions addressing the safety and efficacy evaluation of the nanopharmaceuticals for natural product delivery. Nonetheless, research into sophisticated, science-driven solutions is still continuing; expectations related to safety and efficacy are high to meet clinical needs, but the progress made has been noticeable so far."

Due to their properties, nanoparticles can also be used in medical practice in the development of new types of testing and diagnosis both in vivo and in vitro. For in vitro testing, it is desired to develop chips that contain several sensors to detect quantitatively and qualitatively various biochemical parameters (the concept of 'lab on a chip'). For in vivo testing, nanoparticles are used in both imaging and cancer therapy. In addition, nanoparticles have prospects in advancing implant technology and sensors/biosensors (e.g. blood glucose values; real-time detection). Nanopharmaceuticals are used to administrate targeted pharmacological agents to certain organs and cells (cell selectivity). The implementation of these techniques/devices provides a need to respect the associated ethical aspects.

pub.1135371368,Nanocarriers for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer,"Drug delivery systems have received notable insights in pharmaceutical research resulting in the strategies for the development of nanocarriers for delivery of drugs and biopharmaceuticals, such as liposomes and nanoparticles. These systems have been demonstrated several advantages compared to conventional pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as greater control of the spatial and/or temporal release of the drugs, reduction of side effects, use of a lesser amount of drug take to lower cost, the large interval between administrations, it consequently leads to better acceptance of treatment by the patient and the ability to directing of nanocarriers to their specific target. The exponential increase in recent years in the deposit of patents for new biocompatible materials and new processes for preparing and functionalizing nanocarriers for the diagnosis or treatment of diseases reflects the enormous potential for their uses in therapeutics. Thus, the launch of these devices has a significant impact on the development of new therapeutic, diagnostic, and/or therapeutic approaches, especially for cancer. The fusion of nanotechnology with pharmaceutical research and development opens new horizons for the creation of new materials with unique characteristics of the nanometric scale. The application of nanomaterials designed for medicine tends to produce drugs with unprecedented benefits for the clinical outcome. Given that, this chapter addresses the rational design of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems and discusses clinical trials and market products and those used as nanopharmaceuticals or nanomedicines for cancer treatment, in addition to exploiting the research and development for new platforms and their use in cancer diagnosis."

This led into the establishment of regulatory agencies which can be governmental, non‐governmantal, hybrid or may be self‐regulated. Drug delivery systems of good quality, safety and efficacy can be introduced into the market so, as to prevent, protect and conserve public health and his environment. For regulation and monitoring of nano products, various countries have adopted proper channels of regulatory measures to accomplish the aim. These have ensured to express the regulatory guidelines of the regulatory agencies at a global level. A proper regulatory setup helps in aiding up in the estimation of global governance gap and solution related to that of pharmaceutical nanomedicine.

pub.1047246712,Controlled-release formulation of perindopril erbumine loaded PEG-coated magnetite nanoparticles for biomedical applications,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (FNPs) were synthesized due to low toxicity and their ability to immobilize biological materials on their surfaces by the coprecipitation of iron salts in ammonia hydroxide followed by coating it with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to minimize the aggregation of iron oxide nanoparticles and enhance the effect of nanoparticles for biological applications. Then, the FNPs–PEG was loaded with perindopril erbumine (PE), an antihypertensive compound to form a new nanocomposite (FPEGPE). Transmission electron microscopy results showed that there are no significant differences between the sizes of FNPs and FPEGPE nanocomposite. The existence of PEG–PE was supported by the FTIR and TGA analyses. The PE loading (10.3 %) and the release profiles from FPEGPE nanocomposite were estimated using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy which showed that up to 60.8 and 83.1 % of the adsorbed drug was released in 4223 and 1231 min at pH 7.4 and 4.8, respectively. However, the release of PE was completed very fast from a physical mixture (FNPs–PEG–PE) after 5 and 7 min at pH 4.8 and 7.4, respectively, which reveals that the release of PE from the physical mixture is not in the sustained-release manner. Cytotoxicity study showed that free PE presented slightly higher toxicity than the FNPs and FPEGPE nanocomposite. Therefore, the decrease toxicity against mouse normal fibroblast (3T3) cell lines prospective of this nanocomposite together with controlled-release behavior provided evidence of the possible beneficial biological activities of this new nanocomposite for nanopharmaceutical applications for both oral and non-oral routes."
pub.1168840668,Specific Application of Lipid-Based Nanoparticular Drug Delivery Systems for Cancer Therapy,"Today, cancer is one of the diseases frequently occurring in individuals of all ages in the society with a high risk of death. In most types of cancer, traditional treatment methods can often be insufficient for many reasons. Cancer cells may gain resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and chemotherapy may fail due to “Multidrug Resistance.” While the quality of the patient’s life decreases significantly during chemotherapy and/or radiotheraphy, the physician may become helpless with a treatment in which an adequate response cannot be obtained. Immunotherapy is not always an appropriate method or may be insufficient. There is a need for new approaches in an effective treatment. Thus, many research groups have focused on the site-specific delivery of active agents in nanoparticular drug delivery systems. What is expected from a versatile drug delivery system is that it provides rapid drug accumulation in the cancerous organ, bypasses first pass metabolism, exhibits improved drug therapeutic index with less systemic side effects, and provides anticancer activity against metastases. Lipid-based nanoparticular drug delivery systems, which are the focus of attention of many research groups due to their prominent properties, have an important place among these systems.In this chapterColloidal drug delivery systems, lipid-based nanoparticlesDrug delivery are reviewed considering their physicochemical characteristics and their targeting strategies. Due to the comprehensiveness of the subject, lung cancer, which is one of the most common and deadly cancer types in the world, has been reviewed as an example to reveal the potential of lipid-based nanoparticular drug delivery systems in cancer treatment. Valuable information gathered from recent scientific studies discussing their potential in the treatment of lung cancer is summarized."

According to the Global Cancer Observatory, 2020 (GLOBOCAN), 10 million cancer deaths and approx 19 million new cancer cases occurred across the world. It is estimated that there will be 28.4 million cases in 2040, increasing the global cancer burden by approximately 47%. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women with approximately 2.3 million new cases per year. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous type of cancer with several intrinsic subtypes. Conventional breast cancer treatments are unable to improve patient survival rates. The therapies used cause off-target toxicity and damage healthy tissues. Advances in nanotechnology have created a novel plant-based nanoformulation to specifically target the tumor site and also act as therapeutics. It revolutionized cancer nanomedicine by developing smart metal nanoparticles and overcoming resistance to chemotherapy. Biologically synthesized nanoparticles are preferred because they are durable, economical, and environmentally friendly. Various plant extracts are used to synthesize metallic nanoparticles such as silver, gold, zinc oxides, iron oxide, etc. Secondary plant metabolites act as a reducing agent and stabilizer for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Tunable characteristics and high surface area to volume ratio of metallic nanoparticles make them potential candidate for biomedical platform. These metal and metal oxide nanostructures are accompanied or functionalized by nanocarriers and drugs molecule which make targeted drug delivery possible. This nanoassembly increases the drug stability, bioavailability, drug loading, cellular uptake and therapeutic gain. Recently, the new theranostic approach has made both diagnosis and therapy possible simultaneously. However, applying the plant based nanotherapeutic delivery approach in the future will require interdisciplinary approaches, extensive collaboration and cooperation among researchers, leading academics, pharmaceutical sectors and regulatory agencies to integrate nanopharmaceuticals into clinical practice."

Drug research also contributed to the progress of medical sciences substantially and improving characteristics of drugs in terms of various predicted properties is continued as a challenge and agenda of these researches. Though the objective of drug research is continuous improvements of existing drugs in terms of their curing ability and to discover new drugs which have substantial improved abilities to cure many existing and new diseases, the final goal of drug research is directed to identifying one drug which has the ability to cure all diseases. Such drug system which can cure any diseases instantaneously is called ideal drug or ideal medicine. Based on the exact property expectations from a drug system as a medicine to cure all diseases is still unknown and a systematic study on the goal of ideal drug discovery is yet to be established. In this paper, we have made an attempt to identify the characteristics of an ideal drug which can cure all diseases in the universe. Further, we discussed the challenges and opportunities to realize such an ideal drug which can cure all the diseases. We also analysed the possibility of using nanotechnology which is emerging as universal technology to realize the possibility of developing ideal drug in practice. The advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages of using nanotechnology in drug research with the goal of improving them towards an ideal drug system are also listed. Finally, the comparison is made between conventional drugs and nanotechnology based drugs in terms of Ideal System Characteristics.This paper is on futuristic research along with new knowledge creation and analysis based new interpretation of nanotechnology in medicinal drugs."
pub.1002177197,Chapter 43 Nanoparticulates,"This chapter describes the toxicologic pathology of nanoparticulates, the tools which can help toxicologic pathologists evaluate nanoparticulate studies, and emphasizes unique features occurring in nanoscale dimensions. Nanoparticulates are particulates with at least one dimension less than 100nm. The number and complexity of nanoparticulates is rapidly increasing due to improvements in nanotechnology, the technology that allows engineering in the nanoscale, and often from the atom up. Many products are in current use for diverse commercial purposes, with an estimated economic impact expanding into trillions of dollars in the near future. Recently, nanotechnology has expanded to include medical products, and the new products of nanomedicine include nanopharmaceuticals. Nanotoxicology, the study of the toxic effects of the new products of nanotechnology, lags far behind developments in nanotechnology and nanomedicine. Even fewer studies have investigated the toxicologic pathology of the products of nanotechnology. Nanoparticulates are generally more toxic on a mass basis than larger particles with the same composition. Nanoscaling of particulates increases surface area and thereby increases the dissolution rate of soluble particulates and increases inflammation associated with poorly soluble particulates. Nanosizing also facilitates movement between tissues and across intracellular barriers. In particular, nanoscaling permits extracellular transport in lymphatics, retrograde neuronal transport, and the use of nanoscale endocytic pathways for cell entry and intracellular transport. NPs are similar in size to subcellular structures, including components of the mitotic spindle, permitting critical interactions with these subcellular structures that are not possible with larger particulates. However, some of these unique features can be harnessed for new therapeutic and diagnostic products that allow targeted drug delivery and advanced imaging. Toxicologic pathologists will increasingly evaluate the safety of these new products of nanotechnology. An understanding of the toxicologic pathology of nanoparticulates plays a critical role in the safe development of nanotechnology."

pub.1013829886,Dendrimer space concept for innovative nanomedicine: A futuristic vision for medicinal chemistry,"Over the last decade, various nanomaterial systems have been developed as important and powerful strategies to deliver conventional drugs, recombinant proteins, vaccines, aptamers, siRNA, nucleotides and genes. In particular, alongside polymeric, solid–lipid, magnetic and metal based nanoparticles, polymeric micelles and linear polymers, dendrimer nanostructures represent useful nano-carriers in medicine. Today's challenge to find safe and innovative drugs remains as critical as ever.In this review, for the first time, we define the term dendrimer space concept as an approach that affords a new paradigm of thought for medicinal chemists and opens new and promising avenues toward the identification of original dendrimer-based drugs. Thus, the dendrimer space defines a new ‘druggable’ cluster that is included within the vast volume of chemical space. The dendrimer space concept took its inspiration from both the concepts of ‘druglikeness’ and ‘druggability’, which are fully and practically integrated into the drug discovery process, and from different methods of exploration and navigation, such as the ‘chemography’ approach, in chemical space. It was further influenced by the large number of biomedical applications using dendrimers that were developed from only a handful existing in the early 1990s.To define the boundaries of the dendrimer space, this review first focuses on the recent progress in the exploration of specific sub-chemical spaces (clusters within the continuum of chemical space). Chemical space is defined as the entire collection of all meaningful chemical compounds, and its full examination is insuperable. The compounds included in these different clusters can be mapped onto the coordinates of a multidimensional descriptor space, with such variables as physicochemical properties or topological characteristics, and are based on the concepts of ‘druglikeness’ (drug-like space) and ‘leadlikeness’. In addition, the discrete areas occupied by specific biologically active compounds define the boundaries of the ‘target class’ clusters, which can overlap the drug-like space. Second, this review gives an overview of the nanopharmaceutical properties of dendrimers, both as biologically active derivatives per se and as drug delivery systems. Finally, several perspectives using dendrimers as new delivery platforms based on the concept of dendrimer space are presented."

MITO@HA binds to sodium hyaluronate, which is highly expressed in pancreatic cancers. This study seeks to evaluate MITO@HA treatment efficacy, clarify its inhibitory effect on pancreatic cancer, and provide an experimental basis for the use of organic polymer nanoparticles loaded with antitumor drugs to treat pancreatic cancer. This treatment strategy was developed for pancreatic cancer based on the hydrophobic behavior of the nanopharmaceutical MITO@HA. The average particle size of MITO@HA was 51.4&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;2.3 nm, and the particles had a spherical structure. CCK-8 assays revealed that both MITO and MITO@HA inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. that the most suitable experimental conditions were determined to be exposing pancreatic cancer cells to 0.5 uM/L MITO@HA for 2 days. PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic cancer tissues were found to express high levels of CD44. In in vitro experiments, MITO@HA inhibited G0/G1 phase arrest, increased apoptosis, and decreased cell replication, cell migration and invasion in the pancreatic cancer cell cycle compared to MITO alone. Therefore, we believe that MITO@HA has a good tumor cell inhibitory effect. Furthermore, in vivo experiments revealed that the tumor volume in nude mice in the MITO@HA group decreased (P&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.05), and both MITO and MITO@HA treatment decreased the tumor growth curves, with MITO@HA decreasing them more than MITO alone. Compared with those in the control group and the MITO group, the HE staining of tumors in the MITO@HA group showed massive liquefaction necrosis of the tumor tissues. Safety evaluation of the nude mice in the MITO@HA group revealed that the mice had a normal blood profile, normal liver and kidney function, and normal myocardial enzymes. The above results indicate that MITO@HA can effectively accumulate in pancreatic cancer tumor tissue through the EPR effect and CD44 receptor targeting, leading to liquefaction and necrosis of tumor tissue, thereby effectively reducing tumor growth. The above results showed that MITO@HA is highly safe and can enhance the antitumor effect on pancreatic cancer, providing an experimental basis for clinical application.</p>"

Due to their biological synthesis and biocompatibility, bionanomaterials have received a lot of consideration due to their potential uses in the biomedical sector. Bionanomaterials, which are extraordinarily small, have unique qualities that give them potential in a variety of fields, including pharmacology, aeronautical engineering, material science, biosensors, and more. Moreover, several characterization techniques have been used to explore the characteristics of the created bionanomaterials. The intrinsic physical, chemical, physio-chemical, mechanical, and chemo-biological features of nanobiomaterials for nanobiotechnology, nanopharmaceuticals, and nanobioengineering must be appropriate. The created nanomaterials must also have qualities that are biomimetic and responsive, and they must not be hazardous during any stage of usage or implantation. They must also undergo minimum or zero order degradation or use-related and aging degradation, and they must last a lifetime. Biomaterials at the enhanced size must have complex properties like biological materials and be well matched with biological locations during unloading, delivery, and procedure. Bionanomaterials for sensors, actuators, and drug delivery systems are innovative devices in the health area, enabling continuous monitoring and drug administration. Basically, the technique uses sensors that continuously analyze biological components and deliver drugs in response to predetermined signals. High sensitivity and quick medication release are two benefits. Bionanomaterials, which are extraordinarily small, have unique qualities that give them potential in a variety of fields, including pharmacology, aeronautical engineering, material science, biosensors, and more. Moreover, several characterization techniques have been used to explore the characteristics of the created bionanomaterials. All nano-biomaterials are constructed from nanoparticles. They can be made of polymers (synthetic or natural) and inorganic materials, and they can be utilized as molecular association (metals or ceramics). Nanobiomaterials can be found in a variety of shapes, with spheres being the most prevalent, including rods, needles, platelets, and polygons. Drug targeting, which can be active or passive, is another significant element that uses the nano-formulations or nanomaterials as drug transfer systems. In active pointing, drug delivery schemes are joint by moieties, such as peptides and antibodies, to fix them to the receptor constructions conveyed at the target area."

pub.1121810262,Novel Thyrointegrin αvβ3 Antagonist for the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Abstract
                  Acute myeloid leukemia accounts for up to one-third of the more than 60,000 leukemias diagnosed annually in the U.S. Primary AML cells express membrane αvβ3 integrin, which is associated with adverse prognosis and resistance to chemotherapies used in AML. A macromolecule Polyethylene glycol-conjugated bi-TriAzole Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (P-bi-TAT) acts with high affinity (Ki 3.1 nM) and specificity for the thyrointegrin αvβ3 receptors, without nuclear translocation and has demonstrated effective suppression of cancer cell proliferation, NF-kB expression and invasion in leukemic cells.
                  We evaluated P-bi-TAT in two different AML models against two forms of acute leukemia (monocytic and myelocytic) that are largely resistant to existing therapy, by grafting human leukemia cells in immunocompromised male and female mice. IVIS imaging scans revealed that leukemic colonies were extensively established in bone marrow throughout the control (untreated) grafted animals, as well in liver, lung and kidney. Smears of bone marrow aspirates from untreated animals were found to contain multinucleate myeloblast and monoblast leukemic cells, and peripheral blood smears contained blast cells, multinucleated megakaryocytes, giant platelets and platelet aggregates, which are hallmarks of acute leukemia. IVIS imaging scans revealed 95% reduction in bone marrow colonies and resolution of liver, kidney and lung colonies in animals treated with P-bi-TAT at daily doses ranging from 1-10 mg/kg, subcutaneously for 2-3 weeks. Peripheral blood smears from treated animals were normal. Normal myeloblasts, which are the source of functional white blood cells, were found in the marrow smears, but leukemic cells were not detected in P-bi-TAT treated animals. Thus, against two forms of leukemia models, P-bi-TAT was extraordinarily effective, with the potential in treating most AML sub-types because αvβ3 receptors are expressed in the majority of AML. Among genes targeted by multiple laboratories for pharmacological downregulation of expression in AML are BCL2, VEGF, AKT1, KIT, IDH2, CDK4/6, TIMP1, VEGF, EGFR, and PD-L1. In that regard, P-bi-TAT has been shown in various tumor cell models to downregulate transcription of each of the genes listed, which are relevant to AML disease progression. Additionally, the pro-apoptotic P53 gene transcription is enhanced by P-bi-TAT.
                  In conclusion, P-bi-TAT is a promising lead clinical candidate that warrants clinical trials in AML patients.

pub.1035020198,Development and Evaluation of Nanostructured Lipid Carriers of Benzoyl Peroxide,"Now a days Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) have attracted interest as enhanced topical drug delivery systems because of their small size which assists in skin accumulation. NLCs can also enhance stability of many active substances by shielding them against various factors causing environmental stress. The aim of this study was to encapsulate Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in NLCs and evaluate their skin irritation potential. BPO-NLC nanoparticles were prepared using BPO, Cetylpalmitate, Lipoid S 100 and Poloxamer 188 by the emulsion-solvent diffusion and evaporation method followed by ultra-sonication. The compatibility of BPO and other excipients was established using FTIR Spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. BPO-NLCs were characterized for various properties viz. particle size (photon correlation spectroscopy), zeta potential and polydispersity index (PDI). Skin irritation was determined by the Draize test. Accelerated stability studies were conducted over 3 months at various temperatures and humidities. The developed formulation had a mean particle size in the range of 180–240 nm and a PI Keywords: ANTIACNE; BENZOYL PEROXIDE; NANOSTRUCTURED LIPID CARRIERS; SKIN IRRITATION Document Type: Research Article DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnd.2013.1038 Publication date: December 1, 2013 More about this publication?

pub.1034491232,Chances of Nanomaterials for Pharmaceutical Applications,"Loretz Brigitta,a Jain Ratnesh,a Dandekar Prajakta,a Thiele Carolin,a Yamada Hiroe,a Mostaghaci Babak,a Lian Qiong,b and Lehr Claus Michaela,ba Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS), Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI), Saarbrücken, Germanyb Department of Biopharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Technology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany Brigitta.Loretz@helmholtz-hzi.de purpose of this chapter. Herein we discuss the potential of carriers in the sub-micron dimension for advanced drug delivery. Physical and chemical properties, in particular solubility, permeability and chemical/biological stability are factors that may limit the bioavailability of a drug and consequently also the use in medicine/clinics. Highly potent actives can be discarded or delayed for such reasons. In general drugs can be classified in two groups, which also distinguish them in their degree of dependency on delivery systems. On the one hand there are chemically manufactured small molecules and on the other hand the so called biopharmaceuticals, which are macromolecules generated by means of biotechnological methods. Biopharmaceuticals comprise mainly protein and peptide drugs as well as nucleotide drugs. In case of small molecules, medicinal chemistry approaches sometimes can improve properties such as solubility, stability toward metabolic degradation or reduced toxicity in order to create more efficient agents. In cases where this is not possible formulations are needed to achieve efficient and safe pharmaceuticals. The term “drug delivery” implies a rather complicated process where the right concentration in time has to be achieved at the target location, ideally even with high specificity. In particular anti cancer drugs may benefit from targeted carriers to minimize the adverse effects in healthy tissue and maximize toxicity for cancer cells. In contrast, for biopharmaceuticals a delivery system is always required since their shared properties are large molecule size, structural complexity and fast metabolism. All these features hinder the achievement of sufficing bioavailability of the “naked” molecule. Biopharmaceuticals with their huge diversity however, are believed to realize personalized medicine to treat complex diseases with variable origin. But these new and highly promising drug candidates, originating from the enormous progress in genetics and biotechnology, are absolutely reliant on adequate delivery systems and technologies to exploit their therapeutic potential. In this regard medicine and pharmaceutical industry’s hopes are pinned on the emerging science of nanotechnology. This chapter provides an overview on currently investigated or unmet therapeutic needs, which could be opportunities for nanoscale delivery systems, summarize in brief the current arsenal of nanocarrier technologies and their ongoing translation into the clinics. Finally we discuss the challenges for developing future nanopharmaceuticals."
pub.1063236110,"Abstract 1306: A Phase 1b/2a study of CRLX101, a novel nanopharmaceutical of camptothecin, in solid tumor cancer patients who have failed standard therapy","Abstract Results from a 24-patient dose-escalation safety and tolerability Phase 1 study of CRLX101 were presented at the 22nd EORTC-NCI-AACR symposium in November 2010. A Phase 2a expansion study of CRLX101 has been initiated to investigate the biological activity and tolerability in cancer patients with specific tumor types at the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of 15 mg/m2. Specifically, a focus of the Phase 2a expansion study is to evaluate CRLX101 biological activity in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), amongst other target indications. In this Phase 2a expansion study, thirty-six (36) patients will be enrolled from three (3) clinical sites in the United States. Fifteen (15) patients treated with CRLX101 thus far were patients with advanced NSCLC. Stable disease of greater than 6 months in multiple NSCLC patients treated with CRLX101 has been observed. Dose-limiting bone marrow toxicities of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were addressed with the longer dosing interval of an every-other-week dosing schedule, which accommodates for the prolonged half-life of CRLX101. Hemorrhagic cystitis, the classic camptothecin toxicity, has not been observed. No other significant adverse events have been observed in the current study. The Phase 2a study will be fully enrolled by the end of 2010 with extensive follow-up on most patients by April of 2011. All of the safety, tolerability, and biological activity data will be presented. At this time, twenty-one (21) of the thirty-six (36) patients have been enrolled. To date, three (3) NSCLC patients have received 4 cycles of therapy and are continuing on study. One (1) NSCLC patients is receiving the seventh cycle of therapy. A controlled, randomized Phase 2 study of CRLX101 in NSCLC is planned and will be initiated in early 2011. CRLX101's favorable tolerability profile may enable combination therapy with other cytotoxic drugs including carboplatin and gemcitabine without added toxicities. Preclinical data on the efficacy and tolerability of such combinations will also be presented. In addition, the dual activity of CRLX101 against both topoisomerase-1 and HIF1α suggest that combination with VEGF antagonists could be synergistic. Similarly, pre-clinical data on the dual mechanism inhibition by CRLX101 based on its pharmacokinetics will be presented. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

 Immunotherapy and nanotechnology: a promising combination in the treatment of neoplasms
 Abstract: Cancer, a multifactorial disease, is usually treated mainly with chemotherapy, which can present side effects and resistance in some types of tumors, leading to the need for innovative alternatives. Thus, the main objective of this study is to understand the combined therapy of immunotherapy and nanotechnology in the treatment of neoplasms. The study was carried out through an integrative review of selected manuscripts on the PubMed data platform, using the descriptors ""Nanomedicine"", ""Immunotherapy"", ""Therapeutics"" and ""Neoplasms"", combined in a single search strategy using the Boolean operator ""AND"". We included papers published between 2019 and 2023, freely available and covering combined treatment, resulting in nineteen articles to make up this review. Biomarkers, nanopharmaceuticals, vaccines and nanocarriers were discussed. Combination therapy is emerging as a successful therapeutic approach. However, mass production is difficult, precise analytical methods and equipment are lacking, and more work is needed on this subject.Descriptors: Nanomedicine, Immunotherapy, Therapeutics, Neoplasms.

pub.1005085171,Formulations of Nanoparticles in Drug Delivery,"Nanotechnology is the science that deals with structures in the size range of nanometers. It has the potential to greatly impact our lives. The employment of nanotechnology has opened new vistas in the areas of personalized health care, drug delivery, gene therapy, diagnostics, imaging, and novel drug discovery techniques. Enormous research is going on in the eld of nanotechnology to resolve various issues such as bioavailability, spatial and temporal delivery of drugs, and precise delivery of new molecules like genes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents through the colloidal carriers is at the forefront of nanotechnology as it provides numerous opportunities for efcient exploitation of different formulations and routes of administration. In this perspective, rst, solid-core nanoparticles (NPs) were reported as an alternative drug carrier. NPs are dened as particulate dispersions or solid particles with a size in the range of 10-200 nm, built from macromolecular and/or molecular assemblies, in which the active principle is dissolved, dispersed, encapsulated, or even adsorbed or attached to the external interface. NPs are divided into two main classes based on their structures: nanospheres and nanocapsules that can be obtained by varying the methods of preparation. Nanospheres are matrix systems in which the drug is physically and uniformly dispersed and have a homogeneous structure, whereas nanocapsules are the systems in which the drug is conned in a cavity surrounded by a unique polymer membrane exhibit a typical core-shell structure (Figure 10.1). Their higher kinetic stability and rigid morphology are the major advantages over other colloidal drug delivery systems (such as liposome, niosome, microemulsions, nanoemulsions, etc.). Pharmaceutical NPs are one of the colloidal vehicles that possess the ability to carry drugs, accumulate preferentially at the target site, or release drugs in a controlled way within the body, which leads to improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of therapeutic agents with consequent reduction in systemic side effects and more efcient use of the therapeutic agents (Kreuter 1994; Alexis et al., 2008; Qi et al., 2012). They do not only allow the delivery of small drug molecules but are also expected to deliver peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids, hence opening the gate for gene therapy (Kim et al., 2005; Kommareddy et al., 2005; Jeon et al., 2012). NPs are usually administered through the parenteral route; however, because of their excellent barrier-crossing property, they are also being investigated for oral (Yin et al., 2007; Agueros et al., 2009; Kalaria et al., 2009; Jain et al., 2011), ocular (Motwani et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2010; Basaran et al., 2011), nasal (Michael et al., 2009; Shahnaz et al., 2012), pulmonary (Ungaro et al., 2012), periodontal (Pinon-Segundo et al., 2005; Saboktakin et al., 2011), and transdermal (Elnaggar et al., 2011; Gupta and Vyas"

While modern definitions of business processes exist and are shared in the Business Process Management community, a commonly agreed meta-model is still missing. Nonetheless, several different business process meta-models have been recently proposed and discussed in the literature, which look at business process models from different perspectives, focusing on different aspects and often using different labels for denoting the same element or element relation.In this paper, we start from elements and relations discovered inspecting the literature on business process meta-models through a systematic literature review. We then combine these elements and relations to build a business process meta-model. The obtained literature-based business process meta-model, which is on purpose built to disclose criticalities, is then inspected and discussed. The analysis reveals, besides the lack of attention to some crucial business process elements, issues and inconsistencies in the literature meta-models. An ontological analysis is finally carried out and possible solutions to the discovered issues are proposed."

In our Department of Trauma Surgery a specific guideline is available paper-based as a set of flowcharts. This format is appropriate for the use by experienced physicians but insufficient for electronic support of learning, workflow and process optimization. A formal and logically consistent version represented with a standardized meta-model is necessary for automatic processing. In our project we transferred the paper-based into an electronic format and analyzed the structure with respect to formal errors. Several errors were detected in 7 error categories. The errors were corrected to reach a formal and logically consistent process model. In a second step the clinical content of the guideline was revised interactively using a process modeling tool. Our study reveals that guideline development should be assisted by process modeling tools, which check the content in comparison to a meta-model. The meta-model itself could support the domain experts in formulating their knowledge systematically. To assure sustainability of guideline development a representation independent of specific applications or specific provider is necessary. Then clinical guidelines could be used for training, process optimization and workflow management additionally."

Currently, there is no specific testing standardization for this type of vessel and to fill this gap probabilistic numerical models were developed, performed by the Finite Element Method, fed with the material characteristics obtained experimentally by 2D digital image correlation from flat specimens. From the initial numerical model, a surrogate metamodel was generated by stochastic approximations. Once the metamodels were obtained by robust engineering, an experimental ring-ring tensile test was developed under service conditions and deformations were measured by high-precision 3D digital image correlation. Parametric and robust tests showed that the results of the metamodel did not show statistically significant differences, with errors in the rupture part of less than 2 % with respect to the results obtained in the test, being proposed as a basis for new test procedures."
pub.1099597955,A meta-model for computer executable dynamic clinical safety checklists,"BackgroundSafety checklist is a type of cognitive tool enforcing short term memory of medical workers with the purpose of reducing medical errors caused by overlook and ignorance. To facilitate the daily use of safety checklists, computerized systems embedded in the clinical workflow and adapted to patient-context are increasingly developed. However, the current hard-coded approach of implementing checklists in these systems increase the cognitive efforts of clinical experts and coding efforts for informaticists. This is due to the lack of a formal representation format that is both understandable by clinical experts and executable by computer programs.MethodsWe developed a dynamic checklist meta-model with a three-step approach. Dynamic checklist modeling requirements were extracted by performing a domain analysis. Then, existing modeling approaches and tools were investigated with the purpose of reusing these languages. Finally, the meta-model was developed by eliciting domain concepts and their hierarchies. The feasibility of using the meta-model was validated by two case studies. The meta-model was mapped to specific modeling languages according to the requirements of hospitals.ResultsUsing the proposed meta-model, a comprehensive coronary artery bypass graft peri-operative checklist set and a percutaneous coronary intervention peri-operative checklist set have been developed in a Dutch hospital and a Chinese hospital, respectively. The result shows that it is feasible to use the meta-model to facilitate the modeling and execution of dynamic checklists.ConclusionsWe proposed a novel meta-model for the dynamic checklist with the purpose of facilitating creating dynamic checklists. The meta-model is a framework of reusing existing modeling languages and tools to model dynamic checklists. The feasibility of using the meta-model is validated by implementing a use case in the system."
pub.1127940731,Automated Planning for Supporting Knowledge-Intensive Processes,"Knowledge-intensive Processes (KiPs) are processes characterized by high levels of unpredictability and dynamism. Their process structure may not be known before their execution. One way to cope with this uncertainty is to defer decisions regarding the process structure until run time. In this paper, we consider the definition of the process structure as a planning problem. Our approach uses automated planning techniques to generate plans that define process models according to the current context. The generated plan model relies on a metamodel called METAKIP that represents the basic elements of KiPs. Our solution explores Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to generate plan models. This technique allows uncertainty representation by defining state transition probabilities, which gives us more flexibility than traditional approaches. We construct an MDP model and solve it with the help of the PRISM model-checker. The solution is evaluated by means of a proof of concept in the medical domain which reveals the feasibility of our approach."
pub.1169164666,Regression Metamodel-Based Digital Twin for an Industrial Dynamic Crossflow Filtration Process,"Dynamic crossflow filtration (DCF) is the state-of-the-art technology for solid-liquid separation from viscous and sensitive feed streams in the food and biopharma industry. Up to now, the potential of industrial processes is often not fully exploited, because fixed recipes are usually applied to run the processes. In order to take the varying properties of biological feed materials into account, we aim to develop a digital twin of an industrial brownfield DCF plant, allowing to optimize setpoint decisions in almost real time. The core of the digital twin is a mechanistic-empirical process model combining fundamental filtration laws with process expert knowledge. The effect of variation in the selected process and model parameters on plant productivity has been assessed using a model-based design-of-experiments approach, and a regression metamodel has been trained with the data. A cyclic program that bidirectionally communicates with the DCF asset serves as frame of the digital twin. It monitors the process dynamics membrane torque and transmembrane pressure and feeds back the optimum permeate flow rate setpoint to the physical asset in almost real-time during process runs. We considered a total of 24 industrial production batches from the filtration of grape juice from the years 2022 and 2023 in the study. After implementation of the digital twin on site, the campaign mean productivity increased by 15% over the course of the year 2023. The presented digital twin framework is a simple example how an industrial established process can be controlled by a hybrid model-based algorithm. With a digital process dynamics model at hand, the presented metamodel optimization approach can be easily transferred to other (bio)chemical processes."
pub.1128739277,Computing Embeddings of Directed Bigraphs,"Directed bigraphs are a meta-model which generalises Milner’s bigraphs by taking into account the request flow between controls and names. A key problem about these bigraphs is that of bigraph embedding, i.e., finding the embeddings of a bigraph inside a larger one. We present an algorithm for computing embeddings of directed bigraphs, via a reduction to a constraint satisfaction problem. We prove soundness and completeness of this algorithm, and provide an implementation in jLibBig, a general Java library for manipulating bigraphical reactive systems, together with some experimental results."
pub.1092429951,A template-based approach for responsibility management in executable business processes,"Process-oriented organisations need to manage the different types of responsibilities their employees may have w.r.t. the activities involved in their business processes. Despite several approaches provide support for responsibility modelling, in current Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) the only responsibility considered at runtime is the one related to performing the work required for activity completion. Others like accountability or consultation must be implemented by manually adding activities in the executable process model, which is time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we address this limitation by enabling current BPMS to execute processes in which people with different responsibilities interact to complete the activities. We introduce a metamodel based on Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAM) to model the responsibility assignment for each activity, and a flexible template-based mechanism that automatically transforms such information into BPMN elements, which can be interpreted and executed by a BPMS. Thus, our approach does not enforce any specific behaviour for the different responsibilities but new templates can be modelled to specify the interaction that best suits the activity requirements. Furthermore, libraries of templates can be created and reused in different processes. We provide a reference implementation and build a library of templates for a well-known set of responsibilities."
pub.1092272277,Chaotic genetic algorithm and Adaboost ensemble metamodeling approach for optimum resource planning in emergency departments,"Long length of stay and overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) are two common problems in the healthcare industry. To decrease the average length of stay (ALOS) and tackle overcrowding, numerous resources, including the number of doctors, nurses and receptionists need to be adjusted, while a number of constraints are to be considered at the same time. In this study, an efficient method based on agent-based simulation, machine learning and the genetic algorithm (GA) is presented to determine optimum resource allocation in emergency departments. GA can effectively explore the entire domain of all 19 variables and identify the optimum resource allocation through evolution and mimicking the survival of the fittest concept. A chaotic mutation operator is used in this study to boost GA performance. A model of the system needs to be run several thousand times through the GA evolution process to evaluate each solution, hence the process is computationally expensive. To overcome this drawback, a robust metamodel is initially constructed based on an agent-based system simulation. The simulation exhibits ED performance with various resource allocations and trains the metamodel. The metamodel is created with an ensemble of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), feedforward neural network (FFNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) using the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) ensemble algorithm. The proposed GA-based optimization approach is tested in a public ED, and it is shown to decrease the ALOS in this ED case study by 14%. Additionally, the proposed metamodel shows a 26.6% improvement compared to the average results of ANFIS, FFNN and RNN in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)."
pub.1149849071,A framework for interoperability between models with hybrid tools,"Complex system development and maintenance face the challenge of dealing with different types of models due to language affordances, preferences, sizes, and so forth that involve interaction between users with different levels of proficiency. Current conceptual data modelling tools do not fully support these modes of working. It requires that the interaction between multiple models in multiple languages is clearly specified to ensure they keep their intended semantics, which is lacking in extant tools. The key objective is to devise a mechanism to support semantic interoperability in hybrid tools for multi-modal modelling in a plurality of paradigms, all within one system. We propose FaCIL, a framework for such hybrid modelling tools. We design and realise the framework FaCIL, which maps UML, ER and ORM2 into a common metamodel with rules that provide the central point for management among the models and that links to the formalisation and logic-based automated reasoning. FaCIL supports the ability to represent models in different formats while preserving their semantics, and several editing workflows are supported within the framework. It has a clear separation of concerns for typical conceptual modelling activities in an interoperable and extensible way. FaCIL structures and facilitates the interaction between visual and textual conceptual models, their formal specifications, and abstractions as well as tracking and propagating updates across all the representations. FaCIL is compared against the requirements, implemented in crowd 2.0, and assessed with a use case. The proof-of-concept implementation in the web-based modelling tool crowd 2.0 demonstrates its viability. The framework also meets the requirements and fully supports the use case."
pub.1137441112,Electronic patient record and its effects on social aspects of interprofessional collaboration and clinical workflows in hospitals (eCoCo): a mixed methods study protocol,"BackgroundThe need for and usage of electronic patient records within hospitals has steadily increased over the last decade for economic reasons as well as the proceeding digitalization. While there are numerous benefits from this system, the potential risks of using electronic patient records for hospitals, patients and healthcare professionals must also be discussed. There is a lack in research, particularly regarding effects on healthcare professionals and their daily work in health services. The study eCoCo aims to gain insight into changes in interprofessional collaboration and clinical workflows resulting from introducing electronic patient records.MethodseCoCo is a multi-center case study integrating mixed methods from qualitative and quantitative social research. The case studies include three hospitals that undergo the process of introducing electronic patient records. Data are collected before and after the introduction of electronic patient records using participant observation, interviews, focus groups, time measurement, patient and employee questionnaires and a questionnaire to measure the level of digitalization. Furthermore, documents (patient records) as well as structural and administrative data are gathered. To analyze the interprofessional collaboration qualitative network analyses, reconstructive-hermeneutic analyses and document analyses are conducted. The workflow analyses, patient and employee assessment analyses and classification within the clinical adoption meta-model are conducted to provide insights into clinical workflows.DiscussionThis study will be the first to investigate the effects of introducing electronic patient records on interprofessional collaboration and clinical workflows from the perspective of healthcare professionals. Thereby, it will consider patients’ safety, legal and ethical concerns and quality of care. The results will help to understand the organization and thereby improve the performance of health services working with electronic patient records.Trial registrationThe study was registered at the German clinical trials register (DRKS00023343, Pre-Results) on November 17, 2020."
pub.1023134326,Enforcement of entailment constraints in distributed service-based business processes,"CONTEXT: A distributed business process is executed in a distributed computing environment. The service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm is a popular option for the integration of software services and execution of distributed business processes. Entailment constraints, such as mutual exclusion and binding constraints, are important means to control process execution. Mutually exclusive tasks result from the division of powerful rights and responsibilities to prevent fraud and abuse. In contrast, binding constraints define that a subject who performed one task must also perform the corresponding bound task(s).
OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a model-driven approach for the specification and enforcement of task-based entailment constraints in distributed service-based business processes.
METHOD: Based on a generic metamodel, we define a domain-specific language (DSL) that maps the different modeling-level artifacts to the implementation-level. The DSL integrates elements from role-based access control (RBAC) with the tasks that are performed in a business process. Process definitions are annotated using the DSL, and our software platform uses automated model transformations to produce executable WS-BPEL specifications which enforce the entailment constraints. We evaluate the impact of constraint enforcement on runtime performance for five selected service-based processes from existing literature.
RESULTS: Our evaluation demonstrates that the approach correctly enforces task-based entailment constraints at runtime. The performance experiments illustrate that the runtime enforcement operates with an overhead that scales well up to the order of several ten thousand logged invocations. Using our DSL annotations, the user-defined process definition remains declarative and clean of security enforcement code.
CONCLUSION: Our approach decouples the concerns of (non-technical) domain experts from technical details of entailment constraint enforcement. The developed framework integrates seamlessly with WS-BPEL and the Web services technology stack. Our prototype implementation shows the feasibility of the approach, and the evaluation points to future work and further performance optimizations."
pub.1038860338,A Novel Method to Verify Multilevel Computational Models of Biological Systems Using Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Meta Model Checking,"Insights gained from multilevel computational models of biological systems can be translated into real-life applications only if the model correctness has been verified first. One of the most frequently employed in silico techniques for computational model verification is model checking. Traditional model checking approaches only consider the evolution of numeric values, such as concentrations, over time and are appropriate for computational models of small scale systems (e.g. intracellular networks). However for gaining a systems level understanding of how biological organisms function it is essential to consider more complex large scale biological systems (e.g. organs). Verifying computational models of such systems requires capturing both how numeric values and properties of (emergent) spatial structures (e.g. area of multicellular population) change over time and across multiple levels of organization, which are not considered by existing model checking approaches. To address this limitation we have developed a novel approximate probabilistic multiscale spatio-temporal meta model checking methodology for verifying multilevel computational models relative to specifications describing the desired/expected system behaviour. The methodology is generic and supports computational models encoded using various high-level modelling formalisms because it is defined relative to time series data and not the models used to generate it. In addition, the methodology can be automatically adapted to case study specific types of spatial structures and properties using the spatio-temporal meta model checking concept. To automate the computational model verification process we have implemented the model checking approach in the software tool Mule (http://mule.modelchecking.org). Its applicability is illustrated against four systems biology computational models previously published in the literature encoding the rat cardiovascular system dynamics, the uterine contractions of labour, the Xenopus laevis cell cycle and the acute inflammation of the gut and lung. Our methodology and software will enable computational biologists to efficiently develop reliable multilevel computational models of biological systems."
pub.1024209257,Regulatory interactions maintaining self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells as revealed through a systems analysis of PI3K/AKT pathway,"MOTIVATION: Maintenance of the self-renewal state in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is the foremost critical step for regenerative therapy applications. The insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway is well appreciated as being the central pathway supporting hESC self-renewal; however, the regulatory interactions in the pathway that maintain cell state are not yet known. Identification of these regulatory pathway components will be critical for designing targeted interventions to facilitate a completely defined platform for hESC propagation and differentiation. Here, we have developed a systems analysis approach to identify regulatory components that control PI3K/AKT pathway in self-renewing hESCs.
RESULTS: A detailed mathematical model was adopted to explain the complex regulatory interactions in the PI3K/AKT pathway. We evaluated globally sensitive processes of the pathway in a computationally efficient manner by replacing the detailed model by a surrogate meta-model. Our mathematical analysis, supported by experimental validation, reveals that negative regulators of the molecules IRS1 and PIP3 primarily govern the steady state of the pathway in hESCs. Among the regulators, negative feedback via IRS1 reduces the sensitivity of various reactions associated with direct trunk of the pathway and also constraints the propagation of parameter uncertainty to the levels of post receptor signaling molecules. Furthermore, our results suggest that inhibition of negative feedback can significantly increase p-AKT levels and thereby, better support hESC self-renewal. Our integrated mathematical modeling and experimental workflow demonstrates the significant advantage of computationally efficient meta-model approaches to detect sensitive targets from signaling pathways.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: FORTRAN codes for the PI3K/AKT pathway and the RS-HDMR implementation are available from the authors upon request."
pub.1104503651,Using information flow analysis to detect implicit information leaks for web service composition,"Information leak, which can undermine the compliance of web-service-composition business processes for some policies, is one of the major concerns in web service composition. We present an automated and effective approach for the detection of implicit information leaks in business process execution language (BPEL) based on information flow analysis. We introduce an adequate meta-model for BPEL representation based on a Petri net for transformation and analysis. Building on the concept of Petri net place-based noninterference, the core contribution of this paper is the application of a Petri net reachability graph to estimate Petri net interference and thereby to detect implicit information leaks in web service composition. In addition, a case study illustrates the application of the approach on a concrete workflow in BPEL notation."

Nowadays, pervasive healthcare systems are a major step in this regard. The safety-critical systems on one hand and their failure in communication (i.e. sending and receiving messages) in other hand may lead to disaster results in the systems. Moreover, the need for high quality services in such systems, and the access to various types of Quality of Services such as reliability in software development has been increasing in the past years. In this paper, firstly we extend the core meta-model of the previously designed style for designing the structures of such systems in order to reach a high level of reliability in messaging. Secondly, their configuration mechanisms in controlling the communicative errors will be modeled using graph transformation rules. Finally, the correctness of the model is analyzed by model checking techniques. The results of the analysis show its high reliability."
pub.1105979778,A Metamodel-Driven Business Process Modeling Methodology and Its Integrated Environment for Reusing Business Processes,"Reusing business process models and best practices can improve the productivity, quality and agility in the early development phases of enterprise software systems. To help developers reuse the business process models and best practices, we propose a methodology and an integrated environment for business process modeling driven by the metamodel. Furthermore, we propose a process-template design method to unify the granularity and separate the commonality and variability of business processes so that business process models can be reused across different enterprise software systems. The proposed methodology enables to create reuse-oriented business process templates before the business process modeling. To support the proposed methodology, we developed an integrated environment for creating, reusing and verifying the business process models. As the key techniques, we describe the methodology and its integrated environment, including a metamodel and notations. We applied the methodology and integrated environment to an actual enterprise software development project, and evaluated that the productivity of business process modeling is improved by at least 46%. As the conclusion, this paper contributes to prove the effectiveness of the meta-model driven business process modeling methodology for the reuse of business process models."

pub.1122752541,Integrated Simulation of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages with Petri Net-Based Transformational Semantics,The development of domain specific models requires appropriate tool support for modeling and execution. Meta-modeling facilitates solutions for the generation of modeling tools from abstract language specifications. The Rmt approach (Renew Meta-Modeling and Transformation) applies transformational semantics using Petri net formalisms as target languages in order to produce quick results for the development of modeling techniques. The problem with transformational approaches is that the inspection of the system during execution is not possible in the original representation.We present a concept for providing simulation feedback for domain specific modeling languages (DSML) that are developed with the Rmt approach on the basis of meta-models and transformational semantics using Petri nets. Details of the application of this new approach are illustrated by some well-known constructs of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN).
pub.1137109666,NeuroPred-FRL: an interpretable prediction model for identifying neuropeptide using feature representation learning,"Neuropeptides (NPs) are the most versatile neurotransmitters in the immune systems that regulate various central anxious hormones. An efficient and effective bioinformatics tool for rapid and accurate large-scale identification of NPs is critical in immunoinformatics, which is indispensable for basic research and drug development. Although a few NP prediction tools have been developed, it is mandatory to improve their NPs' prediction performances. In this study, we have developed a machine learning-based meta-predictor called NeuroPred-FRL by employing the feature representation learning approach. First, we generated 66 optimal baseline models by employing 11 different encodings, six different classifiers and a two-step feature selection approach. The predicted probability scores of NPs based on the 66 baseline models were combined to be deemed as the input feature vector. Second, in order to enhance the feature representation ability, we applied the two-step feature selection approach to optimize the 66-D probability feature vector and then inputted the optimal one into a random forest classifier for the final meta-model (NeuroPred-FRL) construction. Benchmarking experiments based on both cross-validation and independent tests indicate that the NeuroPred-FRL achieves a superior prediction performance of NPs compared with the other state-of-the-art predictors. We believe that the proposed NeuroPred-FRL can serve as a powerful tool for large-scale identification of NPs, facilitating the characterization of their functional mechanisms and expediting their applications in clinical therapy. Moreover, we interpreted some model mechanisms of NeuroPred-FRL by leveraging the robust SHapley Additive exPlanation algorithm."

We investigate in this paper how Bigraphical Reactive Systems represented as Reactive XML can be used to provide a formal semantics as well as an extensible and mobile platform independent execution format for XML based business process and workflow description languages such as WS-BPEL and XPDL. We propose to extend the formalism with primitives for XPath evaluation and higher-order reaction rules to allow for a very direct and succinct semantics.

In order to do it, we need: (1) a generalised workflow metamodel that includes data on the workflow environment, process definitions, and process execution; (2) a powerful and flexible query language addressing the metamodel; (3) integration of a query language with a business process definition language. In this paper the mentioned workflow metamodel together with the business process query language BPQL is presented.

pub.1016364502,Petri nets on the semantic web guidelines and infrastructure,"This paper gives the Petri net ontology as the most important element in providing Petri net support for the Semantic Web. Available Petri net formal descriptions are: metamodels, UML profiles, ontologies and syntax. Metamodels are useful, but their main purpose is for Petri net tools. Although the current Petri-net community effort Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) is XML-based, it lacks a precise definition of semantics. Existing Petri net ontologies are partial solutions specialized for a specific problem. In order to show current Petri net model sharing features we use P3 tool that uses PNML/XSLT-based approach for model sharing. This paper suggests developing the Petri net ontology to represent semantics appropriately. This Petri net ontology is described using UML, Resource Description Framework (Schema) RDF(S) and the Web Ontology Language-OWL.

The collaboration process model is key to represent the discovery result. As for process mining in general, Petri Net classes are candidates for collaboration process models due to their analytical power.

While existing approaches for workflow modeling typically address the consistency of process models, there is no de-facto standard for models which also comprise security-related aspects. Besides basic workflow properties such as executing subjects and transition guards, the proposed IF-Net approach allows net parts to be annotated with security levels in a way that information flow control mechanisms can be applied. By introducing distinguishable token types, IF-Net allows the modeling of both, the control- and data-flow of a workflow in an intuitive way. Altogether IF-Net allows the specification of workflows in a detailed way and provides a basis for the formal verification of security properties on these specifications."

The transformation from PMIF models to Petri net models is then build using ATL. This paper presents such a transformation and its integration into PIPE2, a Petri net modelling tool. It also illustrates the transformation by a simple example."
pub.1095454617,Ecore representation for extending PNML for Input-Output Place-Transition nets,"This paper presents a metamodel for the Input-Output Place-Transition nets (IOPT nets), a Petri net class targeted at controllers modeling. The proposed metamodel reuses many of the elements of the Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) metamodel, such as places, transitions, and arcs; it extends the PNML metamodel for Place/Transition nets to comprise concepts inherent to IOPT nets. The IOPT nets metamodel is described in Ecore format, putting IOPT nets in the puzzle of MDA artifacts taking benefit from the MDA infrastructure."
pub.1147368841,Business Process Query Language,"Modern Business Process Management systems have to work effectively in a distributed cloud environment and to adapt quickly to dynamic changes. One of the key approaches to increase business process adaptability is to make process definitions more flexible. Usually, this requires to express complex constraints and conditions within a process definition. These complex elements are related to the history of process execution, current organizational and application data. In addition, such complex constraints and conditions should be represented in a standardized and yet simple way. In order to satisfy the above requirements, we need: (1) a business process metamodel that includes proper data structures for process definitions and the history of their execution; (2) a powerful and easy to understand language to query models instantiated from the metamodel; (3) integration of that query language with a widely used business process definition language. In this chapter, we propose Business Process Query Language (BPQL) together with the Business Process Metamodel. BPQL is integrated with the Business Process Model and Notation language increasing significantly its expressiveness and flexibility. We also present results of applying BPQL in the OfficeObjects® WorkFlow system."
pub.1100421114,Toward Opportunistic Services for the Industrial Internet of Things,"Services are expected to represent the real drivers for all Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios, including Industrial IoT (IIoT). Indeed, rather than focusing only on products, enterprises are now investing on product-service hybrids to improve operational efficiency, boost productivity and, most importantly, build new markets, hence diversifying their revenues. In this direction, IoT service modeling is a crucial activity requiring a multi-facet in-depth examination. In this paper, we first discuss the importance of IoT services by eliciting related benefits and challenges. Then, we tackle service modeling from both a developer-oriented (comprising high-level descriptive metamodels and ontologies) and an enterprise-oriented (comprising operational models subject to formal verification and execution, such as extensions of the conventional Business Process Models, Petri Nets and WorkFlows) perspective, providing a conceptual mapping between these two complementary approaches. The proposed new paradigm of “Opportunistic IoT Service” extends the available models by explicitly considering essential features for service provision, i.e., dynamicity, context-awareness, co-location and transience."
pub.1113728898,An ArgoUML metamodel extension for the workflow systems,"The Unified Model Language (UML) has nine diagrams. One of them is the activity diagram. This allows the modeling of business processes. A business process is a set of logically related tasks executed to achieve a business result. Workflow systems are those systems based on software that allow automating total or partially a business process. Workflow is defined as a set of methods and technologies that offer facilities for the modeling and administration of diverse processes that happen inside a company. The Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) has established a standard that allows the interoperability among applications workflow. The proposed standard includes a model of the workflow processes, Workflow Metamodel, and a language of specification of processes in XML (XPDL). ArgoUML is a CASE tool for the analysis and design of objects oriented software systems. ArgoUML uses NSUML metamodel implementing the UML metamodel defined by the Objet Management Group (OMG). The ArgoUML tool is open source and it allows building all the types of defined diagrams in UML. In this work, we propose an extension of the NSUML, the core of ArgoUML metamodel. In this way, the ArgoUML incorporates the possibility to model and to simulate workflow processes."
pub.1032561519,Business Process and Practice Alignment Meta-model,"Business Process Modelling (BPM) is one of the most important phases of information system design. Business Process meta-models allow capturing informational and behavioural aspects of business processes. Unfortunately, standard business process meta-modelling approaches, such as the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Meta-model, Quality-Oriented Business Process Meta-Model (QOBPM) and Transactional Meta-Model for Business Process (TMBP) focus just on process description, providing different business process models. According to these meta-modelling approaches, it is not possible to compare and identify related daily practices in order to improve business process models. This lack of information recognizes that further research in Business Process (BP) meta-model is needed to reflect the evolution/change on software processes. Considering this limitation in BP meta-modelling, this paper presents a comparative study of the most recognized business process meta-models approaches and introduces a new BP meta-model designed by Business Process and Practice Alignment Meta-model (BPPAMeta-model). Our intention is to present observed problems in existing approaches and propose a business process meta-model that addresses features related to the alignment between daily work practices and business process descriptions."

This paper presents updated characteristics of one class of Petri nets, named Input-Output Place-Transition Petri nets (IOPT nets), extended to support networked embedded controllers design and globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS) systems modeling, together with its associated meta-model and execution semantics. The proposed meta-model is compliant with the Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) meta-model, augmented with the descriptions for inputs and outputs, as well as for time domains and communication channels. The meta-model is described using UML class diagrams and has an equivalent Ecore meta-model that positioning IOPT nets within the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)."
pub.1018837225,From Contracts to E-Contracts: Modeling and Enactment,"Contracts are complex to understand, represent and process electronically. Usually, contracts involve various entities such as parties, activities and clauses. An e-contract is a contract modeled, specified, executed and enacted (controlled and monitored) by a software system (such as a workflow system). Workflows are used to automate business processes that govern adherence to the e-contracts. E-contracts can be mapped to inter-related workflows, which have to be specified carefully to satisfy the contract requirements. Most workflow models do not have the capabilities to handle complex inter/intra relationships among entities in e-contracts. An e-contract does not adhere to activity/task oriented workflow processes, thus generating a gap between a conceptual model of e-contract and workflow. In this paper, we describe conceptual modeling of e-contracts and present a business process model for e-contract enactment. The enactment of e-contracts necessitates dynamic generation and initiation of workflows during the e-contract execution, besides the static workflows. EREC business process model facilitates an integrated approach to e-contracts enactment. Our methodology is illustrated by means of a case study conducted using Financial Messaging Solution contract for banking transactions."
pub.1027263434,A Property-Driven Approach to Formal Verification of Process Models,"More and more, models, through Domain Specific Languages (DSL), tend to be the solution to define complex systems. Expressing properties specific to these metamodels, and checking them, appear as an urgent need. Until now, the only complete industrial solutions that are available consider structural properties such as the ones that could be expressed in OCL. There are although some attempts on behavioural properties for DSL.This paper addresses a method to specify and then check temporal properties over models. The case study is SimplePDL, a process metamodel. We propose a way to use a temporal extension of OCL, TOCL, to express properties. We specify a models transformation to Petri Nets and LTL formulae for both the process model and its associated temporal properties. We check these properties using a model checker and enrich the model with the analysis results. This work is a first step towards a generic framework to specify and effectively check temporal properties over arbitrary models."

We are particularly interested in extending the functional dimension of BPMN2.0. We then position ourselves on the modeldriven MDA architecture Ensure that models are translated into executable business processes. In fact, at the CIM (Computational Independent Model) level of MDA, Corresponding to the BPM4KI model, the PIM layer (Plateform Independent Model) corresponds to the extended BPMN2.0 meta-model and The PSM level (Platform Specific Model) corresponds to the execution Sensitive business processes. Therefore, modeling and deploying This sensitive process requires the development and implementation of Specific business process management systems that support the definition expand."
pub.1032917995,A Generic Process Data Warehouse Schema for BPMN Workflows,"Companies in dynamic environments have to react to certain market events. Reactions can be short-term and influence the behavior of running process instances or they can be mid-term or long-term and cause the redesign of the process. In both situations, insights into the process flow are necessary and provided by Process Data Warehouse Systems. This paper proposes to derive the data warehouse structures from the meta model of the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), the actual de-facto standard of workflow languages. The resulting data structure is generic in order to be portable between application domains and to be stable in case of changing workflows."
pub.1013723371,An Extended Petri-Net Based Approach for Supply Chain Process Enactment in Resource-Centric Web Service Environment,"Enacting a supply-chain process involves variant partners and different IT systems. REST receives increasing attention for distributed systems with loosely coupled resources. Nevertheless, resource model incompatibilities and conflicts prevent effective process modeling and deployment in resource-centric Web service environment. In this paper, a Petri-net based framework for supply-chain process integration is proposed. A resource meta-model is constructed to represent the basic information of resources. Then based on resource meta-model, XML schemas and documents are derived, which represent resources and their states in Petri-net. Thereafter, XML-net, a high level Petri-net, is employed for modeling control and data flow of process. From process model in XML-net, RESTful services and choreography descriptions are deduced. Therefore, unified resource representation and RESTful services description are proposed for cross-system integration in a more effective way. A case study is given to illustrate the approach and the desirable features of the approach are discussed."
pub.1028744377,Temporal Workflow Modeling and Its Application,"Time-information management in workflow has been recognized as one of the most significant tasks in workflow management. The uncertainties in time and time-related constraints in workflow models should be taken into consideration. This chapter first presents the meta-model of Temporal Workflow by extending and modifying the WfMC’s Basic Process Definition Meta-model. The temporal attributes of elements and their relations in the model are analyzed in detail. Based on the introduction of time constraints on elements in Fuzzy-timing Petri Nets, this chapter proposes a new workflow model named Fuzzy Temporal Workflow Nets (FTWF-nets). The calculation of temporal elements in FTWF-nets is given. Subsequently, time modeling and time possibility analysis of temporal phenomena in FTWF-Nets are investigated. Finally, an example is given to illustrate how to use these methods."

In SOWF-MM, services are regarded as resource, a service is bound to a service role when an abstract workflow process model is instantiated, and services may be invoked by different way according to different activities types. Finally, a WFMS, SOWF-MS, is developed to supporting the execution of workflow process model which accords with the metamodel."

By adopting PNML, tools mainly concentrated on modeling activities should generate PNML files to be analyzed by analysis-specific Petri net tools. In this context, we propose an extension to the PNML based on MOF (Meta Object Facility). The implementation of the MOF metamodel enables us to manager Petri net specifications within MOF repositories. In order to illustrate our approach, we present a case study."
pub.1099670994,An Agile Business Process and Practice Meta-model," Business Process Management (BPM) encompasses the discovery, modelling, monitoring, analysis and improvement of business processes. Limitations of traditional BPM approaches in addressing changes in business requirements have resulted in a number of agile BPM approaches that seek to accelerate the redesign of business process models. Meta-models are a key BPM feature that reduce the ambiguity of business process models. This paper describes a meta-model supporting the agile version of the Business Process and Practice Alignment Methodology (BPPAM) for business process improvement, which captures process information from actual work practices. The ability of the meta-model to achieve business process agility is discussed and compared with other agile meta-models, based on definitions of business process flexibility and agility found in the literature."

In order to facilitate service composition for personalized requests, it is needed to customize business process in an efficient and user-friendly way. Reuse of business process can benefit customization of processes. Since registration is the basis for reusing business process, this paper refines a general metamodel for process model registration to support reuse of heterogeneous business processes. In this way, common structure and semantic of various processes provided by the registration mechanism can help different users discover, reuse and reconstruct required business processes in different levels of and granularity."

It is based on the OntoDLP language, an extension of Disjunctive Logic Programming with object-oriented features. Compared to traditional models, the approach enables knowledge inference on dynamic structures of the process, thanks to the reasoning capabilities of OntoDLP. Moreover, the approach can be also used to redefine and classify existing workflow schemes. Indeed, their execution traces, produced by workflow engines, can be easily imported through the mapping facilities of the underlying metamodel, and eventually organized into taxonomic structures for modeling different execution-patterns."

pub.1173658239,Simplification of Robotic System Model Analysis by Petri Net Meta-Model Property Transfer,"This paper presents a simplification of robotic system model analysis due to
the transfer of Robotic System Hierarchical Petri Net (RSHPN) meta-model
properties onto the model of a designed system. Key contributions include: 1)
analysis of RSHPN meta-model properties; 2) decomposition of RSHPN analysis
into analysis of individual Petri nets, thus the reduction of state space
explosion; and 3) transfer of RSHPN meta-model properties onto the produced
models, hence elimination of the need for full re-analysis of the RSHPN model
when creating new robotic systems. Only task-dependent parts of the model need
to be analyzed. This approach streamlines the analysis thus reducing the design
time. Moreover, it produces a specification which is a solid foundation for the
implementation of the system. The obtained results highlight the potential of
Petri nets as a valuable formal framework for analyzing robotic system
properties."

However, current modeling methods always fall short in describing complex collaboration relationship existing in business process integration in SOA-based collaborative environment. On the basis of existing multi-views business process model, a collaborative business process modeling method is presented to meet the above requirement in this paper. According to the analysis of inter-enterprise collaborative behavior, multi-enterprises collaborative meta-model integrating process, role, service and data is put forward. Then, on the foundation of collaborative meta-model, adopting model mapping method, existing business process model is transformed into multi-views collaborative business process model.

pub.1032919219,Reusing Petri Nets Through the Semantic Web,"The paper presents the Petri net ontology that should enable sharing Petri nets on the Semantic Web. Previous work on formal methods for representing Petri nets mainly defines tool-specific Petri net descriptions (i.e. metamodels) or formats for Petri net model interchange (i.e. syntax). However, such efforts do not provide a suitable model description for using Petri nets on the Semantic Web. This paper uses the Petri net UML model as a starting point for implementing the Petri net ontology. The UML model is then refined using the Protégé ontology development tool and the Ontology UML profile. Resulting Petri net models are represented on the Semantic Web is using XML-based ontology representation languages, Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). We implemented a Petri net software tool as well as tools for the Petri net Semantic Web infrastructure."
pub.1093484350,To trace and guide evolution in configurable process models,"Today, research on business process management (BPM) outlines the importance of business process reuse through reference process models which are interested in capturing common practices of organizations. Consequently, reusing these reference process models stresses the necessity of managing a set of process variants. In this context, configurable process model solutions have been developed to facilitate customization of business process in a specific scenario. However, configurable process model should evolve in order to meet new business requirements. To address this issue, we propose a process patterns based approach for leading configurable process model evolution. For supporting traceability of the transition from a given version of a configurable process model to another, an evolution metamodel has been defined. In this paper, we present i) only one pattern of our proposed patterns system, the Activity substitution process pattern, and ii) a proposition of the evolution metamodel."

This paper suggests how automatically to develop a whole database schema of business process framework. To do this, we apply with Model- To-Text transformation based on metamodel to automatically build the schema based business process model. This procedure is follows: 1) defining each meta-model of the entire structure and of database schema, and 2) also defining model transformation rules for it. With of model transformation rules of this procedure, we can automatically transform through meta-modeling of an integrated information system to the schema based model information table specification defined of the entire layer."
pub.1095531783,A business process modeling approach based on Semantic Event-driven Process Chains,"Business Process Modeling (BPM) is widely acknowledged as the specific technology to analyze and control workflow with flexibility and convenience. With the development of SOA theory and practical exploration, it is challenging for BPM to involve web services and to maintain complex interaction information. Since the lack of method to involve web service semantic in business process, we present the Semantic Event-driven Process Chains (SEPCs) that describe the business process of semantic web services composition. A function metamodel is defined to solve semantic inadequacy in a modeling phase and transforming phase. A mapping rule is defined to identify structure patterns and transform the SEPCs model into WS-BPEL business process model. The experiment takes purchase process of one shipbuilding company as an example to show the practical usability of the integrated modeling approach."
pub.1016839878,Formalising Workflow: A CCS-inspired Characterisation of the YAWL Workflow Patterns,"We present work concerning the formal specification of business processes. It is of substantial benefit to be able to pin down the meaning of business processes precisely. This is an end in itself, but we are also concerned to do so in order that we might prove properties about the business processes that are being specified. It is a notable characteristic of most languages for representing business processes that they lack a robust semantics, and a notable characteristic of most commercial Business Process Management products that they have no support for verification of business process models. We define a high-level meta-model, called Liesbet, for representing business processes. The ontological commitments for Liesbet are sourced from the YAWL workflow patterns, which have been defined from studies into the behavioural nature of business processes. A formal characterisation of Liesbet is provided using Milner’s Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS). In this article, we omit some of the technical details of this characterisation and instead present the essential features by means of an abstract machine language, called LCCS. We also explain how we have facilitated the verification of certain properties of business processes specified in Liesbet, and discuss how Liesbet supports the YAWL workflow patterns. We include a simple three-part example of using Liesbet."

The underlying UML class diagram is formally extended with OCL pre- and postconditions for operations and OCL invariants for system states. The metamodel allows the developer to specify processes, activities in processes and temporal relations between them. Known workflow patterns are formally captured in the metamodel and sophisticated temporal relations between activities can be expressed easily. Development of workflow models is explained as well as process instantiation and process execution on the basis of a tool realizing parts of the UML action semantics. Prototypical process execution and animation allows the designer to discover properties of the designed processes and activities in early phases of the development without the need for building a full implementation."

However, textual use cases have limitation in the synthesis of behavior since they have a poor basis for the formal interpretation. Existing synthesis techniques are either largely manual or focused on the use case interactions. In this paper, we present a framework from a model-based point of view to automatically synthesize system behavior from textual use cases to Petri net model. The generated Petri net model can describe component module interactions, and can be checked with the model checking tools. We have implemented our framework and demonstrated the synthesis process via an example."

So, this paper proposes a workflow knowledge meta-model based on ontology, in order to support the combination of business modeling process and knowledge in the process. With the definition of exact grains meta knowledge object in workflow ontology, it can implement the separation of basic application's objects and meta objects and customization of work flow workflow process.

To keep the consistency of process model from business model to IT model, we propose a pivotal metamodel-centric methodology. It aims at keeping or giving all requisite structural and semantic data needed to perform such transformations without loss of information.

Workflow composition is traditionally addressed in various ways, generally via theorem proving techniques. The originality of this research stems from the observation that building a composite workflow bears strong relationships with finite model search, and that some workflow languages can be defined as constrained object metamodels [1], [2]. This leads to consider the viability of applying configuration techniques to this problem. Our main contribution is to prove the feasibility of such an approach, with some advantages and drawbacks compared to logical based techniques. We present a constrained object model for workflow composition, based upon a metamodel for workflows and ontologies for processes and data flows. Experimental results are listed for a working implementation that generates complex interleaving composite workflows involving transformations, synchronization and branching constructs."

This data may also be used for various types of analysis, such as reasoning, process querying and process mining, which consume different data formats. However, all these structures and formats share a common ground: the business-process model and its instantiation are in each of their kernels. In this paper, we propose the use of a Business-Process Instance Metamodel, which serves as a common interface to perform an independent exploitation of data from the applications that produce the data and those which consume the data. A tool has been implemented as a proof of concept to illustrate the ease of matching the data with the proposed metamodel."

There are many companies and organizations implemented business process oriented information systems. Therefore, the flexibility issues become very important in managing large quantity of business processes because business processes are always changing overtime. There is a need of flexible business process models so that every possible changes can be done easily every time. Flexible business process models are represented by a reconfigurable model. In this paper, we proposed a method to manage business process model variations in order to efficiently develop the business process repository. The variation management is done by storing the common business processes and its variation in the repository. Then, we also propose meta models which contain information about the models stored in the repository. The results show that the meta models support the composition process of a new business process based on the common business process. The variation management has achieved to reduce storage redundancy up to 82%."

pub.1061339181,A Novel Executable Modeling Approach for System-of-Systems Architecture,"A novel executable modeling approach is proposed for system-of-systems architecture by taking full advantage of the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) Meta-model (DM2) and defining the common model transformation specification at the metamodel level. This methodology provides more flexibility and adaptability for the automated construction of executable models directly from the architectural data rather than from static models. More specifically, the architectural data metamodel is first established to guide architectural data modeling of core data elements and associations in DM2 as the common and consistent data dictionary for architecture modeling, while the executable formalism metamodel is designed to formally define executable models. Then, the mapping rules between both metamodels are presented as the common transformation specification regardless of which modeling language or methodology is employed in developing architectural descriptions. Finally, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) technology, like XML schema languages and eXtensible Stylesheet Language specifications, is discussed to facilitate the automated transformation of executable models from architectural instance data. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated using a published example where colored Petri net (CPN) is used as the executable formalism."

For this purpose, it is more efficient to register existent process models into a common process model registry, rather than defining numerous mappings from one modeling language to another. Considering the wide acceptance of BPEL, this paper proposed a common metamodel for process model registration (PMR), and defines the mappings from BPEL to PMR with corresponding mapping rules and algorithms. In this way, BPEL process models can be registered in the process model registry based on PMR automatically, and then the essential data from their registration information can facilitate process discovery across heterogeneous process repositories."

pub.1085459742,Applying the Business Process and Practice Alignment Meta-model: Daily Practices and Process Modelling,"Abstract
                  Background: Business Process Modelling (BPM) is one of the most important phases of information system design. Business Process (BP) meta-models allow capturing informational and behavioural aspects of business processes. Unfortunately, standard BP meta-modelling approaches focus just on process description, providing different BP models. It is not possible to compare and identify related daily practices in order to improve BP models. This lack of information implies that further research in BP meta-models is needed to reflect the evolution/change in BP. Considering this limitation, this paper introduces a new BP meta-model designed by Business Process and Practice Alignment Meta-model (BPPAMeta-model). Our intention is to present a meta-model that addresses features related to the alignment between daily work practices and BP descriptions. Objectives: This paper intends to present a metamodel which is going to integrate daily work information into coherent and sound process definitions. Methods/Approach: The methodology employed in the research follows a design-science approach. Results: The results of the case study are related to the application of the proposed meta-model to align the specification of a BP model with work practices models. Conclusions: This meta-model can be used within the BPPAM methodology to specify or improve business processes models based on work practice descriptions."

We also discussed mappings between those languages and the OWL language. The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate the use of MOF-based languages for developing real-world ontologies. Here we discuss two different ontologies that we developed in different domains. The first example is a Petri net ontology that formalizes the representation of Petri nets, a well-known tool for modeling, simulation, and analysis of systems and processes. This Petri net ontology overcomes the syntactic constraints of the present XMLbased standard for sharing Petri net models, namely Petri Net Markup Language."

This paper presents the applicability of A-Prolog to the representation of business process and multiple aspects of reasoning about processes and effects. Finally, based on BPPA system (Business Process Planning based on A-Prolog) which has been applied in CIS development, an example of applying business process reasoning to workflow planning demonstrates that Mbp can simplify and improve business process representation and analysis of CIS reasonably and effectively."
pub.1113729047,Transformations from SPEM work sequences to BPMN sequence flows for the automation of software development process,"Generally, different companies use distinct software development process. Due to it, OMG has specified an architecture to can define a software development process. This architecture uses a metamodel which is able to be abstracted from particular characteristics and to give the possibility of defining the different software development processes. The Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) is a metamodel used for describing a concrete software development process. Also, the OMG specify a standardized language to model business processes. This language is called Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). In this paper, a formalization of transformations between SPEM and BPMN is specified. The transformations are done using the language of formal specification RSL. One time that we obtain a BPMN specification, it is possible to generate XPDL code or BPEL code. The workflow technology can use this code and execute the process. It allows automate the business process, but in this case, the process is a software development process. Consider that workflow technologies automate, totally or partially, the business processes enabling an interaction between men and machines, under an established set of procedural rules. Such technologies use standard languages, like BPEL or XPDL, to specify the business process which is executed in a workflow engine. The BPMN allows to generate BPEL or XPDL codes. Therefore, if we specify a software development process using SPEM, we will automate this process using the workflow technology due to transformations between SPEM and BPMN done in this paper."
pub.1119517719,Security Policies for WFMS with Rich Business Logic - A Model Suitable for Analysis,"This paper introduces a formal metamodel for the specification of security
policies for workflows in online service systems designed to be suitable for
the modeling and analysis of complex business-related rules as well as
traditional access control. A translation of the model into a colored Petri net
is shown and an example of policy for an online banking system is described. By
writing predicates for querying the resulting state-space of the Petri net, a
connection between the formalized model and a higher-level description of the
security policy can be made, indicating the feasibility of the intended method
for validating such descriptions. Thanks to the independent nature among tasks
related to different business services, represented by restrictions in the
information flow within the metamodel, the state-space may be fractioned for
analysis, avoiding the state-space explosion problem. Related existing models
are discussed, pointing the gain in expressiveness of business rules and the
analysis of insecure state paths rather than simply insecure states in the
proposed model. The successful representation and analysis of the policy from
the example combined with reasonings for the general case attest the adequacy
of the proposed approach for its intended application."

Then the requirements of repository support for workflows are explored and analysed. Based on the requirements, an object oriented design for the repository manager is presented."
pub.1047039542,Exchange of Business Process Models Using the POP* Meta-model,"Enterprise Modelling, in general, and Business Process Modelling, in particular, have been used for decades for different purposes and with interesting results. However, a variety of problems can be identified in this context and many enterprises find it difficult to leverage the full potential and benefits of these technologies. One of the most important problems in this sense is the lack of interoperability among enterprises at the modelling level. Quite a lot of efforts has been carried out in this domain to improve enterprise interoperability at this level. The development of the POP* meta-model is one of these initiatives, which aim to establish a meta-model and a corresponding methodology that enable enterprises to exchange their enterprise models, despite the fact that they use different Enterprise Modelling Tools.In this paper, we present a ‘proof of concept’ of the POP* meta-model focused on the process dimension, which is expected to further our understanding of how this meta-model can be used to exchange different business process models among the partners in networks of collaborative enterprises. Moreover, the work performed in this ‘proof of concept’ has been a valuable aid to validate and improve the development of the POP* meta-model."

The first one defines the most used net types, the second an interchange format for these – both are published. The third part deals with Petri net extensions, in particular structuring mechanisms and the introduction of additional, more elaborate net types within the standard.This paper presents a contribution to elaborate an extension framework for the third part of the standard. This strategy aims at composing enabling rules and augmenting constraints in order to build new Petri net types. We show as a proof of concept how this can be achieved with priorities, times, inhibitor arcs in the context of an interleaving semantics. We then map this framework onto the current standard metamodels."

The workflow modeling language is introduced through its abstract syntax, and an evaluation shows how this language supports known workflow patterns. Some patterns can be expressed easier compared to established languages like EPCs or BPMN. Organizational and data aspects in workflow models can be described on the basis of the presented metamodel. The workflow models can be instantiated and executed with a tool realizing parts of the UML action semantics. At an early stage of design, our workflow models can be evaluated by testing scenarios with the used tool in combination with the developed workflow plugin. Employing the tool, dynamic aspects of the workflow process models together with data and organizational aspects can be evaluated. During execution of the workflow scenarios, the workflow models can be adaptively changed, and data can be captured and evaluated by formulating process mining queries with UML's OCL (Object Constraint Language)."
pub.1014529682,An Extension of BPMN Meta-model for Evaluation of Business Processes,"Business process modeling is used for better understanding and communication of company's processes. Mostly, business process modeling is discussed from the information system development perspective. Execution of a business process involves various factors (costs and time) which are important and should be represented in business process models. Controlling of business units uses post execution analysis for detection of failures for improvement. The process models conceived for information system development are not sufficient for post execution analysis. This paper focuses on the challenges of business process modeling in the post execution context. We provide a meta model for evaluation of a business process and discuss BPMN in this context. We also extend existing BPMN meta model for performance analysis of business processes. The proposed extensions are presented with the help of an example."

pub.1127784800,AutoNet: Meta-model for Seamless Integration of Timed Automata and Colored Petri Nets,"Abstract
Time dependent modeling paradigm has always remained the focus of study for embedded system designers. The reason behind this rationale is that the safety and reliability of real time systems mainly depend on how precisely and accurately the time domain is modeled. Several time-driven models have been proposed and attained the level of maturity through series of developments. The most adopted formal methods are 1) Timed Automata which extends the finite states with finite number of real valued clocks, and 2) Colored Petri net which extends finite set of directed graphs with finite number of tokens coupled with color. In this paper, we proposed a Meta model (named as AutoNet) aimed at integration of timed automata and colored petri net. The main purpose of AutoNet is the transformation i.e. a single design with basic classes and state transition diagrams can be transformed to both timed automata and colored petri net. We performed case study to show proof of our concept prototype at traffic light signal modeling. A single iteration through the AutoNet produced both the timed automata and colored petri net of our test case, which is the validation of our design. AutoNet will serve as an automated ‘what you see is what you get’ (WYSIWYG) tool for embedded system engineers."

After ad-hoc applications development, the Workflow management technology has been developed, reducing costs, increasing efficiency and production quality. However, in order to improve models updating and creation for a faster response to new market requirements, a more organic approach to the reuse of existing models would be essential.In this paper we introduce an object-oriented metamodel for the creation of workflow models, aiming to act as a basis for their effective reuse. In particular, we introduce a set of basic components to define workflow models in a modular fashion. This is needed since process models are not generally reused as a whole; rather each single action making up the process, as well as the flow of execution and the flow of data are all considered separately, in order to isolate and reuse single components or group of components inside a process."

Complex management decision problems may possess characteristics that are difficult to describe fully with any single decision-making framework such as a decision tree or a network model. A Petri Net is a powerful and a highly versatile modeling tool that possesses meta-model capability to replace alternative decision-making frameworks and model complex management decision problems or situations. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to review the properties of Petri Net models in view of management perspectives; and (2) to illustrate their power to describe various decision-making frameworks including decision trees, network models, Markov decision problems and time-table problems. Thus, we illustrate how Petri Net models possess meta-model capability to replace alternative decision-making frameworks."

In this paper, we present ATL transformations providing an integrated structural description of the source and target metamodels and the transformation between them. More specifically, the paper presents translation rules of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) state machines models into a class of non-autonomous Petri net models using ATL. The target formalism for the translation is the class of Input-Output Place Transition Nets (IOPT), which extends the well-known low-level Petri net class of Place/Transition Petri nets with input and output signals and events dependencies. Based on this Petri net class, a set of tools have been developed and integrated on a framework for the project of embedded systems using co-design techniques. The main goal is to benefit from the model-based attitude while allowing the integration of development flows based on SysML state machines with the ones based on Petri nets."

Business Process Management (BPM) is harnessing the continuous changes suffered by organizations in the value chain and, therefore, in their processes. Simulation models offer the ability to experience different decisions and analyze their results in systems where the cost or risk of actual experimentation are prohibitive. BPMN models are not directly executable nor is it possible to simulate their behavior in various input parameters. This paper proposes the application of model-driven engineering (MDE) to integrate the definition of business processes with Discrete- Event Simulation (DES) as a tool to support decision-making. We propose a platform independent DES metamodel and a set of rules, to automatically generate the simulation model from BPMN 2.0 based business process in accordance with previous metamodel."

As the core of ITSM, IT Service Support ensures that the customer has appropriate services to support business function. Therefore, many organizations adopt best practices and tools in order to import IT Service Support normative and efficiency, and IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) has been the international de facto standard. However, current standards and tools are not enough to provide precise, abstract and systematic IT Service Support concepts. Furthermore, process model integration, reuse and exchange still remains a challenge in IT Service Support process development area. In this context, an ITIL-based IT Service Support Process metamodel was presented in this paper. The metamodel extends Business Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM) as an IT Service Support process is also a business process. The metamodel has characteristic of easy operation and simple structure, and it has been preliminary applied in implementation of IT Service Support Process tool. The proposed metamodel soundly support process modeling and business rule customization in the form of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)."
pub.1111002910,Validating the DEMO Specification Language,"The Design and Engineering Method for Organisations (DEMO) is the principal methodology in Enterprise Engineering (EE). The Design and Engineering Method for Organisations Specification Language (DEMOSL) states the rules, legends, and metamodel of DEMO. Therefore, any DEMO model must comply with this specification. Moreover, to enable automation of the DEMO model validation, we need a metamodel that can accurately represent DEMO models. With DEMOSL as the appointed specification language for DEMO, with automation as target, we need to validate the fitness of DEMOSL for modelling DEMO.Our findings provide insight into the amount of changes and the complexity and direction of change to complete the metamodel and make it usable for automation. We found that some incomplete, inconsistent or inadequate specifications in DEMOSL hinder its use as a prescriptive metamodel. We describe these limitations in DEMOSL as a whole and in the separate Construction Model (CM), Process Model (PM), Action Model (AM) and Fact Model (FM).Finally, we conclude that the metamodel needs improvement to be able to model all allowed DEMO models."
pub.1023723338,Modeling functional requirements for configurable content- and context-aware dynamic service selection in business process models,"In this article, we propose a meta-model for formal specification of functional requirements for configurable content- and context-aware dynamic service selection in business process models with the objective to enable greater flexibility of the modeled processes. The dynamic service selection can cope with highly dynamic business environments that today's business processes must handle. Modeling functional requirements for dynamic service selection in business process models is not well covered in literature. Some partial solutions exist but none of them allows modeling a complete set of functional requirements for the selection similar to the one we are addressing in this article. Our meta-model enables formal specification of service selection relevant data extracted from service request message, custom configuration data (e.g., thresholds), process and task definition/instance metadata, and service selection rules. The meta-model is configurable and content- and context-aware. Processes leveraging our meta-model can adapt to changing requirements without redesign of the process flow. Proposed meta-model allows users to additionally configure the models at run time (e.g., raising a threshold). Modeling can be divided into roles with different required competences. We implement our meta-model in BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) through specific extensions to the BPMN semantic and diagram elements. By measuring complexity of real-world sample process models we show that using our solution modelers can efficiently model business processes that need to address frequent changing demands. Compared to available alternatives, models using our solution have on average ∼13% fewer activities, ∼16% fewer control-flow elements and ∼22% fewer control paths. By reading ∼10% smaller models (by volume) model readers get more flexible process models that capture all functional requirements for the dynamic selection."
pub.1094583933,Including workflow concurrent modelling in an extension of the UML activity diagram metamodel,"Summary form only given. A workflow is a business process whose execution is controlled in an automated fashion by a workflow management system (wms). A model of the process to be enacted is supplied to the wms through a specification known as process definition. The format of such definition has been standardized by the workflow management coalition (wfmc) with the purpose of satisfying the need of interaction and connectivity between process definition tools and different workflow systems. The workflow process definition standard is specified by a metamodel and the workflow process definition language (wpdl). Both are isomorphic. In business process modelling, the UML standard notation supports less details than the wfmc standard. A wpdl process definition may contain more information than UML activity diagrams. Therefore, a process specification based on activity diagrams does not satisfy the wfmc standard. We propose the integration of the wfmc and the UML standard, and provide a view of how this integration can be achieved through the extension of the UML activity diagram. The extension proposed neither modifies nor restricts the original UML standard. A model built with this extension is easily translated to the wpdl. We show the extension of the UML activity diagram to include the concepts of concurrency and synchronization of workflow processes. In this way, the process definition in UML activity diagram may be interpreted by any wms."

pub.1143684839,Transformation of sequence diagram to timed Petri net using Atlas Transformation Language metamodel approach,"Abstract Real‐time systems are complex and composed of time‐bounded events that must satisfy the real‐time constraints for their proper functioning. To cope with the complexity of real‐time systems, model‐driven approaches such as model‐driven architecture (MDA) can be followed, which uses the conceptual models for system representation. This paper presents an MDA‐based automated approach for an early stage performance evaluation and verification of a real‐time system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML)/Modeling and Analysis of Real‐Time and Embedded systems (MARTE) sequence diagram. A metamodel‐based model‐to‐model transformation technique is used for mapping the UML/MARTE sequence diagram into the generalized Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) representation of the timed Petri net model using Atlas Transformation Language (ATL). The derived PNML representation has the advantage to support the interoperability between different Petri net tools when compared over the existing methods that produce tool‐specific representation. The proposed approach enables the system designers to create and evaluate alternate system designs and predict their behavior, contributing to improving the system quality. The contribution of the proposed technique for identifying the optimal system design is analyzed using a real‐time embedded sensor application. The proposed transformation approach is also validated using a real‐time system from the manufacturing domain."
pub.1093914019,Action Patterns for the Incremental Specification of the Execution Semantics of Visual Languages,"We present a new approach - based on graph transformation - to incremental specification of the operational (execution) semantics of visual languages. The approach combines editing rules with two meta-models: one to define the concrete syntax and one for the static semantics. We introduce the notion of action patterns, defining basic actions (e.g. consuming or producing a token in transition-based semantics), in a way similar to graph transformation rules. The application of action patterns to a static semantics editing rule produces a meta-rule, to be paired with the firing of the corresponding syntactic rule to incrementally build an execution rule. An execution rule is thus tailored to any active element (e.g. a transition in a Petri net model) in the model. Examples from Petri nets, state automata and workflow languages illustrate these ideas."
pub.1158575289,Towards Business Process Model Extension with Quality Perspective,"Organizations are always looking for enhancing the quality of their products/services in order to improve their competitiveness. The quality of products/services are closely related to the quality of the business process of the organization. Therefore, it is crucial for decision makers to gain insight of the quality perspective of their business process at the model level. Several studies aimed to measure and/or model the quality of a business process. Some of them provide these measures and/or models separately from the business model. Some others integrate quality information into the business process model for a specific modeling notation. This makes the integration of quality information dependent on the modeling notation. However, different notations are used by organizations to model their business processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic approach for business process model extension with quality perspective, at the activity level as a first stage. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) the adaptation of the business process quality meta-model and (2) the proposal of a generic business process meta-model extended with quality perspective at the activity level."
pub.1037258692,Integrating Petri Net Semantics in a Model-Driven Approach: The Renew Meta-Modeling and Transformation Framework,"This paper presents an approach to the development of modeling languages and automated generation of specific modeling tools based on meta-models. Modeling is one of the main tasks in engineering. Graphical modeling helps the engineer not only to understand the system but also to communicate with engineers and with other stakeholders that participate in the development (or analytic) process.In order to be able to provide adequately adapted modeling techniques for a given domain, it is useful to support the development of techniques that are designed for their special purpose, i.e. domain-specific modeling languages (DSML). For this purpose meta-modeling comes in handy. Meta-models provide a clear abstract syntax and model-driven design approaches allow for rapid prototyping of modeling languages. However, the transformation and also the original (source model) as well as the transformed (target) model often do not provide a clear semantics.We present an approach to model-driven development that is based on Petri nets: high- and low-level Petri nets in various formalisms can be used as target models. The presented approach uses ontology-based meta-models, code and graphical templates, as well as custom and predefined transformation engines. The RMT framework provides the generation of modeling tools and the transformation into executable and/or analyzable models based on the defined Petri net semantics."

Business process modeling is typically performed by business analysts and managers from the purpose of transformation of business prospective of Enterprises to the IT prospective. To model business perspective, need of high level Process Model has been raised as Business Process Modeling Notation, BPMN, is considered at low level. Our belief is that the sequencing and alignment of business rule can lay down the construction of High level process model. We have explored the nature of business rule in business and developed a Business rule meta-model to represent them. Thereafter, A Process Template is derived from Business rule meta-model and then Process Template is mapped to High level process model. In this paper we have focused on Business rule meta-model and construction of Process Template. From Process Template to High level process model will be the future work."

For this purpose, we provide model-to-model transformations from ecore IOPT models to a rewriting logic specification in Maude. The transformations are defined as semantic mappings based on the respective metamodels: the IOPT metamodel and the Maude metamodel. Also, we define model to-text transformations for the generation of the model execution code in the rewriting logic framework. Hence, we present a translational semantics composed by two components: (i) the denotational one, considering as semantic domains the operations, equations, and properties that specify the Petri net structure, signals, and events according to the commutative monoid view; and (ii) the operational one, that changes the interleaving semantics of Maude using rewriting rules specified at the Maude metalevel to provide a maximal step semantics for transitions with arcs, test arcs, and priorities. Additionally, this work gives architectural advices in order to compose new semantics specifications by simple component substitution. Due to its simulation and verification capabilities for control systems, the presented work was applied to a domotic project that intends to save energy in residential buildings."
pub.1047773316,Background,"In this chapter we review related work and briefly present approaches and technologies used in the development of the presented approach for multilevel business process modeling and data analysis. Multilevel business process modeling builds on existing research on multilevel domain modeling, especially multilevel objects [76]. The proposed modeling approach qualifies as data- or artifact-centric business process modeling [82] and relies on the notion of behavior-consistent specialization of life cycle models [108]. Multilevel business process models are executable in an automated way, the resulting traces being subject to business process intelligence. The multilevel business process modeling approach relies on UML (with OCL) as modeling language and for the definition of the formal metamodel; XML serves as the format for logical representation."
pub.1095789759,Optimization of the Business Process Metrics Definition according to the BPDM Standard and its Formal Definition in OCL,"Business Process Management combines a vision focused on processes and a functionalities integration view to enhance an organization's effectiveness. It provides ways to implement the processes and provides functionalities to control and modify their workflows. A very useful tool to achieve this control is a set of process models, as they supply a description of the process structure and complexity. Considering the importance of Business Processes models, the use of metrics may be the key to obtain high quality models that are useful as support to improve the processes maintenance, updating and adaptation. Based on metamodels of the BPDM standard, a proposal of metrics for Business Processes models is submitted; these metrics are specified in OCL and their application results are outlined in a study case."
pub.1144361626,Parameterised robotic system meta-model expressed by Hierarchical Petri nets,"The paper presents a model-based approach to developing robotic system controllers. Central to this approach is a parameterised meta-model that describes the generic robotic system from two points of view: structure and activity. By appropriate parameterisation of the meta-model one can obtain a particular model of a robotic system performing desired tasks. The meta-model is expressed using the Robotic System Hierarchical Petri Net (RSHPN), a 6-layer Petri net tailored for robotics. Each layer describes the activity of the robotic system at a completely different level of abstraction. This guarantees the separation of concerns. The required model emerges from the meta-model by appropriate parameterisation of the layers of the RSHPN. Introduction of parameterisation enables the robot designer to focus only on the concepts derived from the domain. It greatly facilitates the robotic system development process as it gives the designer clear guidance on what needs to be defined and what is imposed by the design pattern. The resulting single RSHPN model is used both to verify some properties of the system, e.g. lack of deadlocks, but also to automatically generate controller code. The presented approach is illustrated by examples of the creation of two different robotic systems."
pub.1061794054,A Modeling and Simulation Framework for Health Care Systems,"In this paper, we propose a new modeling methodology named MedPRO for addressing organization problems of health care systems. It is based on a metamodel with three different views: process view (care pathways of patients), resource view (activities of relevant resources), and organization view (dependence and organization of resources). The resulting metamodel can be instantiated for a specific health care system and be converted into an executable model for simulation by means of a special class of Petri nets (PNs), called Health Care Petri Nets (HCPNs). HCPN models also serve as a basis for short-term planning and scheduling of health care activities. As a result, the MedPRO methodology leads to a fast-prototyping tool for easy and rigorous modeling and simulation of health care systems. A case study is presented to show the benefits of the MedPRO methodology."
pub.1061399010,System Prototype and Verification Using Metamodel-Based Transformations,"Mapping domain-specific languages' core concepts into the concurrent object-oriented Petri nets formal specification language provides users with the semantics necessary for developing prototypes for these DSLs. Different knowledge domains demand different types of support from software languages. Domain engineers often use domain-specific languages to overcome this problem. DSLs are difficult to design, implement, and maintain and are often less efficient than hand-coded software. To address some of these problems, we propose transforming a DSL into the concurrent object-oriented Petri nets formalism. The DSL metamodel serves as the transformation's starting point. The transformation represents the semantic mapping between the DSL and CO-OPN. We aim both to provide a formally defined semantics for the DSL and, because we integrate CO-OPN in a framework, to provide the functionalities that allow model verification and fast prototype generation for the DSL"
pub.1037591725,Guidelines of Business Process Modeling,"Process modeling becomes more and more an important task not only for the purpose of software engineering, but also for many other purposes besides the development of software. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the quality of process models from different viewpoints. This is even more important as the increasing number of different end users, different purposes and the availability of different modeling techniques and modeling tools leads to a higher complexity of information models. In this paper the Guidelines of Modeling (GoM)1, a framework to structure factors for the evaluation of process models, is presented. Exemplary, Guidelines of Modeling for workflow management and simulation are presented. Moreover, six general techniques for adjusting models to the perspectives of different types of user and purposes will be explained."
pub.1049862695,Modeling Business Processes in Web Applications with ArgoUWE,"The CASE tool ArgoUWE supports the systematic design of Web applications using the UML-based Web Engineering (UWE) approach. The design methodology of UWE is based on a metamodel which is defined as a lightweight extension of the UML metamodel in the form of a profile and comprises the separate modeling of the different aspects of a Web application: content, structure, layout, and business logic. ArgoUWE is implemented as a plugin into the open-source tool ArgoUML. In this paper, we focus on the latest improvements of the ArgoUWE tool: On the one hand, ArgoUWE supports the design of workflow-driven Web applications where business logic can be captured by process structure and process flow models. On the other hand, ArgoUML’s design critic mechanism has been extended to indicate deficiencies and inconsistencies in UWE models based on the UWE metamodel and its OCL well-formedness rules."

We present a meta-model designed for the performance modeling of network infrastructures in modern data centers. Instances of our meta-model can be automatically transformed into stochastic simulation models for performance prediction. In this paper, we present a transformation to Queueing Petri Nets (QPNs). We show that despite the high level of abstraction of the QPN models, we are able to predict the utilization of resources with good accuracy within a short time."
pub.1012312788,A Framework for Building Mapping Operators Resolving Structural Heterogeneities,"Seamless exchange of models among different modeling tools increasingly becomes a crucial prerequisite for the success of modeldriven engineering. Current best practices use model transformation languages to realize necessary mappings between concepts of the metamodels defining the modeling languages supported by different tools. Existing model transformation languages, however, lack appropriate abstraction mechanisms for resolving recurring kinds of structural heterogeneities one has to primarily cope with when creating such mappings.We propose a framework for building reusable mapping operators which allow the automatic transformation of models. For each mapping operator, the operational semantics is specified on basis of Colored Petri Nets, providing a uniform formalism not only for representing the transformation logic together with the metamodels and the models themselves, but also for executing the transformations, thus facilitating understanding and debugging. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply the proposed framework for defining a set of mapping operators which are intended to resolve typical structural heterogeneities occurring between the core concepts usually used to define metamodels."
pub.1095476248,Transformation of BPMN Subprocesses Based in SPEM Using QVT,"The workflow automate the business process of a organization. Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) is a standard as a specification of any software development process. In particular, the software development processes are business process. This work proposes a solution to automate the management of activities of a software development process specified by SPEM. The SPEM activities are transformed in subprocesses of the standard BPMN. The transformation is done by the language Query/Views/Transformations (QVT). The SPEM, BPMN and QVT have been standardized by Object Management Group (OMG). The target (BPMN) subprocess definition is turned into a specification in a standard language to put in action the workflow processes, such as Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) o XML Process Definition Language (XPDL). In this way, the specification of subprocesses of software development process will executed by Workflow engine. The engine automates any software development process specified by SPEM through its transformation into BPMN subprocesses."
pub.1036548717,Enterprise Model Integration,"Due to rapid changing business requirements the complexity in developing enterprise-spanning applications is continually growing. A vital field of delivering technical concepts and technologies for integrating heterogeneous applications and components to support inter-organisational business processes is the area of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). A common characteristic of all EAI approaches is their focus on technical and runtime aspects of integration. From our project experiences in developing large B2B applications, it is necessary to integrate applications on the business and conceptual level as well. Because of the diversity of models and modelling languages for developing enterprise applications, we propose the Enterprise Model Integration (EMI) approach. In this paper we describe basic concepts of EMI, a pattern system for metamodel integration, and a case study applying EMI for developing B2B applications. The EMI approach is compatible with the MDA infrastructure and implemented within the meta model management tool ADONIS."
pub.1094625400,UML state machine implementation in FPGA devices by means of dual model and Verilog,The paper presents the methodology of the logic controller development process based on the UML state machine diagram. The development process covers the logic synthesis and the implementation by means of the intermediate model based on Petri net formalism. The transformation between these two formal models is performed at the metamodels level according to the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). Semantics of the hierarchical configurable Petri net (HCfgPN) was adopted for the preemption and resumption mechanism. Operational subnet of HCfgPN model may be verified using formal methods.
pub.1004378678,A Data and Event Oriented Workflow Process Definition Metamodel Coherent with the UML Profile for EDOC Systems,"This paper presents a plausible mapping between the adopted UML Profile for EDOC systems and one of the submissions to the OMG’s Request for Proposal for a Workflow Process Definition Metamodel. Then, given that the proposed by DSTC Workflow Process Definition Metamodel does not consider the specification of events therefore in this paper it is suggested a new workflow process definition metamodel that include these aspects with a clear separation of the data and event oriented control flow dependencies and that is compatible with the UML Profile for EDOC systems. Furthermore, in order to build the proposed in this paper workflow definition metamodel as an UML profile, the new workflow metamodel is derived (stereotyped) from the UML 1.4 Activity Graphs. To introduce a representation that be computationally interpretable by a workflow engine a textual notation is introduced to represent a workflow process definition coherent with the proposed Workflow Process Definition Metamodel. As a proof of concept a simple prototype of a workflow engine able to interpret the textual representation of the workflow process definition was implemented in the Java language."
pub.1121692933,ModelFlow: towards reactive model management workflows,"In this paper we propose a domain specific language that enables the description and execution of model management workflows. Our language declares tasks and resources involved in a multi-step model management process and resolves the execution behaviour and order based on dependencies among these components. We describe the abstract and a concrete syntax of the language along with its execution semantics. Then, we demonstrate how the language interpreter can orchestrate and execute a selection model management tasks through a case study of a workflow that generates a graphical editor from a metamodel."
pub.1165183095,Towards a Meta-Modeling Approach for Business Process Models Improvement Based on Ontological Analysis,"Business process modeling enable smoother and more efficient decision making in the organizations as it achieve consistency and standardization of their operations, facilitate communication and collaboration between different stakeholders. Therefore, it is important to be able to model real world aspects. To this end, we have carried out a thorough review of the relevant literature which focuses on real-world aspects that Business process modeling languages BPMLs are not able to model. These aspects are based on ontological analysis and characterization of process modeling constructs. Our research aims to propose an approach for business process model modeling improvement by defining Object Constraint Language OCL rules written at the meta-model level making them independent from specific notations. We exploited IS domain knowledge, defined a meta-model, and added semantics to the meta-model by the mean of OCL constraints. As formalism we use the (OCL) with Ecore from the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)."
pub.1094963459,Definition and Validation of Metrics for ITSM Process Models,"Process metrics can be used to establish baselines, to predict the effort required to go from an “as-is” to a “to-be” scenario or to pinpoint problematic ITSM process models. Several metrics proposed in the literature for business process models can be used for ITSM process models as well. This paper formalizes some of those metrics and proposes some new ones, using the Metamodel-Driven Measurement (M2DM) approach that provides precision, objectiveness and automatic collection. According to that approach, metrics were specified with the Object Constraint Language (OCL), upon a lightweight BPMN metamodel that is briefly described. That metamodel was instantiated with a case study consisting of two ITSM processes with two scenarios (“as-is” and “to-be”) each. Values collected automatically by executing the OCL metrics definitions, upon the instantiated metamodel, are presented. Using a larger sample with several thousand meta-instances, we analyzed the collinearity of the formalized metrics and were able to identify a smaller set, which will be used to perform further research work on the complexity of ITSM processes."
pub.1094299719,Evaluating flexible workflow systems,"Active business process support utilizing workflow technology is promising for building information systems that are flexible regarding both business and corresponding IT infrastructure transformation. To achieve this, conceptual models of work processes have to be aligned with interests of several stakeholders, including business professionals and users. In particular, user access to process models presuppose comprehensible in addition to expressive models. We propose a framework for evaluating quality in process modeling languages (PMLs) and models. It is applied to a representative sample of flexible workflow products and prototypes. We study the properties of the various products' underlying PMLs, and derive their first cut ontology, or meta model. In carrying out the evaluation, we show the applicability of our framework, and point out some research opportunities in areas where the products differ widely or carry similar deficiencies."
pub.1018748177,Heterogeneous Business Process Management: A Metamodel-Based Approach,"Dynamically adapting business process to changing needs, and promptly reacting to events are today key factors to maintain competitiveness in the market. Business Process Management (BPM) is focusing today more and more on a BPM in the large approach to process changes that embrace all of the specific techniques and mechanisms needed to design, enact, execute and monitor processes and process-aware information systems. A novel and promising feature of BPM in the large is the ability to store, aggregate and combine this huge and very diverse amount of data that can enable new ways of analysing current operations and can deliver new business insights. The KITE.IT Project [2] is aimed at facing such challenges in the context of the Italian aerospace industry, using and integrating Open Source tools exclusively. The project has recently deployed its initial open framework offering a robust data integration system in an open and scalable architecture. In such a context a metamodel approach was considered the very first base to design a system apt at integrating data originated from heterogeneous sources. The clear advantage that can be reached is the improvement of the speed and the effectiveness of business operations. The clear advantage, which can be reached, is the improvement of the effectiveness of business operations. This paper, in particular, presents the design process that was implemented in defining the KITE.IT Metrics Metamodel (KMM). A final evaluation of the framework, as it was initially deployed, is also reported."

This approach uses information obtained from user interactions with the ARIS Toolset modeling environment and information from tool documentation. The application of the proposed approach results in language metamodels, clarifying the modeling elements of the ARIS Method and the relationships between these elements. The metamodels serve as a starting point for the definition of the semantics of the language and allow the construction of tools to manage modeling, simulation, analysis and transformation of organizational models and business process models."
pub.1048110813,Generating Business Process Models from Object Behavior Models,"Object-oriented modeling is an established approach to document information systems. In an object model, a system is captured in terms of object types and associations, state machines and collaboration diagrams, among others. Process modeling on the other hand, provides a different approach whereby behavior is captured in terms of activities, flow dependencies, resources, etc. These two approaches have their relative advantages. Also, object models and process models lend themselves to different styles of implementation. In this paper we define a transformation from a meta-model for object behavior modeling to a meta-model for process modeling. The transformation relies on the identification of causal relations in the object model. These relations are encoded in a heuristics net from which a process model is derived and then simplified. Using this transformation, it becomes possible to apply established object-oriented techniques during system analysis and design, and to transform the resulting object models into executable process models that can be deployed in a workflow engine. The proposal has been implemented in an object modeling tool."

There is no public standard traceability metamodel defined for BPMN yet. We present solutions that we have already applied in practice: we improve the traceability of BPMN models by defining derived properties that are calculated by a modeling tool on the fly. In contrast to other existing solutions, this approach does not require additional efforts from users for defining and maintaining traceability, and does not overload projects with redundant information. Using this approach, CASE tool developers are able to supplement their tools with traceability analysis means allowing users to access traceability information easier, to check completeness and correctness of BPMN models, and to analyze the impact of changes."
pub.1073673445,Exploring the Potential of Dynamic Perspective Taking on Business Processes,"Although many organizations have started to work with business process models in their operational practice, they have not explored the entire potential of intertwining business process modeling with organizational development. Process specifications contain workflows that require execution, in order to achieve business objectives and support business operation effectively. With the advent of Subject-oriented and Social Business Process Management, communication and stakeholder interaction have become novel perspectives on how to design and implement processes. They go beyond formal responsibilities encoded in functional roles, and are not very common across organizational hierarchies. However, stakeholders, including organizational developers and IT specialists, can be supported looking at processes and their execution from either perspective, namely, from a traditional one, focusing on functions and task accomplishment, and from an interactional perspective, focusing on communication among stakeholders and system interactions. The introduced dual-mode workflow execution engine UeberFlow allows considering both perspectives during process runtime, thus, checking operational completeness from either perspective. Stakeholders can start modeling with a perspective they are familiar with and subsequently proceed with the another one by switching dynamically to an alternate mode of execution. The presented meta-model and architecture of such a dual mode support tool enables coupling business process management directly with organizational development."

applications to the world wide web or to business process modeling. Workflow
composition is traditionally addressed in various ways, generally via theorem
proving techniques. Recent research observed that building a composite workflow

pub.1052967865,The ePNK: An Extensible Petri Net Tool for PNML,"The Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) is an XML-based interchange format for all kinds of Petri nets, which is an ISO/IEC International Standard 15909-2 now. The focus of this standard is on PNML as an interchange format for high-level Petri nets. PNML, however, is more general and allows exchanging all kinds of Petri nets. To this end, PNML introduced the concept of Petri Net Type Definitions.There are many tools supporting one form of PNML or another. In particular, there is the PNML Framework, which helps tool developers implementing an interface to PNML by providing a framework and an API for loading and saving Petri net documents in PNML. This framework is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and has the focus on the underlying meta-models of Petri nets. The PNML Framework, however, is not generic in the following sense: Whenever a new Petri net type is created, the code for the complete tool needs to be regenerated. Moreover, the PNML Framework does not come with a graphical editor.The ePNK overcomes these limitations: It provides an extension-point so that new Petri net types can be plugged into the ePNK without touching the code of the ePNK. For defining a new Petri net type, the developer, basically, needs to give a class diagram defining the concepts of the new Petri net type, along with a mapping of these concepts to XML syntax. This type can then be plugged into the ePNK, and its graphical editor will be able to edit nets of this new type with all its features. This paper present the main idea of the ePNK, and how to use and extend it."

The work consists of transforming the SPEM specification of the SmallRUP development methodology to be used as an input of a Standard Workflow Engine. For this purpose, a transformation was used defined in Relations language, which is part of the Query/Views/Transformations (QVT). Such transformation has been specified in former research works and converts a SPEM specification into a process specification in Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). The BPMN specification is the base to specify with the process editor of Bonita tool, the business process that represents SmallRUP, and this way, manage with a Standard Workflow Engine, included in Bonita, a development project that is managed following the SmallRUP methodology."

Fabric processes do not directly pursue a business goal, but IT-related goals such as the creation of a cloud-service or its configuration. Fabric-processes differ from business processes in their meta-model. Fabric processes include resources and operations not found in business processes. The meta-model developed enables the proper specification of fabric-processes. We address requirements for specifying fabric-processes by so-called Fabric-Process Patterns.

pub.1029337633,Z and high level Petri nets,"High level Petri nets have tokens with values, traditionally called colors, and transitions that produce tokens in a functional way, using the consumed tokens as arguments of the function application. Large nets should be designed in a topdown approach and therefore we introduce a hierarchical net model which combines a data flow diagram technique with a high level Petri net model. We use Z to specify this net model, which is in fact the metamodel for specific systems. Specific models we specify partly by diagrams and partly in Z. We give some advantages and disadvantages of using Z in this way. Finally we show how to specify systems by means of an example."

pub.1031783679,Engineering Adaptive IT Service Support Processes Using Meta-modeling Technologies,"IT service support is a process-oriented practice that strives to manage the efficient supply of IT services with guaranteed quality. Many organizations adopt best practices and tools in order to improve the maturity of IT service support processes. However, when existing solutions and methodologies are applied in various organizations, the customization efforts and costs are usually large. And also dynamic changes during IT service support process execution can’t be supported by almost all of the existed tools. Furthermore, process model integration, reuse and exchange still remain challenges in IT service support process modeling area. In this context, an IT service support process metamodel is presented in this paper. The metamodel extends a generic business process definition metamodel – BPDM, through its domain characteristics. Based on the proposed metamodel, we develop a flexible IT service support process engineering platform, which integrates and automates IT service support processes including incident, problem, change, release and configuration management. In contrast to other IT service support tools, besides process modeling and enactment, it can evolve the metamodel, interchange process models with other tools through metamodel parsing adapter flexibly, and also support adaptive process management via metamodel-based ECA rules."

                    Purpose
                    The authors use the extension mechanism provided by the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) to define roles, which allows roles to be fully aligned with the BPMN standard. The authors describe how a pattern can be defined in terms of roles and present the formal semantics of pattern realization and refinement to support systematic reuse of patterns in business process development.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    It is widely agreed that the use of business process patterns improves the efficiency and quality of business process development. However, few techniques are available to describe business process patterns at an appropriate level of abstraction to facilitate the reuse of patterns. To address this, this paper presents the role-based Business Process Model and Notation (R-BPMN), an extension of BPMN for abstract modeling of business process patterns based on a novel notion of role.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The authors apply R-BPMN in case studies for pattern realization and refinement and discuss tool support via an existing tool. The case studies demonstrate the practical benefits of R-BPMN in capturing pattern variability and facilitating pattern reuse.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The findings imply a potential impact of R-BPMN on practical benefits when it is supported at the metamodel level in tool development.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    This study addresses the need for abstract modeling of process patterns at the metamodel level, which facilitates the formalization of pattern variability and tool development to support various realizations of process patterns at the model level.

pub.1095333724,Developing a Process-Oriented Notation for Modeling Operational Risks - A Conceptual Metamodel Approach to Operational Risk Management in Knowledge Intensive Business Processes within the Financial Industry,"According to the Basel II committee operational risks are the least understood and manageable risks in banks. Operational risks in banks are closely linked to the underlying business process landscape. Recently, researchers have suggested to model this process landscape in banks with new semantic business process modeling approaches. These enable banks not only to model their business processes more efficiently, but also analyze them in a (semi-)automatic way for multiple purposes (e.g. process weakness identification, IT investment decisions etc.). In this paper we extend such a semantic business process modeling language (SBPML) for banks by a risk view for modeling and analyzing operational risks in business process models from a conceptual modeling perspective. As a result of a case study at a bank, seeking to combine business process management and risk management in an integrated approach, we present an enhanced metamodel of the SBPML, which enables banks to model and analyze their processes and operational risks in a holistic way."

Finally the business rules are integrated with business process model to maintain the semantics of process model completely. With the implementation of a prototype of the REPC-based modeling platform and a purchase process example, the correctness and the practical usability of the modeling framework has been verified. REPC provides a new framework for business process modeling in SOA information system."
pub.1121664141,A Formalization Model Transformation Approach on Workflow Automatic Execution from CIM Level to PIM Level,"Model transformation is a keystone in carrying out model-driven development. Currently, many studies have focused on model transformation, those researches study the automatic transformation from PIM to PSM and from PSM to code, but only few have dealt with how the CIM-level model is automatically mapped onto the PIM-level model. Even though some studies have proposed the semi-automatic transformation from CIM-level model to PIM-level model, only few mechanisms are discussed to protect the consistency between the CIM-level model and the PIM-level model in these researches because notation specification of these CIM-level model and PIM-level model does not contain precise semantics. Focusing on workflow perspective, this paper proposes an automatic model transformation approach, which applies a formal model to define the automatic mapping of the workflow from CIM-level model to PIM-level model. This proposal extends Petri nets model elements to define a bridge model, then we use this bridge model to link the CIM-level model (BPMN) and PIM-level model (SCM) following model-driven approach. The metamodels, the transformation rule and the transformation plug-ins have been defined in Eclipse Modeling Framework. Meanwhile, the plug-ins have been empirically validated by a Travel Agency case study. This study shows that using extended Petri nets model as a bridge model to define an automatic model transformation between CIM-level model and PIM-level model is feasible. This approach by means of formal model can ensure the correctness and completeness of the target model, and it can also maintain the consistency between the source model and target model."
pub.1135026136,Resilient Business Process Modeling and Execution Using BPMN and Microservices,"Process Modeling Languages (PMLs) help to define, structure and organize operational workflows. The Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN), one of the most prominent PMLs, allows the definition and execution of process models including distributed participants and systems. An increasing number of BPMN use cases take place in unreliable communication environments, where connectivity may be intermittent or broken. Resilient processes need to avoid failures that may result in process interruptions or complete breakdowns.Considering the particular requirements of unreliable communication environments, this paper addresses shortcomings when modeling and executing business processes. With resilient BPMN (rBPMN), the BPMN meta model is extended to allow resilient process designs by domain experts. Exemplary realizations of the introduced resilience strategies use state of the art technologies such as microservices and container virtualization. A proof-of-concept implementation illustrates the resilient design and execution of process models, serving as a guide for other use cases exposed to unreliable communication."
pub.1016964531,Computer Aided Multi-paradigm Modelling to Process Petri-Nets and Statecharts,"This paper proposes a Multi-Paradigm approach to the modelling of complex systems. The approach consists of the combination of meta-modelling, multi-formalism modelling, and modelling at multiple levels of abstraction. We implement these concepts in AToM3, A Tool for Multi-formalism, Meta-Modelling. In AToM3, modelling formalisms are modelled in their own right at a meta-level within an appropriate formalism. AToM3 uses the information found in the meta-models to automatically generate tools to process (create, edit, check, optimize, transform and generate simulators for) the models in the described formalism. Model processing is described at a meta-level by means of models in the graph grammar formalism. As an example, meta-models for both syntax and semantics of Statecharts (without hierarchy) and Petri-Nets are presented. This includes a graph grammar modelling the transformation between Statecharts and Petri-Nets."
pub.1100928151,The Research on Workflow Meta-Model Based Modeling of Joint Operation Command Process,"Command process of Joint operations throughout the lifecycle of joint operations. For the dynamic development of the command process execution order and semi-automatic/automated command process management, we introduce workflow technology and methods. In order to meet the dynamic variations of the process definition in the workflow system, this paper analyzes the dynamic characteristics of the workflow technology, which is based on the concept of joint operation, and proposes the mapping of the hierarchical decomposition model for the joint operation to the application requirements. According to the above study, the workflow process definition meta-model that was put forward by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) has been improved in the paper. While the workflow process definition language (XPDL) is a kind of text description language that is based on the meta-model, thus the XPDL demands to be extended accordingly. These improvements and extension make the rectification of both the definition state and the running state process model more flexible. Through these improvements and extensions, the modification of the process model becomes more flexible. The workflow management system based on the improved meta-model is both flexible and fully embodies the dynamic characteristics of the workflow, which is more suitable for the workflow system and apply on a more complex command process."
pub.1093214085,A Metamodel Based Perspective on the Adaptation of a Semantic Business Process Modeling Language to the Financial Sector,"Process modeling is an important prerequisite to process reorganization and management. As a result, many companies have spent much effort on process documentation, while hardly gaining equivalent benefits in the analysis and usage of the resulting process models. To balance the cost-benefit-ratio of process modeling projects with respect to their later usage, especially regarding automatic process model analysis (i.e. for optimization purposes etc.), new domain-specific and thus semantic business process modeling languages (SBPML) have been proposed for selected domains. In this paper we investigate the adaptability of SBPML from the public sector to the banking sector from the perspective of the language's metamodel, since banks are currently highly involved in modeling initiatives to industrialize and optimize their process landscapes and are unsatisfied with existing modeling approaches regarding the cost-benefit-ratio of modeling. While taking a metamodel perspective on the language artifact itself, we derive requirements for process modeling from the domain of financial institutions and present findings on the adaptation of SBPML, giving a complete conceptual model of the SBPML method for banks."
pub.1094556087,BPMN4CP: Design and Implementation of a BPMN Extension for Clinical Pathways,"The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for business process modeling that is very common in professional practice due to its expressiveness, the well defined meta model and the possibility of workflow integration. This research article aims to apply the BPMN for the representation of clinical pathways in order to utilize its benefits in the clinical context. BPMN provides a set of generic process modeling elements what makes it necessary to extend the language by domain-specific concepts from the field of clinical pathways (e.g., evidence indicators). Therefore, the extension method of Stroppi Et Al. (2011) was applied and extended in order to facilitate a systematic design and development. This research article provides the analysis of requirements and relevant concepts for modeling clinical pathways. Based on a domain ontology, need for extension is identified and the valid BPMN extension meta model is designed by the construction of a conceptional domain model and the corresponding BPMN extension model. The evolved extension “BPMN4CP” is demonstrated by an example process of wisdom tooth treatment."
pub.1003128838,"Modeling Human Aspects of Business Processes – A View-Based, Model-Driven Approach","Human participation in business processes needs to be addressed in process modeling. BPEL4People with WS-HumanTask covers this concern in the context of BPEL. Bound to specific workflow technology this leads to a number of problems. Firstly, maintaining and migrating processes to new or similar technologies is expensive. Secondly, the low-level, technical standards make it hard to communicate the process models to human domain experts. Model-driven approaches can help to easier cope with technology changes, and present the process models at a higher level of abstraction than offered by the technology standards. In this paper, we extend the model-driven approach with a view-based framework for business process modeling, in which models can be viewed at different abstraction levels and different concerns of a model can be viewed separately. Our approach enables developers to work with meta-models that represent a technical view on the human participation, whereas human domain experts can have an abstract view on human participation in a business process. In order to validate our work, a mapping to BPEL4People technology will be demonstrated."

Our general methodology is based on the principles of the MDA paradigm, distinguishing between platform specific (PSM), platform independent (PIM) and computation independent (CIM) models, and on the general philosophy of solving integration problems on higher levels of abstraction. The basic models and metamodels on CIM, PIM and PSM level, forming the pre-requisite for our further project work, are examined in this article."
pub.1107953787,MFI-5 Based Similarity Measurement of Business Process Models,"With the increasing use of business process model management techniques, a large number of business process models are being developed in the industry, so the corresponding enterprises and organizations usually need to maintain a large business process set. An approach is presented based on the Meta-model for process model registration (MFI-5) to accurately measure the similarity of process models. First, based on MFI-5, the Process Model Description Framework (PMDF) is constructed. According to PMDF, a similarity feature set of the process model (SFS) is defined. Second, the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is utilized to describe corresponding business process, and the BPMN models are obtained. Further the BPMN models are identified and quantified by using SFS, so the model vectors are obtained. At last, the Tanimoto Coefficient-based algorithm is utilized to calculate the similarity between any two vectors, the similarity measure matrix of the BPMN models can be extracted. We illustrate the approach in the context of measuring the similarity of the online sales service processes, the result of which shows that the proposed approach can facilitate business process recommendation."

This interest deals more particularly with situation where the spatial and temporal components make a great part of the system to model (for example systems of production). Within the framework of this article, we will be interested in the production systems where the multi-agent systems are well suited to model phenomena in which the interactions between diverse entities are so complicated to be expressed by classic mathematical tools. This paper proposes an approach based on the producer consumer computing problem and Petri net tool to present an oriented Petri net meta-model to model a production multi-agent system."
pub.1158575350,An MDA Approach for Extending Functional Dimension for Sensitive Business Processes Execution,"In this research paper, we have proposed a rigorous scientific approach to ensure the transformation of the extended BPMN2.0 meta-model into an executable business process model. We are particularly interested in the extension of the functional dimension of BPMN2.0. Subsequently, we based ourselves on the MDA model-driven architecture to ensure the transformation of models to an executable business process. Indeed, the CIM level (Computaional Independant Model) of MDA, corresponds to the BPM4KI model, the PIM level (Plateform Independant Model) corresponds to the extended BPMN2.0 meta-model and the PSM level (Plateform Specific Model) corresponds to the execution of sensitive business processes. Thus, the modeling and deployment of such sensitive processes requires the development and implementation of a specific business process management system that supports the defined extensions."
pub.1094732850,Supporting the SPEM with a UML Extended Workflow Metamodel,"The specification, analysis, and administration of business processes have charged great importance in this last time. This has been caused by a competitive industry necessity, dynamics, where she use the available resources efficiently. The “Workflow” technologies has given answer to these requirements, offering support for the partial or total automation of production processes. The necessities of software industry are not different. In constant search of quality products, engineers and analysts work optimizing software methodologies development. In this paper we propose a mapping between two metamodels used for the business processes specification. The first metamodel, is Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) for development processes modeling. The second, UML Extended Workflow Metamodel (UML-EWM), is a extension of Unified Modeling Language Metamodel (UML) for workflows processes modeling. With this mapping we propose to incorporate the characteristics of workflow process to software development process modeled in SPEM. This facilitates the automation of development processes with workflow technologies."
pub.1006562324,Managing Model Adaptation by Precise Detection of Metamodel Changes,"Technological and business changes influence the evolution of software systems. When this happens, the software artifacts may need to be adapted to the changes. This need is rapidly increasing in systems built using the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm. An MDE system basically consists of metamodels, terminal models, and transformations. The evolution of a metamodel may render its related terminal models and transformations invalid. This paper proposes a three-step solution that automatically adapts terminal models to their evolving metamodels. The first step computes the equivalences and (simple and complex) changes between a given metamodel, and a former version of the same metamodel. The second step translates the equivalences and differences into an adaptation transformation. This transformation can then be executed in a third step to adapt to the new version any terminal model conforming to the former version. We validate our ideas by implementing a prototype based on the AtlanMod Model Management Architecture (AMMA) platform. We present the accuracy and performance that the prototype delivers on two concrete examples: a Petri Net metamodel from the research literature, and the Netbeans Java metamodel."

In our method the produced UML models are precisely defined by means of a metamodel, a set of constraints, and a limited set of UML constructs to help modellers to avoid common mistakes and to guarantee, by construction, a good quality.

It is based on a framework consisting of the layers business plan, business process model, and business application system as well as views on these layers focusing on specific aspects. This contribution presents the SOM language for business process modeling and shows how business application systems can be linked to business process models. The language uses concepts of systems theory and is based on the notions of business object, business transaction, task, event, and service. Business objects are coordinated by feedback control or by negotiation. Decomposition rules allow a stepwise refinement of a business process model.

pub.1025522988,Transformation in QVT of Software Development Process based on SPEM to Workflows,"This work provides a solution to automate the software development processes specified by the software process engineering metamodel (SPEM). To achieve this automation, the software development activities specified in SPEM are transformed in a subprocess specification of the Business Process Modeling notation (BPMN) defined by object management group (OMG), this transformation is done by Relations language which belongs to Query/Views/ Transformations (QVT). The obtained BPMN subprocess definition is turned into a specification in a standard language to put in action the workflow processes, such as Business process execution language for Web services (BPEL4WS) o XML Process definition language (XPDL). Therefore, in this way, the specification for the language to be implemented will be the input to a Workflow engine. Not only is the automation of the transformation achieved by this specification, but also, and basically, the automation of any software development process specified by SPEM through its transformation into BPMN subprocesses."
pub.1121800187,What's My Process Model Composed of? A Systematic Literature Review of Meta-Models in BPM,"Business process modelling languages typically enable the representation of
business process models by employing (graphical) symbols. These symbols can
vary depending upon the verbosity of the language, the modeling paradigm, the
focus of the language, and so on. To make explicit the different constructs and
rules employed by a specific language as well as bridge the gap across
different languages, meta-models have been proposed in literature. These
meta-models are a crucial source of knowledge on what state-of-the-art
literature considers relevant to describe business processes. Moreover, the
rapid growth of techniques and tools that aim at supporting all dimensions of
business processes and not only its control flow perspective, as for instance
data and organisational aspects, makes even more important to have a clear
idea, already at the conceptual level, of the key process constructs. The goal
of this work is to provide the first extensive systematic literature review
(SLR) of business process meta-models. This SLR aims at answering research
questions concerning: (i) the kind of meta-models proposed in literature; (ii)
the recurring constructs they contain; (iii) their purposes; and (iv) their
evaluations. Thirty-six papers were selected and evaluated against four
research questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of
work conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular,
while traditional paradigms towards business process modelling, and aspects
related to the business process control flow seem to be well present, novel
paradigms and aspects related to the organisational, data and goal-oriented
aspects of business processes seem to be still under-investigated."
pub.1095862123,Preliminary validation of the metamodel for developing learning ecosystems,"Learning ecosystems are positioned as a technological solution able to provide learning environments that evolve over time to cover the changing needs of users or include new tools for knowledge management. The definition, development and deployment of this type of software solutions is complex and involves several problems identified and analyzed in previous works. In order to solve these problems, an architectural pattern based on Buschmann's Layers pattern has been defined. The accumulated experience developing learning ecosystems along with the problems analysis using Business Process Model and Notation and the architectural pattern, have provided a knowledge base to define an ecosystems metamodel. The proposed metamodel provides a framework for Model-Driven Development of learning ecosystems. The main objective of the present work is to validate the ecosystems metamodel from modeling a learning ecosystem."
pub.1104645584,BPMN extensions for automating cloud environments using a two-layer orchestration approach,"Cloud orchestration describes the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex cloud systems, middleware and services, and is realized by orchestrating workflows. To achieve an end-to-end cloud orchestration, workflow designers usually have to cope with integration challenges between two different technologies – one that entails technical cloud orchestration and another comprising business-level orchestration. This however presents a complex undertaking for workflow designers, as they have to gain sufficient knowledge and expertise of two diverse technologies in order to automate cloud-specific tasks across two different domains. Introduction of a unified orchestration platform would solve these issues, as it would deliver a common vocabulary for different types of workflow designers and would provide them with a single platform for orchestrating both business and technical activities, without having to face the integration complexities. The main objective of this paper is to provide support for cloud-specific workflows in BPMN business process engines. To achieve this objective we (1) define a meta-model for modeling cloud workflows, (2) extend BPMN 2.0.2 specification to orchestrate cloud-specific workflow activities, and (3) implement a meta-model with BPMN extensions by showing how cloud orchestration workflow elements (i.e. activities and workflow control) map onto extended BPMN elements. As a part of the evaluation we measure process size and complexity of two process models using various process metrics. The results have shown that when using our proposed BPMN extensions, the overall size and complexity of the use case process under test has been reduced by more than half on an average. We also improve the readability of BPMN process."
pub.1016320998,Model transformations for Business-IT alignment,"Modeling business process allows an organization to think about its way of conducting business while helping discover weakness in its processes. Although it is common for participants to collaborate within an organization, it is essential to define how different participants from different organizations collaborate as a community, to reach a common business goal. In this context, the realization of business processes by means of services becomes more important, providing support for separating their definition from the technologies implementing them, allowing a better response to changes. A model-driven approach for the direct generation of services from business processes provides several advantages such as reuse of the knowledge imbibed in the correspondences defined between the involved metamodels and traceability between elements in both metamodels, allowing for a better Business-IT alignment. In this article we present an approach for the automatic generation of SoaML service-oriented models from collaborative business process models in BPMN2."
pub.1091213570,A BPMN Extension for Integrating Knowledge Dimension in Sensitive Business Process Models,"While importance of knowledge dimension is well recognized, there is no clear theoretical background and successful practical experiments of inclusion and integration of this dimension in BP meta-models and BPM formalisms. This paper proposes to extend the well-known Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN 2.0) with the knowledge dimension so that using a common modeling formalism it would be possible to relate the various types of knowledge, information and data to the business process model. This extension, called «BPMN4KM», is designed methodically by application of the extension mechanisms of BPMN 2.0. We aim at incorporating relevant issues at the intersection of knowledge management (KM) and business process modeling (BPM) in order to enrich the graphical representation of sensitive Business processes (SBPs) and improve the localization and identification of crucial knowledge mobilized and created by these processes. Besides, we evaluate the relevance of BPMN4KM concepts through a real SBP scenario from medical domain."
pub.1104378469,Towards a Risk-Aware Business Process Modelling Tool Using the ADOxx Platform,"Abstract
Business Process modelling is a key element in the management of organizations. It allows to build an analytical representation of ‘as-is’ processes in an organization and compared it with ‘to-be’ processes for improving their efficiency. Besides, although, risk is an element that can affect business process negatively, it is still managed independently. A necessary link is missing between business process and risk models. To better manage risk related to business process, it should be integrated and evaluated dynamically within the business process models. Currently, there are different meta-models allowing business process modelling. Nevertheless, there are few meta-models allowing risk modelling and even fewer ones that integrate both concepts related to risks and business processes. Based on this need and these observations, we propose, in this work, a risk-aware business process modelling tool using the ADOxx meta-modelling platform."
pub.1171138782,Leveraging the industrial internet of things for business process improvement: a metamodel and patterns,"Industrial organizations of all kinds increasingly recognize the industrial internet of thing’s (IIoT) capabilities to enable valuable business process improvement (BPI). However, both theoretically and practically, there is a lack of clarity regarding the systematic and successful identification, specification, and implementation of corresponding applications. This article aims to bridge this research gap by presenting a comprehensive metamodel encompassing all relevant aspects and elements of IIoT applications with BPI propositions. The metamodel is the foundation for deriving generic yet practical patterns that can assist organizations in effectively executing IIoT projects. To evaluate the usefulness of the approach, five initial patterns were designed and applied by a market-leading organization. The metamodel and patterns contribute to the descriptive knowledge of the IIoT and facilitate sense-making, theory-led design, and practical project execution. To ensure rigor, the research endeavor followed fundamental principles of the design science research (DSR) methodology."
pub.1106903622,An approach for business process model registration based on ISO/IEC 19763-5,"To facilitate business collaboration and interoperation among enterprises, it is critical to discover and reuse appropriate business processes modeled in different languages and stored in different repositories. However, the formats of business process models are very different, which makes it a challenge to fuse them in a unified way without changing their original representations and semantics. To solve this problem, this paper uses semantic interoperability technique which is able to transform heterogeneous process models into uniform registered items. Based on the general and unambiguous metamodel for process model registration (PMR for short) in ISO/IEC 19763-5 that we proposed before, in this article, we provide a generic process model registration framework for registering heterogeneous business process models to facilitate semantic discovery of business processes across enterprises, and promote process interoperation and business collaboration. Considering that Event-driven Process Chain (EPC) is a popular process model widely used in the industry, we focus on the mapping rules and related specific transformation algorithms from EPC to PMR as an instantiation of our framework and develop an automatic process model registration tool for EPC. Moreover, we conduct a series of experiments to verify the correctness and efficiency of our proposed framework by leveraging the real data set of 604 EPCs from SAP."

pub.1041591778,Aligning Business Process Models and Domain Knowledge: A Meta-modeling Approach,"In recent years the problems related to modeling and improving business processes have been of growing interest. Indeed, companies are realizing the undeniable impact of a better understanding and management of business processes (BP) on the effectiveness, consistency, and transparency of their business operations. BP modeling aims at a better understanding of processes, allowing deciders to achieve strategic goals of the company. However, inexperienced systems analysts often lack domain knowledge leading and this affects the quality of models they produce. In this paper we propose to support this modeling effort with an approach that uses domain knowledge to improve the semantic quality of BP models. This approach relies on domain ontologies as a mean to capture domain knowledge and on meta-modeling techniques. The main contribution of this paper is threefold: 1) the metamodels describing both a domain ontology and a BP model are described, 2) the alignment between the concepts of both meta-models is defined and illustrated, 3) a set of OCL mapping rules is provided. A simple case study illustrates the process."

In this paper, we propose a framework to transform automatically UML activity diagram 2.0 (informal notation) to Petri Nets (formal notation) for the analysis purpose using INA analyzer tool. This transformation helps the software designers to analyze and verify properties. For realizing this transformation, we have proposed a meta-model for UML-AD and another one for PN.

We present a consistency checking framework to resolve the problems for service-based application. Firstly, based on business model analysis, a Multi-View business meta-model is built to act as a referred framework to find out relationships between different business elements. Then the meta-model is served as the basic criterion to check consistency of different business models. Next the integrity and consistency algorithms are proposed to cope with the Multi-View models. By means of our algorithms, inaccurate and lost relationship will be found and rebuilt at the same time. Lastly, a transportation process of one Logistics Company is given as a case study to verify the practical usability of the checking consistency framework. The result shows the proposed framework is a feasible method to cope with Multi-View models in Business Process Model Repository."
pub.1107891000,Applying Software Metrics to evaluate Business Process Models,"In this paper, we define a set of metrics for the evaluation of conceptual models of business processes. The proposal supposes the adaptation and extension of the FMESP framework (Framework for the Modeling and Evaluation of Software Processes). This adaptation can be carried out thanks to the similarities that exist between both types of processes (software and business). FMESP includes a set of metrics, which provide the quantitative basis necessary to find out the maintainability of the software process models. This proposal has been used as the starting point in proposing a set of metrics for the evaluation of the complexity of business process models defined by BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). Moreover, the groups of metrics of FMESP have been extended. This is because the models of business processes represented in BPMN include quite a number of aspects of interest in this domain which are not considered in software processes modelled with SPEM (Software Process Engineering Metamodel)."
pub.1006491994,M3D,"Nowadays, Web Applications (WAs) are complex software systems, used by multiple users with different roles and often developed to support and manage business processes. Due to the changing nature of the supported processes, WAs need to be easily and quickly modified, to adapt and align them to the processes they support. In recent years, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches have been proposed and used to develop and evolve WAs. However, the definition of appropriate MDE approaches for the development of flexible process-centric WAs is still limited. In particular, (flexible) workflow models have never been integrated with the models (e.g., presentation, information models) used in MDE approaches to develop this type of applications. In this paper, we present M3D (Model Driven Development with Declare), a tool for developing WAs that integrates three MDE metamodels used to represent the main components of a WA with the metamodel of Declare, a declarative language to model business processes. The tool exploits and combines the declarative nature of Declare and the advantages of MDE to get an efficient roundtrip engineering support to develop and evolve flexible process-centric WAs."

Specifically, the pattern-based adaptation of reference workflows to changing data contexts allows for a better modeling of variance and its evolution over time than traditional approaches. We recently presented variant ${BPMN}\ (vBPMN)$ I as an extended business process metamodel for realizing suchlike flexible and event-aware workflows by the rule-based application of reusable BPMN adaptation patterns to a reference workflow at runtime. However, as for vBPMN and in general, increased modeling flexibility usually comes at the cost of an increased danger of defining inconsistent business logic. Therefore we reviewed literature in order to create a generic taxonomy of potential anomalies which can occur when mixing graph-and rule-based business logic, comprising control-flow, rule-base and data-flow issues. To tackle these issues concretely for control-flow and rule-base issues in vBPMN, we developed a checking pipeline using the vBPMN metamodel and OCL to identify special structural error spots in a vBPMN model and a subsequent selective rule condition checking. In this paper we discuss by which means the most challenging anomalies can be prevented throughout the checking pipeline. The pipeline itself has been implemented by integrating eCore/oclInEcore facilities with the jBoss Drools Rule Verifier."
pub.1024470151,5 Modeling Processes,"This chapter describes process modeling, starting with some terminological aspects. Workflows are presented as special perception of processes. Business processes have proved to be an adequate paradigm in describing value-creating activities within and among enterprises in both the old economy and the new economy. Most often, processes are regarded as sequence of intra- or inter-organizational activities, tasks, or functions that represent some value creation. An important aspect in process analysis, modeling, and implementation is the ability to handle any change to the process design over time. The concept of a “workflow” reflects the traditional view of the implementation of processes in organizational environments. The prevailing workflow metaphor depicts a business process as a stream or flow of documents, and/or (intermediate or finished) products, processed stepwise by each agent in turn, that is, when the particular work piece comes flowing past them, and then passed on toward the next processing station. Metamodels describe the elements and their relationships within a specific model type. These models are important components in business process management."
pub.1037244949,An Open Process Model Library,"Business process elicitation requires high human and financial resources, often only affordable to large organizations. We observed that many business processes are modeled redundantly consuming a lot of money and resources. Collecting, sharing, and re-using process models overcome this problem. Libraries in the real world are a good example of sharing resources among many members reducing the relative cost of each item.In the same way we propose to collect, share, and exchange process models in a process library. This paper introduces the requirements, design and implementation for a process library with a use case from the public sector in its initial phase that allows collecting, sharing, and exchanging process models within or across public administrations. Building onto this, we propose challenging research opportunities in the field of process model libraries."
pub.1004918729,A Quality-Oriented Business Process Meta-Model,"Business process modeling is an important part of information systems design. Business process modeling techniques provide a standard way of presentation and communication of business processes. One important problem in this context is to assess the quality of business processes as well as their ontological constructs, which raises several issues, such as the identification of business process constructs as well as the quality dimensions and factors relevant to these constructs. In this paper, our goal is twofold. First, we present a business process meta-model containing all possible constructs of a business process. Second, after discussing a set of quality factors suitable for business processes constructs, we present a quality oriented meta-model resulting from the enrichment of the business process meta-model with quality related information."
pub.1025497879,Generic Linear Business Process Modeling,"Visual-oriented process modeling concepts and languages used today often lead to modeling of “spaghetti-processes”. Thus, the process models are not applicable effectively in distributed, partially automated and dynamic scenarios. They also support permanent adaptation and composition of process models insufficiently. The approach of Generic Linear Business Process Modeling describes a meta model that aims to avoid these inadequacy. According to the concept of linear programming, nested logic blocks are applied to model the process flow. Additionally, by using generic blocks composition and amplifying of process models on different levels of detail is achieved. Further the approach outlines the visualization of generic linear process models and an XML based format in order to exchange the models in a networked business environment."
pub.1023309714,A Proposal for Ownership Representation in the Context of Business Process Models,The literature on Business Process Management (BPM) confirms the importance of establishing process ownership but conventional approaches as BPMN or EPC do not offer a way to represent the process owner. The aspect-oriented business process (AO-BPM) approach makes this issue more prominent because of the separation between crosscutting concerns and the core elements of a process. In this paper we present a way to represent the ownership based on the Strategic Actor model from i* and incorporate this approach to the EPC meta-model. We also provide a proof of concept by means of an example that illustrates our solution.
pub.1094623145,Scoop: A complete methodology for cooperative systems modeling and analysis,"In this paper, we present our methodology proposal for cooperative remote systems modeling. Its aim is to develop models of existing or planned cooperative systems. These models are used to specify systems or to create dynamic working simulations. Comparative performances are deduced from the latter. The associated meta-model proposal is based, among other things, on the use of multi-agent systems, Petri nets and stochastics Petri nets. After having described the whole methodology concepts, we show a set of general results extracted from simulations."
pub.1094013259,CSEPM - A Continuous Software Engineering Process Metamodel,"Software engineers have to cope with uncertainties and changing requirements. Agile methods provide flexibility towards changes and the emergence of continuous delivery has made regular feedback loops possible. The abilities to maintain high code quality through reviews, to regularly release software, and to collect and prioritize user feedback, are necessary for continuous software engineering (CSE). However, there exists no software process metamodel that handles the continuous character of software engineering. In this paper, we describe an empirical process metamodel for continuous software engineering called CSEPM, which treats development activities as parallel running workflows and allows tailoring and customization. CSEPM includes static aspects that describe the relations between specific CSE concepts including reviews, releases, and feedback. It also describes the dynamic aspect of CSE, how development workflows are activated through change events. We show how CSEPM allows to instantiate linear, iterative, agile and continuous process models and how it enables tailoring and customization."

The goal is to enable custom fine-grained and elaborate message exchange between distributed yet tightly-coupled parties. Hence, the concept of a conversation protocol is introduced. Its reference implementation – the CompTalks Framework – is a Java-based middleware toolkit that supports development, testing, analysis, validation and running highly interactive services. An important feature is the ability to verify the developed protocols at compile time by using a Petri Net-based analyzer. The framework was successfully applied to develop a protocol for GSEngine which serves as the runtime system of the ViroLab virtual laboratory, enabling development and execution of complex collaborative applications."
pub.1130333753,A service‐oriented method for domain and business process modelling,"Abstract In this paper, we present Precise SOM (Precise Service Oriented Modelling) —a novel lightweight method for integrated domain and business process modelling—which follows the service‐oriented paradigm, uses a UML profile as notation and provides detailed workflows to guide the production of the models. In our method, the UML models are precisely defined by means of a metamodel and of a set of constraints, and by restricting UML to the essential language constructs, to help modellers to avoid common mistakes and to guarantee, by construction, a good quality. Precise SOM has been validated by detailing how it can be used in various modelling tasks, some of them illustrated by a (industrial) case study."

To solve the problem, the paper discusses BPMM (Business Process Metric Model), which is based on the theory of model-driven and Business Process model, and base this method, we give the simple Meta Model, the model and its implementation. This paper concludes that the metric model can be effectively used in business process execution."
pub.1012371065,A New Approach to Competence-Based Business Partner Profiles for Collaborative Business Process Management,"In this paper a novel approach and thinking to foster the derivation of competence and skill requirements by business process models is presented. Management of intra- and inter-organizational business processes is a significant issue that influences a company’s success. A multitude of competence models, standards and frameworks exist. Furthermore, current resource models in business process management solutions are not sophisticated and adequately reflecting the needs of collaborative resource planning and competence management. Our research activities yielded a meta model which tends to overcome existing shortfalls. In this article we present an extensible resource meta-model that allows the modeling of resources including their competences, skills and knowledge. Furthermore we demonstrate the aggregation of competence concepts to business partner profiles in collaborative networks."
pub.1035353978,Modeling of production processes using UML and Petri nets.,"The paper proposes combined use of UML and Petri nets to model production processes which will be useful for designers of production processes in any area of industry. In practice, the specification of a normal operation cycle is presented by a technical drawing. It is known that UML helps to present the concept and various aspects of a system, and Petri nets can provide information about faults. A major challenge in modeling a production process with dynamic models of activity diagrams such as UML 2.0 and PNs is cooperation of these two different methods and conversion between them. The meta-model can be used to control the effects of modifications made in the system. These methods have been widely applied in different areas, but being applied together they can produce new results. This will be demonstrated on a practical example."
pub.1015071467,Uses and applications of Software & Systems Process Engineering Meta‐Model process models. A systematic mapping study,"Software process engineering is a discipline, which aims to study and improve software development and maintenance processes. The explicit definition of software processes is essential. To this end, the Object Management Group consortium proposed the Software & Systems Process Engineering Meta‐Model (SPEM) that exploits the benefits of the Model Driven Architecture paradigm applied to software process models, instead of software specification models. The aim of this study is to discover evidence clusters and evidence deserts in the use and application of SPEM from a business process management point of view. To reach the proposed objective, we have undertaken a systematic mapping study of the existing scientific literature. The reviewed literature deals mainly with process modeling and, to a lesser extent, with process adaptability, verification, and validation, enactment and evaluation. Wide agreement exists in using the SPEM meta‐model to develop different types of methods and processes. Further research efforts are needed in areas related to enactment and evaluation of software processes. There is a need to evolve to a new version of the meta‐model that incorporates the improvements proposed by different authors. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This paper presents a systematic mapping study on the uses and applications of software process models defined with Software & Systems Process Engineering Meta‐Model. The study analyzes the possibilities that Software & Systems Process Engineering Meta‐Model models offer in the Business Process Management life cycle. The reviewed literature mainly deals with process modeling, by developing either processes models or frameworks. The obtained results lack sufficient works related to the assessment of industrial implementations."
pub.1095097018,Development of a Business Process Modeling Methodology and a Tool for Sharing Business Processes,"Sharing know-how regarding business process modeling activities and best practices can save time in the early phases of business system development. To help developers share know-how and best practices, we have developed a methodology and a tool for business process modeling and have applied it to a system development project. Furthermore, we have developed process-template development techniques to realize granularity-unification of business processes so that business process models can be reused, and have clarified the practical divisions of process models and the design issues concerning each division. These techniques enable the preparation of reuse-oriented business process templates before the business process modeling activity. In this paper, we describe the methodology and tool, including a meta-model and notations we have constructed for business modeling. We then consider the effectiveness of the methodology and tool: in an actual development project, the tool and business process templates decreased development time by 46% or more."
pub.1095376092,Development of Flexible Process-Centric Web Applications: An Integrated Model Driven Approach,"In recent years, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches have been proposed and used to develop and evolve WAs. However, the definition of appropriate MDE approaches for the development of flexible process-centric WAs is still limited. In particular, (flexible) workflow models have never been integrated with the models (e.g., presentation, information models) used in MDE approaches to develop this type of applications. In this paper, we propose an MDE approach for the development and the evolution of flexible process-centric WAs that integrates three MDE metamodels used to represent the main components of a WA with the metamodel of Declare. A case study, carried out to validate the feasibility, correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach is presented and discussed."
pub.1125981760,Document Business Process Model Extension for Modeling Secure Ubiquitous Documents,"Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the de facto standard for modeling business processes in both academic and industrial fields. It was developed by Object Management Group (OMG) to define and visualize business process models. In business process modeling approaches, although the fundamental role of documents, the control flow perspective dominates the document perspective. Therefore, it’s still not possible to model documents using BPMN due the lack of an adequate notation. Moreover, with the growing usage of Cloud technology, the sensitive documents of business processes outsourced in Cloud may be target of malicious attacks due the lack of security in this paradigm. Thereby, to overcome the inability of BPMN in representing document shared in Cloud and their security, this work presents a new extension of BPMN 2.0 Meta-Object Facility meta-model and notation called DBPM (Document Business Process Model) to support the modeling and visualization of document perspective requirements. Also, a formal definition of the new extension is presented. As a result, the DBPM handles ubiquitous documents (i.e. documents shared in Cloud) and their security at high conceptual level."

pub.1149992242,BPMN4sML: A BPMN Extension for Serverless Machine Learning. Technology Independent and Interoperable Modeling of Machine Learning Workflows and their Serverless Deployment Orchestration,"Machine learning (ML) continues to permeate all layers of academia, industry
and society. Despite its successes, mental frameworks to capture and represent
machine learning workflows in a consistent and coherent manner are lacking. For
instance, the de facto process modeling standard, Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN), managed by the Object Management Group, is widely accepted and
applied. However, it is short of specific support to represent machine learning
workflows. Further, the number of heterogeneous tools for deployment of machine
learning solutions can easily overwhelm practitioners. Research is needed to
align the process from modeling to deploying ML workflows.
  We analyze requirements for standard based conceptual modeling for machine
learning workflows and their serverless deployment. Confronting the
shortcomings with respect to consistent and coherent modeling of ML workflows
in a technology independent and interoperable manner, we extend BPMN's
Meta-Object Facility (MOF) metamodel and the corresponding notation and
introduce BPMN4sML (BPMN for serverless machine learning). Our extension
BPMN4sML follows the same outline referenced by the Object Management Group
(OMG) for BPMN. We further address the heterogeneity in deployment by proposing
a conceptual mapping to convert BPMN4sML models to corresponding deployment
models using TOSCA.
  BPMN4sML allows technology-independent and interoperable modeling of machine
learning workflows of various granularity and complexity across the entire
machine learning lifecycle. It aids in arriving at a shared and standardized
language to communicate ML solutions. Moreover, it takes the first steps toward
enabling conversion of ML workflow model diagrams to corresponding deployment
models for serverless deployment via TOSCA."
pub.1012988851,Semantics of business process vocabulary and process rules,"Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), an OMG standard, provides a meta-model for the semantic and declarative models of business vocabulary and business rules. Logical formulation of SBVR facilitates IT people to interpret these models generated by business people. However, an important aspect of a business is process model, and it is outside the scope of SBVR. Knowledge intensive and dynamic nature of business processes require such a declarative meta-model for process modeling in order to provide flexibility and adaptability. In this work, an approach for process modeling using SBVR's methodology is proposed. We have made an initial attempt to define a declarative meta-model, Semantics of Business Process Vocabulary and Process Rules (SBPVR). SBPVR divides knowledge of business processes into three parts; process concept types, process fact types and process rules. Process concept types and fact types represent structure of processes and process rules provide guidance over the structure and flow of processes at execution time. In the paper, these types are further categorized to represent the various elements of process models. SBPVR provides flexibility and adaptability to the process model through its declarative nature and fact oriented approach."

pub.1094629541,Semantic Business Process Representation to Enhance the Degree of BPM Mechanization an Ontology,"Business process management is still characterized by a low degree of mechanization. One of the main causes is a lack of an appropriate semantic representation for business process models and execution data unified in a single ontology. Many researchers addressed this problem but the ontologies proposed so far define a proprietary property called occurrence Of to link a process model to its execution data. In this paper we we propose an alternative approach based on a multilayer representation using an is-a relation instead. This is cognitively more adequate and allows to use standard reasoning mechanisms. We show how OWL-FA enables a semantic representation of the metamodel in an ontology, providing decidable reasoners. We present a case study and we address the semantic issue with a detailed analysis. We show how it is possible to answer some queries with the support of this ontology, demonstrating how our ontology can be a suitable tool to enhance the mechanization of business process management."
pub.1008663385,Beyond Control-Flow: Extending Business Process Configuration to Roles and Objects,"A configurable process model is an integrated representation of multiple variants of a business process. It is designed to be individualized to meet a particular set of requirements. As such, configurable process models promote systematic reuse of proven or common practices. Existing notations for configurable process modeling focus on capturing tasks and control-flow dependencies, neglecting equally important aspects of business processes such as data flow, material flow and resource management. This paper fills this gap by proposing an integrated meta-model for configurable processes with advanced features for capturing resources involved in the performance of tasks (through task-role associations) as well as flow of data and physical artifacts (through task-object associations). Although embodied as an extension of a popular process modeling notation, namely EPC, the meta-model is defined in an abstract and formal manner to make it applicable to other notations."

Based on $M_{spoa}$, clewed and cored by form business process, C B P M (Complex Business Process Model) is presented to describe dynamic behavior relationship.

pub.1099650899,An HLA-based BPMN Extension for the Specification of Business Process Collaborations,"Inter-organization business process collaboration is one of the most significant factors driving today's global business development. Such collaborations are typically composed by various processes executed by different organizations and are often difficult to specify and analyze, due to their distributed nature and to data interoperability issues. The standard notation for business process modeling, namely BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), only provides a limited support to the specification of collaborations. This paper introduces a data model extension of BPMN inspired by the HLA (High Level Architecture) distributed simulation standard. In addition, the paper proposes a metamodel-based mapping from BPMN to HLA, which can be seen as a significant step towards the implementation of a conceptual framework for specifying and analyzing collaborative business processes by use of distributed simulation approaches."

A PLC is a special purpose industrial computer used to automate industrial processes. Bugs in LD programs are very costly and sometimes are even a threat to human safety. We propose a model driven approach for formal verification of LD programs through model-checking. We provide a metamodel for a subset of the LD language. We define a time Petri net (TPN) semantics for LD programs through an ATL model transformation. Finally, we automatically generate behavioral properties over the LD models as LTL formulae which are then checked over the generated TPN using the model-checkers available in the Tina toolkit. We focus on race condition detection."

languages, with highest possibility of wide practical usage - UML Activity
diagrams (AD) and Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). The necessary in
practice workflow aspects are briefly discussed, and on this basis a natural AD
profile is proposed, which covers all of them. A functionally equivalent BPMN
subset is also selected. The semantics of both languages in the context of
process execution (namely, mapping to BPEL) is also analyzed in the paper. By
analyzing AD and BPMN metamodels, authors conclude that an exact transformation
from AD to BPMN is not trivial even for the selected subset, though these
languages are considered to be similar. Authors show how this transformation

pub.1160611770,Explicit traceability model for aligning a conception sequence diagram and a BPMN diagram,"In modern software engineering process methodologies, business process models (BPM) tend to occupy an increasingly important role in the development and ongoing management of information systems (IS). However, only few information systems are developed according to the business processes they support. This separation leads to differences between the economic model and the model of IS. Thus, this work aims to bridge the gap between business and software modeling. To achieve this goal, we introduce an explicit traceability methodology that extends a previous requirements traceability methodology to address alignment and the coevolution of the dynamic viewpoint of the software models and business process models (BPM). Indeed, we first define a unified trace metamodel that includes all Business Process and Model Notation (BPMN) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) elements (use cases, conception sequence diagrams) and traceability links between interconnected elements. Next, we instantiate the built-in metamodels in the form of new diagrams called BPMNTraceISM (BPMN Traces Information System Models). Finally, we define a set of bi-directional transformation models between the BPMN, UML, and the new BPMNTraceISM diagrams. To prove the feasibility of our traceability method, we implemented a full graphic editor to design and visualize BPMNTraceISM diagrams, and ATL (ATLAS Transformation Language) rules to support the bi-directional transformation models. We have also test traceability methods with a case study."
pub.1125681294,A Model-driven Engineering Approach for Business Process based SaaS Services Composition,"Nowadays, tremendous number of enterprises are looking to outsource their business processes in order to gain in productivity, reduce cost, and enhance performance. Outsourcing business processes to cloud computing and more specifically to SaaS services, is actually among the most prominent opportunities regarding the benefits that this paradigm offers. However, matching the business process activities with the suitable SaaS services is not a trivial task regarding the diversity of both, functional requirements of business processes and the functionalities offered by SaaS services. Furthermore, once the business process execution is entirely supported by the SaaS services, the process owner, lacking in general the required expertise related to SaaS domain, needs to be aware of how the business process is handled by the SaaS. This is done principally through transforming the business process model to the SaaS model. This paper proposes a model-based approach using SAT-based formal verification to select and validate the most suitable SaaS services to support the business process achievement. Furthermore, a model to model transformation from business process to SaaS is proposed. This transformation is based on (i) a lightweight extension of the business process meta-model of ISO/CEI 19510 and (ii) our proposition of the SaaS meta-model."

Unfortunately, the main concepts of popular process formalisms are not always adequate to describe collaboration. We extend the Software & System Process Engineering Meta-Model (SPEM) by introducing concepts needed to represent precise and dynamic collaboration setups that practitioners create to address ever-changing challenges. Our goal is to give practitioners the ability to express evolving understanding about collaboration in a formalism suited for easy representation and tool-provided assistance. Our work is based on a collaborative process metamodel we have developed. In this paper, we first present a meta-process for process modeling and enactment, which we apply to our collaborative process metamodel. Then we describe the implementation of a suitable process model editor, and a project plan generator from process models."

First of all a resource meta-model is constructed, which represents the basic information unit. Then the concept of domain ontology is used to organize and manage resources obtained from distributed and heterogeneous sources. Based on the resource, Bite is used to compose RESTful services in order to control business processes in an orderly way. Therefore, the way of services to call resources within the limits of traditional web service architectures is being transferred into a resource flow.

To solve this issue, we advocate the use of both Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and reflective technologies. Such technologies enable a metamodel of the software architecture to be established to represent both structural and behavioral aspects. Based on some requirements expressed by the software designer, and using online animation of the software model (CBSE metamodels and Petri Nets), we propose an approach to l/decide when the system (or a sub-system) is adaptable, and 2/ guide the system towards an adaptable state. Finally, this approach is applied to the online adaptation of replication mechanisms on a small case study."

In this context, how to improve NPD efficiency and quality is one of common aims in rapidly changing global market. This paper presents a dual-process modeling and control method for collaborative design of new products based on petri net for this reason. Firstly, the design process is divided into several design stages from the coarse-grained perspective, and the object petri net is established to make the whole design process in a collaborative environment. Secondly, the design relations among the design majors are analyzed from the perspective of fine granularity. This process transforms the complex relationships, establishes the specialty collaborative design meta model and simulates it. The work progress is quantitative analysis and feedback information is controlled based on object petri net. A design method based on factory mode is proposed to control process of design specialty collaboration, while a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and evaluation compensation is proposed to confirm feedback information for adapting to the dynamic design process. Finally, a case is used to illustrate the method, which shows the effectiveness of the method."
pub.1031095795,An architecture for the interoperability of workflow models,"The goal of this work is to contribute to the field of interoperability of Workflow models. To achieve interoperability, we have built a generic architecture that addresses three levels of abstraction: a common meta-model that the Workflow models must share, a common model that they enact collectively, and a common data model whose management is shared. So, the approach we have adopted is based on a strategy of uniformity to solve the problems related to the semantic, syntactic and execution platform heterogeneity. The common meta-model gathers the common concepts that are shared between Workflow models and it defines their semantics. Common concepts (activity, event, etc.) that are extracted from different formalisms used in the field of business process (or Workflow) allow us to instantiate a canonical model that describes only common parts (activities, artifacts). As for the common data model, it is instantiated by the common model. For the control interoperability, we have adopted an approach that deals with a flexible connection mechanism based on events through a connection server. This approach can be implemented above any interoperability platform (CORBA, EJB, etc.). Moreover, the shared canonical model that we have proposed is generic, simple and re-usable."

The presented evaluation criteria combine domain specific evaluation approach and some of the existing quality metrics, defined in the field of software. Well established evaluation criteria of workflow metamodels should enable their comparison, selection and proper use of methods and tool built upon them. The final result is a list of nine categories of evaluation criteria, decomposed into more than forty subcategories, but the list of subcategories is extendable. The practical validation of proposed evaluation highlighted some topics for future research."
pub.1110931409,The Design of Flexible Workflow in Scientific Research Management System,"In scientific research management projects, if the process model changes, without a workflow technology, the codes need to be modified and the workload of modification will increase significantly. After introducing a flexible workflow technology, what can be done is to directly define the new process model. This paper mainly introduces ECA rules on the basis of workflow meta-model to design a flexible workflow: the ECA rules will express execution logics of the basic workflow, and the basic elements of the process model in the approval process of scientific research projects will be represented by ECA. The design of the flexible workflow in scientific research management system will include flexible workflow engine and the process approval platform for scientific research project management with ECA rule analysis. The flexible workflow implemented in this paper can better guide the workflow engine to adapt to the current environment, and decide the different execution process according to the specific process instance contexts. The method proposed in this paper better supports the needs of scientific research project management."
pub.1132674531,M2FOL: A Formal Modeling Language for Metamodels,"Enterprise modeling deals with the increasing complexity of processes and systems by operationalizing model content and by linking complementary models and languages, thus amplifying the model-value beyond mere comprehensible pictures. To enable this amplification and turn models into computer-processable structures a comprehensive formalization is needed. In this paper we build on the widely accepted approach of logic as basis for modeling languages and define them as languages in the sense of typed predicate logic comprising a signature $$\varSigma $$ and a set of constraints. We concretize how the basic concepts of a language – object and relation types, attributes, inheritance and constraints – can be expressed in logical terms. This naturally leads to the denotation of a model as $$\varSigma $$-structure satisfying all constraints. We apply this definition also on the metalevel and propose a formal modeling language to specify metamodels called M2FOL. A thus formalized metamodel then rigorously defines the signature of a language and we provide an algorithmic derivation of the formal modeling language from the metamodel. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by formalizing the Petri Net modeling language, a method frequently used for analysis and simulation in enterprise modeling."
pub.1093364956,Principles for System Prototype and Verification using metamodel based Transformations,"Using Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) allows solutions to be expressed in the idiom and at the level of abstraction of the problem domain. However, this does not imply that prototypes can be easily and rapidly generated. In reality, Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are difficult to design, implement and maintain, and usually there is a potential loss of efficiency when compared with hand-coded software. In this paper we explain the principles based on which we expect to solve some of these problems by means of transformation from a DSL to a formalism with a well define semantics named Concurrent Object Oriented Petri-Nets (CO-OPN). The proposed methodology uses the meta-model of the DSL as the principle for the transformation. This transformation represents the semantic mapping between the DSL and CO-OPN. The achievement is both to provide a formally defined semantics to the DSL and, since CO-OPN is integrated in a framework, to provide the functionalities that allow model verification and fast prototype generation for the DSL."
pub.1033746412,Service Value Meta-Model: An Engineering Viewpoint,"Various tangible or intangible values are the ultimate outputs of service systems. In service engineering, the comprehensive description of service value is a key step that helps service engineers design and develop high-quality interoperable service systems that will deliver expected values to customers and providers. In this paper, a service value metamodel is put forward from an engineering point of view. First, the objective of service value modeling is extensively analyzed. Then, the various essential aspects of service value that have significance for service system design are presented and each aspect is illustrated in detail by a set of concepts. Based on this meta-model, a multi-level service value model and the corresponding value-oriented service engineering process are briefly introduced."
pub.1009771893,Towards an understanding of model executability,"Processes are a major concern of information system. They need thus to be defined as precisely as any other artefact of the system. Meta-modeling techniques have proved their relevance for addressing such issues. However, a process meta-model may not be restricted to the definition of a set of concepts, relations and assertions. As the purpose of a process is to be executed, the underlying execution rules have also to be made explicit. In this paper we attempt to identify the main characteristics of executable meta-models. This study is illustrated with a concrete example, a Petri nets meta-model."
pub.1005816565,A Systematic Literature Review of Consistency Among Business Process Models,"The field of business process modeling has been beset by inter-model consistency problems which are mainly due to the existence of multiple variants of the same business process, for instance when models have been produced by different actors, or through the time by a same (or different) actor(s), as well as the possibility of its modeling from discrete and complementary perspectives (using different lenses). The aim of our research is manifold. First we aim to develop a framework (i) enabling situating new research activities as well as the existing approaches and (ii) targeting to master the inter-model consistency issue. Second, this framework shall offer the capability of handling business process models coherence issue (i) having in mind various modeling goals and targets/products and (ii) having in hand a wide range of problem statements and project situations requiring the use of a large catalogue of business process meta-models. Third, we have the ambition of determining gaps in current research with the aim of suggesting areas for further investigations in the area of inter-models consistency. In order to do so, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of consistency among business process models, where a total of 982 published papers extracted from the most relevant scientific sources, were considered, of which 41 papers, were ultimately included."
pub.1093553388,A Security Meta-Model for Service-oriented Architectures,"Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) facilitate the provision and orchestration of business services to enable a faster adoption to changing business demands. Several approaches have been described to generate executable description of service orchestrations based on visual business process models. These models describe workflows and related information on an abstract level supporting business analysts to state and verify business requirements. In previous work, we have adopted this approach to simplify the security engineering in Service-oriented Architectures. We foster a model-driven approach based on the integration of security annotations in visual modelling notation. These annotations are gathered and translated to a domain-independent security model that facilitates the generation of enforceable security configurations (e.g.WS-SecurityPolicy). In this paper, we introduce our security meta-model for SOA that constitutes the foundation for our model-driven approach. Based on a model for service interactions that describes the exchange of information in a service-based system, we define a model to express security requirements and policies, and introduce a mapping to WS-Policy and WS-Security Policy."
pub.1094423288,Decentralized Workflow Modeling and Execution in Service-Oriented Computing Environment,"In this paper, workflow management technology is used to achieve business process integration. The main idea is that the services provided by the business processes of an enterprise are implemented as corresponding workflow models, which can be considered to be “black-boxes ”, but can be subscribed and reused as sub-workflows by the service requestors in defining their own workflow models. The meta-model for supporting the proposed workflow modeling is given. The peer-to-peer interaction between workflow engines, the invoking of applications, and the monitoring and control of process instances can all be implemented as Web services. In order to endow this workflow management paradigm with more flexibility, multi-agent technology is used to perceive environment change, and to create adapted process definition through negotiation. Agents negotiate with KQML, but the communication is implemented with Web service model. The interfaces of the agents are defined with WSDL. KQML messages are mapped into SOAP messages."
pub.1040975644,Interoperability of Software Engineering Metamodels,"Several metamodels have been proposed in the software engineering literature recently. For practical usage, it is important to ensure that these metamodels can be used in an interoperable fashion. In this paper we present an approach as a part of our PhD research in the same direction. Our methodology is based on the study of analogous characteristics among metamodels, ontologies and schemas. We have adopted ontology merging and schema matching techniques and apply them to the domain of metamodels to assist in creating interoperable metamodels. This methodology is applied and presented here with an illustrative example in which we show the results of merging two of the OMG metamodels: the Organization Structure Metamodel (OSM) and the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN)."
pub.1050414338,Deriving document workflows from feature models,"Despite the increasing interest in the Document Engineering community, a formal definition of document workflow is still to come. Often, the term refers to an abstract process consisting in a set of tasks to contribute to some document contents, and some techniques are being developed to support parts of these tasks rather than how to generate the process itself. In most proposals, these tasks are implicit in the business processes running in an organization, lacking an explicit document workflow model that could be analysed and enacted as a coherent unit. In this paper, we propose a document-centric approach to document workflow generation. We have extended the feature-based document meta-model of the Document Product Lines approach with an organiza-tional metamodel. For a given configuration of the feature model, we assign tasks to different members of the organization to con-tribute to the document contents. Moreover, the relationships between features define an ordering of the tasks, which may be refined to produce a specification of the document workflow model automatically. The generation of customized software manuals is used to illustrate the proposal."
pub.1169629476,Ensuring the relevance of enterprise business process knowledge based on an ontological model,"The problem of ensuring the relevance of knowledge about the business process of an enterprise based on its ontologi-cal model is considered. The obsolescence of enterprise business process models leads to the need to redesign solutions for their automation. Approaches to solving the problem of maintaining the relevance of the business process model are presented. The regulatory basis of the business process of an enterprise was examined for its similarity to models developed to solve automation problems, and a conclusion was made that they have a common basis. This makes it possible to consider the regulatory basis as a metamodel and store data using linguistic variables. Ontological models built according to the IDEF5 standard for the most common regulatory documents of a business process are consid-ered. It was been revealed that one of the most important elements of managing an industrial enterprise and its busi-ness processes is maintaining the relevance of all components, including the situational ontological model. A method-ology is proposed for integrating an ontological model into the process of updating enterprise regulatory documents, preserving knowledge about the business process and retrieving it to generate changes to regulatory documents and models used to automate business processes. An example of using the technique for planning equipment repairs carried out outside the main work plan is considered."
pub.1100424183,"An Architecture for Querying Business Process, Business Process Instances, and Business Data Models","Business data are usually managed by means of business processes during process instances. These viewpoints (business, instances and data) are strongly related because the life-cycle of business data objects need to be aligned with the business process and process instance models. However, current approaches do not provide a mechanism to integrate these three viewpoints nor to query them all together while maintaining the information in the distributed, heterogeneous systems where they have been created. In this paper, we propose the integration of the business process, business process instance, and business data models by using their metamodels and also an architecture to support this integration. The goal of this integration is to make the most of the three models and the technologies that support them in an isolated way. In our approach, it is not necessary to change the source data formats nor transforming them into a common one. Furthermore, the proposed architecture allows us to query the three models even though they come from three different technologies."
pub.1146415171,Model-driven management of BPMN-based business process families,"Business processes can have variants depending on specific business requirements, which lead to the definition of a so-called business process family. Since conventional business process modeling languages, e.g., the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), do not explicitly support variants’ specification, several proposals have emerged to deal with it. However, they mainly focus on languages’ definition, while less emphasis is made on providing complete variability management. This article presents a Model-Driven Engineering approach for managing BPMN-based business process families composed of a metamodel for conceptualizing process families, a high-level process for managing them (involving model transformations for the configuration of variants), and tool support for the complete approach. We validated the proposal using a real-world example from a university and an empirical study with real users. Users rated the support tool’s principal functional suitability and usability features as very good. Many improvement opportunities were detected, e.g., version control, collaborative work, and error reporting. We also provide a literature review and thorough evaluation of BPMN-based business process families’ proposals using the VIVACE framework."
pub.1094172978,Using Declarative Workflow Languages to Develop Process-Centric Web Applications,"Nowadays, process-centric Web Applications (WAs) are extensively used in contexts where multi-user, coordinated work is required. Recently, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques have been investigated for the development of this kind of applications. However, there are still some open issues. First, a complete roundtrip engineering support is still missing. Second, the lack of a proper integration of the existing MDE methodologies with workflow modeling techniques does not allow the developers to model the components of a WA in a compact and easy way. Third, the existing MDE approaches are based on procedural languages and not on declarative languages, even if these are more suitable to describe processes characterized by high variability. To address these issues, in this paper, we adopt a conservative approach to roundtrip engineering for the development of process-centric WAs and propose the integration of three MDE metamodels used to represent the main components of a WA with the metamodel of Declare, a declarative language to represent business processes. The proposed approach has been used to develop an online system for visit reservation in a hospital in order to validate its feasibility, correctness and effectiveness."
pub.1149553809,Automatically-Generated Agent Organizations for Flexible Workflow Enactment,"The use of multi-agent systems for the implementation and management of data-intensive workflows is generally considered a particularly interesting solution. We propose an approach that exploits the definition of processes described with the BPMN language for the automatic generation of agent organisations. To demonstrate the use of our approach, we chose the JaCaMo agent framework for its inherent support of agent organisations described with the MOISE meta-model. The resulting agent organization is built for adapting to different execution context, by self-modifying its structural and functional specification for continuing to fulfil the BP goal."
pub.1181607202,Access Control Verification in Smart Contracts Using Colored Petri Nets,"This paper presents an approach for the verification of access control in smart contracts written in the Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML). The approach utilizes Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) and their analysis tool CPN Tools. It is a model-driven-based approach that employs a new meta-model for capturing access control requirements in DAML contracts. The approach is supported by a suite of tools that fully automates all of the steps: parsing DAML code, generating DAML model instances, transforming the DAML models into CPN models, and model checking the generated CPN models. The approach is tested using several DAML scripts involving access control extracted from different domains of blockchain applications."

pub.1124366142,KPI-Based Approach for Business Process Improvement," Business Process Management is a contemporary approach with the main purpose of deploying, executing and continuously optimizing the different types of business processes and thus improving the agility of the organization. In this paper, we propose an approach to business process improvement based on key performance indicators during the Business Process Management lifecycle. We started by highlighting the life cycle of key performance indicators. Then our proposal was at meta-modeling level, adding performance indicators as concepts of the Business Process Model and Notation meta-model. This brought us to a new extension of this meta-model based on key performance indicators. The particular case of the Scrum agile development process is then considered as a case study. In this context, key performance indicators are proposed for this process and are classified according to the elements of the Scrum method. The proposed approach was tested by taking the example of a company using ScrumWise tool for conducting scrum developments. The developed prototype allowed a performance evaluation of the Scrum process through key performance indicators and a set of recommendations were proposed to help managing tasks and improving the adopted process."

We describe the methodological integration of the two modelling methods with the aim of fulfilling several criteria: i) to rely on appropriate theories; ii) to provide abstract and concrete syntaxes; iii) to provide scenarios of application; and iv) to develop tool support. We provide guidelines for using the two modelling methods in a top-down analysis scenario. We also present an illustrative case that demonstrates the feasibility of the approach."
pub.1010940785,Metamodelling Platforms,"The elements of an enterprise are managed more and more model-based. The state-of-the-art in the area of modelling of organisations is based on fixed metamodels. Product models are created by using product modelling environments, process models are created in business process modelling tools and organisational models are realised in personnel management tools. Web service models link these business models to information technology. They are created by using standardised languages and common ontologies. Information technology is modelled in tools supporting notions such as workflow or object-orientation. The models of the company’s strategy, goals and the appropriate measurements are described and monitored by using tools supporting management concepts such as Balanced Scorecard.Major requirements to an enterprise modelling platform are flexibility and adaptability. These are fulfilled by environments providing flexible metamodelling capabilities. The main characteristic of such environments is that the formalism of modelling—the metamodel—can be freely defined. This raises research issues on how to design, manage, distribute and use such metamodels on a syntactic as well as on a semantic level and how to integrate, run and maintain a metamodelling platform in a corporation’s environment.Platforms based on metamodelling concepts should support the following topics:
Engineering the business models & their web servicesDesigning and realizing the corresponding information technologyEvaluating the used corporation resources and assetsThis paper presents a framework for metamodelling platforms and gives some answers to the research issues stated above. As part of the framework flexible metamodel integration mechanisms, using meta-metamodels (meta2-models) and semantical mapping, are discussed. Additionally, a system architecture and the building blocks of a corporate metamodelling platform are described. Finally, best practices from three EU funded projects—REFINE, ADVISOR, and PROMOTE—all realised with industrial partners, are presented.The full version of the paper can be downloaded from http://www.dke.univie.ac.at/mmp"
pub.1011243479,Improving Business Process Model Quality Using Domain Ontologies,"This paper addresses the issue of improving quality of business process (BP) models by exploiting domain knowledge. Indeed, business process models reflect the business processes of companies. The success of these processes has a direct and undeniable impact on business operations success. Managing them through their underlying models helps improving their effectiveness, consistency, and transparency. BP modeling aims at a better understanding of processes, allowing deciders to achieve strategic goals of the company. However, several studies from the literature showed that in experienced system analysts often produce low-level quality. This situation is partly due to lack of domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to support this modeling effort with an approach that uses domain knowledge to improve the semantic quality of BP models. We suggest to use ontologies as a mean to capture domain knowledge and meta-modeling techniques to deal with BP models independently of languages in which they are expressed. Our contribution is threefold: (1) the meta-models describing both a domain ontology and a BP model are described, (2) the alignment between the concepts of both meta-models is defined and illustrated, (3) a set of Object Constraint Language mapping rules is provided. A simple case study illustrates the process."
pub.1053643243,Lost in Translation? Transformation Nets to the Rescue!,"The vision of Model-Driven Engineering places models as first-class artifacts throughout the software lifecycle. An essential prerequisite is the availability of proper transformation languages allowing not only code generation but also augmentation, migration or translation of models themselves. Current approaches, however, lack convenient facilities for debugging and ensuring the understanding of the transformation process. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel formalism for the development of model transformations which is based on Colored Petri Nets. This allows first, for an explicit, process-oriented execution model of a transformation, thereby overcoming the impedance mismatch between the specification and execution of model transformations, being the prerequisite for convenient debugging. Second, by providing a homogenous representation of all artifacts involved in a transformation, including metamodels, models and the actual transformation logic itself, understandability of model transformations is enhanced."

In this paper, a meta-model approach for the evaluation of different workflow management systems is introduced. After a comparison of the meta-models of current workflow management systems, a procedure model for the evaluation process is specified. An organizational reference model is introduced, which helps users in specifying their requirements for a workflow management system. A comparison of scoring model and meta-model-based evaluation processes concludes this paper."
pub.1094995124,A Platform Independent Communication Support for Distributed Controller Systems Modelled by Petri Nets,"This paper addresses the distributed execution of Input-Output Place Transition Petri nets (IOPT-nets) models through a network of distributed controllers by providing platform independent modules for communication. Each controller is associated with an IOPT-net sub-model and a set of static communication modules characterized dynamically by the communication meta-model. The sub-models use communication channels to exchange events allowing the global evolution of the IOPT-net model. Whenever controllers are interconnected through some kind of network, communication channels are implemented by platform specific modules following a layered architecture. Communication interfaces, buffers size, routing, etc. are parameterized through the communication meta-model at the application description level, providing the necessary specifications for code to be generated dynamically and therefore support the distributed controller's communication. An application example is introduced, composed by a network of nine distributed controllers interconnected following different topologies and using different communication interfaces. Arduino boards are used together with Ethernet shields and serial lines as implementation platforms for proof-of-concept purposes."
pub.1095723475,Model Driven Data Warehousing for Business Performance Management,"Traditional data warehouses are manually designed starting from specific requirements and anticipated data analysis needs. As a result there is frequently a disconnect between business process models, business definition of data artifacts and the data stored in the data warehouses as they are often designed manually and in isolation. Hence it has always been a challenge to keep the data warehouse in sync with the continuously changing business process models, resulting in both high maintenance costs and lost opportunities. In this paper we present our Model Driven Data Warehousing (MDDW) approach in the area of Business Performance Management (BPM). The purpose of MDDW is to bridge the gap between the business process models and the data warehouse models, thus enable the rapid adaptation to changes in the business environment. We describe our modeling framework comprising the various modeling elements and meta-models that capture both business and IT data artifacts."
pub.1124881599,Design of a Domain-Specific Metamodel for Industrial Business Process Management,"Enterprises operate in fast-changing environments nowadays and experience the continuous need to adapt to changing circumstances and new strategical and technological developments. This observation impacts how enterprise information systems are analysed, designed, implemented and used. Focusing on the analysis and design phases, conceptual modelling methods in the field of enterprise architecture management experience a continuous evolution in research and practice. Existing methods are re-purposed for specific requirements, new methods are developed/evaluated in concrete industrial settings and coupling/integration techniques support holistic viewpoints. Nevertheless, current practices in the design and enactment of such methods, and more specifically their metamodels, are inefficient with respect to agile and iterative considerations. Within this paper, a novel design approach for modelling method engineering is discussed that builds on the notion of meta-models as conceptual structures. Syntactic and semantic operation on these structures aim to facilitate the design process following the design science research methodology. The approach is evaluated by introducing a case developed as part of the European research project GOOD MAN. In the context of the project an enterprise architecture metamodel has been designed, developed and deployed that supports an integrated viewpoint of conceptual model artefacts coupled with operational data visualisations to assess the effectiveness of design decisions."
pub.1094479763,An Ontology Acquisition Method for Business Process Modelling and Improvement,"the idea of ontology-based approach to business process modeling is certainly viable. However, according to the semantic representation deficiency of the process models, it's hard to realize the ontology auto-acquisition to support the model mapping from domain model to IT-specific PIM. This paper presents an ontology-activity-based model acquisition approach to improve business process modelling. It proposes that the key elements in business process modeling are activities and should be the basis in constructing the domain ontology. Aiming to provide the key description capability for the process model, it discusses the hierarchy of the model by adding the structure dimension between the information tier and process tier to describe the relationships of the object and the process from the viewpoint of activity structure attributes. It also describes a model-relevance-calculation-based optimal method for extracting ontology activities from the process meta-models. Finally, the ontology activity identification and acquisition approach is discussed."

In this paper we want to find out how to support users best in grasping process changes. For this, first of all, a conceptualization of Change Tracking Graphs (CTG) is provided that is independent of any process meta model. The CTGs are then visualized in different ways following aesthetic criteria on the one side and mental map aspects on the other side. Further, different visual properties are applied. All different combinations of change representation for process models are evaluated based on an empirical study with 117 participants. This study provides a first stepstone towards a more user-centric application of process change."

An SP_Machine is based on an underlying software process (meta)model. Of consequence, different SP_Machines can be defined. The one presented here is based on a state-oriented metamodel for software process. We believe that SP_Machines we will become a crucial component of the future SDEs (Software Development Environments) and, moreover, the effectiveness of these will largely depend on the power of the SP_Machines that we will be able to realize in the near future."
pub.1006246781,Deriving XACML Policies from Business Process Models,"The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) has become a defacto standard for describing processes in an accessible graphical notation. The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is an OASIS standard to specify and enforce platform independent access control policies.In this paper we define a mapping between the BPMN and XACML meta-models to provide a model-driven extraction of security policies from a business process model. Specific types of organisational control and compliance policies that can be expressed in a graphical fashion at the business process modeling level can now be transformed into the corresponding task authorizations and access control policies for process-aware information systems.As a proof of concept, we extract XACML access control policies from a security augmented banking domain business process. We present an XSLT converter that transforms modeled security constraints into XACML policies that can be deployed and enforced in a policy enforcement and decision environment. We discuss the benefits of our modeling approach and outline how XACML can support task-based compliance in business processes."
pub.1051003435,Meta Model Extensibility of BPMN: Current Limitations and Proposed Improvements,"The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the prevalent conceptual modeling language for business process modeling and process analysis. BPMN benefits from its expressiveness and the well-defined meta model, which is defined by the Meta Object Facility (MOF). The emergence of BPMN entails an increasing demand for language extensions in order to both benefit from the dissemination and apposite concepts. Although BPMN is one of very few languages that explicitly provides capabilities for its extension, the proposed mechanism reveals some shortcomings and inaccuracies concerning model abstractions, specificity and semantical clarity. A list of improvable aspects is hence provided based on an in-depth analysis of the extension mechanism. The analysis has a special focus on the abstract syntax (BPMN meta model). Several techniques for enhanced BPMN extension design are proclaimed by adapting alternative mechanisms for language extensibility: Profiling, under specification (hooking) and annotation (plug-ins and add-ons). The stated mechanisms are partly adapted from other modeling languages (profiling) or the field of Software Engineering (hooking, plug-ins, add-ons). Each approach is described by its core concepts, its application and by some examples. The approaches are finally compared regarding several criteria."
pub.1094132015,A Multi Level approach to Autonomic Business Process,"As a result of new business demands and technological advances processes are becoming increasingly complex and heterogeneous. This calls for business processes that must be managed in an autonomic manner in response to changes in its environmental context. However, a key challenge is to provide variability, understandability and scalability in modeling increasingly complex business processes. In our work we rely on explicit representation of environment variability through context-awareness and quality attributes in order to properly represent autonomic features in Business Process Models. We outline a process that helps to define the modularity of the Business Process Models, indicating where the system needs to be instrumented. A meta-model with the concepts used is presented. This novel approach provides four well-defined levels of abstraction: Communicational Level, Technological Level, Operational Level and Service Level. A real example is used to illustrate our proposal."
pub.1037956224,A Meta-model for e-Contract Template Variable Dependencies Facilitating e-Negotiation,"Contracts are important for attaining business process interoperability and enforcing their proper enactment. An e-Contract is the computerized facilitation or automation of a contract in a cross-organizational business process. In this paper, motivated by a lease template example, we propose a meta-model for e-Contract templates and template variables. Furthermore, we discover different types of relationships, such as partial order and indivisibility, among template variables. In addition, negotiators can logroll among template variables, focusing on tradeoffs among these instead of arguing about single variables. Based on these relationships, we present an algorithm to determine a negotiation plan of an e-Contract. Furthermore, we propose a model for e-Negotiation of contracts based on contract templates and workflow management technologies. As a result, the process of contract e-Negotiation can be streamlined."

By applying DSM and MDA, the meta-model consisting of domain schema and domain template was established to simplify the business process. Then the character property, relationship property and operation of business-process-oriented DSM (BP-DSM) meta-model were described. The meta-model and application template would be consummated by continuous instantiation and abstraction of the domain concepts. By extracting and accumulating a large number of enterprises' templates within the same industry, the industry-oriented model template would be ultimately established."

By now a large number of systems, that follow different workflow paradigms, are available. This leads to the problem of selecting the appropriate workflow management system for a given situation. In this paper we outline the benefits of a meta model approach for the evaluation and comparison of different workflow management systems. After a general introduction on the topic of meta modeling the meta models of the workflow management systems WorkParty (Siemens Nixdorf) and FlowMark (IBM) are compared as an example. These product specific meta models can be generalized to meta reference models, which helps to specify a workflow methodology. Exemplary, an organisational reference meta model is presented, which helps users in specifying their requirements for a workflow management system."
pub.1094280347,TRANSFORMING YAWL WORKFLOW TO BPEL SKELETON,"Nowadays, a business process is presented widely in form of BPEL in order to illustrate the interaction of web services. Unfortunately, some complex business processes are not completely implemented by BPEL due to the limitation of the language. An alternative language called YAWL is lately created to support the complex patterns of business processes/workflows and to provide the well-form structural checking scheme of the patterns. However, BPEL is still famous, standardized and supported in the modeling tools. In this research, a YA WL-to-BPEL transforming procedure is proposed to encourage the alternative of using YAWL as a initial modeling language. The YAWL process/workflow patterns will be transformed into a meta-model using control flow graph. The Fold function is invoked to perform the iterative checking on both the well-structured and non well-structured process/workflow patterns. The corresponding BPEL skeleton will be finally generated."

Today, telework is mainly used for isolated tasks and for those with only few cross-references to others. But telework will only achieve its full potential if attention is given to the fact that work in companies is normally co-operative work. For this co-operative work, business process modeling and workflow management is accepted as a supporting methodology. On the one hand this is important for enabling a production company to distribute work to employees who operate within this organizational model, and at the same time, compared with conventional models of organizing work, to increase the productivity of task execution. The increasing effort for co-ordination and monitoring is seen to be the main obstacle of co-operative telework. The use of existing workflow management systems for the support of co-operative telework is currently not possible; there is no tool available with specific co-ordination and planning functionality for this purpose. In this paper, we will define a specific business process model which is oriented for the modeling of decentralized structures especially for telework and the direct support by a workflow management system (WFMS). Compared to traditional WFMSs, our system is extended by a module for the planning and monitoring functionality required for monitoring of teleworkers and their time management. The distribution of work is supported by means of a co-ordinator as a constituent part of the WFMS. It executes workflows which are provided by a certain method for modeling business processes. This method already considers necessary refinements in passing over business processes to workflows. The models for business processes are supplied by means of a meta-model, which is extended by aspects of telematics. The system is built using Internet technology and uses platform-independent WWW software for the user interface."
pub.1095110978,Semantics of Control-Flow in UML 2.0 Activities,"The recent major revision of the UML [23] has introduced significant changes and additions. In particular, the metamodel portion underlying Activity Diagrams has been completely reengineered, with Activity being the central concept, the successor of ActivityGraph in UML 1.5. In this paper, a denotational and compositional semantics for Activities is defined as a mapping from Activities into Procedural Petri nets [21]. The semantics excludes data type annotations and all features based on them, but includes all kinds of control flow, including non well-formed concurrency and, particularly, procedure calling."
pub.1120017725,An automation framework design for secure software development,"Abstract Business process modeling (BPM) is procedural‐oriented advanced activity for representing process models with domain knowledge. It consists of all the functional requirements given by the users to build the software. However, nonfunctional requirements such as cost, time, performance, and security are used to evaluate the performance of a system. Among these requirements, security is the vital attribute to be taken care at the early stage of any software development. For example, even governing bodies are heavily dependents on the data system due to security exposures. So automation on model transformation from non‐secured metamodel to secured metamodels improves the overall execution of the software evolution process. In this paper, the authors propose an Auto Secure Business Process (AutoSBP) system to automate security to the existing software models. The activity model of existing system is dismantled into attributes and actions to extract its business need. Based on the interpretation from business data, security implications are applied to the existing software models. To fine tune the security implications, ID3 decision learning algorithm is applied. The effect of the system‐generated model assures the quality by its complexity metrics."

As the meta-model contains a plethora of parameters, a specialised language, i.e. RSSL, has been introduced to facilitate the transformation of the meta-model into a model of the designed system, i.e. its specification. The paper focuses on an example showing how RSSL is used in the design process. The use case is a ball-collecting mobile robot operating in two modes: teleoperated and autonomous, controlled by voice commands, navigating in an environment containing obstacles."
pub.1018707312,Modeling and executing ConcurTaskTrees using a UML and SOIL-based metamodel,"In this paper, we present a formal metamodel-based approach for modeling and executing ConcurTaskTrees (CTT). CTT is a modeling language for tasks that represent hierarchical tree-like, structured workflow models. In the metamodel soundness properties as well as operational semantics of the workflow language are captured. The models are created with an abstract syntax in the UML-based Specification Environment (USE). Thereafter, they can be executed in the same tool by calling operations from the metamodel that are implemented in the Simple OCL-based Imperative Language (SOIL). A plugin for the USE tool has been developed to give an appropriate interface to the user who can test dynamic control flow properties of the models with it."
pub.1095091428,BPMN Process Model Checking Using Traceability,"Model transformation is a method for transforming elements of one Meta model into other Meta model elements. System like software or business model checking is significant research domain. Question is that when Model Transformation is performed for transforming a model to another model how much accurately it was performed. There is a method that I have used is Traceability to find out that natural language specifications accurately transformed to proposed business process model. Traceability is a method to find out that any specifications of natural language accurately transformed to proposed business process model. Traceability makes easy for users to trace the weight between different software engineering artifacts. Typically technique used for model checking very helpful to verify the correctness and accuracy of properties in a model. Our presented work presents an implementation of Traceability, a mechanism used to keep record between the Source model and Target model elements in model transformation framework. Traceability is a mechanism that can be used for instance level reverse transformation automatically. This type of applications for Traceability is essential for model transformation such as Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) to Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Our presented approach is inspired by Query View Transformation (QVT) that is formulated as an algorithm. This paper also reports on a case study that is based on model transformation in SBVR to BPMN, which uses new version of SiTra."
pub.1094174793,Run-Time Composition of Partly Structured Business Processes Using Heuristic Planning,"Context: Organizations act in a highly competitive markets, which forces them to be able to quickly adapt and optimize their processes. Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) supports modelling run-time adaptation of partially structured business process models, but does neither allow selection nor sequence of tasks. Objective: Our goal is to develop an approach that computes sequences of tasks such that a context-specific goal is satisfied. We apply the SMA * algorithm to support run-time planning of partly structured parts of a business process in order to find an appropriate sequence of tasks. Method: We perform a literature review in order to derive the most suitable heuristic search algorithm. To support the selection and specification of tasks, we extend the CMMN metamodel. A running example is presented to show practical applicability of the approach. Results: The extension of the CMMN metamodel reflects the requirements for serializing tasks at run-time. Furthermore, we modified the SMA * algorithm and defined a heuristic function. Conclusion: Our approach allows to automatically derive execution plans for partly structured business processes depending on the context."
pub.1004042084,An ontology-based semantic foundation for ARIS EPCs,"This paper presents an ontological analysis of the EPC (Event-driven Process Chain) business process modeling notation supported in the ARIS Toolset. This ontological analysis provides an interpretation of the modeling elements in EPC diagrams in terms of the UFO foundational ontology. This enables us to define the precise real-world semantics for business process models represented through EPCs and allows us to identify problems affecting the clarity and expressiveness of EPCs. In our analysis, we consider an up-to-date metamodel of the ARIS Method that we have defined in our earlier work, which specifies EPCs as currently supported by the ARIS Toolset. To the best of our knowledge, the interpretation proposed here is presently the most complete ontological account for EPCs."

pub.1113703506,A Performance Measurement Extension for BPMN,"Business process model and notation (BPMN) is becoming the most used modeling language for business process. One of the important upgrades of BPMN 2.0 is the fact that data objects are now handling semantic elements. Nevertheless, BPMN does not enable the representation of performance measurement in the case of interoperability problems in the exchange of data objects, which remains a limitation when using BPMN to express interoperability issues in enterprise processes. We propose to extend the metamodel of BPMN in order to fill this gap. The extension, named performanceMeasurement, is defined using the BPMN extension mechanism. This new element will allow to represent performance measurement in the case of interoperability problems as well as interoperability concerns which have been solved. We illustrate the data interoperability capabilities with an example from a real industrial case."
pub.1119509840,Web Services Modeling and Composition Approach using Object-Oriented Petri Nets,"Nowadays, with the emergence and the evolution of new technologies, such as
e-business, a large number of companies are connected to Internet, and have
proposed web services to trade. Web services as presented, are conceptually
limited components to relatively simple functionalities. Generally, a single
service does not satisfy the users needs that are more and more complex.
Therefore, services must be made able to be composed to offer added value
services. In this paper, a web services composition approach, modelled by
Objects-Oriented Petri nets, is presented. In his context, an expressive
algebra, which successfully solves the web services complex composition
problem, is proposed. A java tool that allows automating this approach; based
on a definite algebra and a G-nets meta-model, proposed by us, is developed."
pub.1131897220,Propagation of Parametric Uncertainty in a Conceptually Designed Bioethanol Production Process,"Understanding the propagation of parametric uncertainty in model-based computer simulations of conceptually designed bioprocesses and their metamodels is a critical step in improving the utilization and usefulness of such models. Generally, the number of design and operational parameters to be identified, calculated or assumed is very high. However, uncertainty analyses of these parameters usually focus on a selected few. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effect of increasing the number of uncertain parameters on the uncertainty of the metrics of interest acquired from the simulations and metamodels generated to relate these metrics to the uncertain parameters. The results indicate that overall uncertainty in simulated process metrics stabilises after a certain number of uncertain parameters is reached regardless of the characteristics of parametric uncertainty. However, metamodeling options such as sampling method, number of samples used, and type of metamodels used have direct effects on how the overall uncertainty can be represented by these metamodels. A demonstrative analysis is offered on a bioethanol production process model as a case study. In conclusion, the findings in this paper highlight the importance of the workflow followed in generating metamodels of bioprocess simulations under uncertainty."

For this, AST provides integrated support of several decision deferral based approaches to process flexibility and enables their systematic comparison. Moreover, AST facilitates the design and execution of controlled experiments through experimental workflow support. This paper introduces AST, explains its underlying meta-model, discusses factors which can be investigated using AST and shows how it can be used for designing and conducting experiments."
pub.1049689509,Inter-organizational Reference Models – May Inter-organizational Systems Profit from Reference Modeling?,"Inter-organizational systems span from business models over business process models to their execution on top of a service-oriented architecture. In our project BSopt we have developed an integrated model-driven approach that addresses the different layers and builds up-on well-estabilshed languages on each of these layers. When applying our integrated methodology we recognized that models for the same business case are similar, but still varying for different business partner networks. Accordingly, a systematic approach to derive a model from another model, i.e., from a reference model, is needed. Significant achievements have been made by the reference modeling community in finding ways to leverage the potentials of model reuse in business process modeling. In this paper we outline the potentials of adapting design techniques known from reference modeling to the specific needs of inter-organizational system develpment even if we do not provide a solution yet."
pub.1094041211,Compliance Scopes: Extending the BPMN 2.0 Meta Model to Specify Compliance Requirements,"Compliance of business processes is becoming increasingly important in the domain of business process design. Despite that, human process designers must be able to concentrate on the business goals which a business process needs to fulfil. Compliance aspects of the business process should not be in the main focus of the human process designer during the development phase. Therefore, tools must support human process designers in developing compliant business processes. In this paper we introduce the concept of compliance scopes. Compliance scopes are areas in a business process where certain compliance conditions must hold. These conditions are attached to the compliance scopes. Compliance scopes can be applied to existing business process models as well as to process templates. In this way compliance rules are applied to certain areas of a business process. During design time, compliance scopes can be used in graphical workbenches to evaluate modifications to business processes."
pub.1019113487,Applying Model Transformation By-Example on Business Process Modeling Languages,"Model transformations are playing a vital role in the field of model engineering. However, for non-trivial transformation issues most approaches require imperative definitions, which are cumbersome and error-prone to create. Therefore, Model Transformation By Example (MTBE) approaches have been proposed as user-friendly alternative that simplifies the definition of model transformations. Up to now, MTBE approaches have been applied to structural models, only. In this work we apply MTBE to the domain of business process modeling languages, i.e., Event-driven Process Chains and UML activity diagrams. Compared to structural languages, business process modeling languages cover static semantic constraints, which are not specified in the metamodel. As a consequence, reasoning on the abstract syntax level is not sufficient. The contribution of this paper is to extend our existing MTBE approach by new alignment operators on the user level, which further improves the transparency of model transformation code. Concrete syntax and the knowledge about mapping 0operators are to be the only requisite artifacts."
pub.1133170939,An UML Based Performance Evaluation of Real-Time Systems Using Timed Petri Net,"Performance is a critical non-functional parameter for real-time systems and performance analysis is an important task making it more challenging for complex real-time systems. Mostly performance analysis is performed after the system development but an early stage analysis and validation of performance using system models can improve the system quality. In this paper, we present an early stage automated performance evaluation methodology to analyse system performance using the UML sequence diagram model annotated with modeling and analysis of real-time and embedded systems (MARTE) profile. MARTE offers a performance domain sub-profile that is used for representing real-time system properties essential for performance evaluation. In this paper, a transformation technique and transformation rules are proposed to map the UML sequence diagram model into a Generalized Stochastic Timed Petri net model. All the transformation rules are implemented using a metamodel based approach and Atlas Transformation Language (ATL). A case study from the manufacturing domain a Kanban system is used for validating the proposed technique."

This model takes advantage of the strong points of the Web Service distributed computing model. Being a good extension and modification of early meta-model, it is more flexible, adaptive, and customizable. It can also smooth over the difference between various software and hardware platforms, to better support the interaction between workflow systems of different structures."
pub.1026201573,Ontology-based process model for business architecture of a virtual enterprise,"As new collaborative business models emerge, considerable research is being carried out on Virtual Enterprise (VE) as an alternative to secure competition. To operate a VE, a common framework that must be shared between participants is needed to implement a seamless business process. This paper focuses on an ontology-based process model that provides a common semantic and communication protocol. The suggested process model has a single integrated meta-model that describes the internal and intra business process of a VE. The internal process is the formal process of each business partner and is described using the Collaborative Component Architecture (CCA) of Enterprise Distributed Object Computing (EDOC). On the other hand, the intra process is a collaborative process that can be modified by the business scenario and is described using a Role Activity Diagram (RAD). The suggested process model is applied for the collaborative design chain process of the automotive-part industry as a case study."

This chapter presents a simple practical framework for aligning various concepts and representations of organizational behavior, which assists identifying appropriate model types. The framework is presented as a means to improve process modeling within BPM initiatives and as a guide to the development and documentation of process architectures. A set of BPMN 2.0 based templates are described which enable the modeling of the concepts in the framework. Both health sector and investment management industry cases studies are described in which the framework is used to align descriptions of organizational behavior to produce useful integrated behavioral reference models and unified process model sets. The framework is also used to analyze model and process architecture completeness and structure."
pub.1094886496,A Model-Driven Engineering approach with Diagnosis of Non-Conformance of Security Objectives in Business Process Models,"Several reports indicate that the highest business priorities include: business improvement, security, and IT man-agement. The importance of security and risk management is gaining that even government statements in some cases have imposed the inclusion of security and risk management within business management. Risk assessment has become an essential mechanism for business security analysts, since it allows the identification and evaluation of any threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to which organizations maybe be exposed. In this work, a framework based on the concepts of Model-Driven Development has been proposed. The framework provides different stages which range from a high abstraction level to an executable level. The main contribution lie in the presentation of an extension of a business process meta-model which includes risk information based on standard approaches. The meta-model provides necessary characteristics for the risk assessment of business process models at an abstract level of the approach. The framework has been equipped with specific stages for the automatic validation of business processes using model-based diagnosis which permits the detection of the non-conformance of security objectives specified. The validation stages ensure that business processes are correct with regard to the objectives specified by the customer before they are transformed into executable processes."

Nevertheless, there is a lack of unified definition, description and modeling method of the HV. This paper demonstrates HV as an additional viewpoint to strive to understand what HV is and how the HV can be used to describe the combat organizing process (HV-5) in the network centric warfare. By mapping the combat organizing process elements defined in HV-5 Meta model to the Object Petri Net (OPN) data elements, an OPN based model method for HV-5 is proposed. This model can effectively show how the operational human interact with each other in the combat organizing process."

In this paper we present a meta model for block structured workflow models in the form of classi- cal nested control structure representation as well as the frequently used graph representations. We support reuse of elementary and complex ac- tivities in several workflow definitions, and the separation of workflow specification from (expanded) workflow models. Furthermore, we pro- vide a set of equivalence transformations which allow to map workflows between different representations and to hange the positions of control elements without hanging the semantics of the workflow."

This solution advocates a driven engineering approach considering at the CIM level, a specific meta-model, the Version Business Process (VBP) meta-model for modelling versions of Business Processes (BP), and at the PIM level, an extension of the BPMN meta-model for visualizing and user validating the modelled BP versions. This paper introduces the VBP meta-model, presents the extension of BPMN we propose to specify versions of BPs, and illustrates how we automatically map, using QVT rules, BP versions modelled using the VBP meta-model onto corresponding extended BPMN ones. This solution is intended to business process designers: it supports them for modelling and specifying flexible business processes using the version concept."
pub.1094174508,A Role and Task-based Workflow Dynamic Authorization Modeling and Enforcement Mechanism,"Current workflow products can support more complex modeling of business processes, workflow engine mechanism is well researched, but the link between organizational elements and process activities is less well understood. In access control, most products can only support fixed role-based task assignment, not enough in considering more complex security policies, such as DSOD, task binding of duties, and temporal constraints, that important in dynamic workflow system. This paper examines workflow access control requirement in practice, analyzes WFMC workflow meta-model, and adopts the R&TBAC approach to separate role-based organization and task-based authorization-step modeling, and especially designs an agent-based dynamic policy enforcement mechanism to bridge the gap. The intelligent task assigning agent to be defined as a virtual participant in workflow process definition, and creating within workflow engine controlled available task instance, acts as to evaluate task dynamic authorization policy to provide eligible task participant role-set based on its information model. This paper gives a formal specification of the workflow authorization model, and designs the agent information model, assigning policy model, and function model in detail. The modeling approach can widely adapt to various existing workflow systems and can automatically change policy as enterprise organization or business process definition need changing."

pub.1095829631,CuteFlow: A Refined Modeling-Driven Business Process Designer,"Currently in the BPM (Business Process Management) domain, there exist many meta-models which are defined as a set of semantic elements for representing related concepts. Correspondingly, various tools have been developed based on one of those meta-models. However, the more complicated the meta-models are, the more difficult it is to interoperate two heterogeneous models. In the meantime, SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) emerges as a promising solution to the highly efficient integration of enterprises, while MDA (Modeling Driven Architecture) is proceeding rapidly on its way to a high maturity along with the perfection of supporting tools which provides a solid foundation for the implementation. In this paper, we extract a refined meta-model based on the mainstream meta-models. Then, Modeling-Driven roadmap on technology of our modeler is proposed. Finally, we both design and implement a business process modeling tool based on the meta-model following the MDA methodology."

BPEL provides a workflow‐oriented composition model for Web services applications, and is thus a central piece in the heavily componentized service‐oriented computing model. BPEL results from the merger of two distinct process metamodels (the process algebra model of XLANG and the graph‐oriented model of WSFL) into a coherent and powerful framework. Implementing BPEL thus presents significant challenges to middleware developers.

To be more efficient, organizations look for a good business process modeling. In this way, to model a business process, the are a lot of knowledge which are responsible to present a part of the process in a good level of understanding. However, the issue to be addressed in this paper is how to formalize implicit pieces of knowledge figured in the business process so as to construct a business knowledge model which will be treat in a high understanding level. This paper contributes with a meta-modeling approach that the principle is to transform a business process model to a business knowledge model. The purpose of such an approach is to provide a way to automatically build a business ontology based on easy processing of business knowledge dimensions."

Two optimisation methods, mixed integer programming solver and heuristic simulation-based optimisation are compared to each other. It can be shown, up to which model complexity the solver methods have the advantage over the simulation-based methods concerning a possible online application. Both the mathematical formulation as well as the discrete event simulation system, bases on a meta-model – a special Petri net. It is shown that bipartite graphs, i.e. Petri nets, avoid ambiguities in the case of alternative assembly sequences and have advantages in comparison to the usual simple precedence graphs. The results of optimisation experiments are described by the example of assembling a numeric controlled milling table. The model is capable of reflecting multiple parallel assembly processes, alternative assembly steps and can predict characteristics like utilisation, stock or adherence to schedules."

This transition implies the transformation towards Industry 4.0. The latter is characterized by the increasing interconnection of equipment through the Internet of Things. Also, this evolution has strongly impacted the complexity of projects. At this moment, a reliable project management method must be applied to allow good project management considering the customer’s changing needs. Project management experts make a great effort to train their team on the functionality and operation of the method. Among these methods, we have the Feature Driven Development (FDD) method. It is an agile method dedicated to large projects. This paper in the first phase aims to help these experts and anyone who wants to know the process of the FDD method through a business process model using the BPMN standard.

pub.1023008323,Unified Process Modeling with UPROM Tool,"UPROM tool is a business process modeling tool designed to conduct business process and user requirements analysis in an integrated way to constitute a basis for process automation. Usually, business process models are not utilized systematically to develop related artifacts, specifically when a process-aware information system is to be developed to automate those processes. This results in completeness, consistency and maintainability problems for those artifacts. Unified business process modeling methodology, UPROM, is developed to integrate process modeling and practices. Enabling the application of UPROM, the tool provides editors for six different diagram types based on a common meta-model. It offers features so that modelers can develop a cohesive set of models. Using these models, UPROM tool can be used to automatically generate artifacts of user requirements document, COSMIC based software size estimation, process definition document and business glossary."

pub.1133450059,A Meta Model for Mining Processes from Email Data,"Significant research work has been conducted in the area of process mining leading to mature solutions for discovering knowledge from structured process event logs analysis. Recently, there were several initiatives to extend the scope of these analysis to consider heterogeneous and unstructured data sources. More precisely, email analysis has attracted much attention as emailing system is considered as the principal channel to support the execution of business processes. However, existing initiatives didn’t formalize the relationship between emailing systems and business process elements. As a result, they target to discover business processes limited to the activity perspective. In this paper, we first propose a meta model to specify what kind of process knowledge we can discover from emails. We define by this way a research roadmap for an effective multi-perspective process discovery from emails. This metamodel is proved through a concrete case study related to ""hiring"", ""patent application"", and ""paper submission"" business processes. In addition, we highlight the limitations of current process mining techniques in the discovery of different process perspectives."

We follow a participative design approach based on scenarios in order to design a socially-adapted device that will be useful to improve seniors’ life. To specify our system, we first provide an UML scenario metamodel to abstract all the concepts involved in our system collaborative functioning (interactions with stakeholders, environment …). This metamodel is used to generate different scenarios in order to better define future users ‘needs and the system requirements and notably its behavior (represented with BPMN and Petri Nets). A scenario generator has been implemented for that purpose. Finally, we show how to simulate and analyze those generated scenarios using process mining techniques."
pub.1160188879,Using Team Topologies in Model-Driven Strategic Alignment,"Model-driven techniques for designing strategically aligned information systems usually map the goals of multiple and competing actors to business process models through automatic model-to-model transformations and analysis. In previous work, we designed Stra2Bis, a method for designing strategically aligned business processes based on a different approach: mapping the business strategy and organisation structure into the business process model. Stra2Bis and goal-based techniques share an issue: only some organisational level elements actors directly affect the business domain and, thus, the business processes. In this article, we propose to extend Stra2Bis by adding concepts from Team Topologies, an approach for organising business and technology teams. Team Topologies help distinguish the business-relevant organisation units from other supporting units; we exploit these concepts to constrain the model-to-model mappings, avoiding unnecessary analysis and modelling outside the business domain. We formalise the approach by specifying the method's metamodel extension and redefining the model-to-model transformation guidelines. We also discuss how existing goal-based alignment frameworks can exploit this approach."

For the analysis (or simulation) of the system as a whole, each component is transformed into a single common formalism having an appropriate solution method. In our approach we make meta-models of the formalisms and express transformations between them as graph transformation. These concepts have been automated in the AToM3 tool and as an example, we show the analysis of a hybrid system composed of a temperature controlled liquid in a vessel. The liquid is initially described using differential equations whose behaviour can be abstracted and represented as a Statechart. The controller is modelled by means of a Statechart and the temperature as a Petri net. The Statechart models are translated into Petri nets and joined with the temperature model to form a single Petri net, for which its reachability graph is calculated and Model-Checking techniques are used to verify its properties."
pub.1043468336,A New Process Meta-model for Convenient Process Reconfiguration,"With the analysis of WFMC (Workflow Management Coalition) process meta-model, it’s indicated that the limitations of that model cause the difficulty for convenient reconfiguration of business process. So, a new process meta-model, ESR (Event-State-Rule) meta-model, is presented in this paper as the substitution to WFMC’s. Some elements are added in the new model, such as the event, the state and the rule with which dynamic relevance between the process and the business can be normalized expressed in process definition. Also, the boundary between process logic and business logic becomes much more explicit with the benefit from that model, which means that process logic can be separated from business logic quite effectively. Now, it becomes possible that rigid process and flexible process are modeled in a unified process framework. When process logic varies, the reconfiguration of the process may be fulfilled only with the corresponding variation of process definition so that convenient process reconfiguration is implemented."
pub.1014605407,Automated development of constraint-driven web applications,"Today's Web Applications (WAs) are complex multi-user and multi-tenant software systems, used by users with different roles and often developed to support and manage complex business processes. Due to the changing nature of such processes, WAs need to be easily and quickly modified, to be adapted and aligned to the processes they support. In recent years, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches have been used to support the development and the evolution of WAs. However, the definition of appropriate MDE approaches for the development of flexible process-centric WAs is still limited. In particular, flexible workflow models have never been integrated with the models used in MDE approaches to develop this type of applications. This paper proposes an MDE approach for the development and the evolution of flexible process-centric WAs that integrates four MDE metamodels used to represent the main components of a WA with the metamodel of Declare, a declarative language to model business processes. A case study, carried out to validate the feasibility, the correctness and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is presented and discussed."
pub.1164503577,Shape Optimization of a Cooling Hole Using Improved Metamodeling Techniques and Workflow,"Abstract In modern day gas turbine hot sections, active cooling of liner walls is critical due to extremely high temperatures and long continuous operation. A secondary flow can be introduced that shields the metal surfaces by forming a film increasing the durability and life of the liner. Typically, this cooling flow is mixed with the mainstream by a series of holes or slots along the length of the liner wall. In the past, typically, these effusion holes were cylindrical. However, as the hot section temperature increases, more advanced hole designs are necessary for increased cooling effects. Determining an optimal hole design is costly and time-consuming if approached with standard experimental trial-and-error techniques. Numerical tools can aide in optimization studies, but for complex transient flows requiring scale-resolving methods, simple optimization methodologies require thousands of design points and can take extended periods of time to complete. In this study, a metamodel-based optimization of a shaped cooling hole is demonstrated in an automated workflow. The automated workflow consists of six geometrical hole parameters being investigated at flow conditions akin to the hot section at a constant blowing ratio. These six parameters completely define the shape of the hole leading to a complete optimized design for maximum cooling effectiveness. The metamodel is based on data from a stress-blended eddy simulation (SBES). To construct the meta-model, an adaptive technique is used that employs machine learning (ML) algorithms to minimize the number of required design points by dynamically modifying the design space sampling based on the gradients in the response. As part of the metamodel generation, a sensitivity analysis is performed to eliminate geometry parameters which do not influence the cooling effectiveness. The optimization study is done in two parts: the first part involves an evolutionary algorithm-based optimizer which runs the fast-running metamodel through multiple design points to identify potential optimal solution candidates; the second part involves validating the candidate designs using actual solver calls. This two-pronged approach drastically reduces the time to achieve optimal effusion hole design while ensuring that the design space is explored thoroughly. Overall, this work demonstrates the enhanced optimization capabilities and timeline compression of a shaped cooling hole."
pub.1025333785,RAL: A High-Level User-Oriented Resource Assignment Language for Business Processes,"An important task of business process design is the definition of what and how members of an organization are involved in the activities of the business processes developed within it. In this paper we analyse the capabilities of BPMN 2.0, the de-facto standard for business process modelling, in this regard. The conclusion is that, although it provides some mechanisms to assign resources to business process activities, they present several drawbacks. On the one hand, it does not provide a clear way to relate the assignment of resources with a model of the structure of the organization. On the other hand, it relies on XPath as the default language to assign resources to activities. The consequence is that it has limitations regarding the expressiveness of resource assignment expressions. Furthermore, it makes resource assignment not easy to learn and use since XPath has not been designed for that purpose. To overcome these drawbacks we introduce RAL (Resource Assignment Language), a DSL based on a well-known organizational metamodel that can be used together with BPMN 2.0. RAL provides more expressiveness to the resource assignments and it uses a high-level sintaxis defined to be used by technically unskilled users."

pub.1107869556,Providing the Flexibility of the Shop Floor to Information Systems for Monitoring Tasks,"This chapter presents an approach to use business processes that describe the value‐adding processes of a company to configure the information system to provide the correct information. This approach uses two use cases, one for providing key performance indicators (KPIs) the other for providing condition‐monitoring information. The presented approach, increasing interoperability in terms of reducing configuration efforts for flexible systems by using business processes, has three main aspects. The first is that the different measuring models need to be integrated into the management system. The second is that the meta‐models of the management system and the business process model need to be compatible. The third is that the connections between the process model and the measuring models need to be created, ideally automatically. The business process model and notation (BPMN) models of the company's business are used to adopt the flexibility of the production processes."

Since it is hard for end-users to combine heterogeneous business processes and obtain Web service-based solutions, this paper proposes MPMR (Metamodel for Process Model Registration) to register business process and Web service in a unified and normative manner and then enable semantic interoperation between them. In this way, the MPMR-based registration information of them can be used to help smoothly translate professional business process requirements into the corresponding solution based on Web services. Finally, a typical case study in urban transportation is demonstrated to show the practice of using MPMR to support development of Web service applications for a VE or the participating enterprises."

This paper presents the concept of Temporal Workflow. Through extending and modifying the WfMC’s Basic Process Definition Meta-model, a modified workflow meta-model is presented, and the temporal attributes of elements and their relations in it are analyzed in detail. Based on this, the primary elements in workflow are formalized, and time is introduced into workflow as a dimension."
pub.1157075892,BPMN4MOOC: A BPMN extension for the design of connectivist MOOC,"Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard formalism for business process modeling that is very popular in professional practices due to its expressiveness, the well-defined meta-model, and its easiness of use by non-technical users. For instance, BPMN2.0 is used for business processes in commercial areas such as banks, shops, production, and supply industry. Due to its flexible notation, BPMN is increasingly being used in non-traditional business process domains like education. The presented research work aims to develop a valid extension by applying the BPMN representation of pedagogical scenario in connectivist cMOOC context. BPMN provides a set of generic process modeling elements that make it necessary to extend the language and notation by domain-specific concepts from connectivist pedagogical approach. Therefore, BPMN2.0 extensibility mechanism was explored to include the representation of specific cMOOC pedagogical concepts. Moreover, this paper provides an analysis of the requirements of those concepts. Based on a cMOOC-oriented pedagogical scenario model, the need for an extension is identified and the valid BPMN extension meta-model is designed by the construction of a conceptual domain-specific model and the corresponding BPMN extension model."

The collaboration processes of inter-enterprise are very complicated and highly dynamic. It is necessary to develop a process model to describe the business flow across enterprise boundaries. This work presents the process meta-model as the basis of process modeling. And the main element entities in the meta-model are defined to provide the knowledge for process modeling. Further more, for customer using easily, we bring forward the UML-based graphic modeling method that has user-friendly interaction and the model instances. The UML sequence diagram is used to show information exchange between collaboration partners, and the extended activity diagram is used to show the collaborative process. Finally, the procedure declaration of business process modeling is given to guide modeling, and a modeling tool system has been developed."
pub.1093730217,A Petri Net Based Debugging Environment for QVT Relations,"In the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm the Query/View/Transformation (QVT) standard plays a vital role for model transformations. Especially the high-level declarative QVT Relations language, however, has not yet gained widespread use in practice. This is not least due to missing tool support in general and inadequate debugging support in particular. Transformation engines interpreting QVT Relations operate on a low level of abstraction, hide the operational semantics of a transformation and scatter metamodels, models, QVT code, and trace information across different artifacts. We therefore propose a model-based debugger representing QVT Relations on bases of TROPIC, a model transformation language utilizing a variant of Colored Petri Nets (CPNs). As a prerequisite for convenient debugging, TROPIC provides a homogeneous view on all artifacts of a transformation on basis of a single formalism. Besides that, this formalism also provides a runtime model, thus making the afore hidden operational semantics of the transformation explicit. Using an explicit runtime model allows to employ model-based techniques for debugging, e.g., using the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for simply defining breakpoints and querying the execution state of a transformation."
pub.1016421980,Formal Definition of Measures for BPMN Models,"Business process models are currently attaining more relevance, and more attention is therefore being paid to their quality. This situation led us to define a set of measures for the understandability of BPMN models, which is shown in a previous work. We focus on understandability since a model must be well understood before any changes are made to it. These measures were originally informally defined in natural language. As is well known, natural language is ambiguous and may lead to misunderstandings and a misinterpretation of the concepts captured by a measure and the way in which the measure value is obtained. This has motivated us to provide the formal definition of the proposed measures using OCL (Object Constraint Language) upon the BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) metamodel presented in this paper. The main advantages and lessons learned (which were obtained both from the current work and from previous works carried out in relation to the formal definition of other measures) are also summarized."

In this article, we will present an approach which allows to model business process while integrating context notion, we will propose a meta-model of context that allows to model the context in a generic way, and also a framework to gather this context meta-model with the BPMN model in order to elaborate a contextual business process."
pub.1095228289,A Metamodel-Based Matching Algorithm for Model Transformations,"Metamodeling techniques have become the subject of research in the last decades. Different approaches of software development emphasize the use of models at all phases of the design and implementation. With metamodels, we can define the concepts of models in concrete domains. Model transformations are used to convert models to other ones. To define rules of transformations, we need to declare, which part of the input models has to be converted. By means of metamodels we can define more complex structures to be matched. In this case we need to find an instance of the defined metamodel in the input graph. The efficiency of the matching algorithms is critical during the application of model transformations. In this paper, a matching algorithm is presented that is able to find all instances of metamodels in arbitrary input models."
pub.1016996335,Model-driven specification of adaptive cloud-based systems,"In cloud-based systems, business process models compose loosely coupled services to fulfill a certain goal. In order to ensure a high quality of service (QoS) of these systems, irregularities and violations need to be detected and handled at runtime by adapting the system. As a consequence, engineering such systems requires an explicit modeling of adaptation rules, which define how the system is adapted under certain conditions. These rules are defined based on models that specify QoS agreements as well as service bindings and business processes that are adapted. In this paper, we present a modeling approach for adaptive, cloud-based systems which supports the explicit specification of adaptation rules. We are introducing a metamodel for specifying bindings between business processes and cloud services considering Service Level Agreements that define the required QoS. In order to express adaptations of business processes on different levels of granularity, we are using an extended metamodel including fragments that group multiple process elements."

Firstly, the architectural data meta-model is established to guide architectural data modeling of core data elements and associations in DM2 as the common and consistent data dictionary for architecture modeling, and the executable formalism meta-model is designed to formally define executable models. Then, the mapping rules between both meta-models are defined as the common transformation specification regardless of what modeling language or methodology is employed in developing architectural descriptions. Finally, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) technologies are discussed to facilitate the automated transformation of executable models from architectural instance data. Colored Petri Net (CPN) is used as an illustrative executable formalism in the discussion of the proposed approach."

This meta-model is semantically rich and well founded on COOP, a core ontology of organization’s processes. It covers all aspects of BPM and KM: the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. The aim of BPM4KI is to develop a rich and expressive graphical representation of BPs, especially, the sensitive business processes (SBPs) in order to identify and localize the crucial knowledge that is mobilized and created by these processes.

As far as we know, the metamodel has yet to be studied from a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) perspective. This paper provides an Ecore-based representation of the OCED metamodel and explores its capabilities from an MDE perspective.

Moreover, most traditional modeling methods are incomplete, and ad hoc methods are used to ""fill in the gaps"". As industry dependence on software increases, software quality becomes paramount, and such informal practices are no longer adequate. Model integration is a favorable approach to resolving these problems. The paper examines using a metamodel to provide automatic integration support for traditional modeling methods.

pub.1110301836,A unifying structure of metamodel landscape,"The modelling landscape experiences a rich proliferation of modelling language, or metamodel. The emergence of cross-disciplinary disciplines, such as enterprise engineering and service engineering, necessitates a multi-perspective approach to traverse the component from strategic level to technological aspect. This paper aims to find a unifying structure of metamodels introduced by academics and industries. A grounded approach is taken to define the structure by collating the metamodels to form an emerging structure. Metamodels were collected from a literature survey from several interrelated disciplines: software engineering, system engineering, enterprise architecture, service engineering, business process management and financial accounting. The result suggests seven stereotypes of metamodel, characterized by its label: goal, enterprise, business model, service, process, software and system. The aspect of “process” holds a central role in connecting all other aspect in the modelling continuum. Service engineering can be viewed as an alternative abstraction of enterprise engineering in containing the concepts of “business model”, “capability”, “value”, “interaction”, “process” and “software”. Metamodel collection was performed to emphasize on representativeness rather than comprehensiveness, in which old and unpopular metamodel were disregarded unless it offer unique characteristic not yet represented in the collection. Owing to its bottom-up approach, the paper is not intended to identify a gap in metamodel offering. This paper produces a structure of metamodel landscape in a graphical format to illustrate correlation between metamodels in which evolutive patterns of metamodel proliferation can be observed. The produced structure can serve as map in metamodel continuum."
pub.1016752632,Graph Transformation Concepts for Meta-model Evolution Guaranteeing Permanent Type Conformance throughout Model Migration,"Meta-modeling has become the key technology to define domain-specific modeling languages for model-driven engineering. However, these modeling languages can change quite frequently which requires the evolution of their meta-models as well as the co-evolution (or migration) of their models. In this paper, we present an approach towards meta-model model co-evolution based on graph transformation concepts that targets to consider this challenge in a formal setting. Models are specified as graphs while model relations, especially type-instance relations, are defined by graph morphisms specifying type conformance of models to their meta-models. We present a basic approach to automatic deduction of model migrations from meta-model evolution steps which are specified by single transformation rules. Throughout that migration process, type conformance is ensured permanently. A first implementation is given using existing technology, namely the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the EMF model transformation tool Henshin which is based on graph transformation concepts. Our evolution approach is presented at two small evolution scenarios for Petri nets and state machines."

Business process monitoring deals with recording information about the actual execution of processes to then extract valuable knowledge that can be utilized for business process quality improvement. In prior research, we developed an occurrence-centric approach built on our notion of occurrence that provides a holistic perspective of system dynamics. Based on this concept, more complex structures are defined herein, namely Occurrence Base (OcBase) and Occurrence Management System (OcSystem), which serve as scaffolding to develop business process monitoring systems. This paper focuses primarily on the critical provenance task of extracting valuable knowledge from such systems by proposing an Occurrence Query Framework that includes the definition of an Occurrence Base Metamodel and an Occurrence Query Language based on this metamodel. Our framework provides a way of working for the construction of business process monitoring systems that are provenance aware. As a proof of concept, a tool implementing the various components of the framework is presented. This tool has been tested against a real system in the context of biobanks."
pub.1044126195,Beyond Workflow Mining,"In the domain of Business Process Management and Workflow Management Systems, the log of work transactions executed has been found to be a useful artifact. The ideas, work, and literature on workflow mining have been primarily concerned with examining the workflow event log to rediscover control flow. Workflow mining has generally been defined as “the process of extracting a workflow model from a log of executions of activities”. In fact, most of the literature specifically and narrowly is concerned with rediscovering the precedence relations amongst activities. It is generally a hidden assumption that all activities are known a priori because they are listed by label in the workflow event log. In this position paper, we explore the possibility of removing this assumption, and thus performing workflow discovery rather than precedence rediscovery. Workflow discovery does not assume that process structure or even activities are known a priori and is concerned with discovering a wholistic perspective of workflow.Workflow management systems are people systems that must be designed, deployed, and understood within their social and organizational contexts. Thus, we argue in this document that there is a need to expand the concept of workflow mining beyond the behavioral perspective to encompass the social, organizational, and activity assignment perspectives; as well as other perspectives. To this end, we introduce a general framework and meta-model for workflow discovery, and show one approach to workflow discovery in a multidimensional perspective."

To solve this problem, we suggest automatically to build the schema based business process model with model-to-text conversion technique. This procedure consists of 1) defining each meta-model of the entire structure and of database schema, and 2) also defining model transformation rules for it. With this procedure, we can automatically transform from defining through meta-modeling of an integrated information system designed to the schema based model information table specification defined of the entire layer each layer specification with model-to-text conversion techniques. It is possible to develop the efficiently integrated information system."

They are all the more aware of the need to effectively identify, preserve, share and use the knowledge mobilized by their business processes. Thus, in order to improve their performance, business process modeling has become a primary concern for any organization in order to improve the management of its individual and collective knowledge assets. This paper proposes a new meta-model of sensitive business processes modeling for knowledge management, called BPM4KI (Business Process Meta-Model for Knowledge Identification) based on COOP, a core ontology of organization’s processes.

pub.1035957360,Case handling: a new paradigm for business process support,"Case handling is a new paradigm for supporting flexible and knowledge intensive business processes. It is strongly based on data as the typical product of these processes. Unlike workflow management, which uses predefined process control structures to determine what should be done during a workflow process, case handling focuses on what can be done to achieve a business goal. In case handling, the knowledge worker in charge of a particular case actively decides on how the goal of that case is reached, and the role of a case handling system is assisting rather than guiding her in doing so. In this paper, case handling is introduced as a new paradigm for supporting flexible business processes. It is motivated by comparing it to workflow management as the traditional way to support business processes. The main entities of case handling systems are identified and classified in a meta model. Finally, the basic functionality and usage of a case handling system is illustrated by an example."

With the development of digital twin, building the physical-virtual data space for improving energy management capacity of enterprises has received tremendous attention. The energy behaviour model implementing accurate simulation and prediction of energy state is the core meta-model of energy-efficient manufacturing digital twin (EMDT). The widely used state-based energy modelling assumes constant power in operation state and approximately fits the energy behaviour without considering uncertain operation environment, resulting in energy behaviour distortion. A data-driven hybrid petri-net (DDHPN) inspired by both the state-based energy modelling and machine learning was developed for establishing the energy behaviour meta-model. Gaussian kernel extreme learning machine is proposed to fit the instantaneous firing speed of energy consumption continuous transitions in DDHPN. DDHPN-based energy behaviour model is driven by physical data under real-time working conditions, operating parameters, and production load for generating a virtual data space of energy management. Finally, DDHPN was integrated into the EMDT model using unified modelling language. The application in extrusion process and die casting process show that the presented model has higher accuracy in energy behaviour prediction. Furthermore, a digital-twin-based energy management prototype system for extrusion workshop demonstrates its potential."

Through the analysis of the system fault, this paper puts forward the abstract definition of fault, uses variation patterns to describe the fault behavior, and gives ST_Net Petri net system and meta model definition of fault, discuss the injection mechanism and influence of the properties of variation pattern."
pub.1174762799,"Metamodel and Formalization to Model, Transform, Deploy, and Execute Quantum Workflows","Quantum algorithms typically comprise classical pre- and post-processing tasks, making quantum applications inherently hybrid. To facilitate the integration and orchestration challenges arising when building hybrid applications, a quantum-specific workflow modeling extension was introduced. However, it lacks support for state-of-the-art techniques that have emerged in recent years, e.g., circuit cutting and warm-starting. As the usage of these complex techniques further complicates integrating quantum circuit executions with classical applications, we introduce new activity types and data objects to facilitate their integration. Moreover, we formalize the quantum workflow modeling extension by presenting a metamodel as well as transformation algorithms, ensuring its compatibility with existing workflow languages. Furthermore, we showcase the practical feasibility of our approach by presenting a system architecture, a prototypical implementation, and a case study."
pub.1011849983,A New Action Rule Syntax for DEmo MOdels Based Automatic worKflow procEss geneRation (DEMOBAKER),The current way of specifying Action Rules in the Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) is ambiguous and leads to incomplete specifications that do not contain enough ontological information so that we can more systematically convert DEMO models to comprehensive Business Process Management and Notation (BPMN). With our proposal we now can specify – still at an ontological level – much more needed details and essential information for a more complete and close to automatic generation of BPMN models. Action rules are also the perfect spot to already specify functional and implementation requirements for the information systems supporting the Workflow Management System running such BPMN models. Thus we also contribute to bridge the huge gap between DEMO models and important implementation issues that arise at design time and should immediately be specified together with ontological elements.
pub.1041173513,Analysis of business process integration in Web service context,"The integration of Web services is a recent outgrowth of the Business Process integration field that will require powerful meta-schema matching mechanisms supported by higher level abstractions, such as UML meta-models. Currently, there are many XML-based workflow process specification languages (e.g. XPDL, BPEL) which can be used to define business processes in the Web services and Grid Computing world. However, with limited capability to describe the relationships (schemas or ontologies) between process objects, the dominant use of XML as a meta-data markup language makes the semantics of the processes ambiguous. OWL-S (Ontology Web Language for Services) exploits the semantic description power of OWL to build an ontology language for services. It therefore becomes a candidate for an inter lingua. In this paper, we propose an integration framework for business processes, which is applied to Web services defined in OWL-S."
pub.1094385998,Using graph grammars and meta-modeling to process code mobility in LRN models,"Petri nets have been proposed initially to model concurrency and distributed systems. The ordinary formalism is so simple with a smart formal background, but it fails in modeling mobility aspects. In spite of this, searchers in mobility modeling domain are attracted by Petri nets, and many extensions have been proposed to treat mobility aspects. Among these, we find Labeled Reconfigurable Nets (LRN), This new formalism allows explicit modeling of computational environments and processes mobility between them. It allows, in a simple and an intuitive approach, modeling mobile code paradigms (mobile agent, code on demand, remote evaluation). In this paper, we propose an approach based on the combined use of Meta-modeling and Graph Grammars to automatically generate a visual modeling tool for LRN, for analysis and simulation purposes. This tool produces graphical models, highly-structured to reach this goal. In our approach, the UML Class diagram formalism is used to define a meta-model of LRN. The meta-modeling tool ATOM3 is used to generate a visual modeling tool according to the proposed LRN meta-model. To generate R-Maude specification of the graphically specified LRN models, we have proposed a graph grammar. Then the reconfigurable rewriting logic language R-Maude can be used to perform the simulation of the resulted R-Maude specification. Our approach is illustrated through examples."

pub.1062959886,An Integrated Design Method for SOA-Based Business Modeling and Software Modeling,"Service-oriented architecture (SOA)-based system development requires a systematic integration technique for software modeling and business modeling methods that approach the implementation component from the perspective of a business service. We proposes the integrated design method (architecture, metamodel, framework, process) for the integration of component software modeling in business process modeling notation (BPMN) business modeling to service-oriented modeling based on model-driven architecture (MDA) and model view controller (MVC) patterns according to SOA. The integrated architecture is composed of a metamodel and a process framework. The integrated metamodel is mapped to the core modeling elements of the SOA-based extended layered (XL)-BPMN/business process execution language (BPEL)/web service description language (WSDL)/component models, and the conversion profile is defined. For the establishment of the integrated process between business and software modeling, the framework is first defined; using this framework, we apply MDA (CIM: Conceptual Independent Modeling, PIM: Platform Independent Modeling, PSM: Platform Specific Modeling) and MVC patterns to define the integrated modeling process for the three development phases. The proposed modeling process was applied to the design of an online shopping mall system (OSMS). The design models were described on the basis of MDA/MVC according to the layered modeling elements defined in the individual/integrated metamodel and the three modeling phases of the integrated modeling process. The case study demonstrated that the conversion modeling task maintains the consistency and practicality between the SOA-based business and software modeling. The use of this method will make the consistent conversion modeling work between businesses and software convenient with a service orientation, will make it easy to change a business process, and will maximize the number of established reuse models."
pub.1010147165,Two Dependency Modeling Approaches for Business Process Adaptation,"Complex business processes in the form of workflows or service compositions are built from individual building blocks, namely activities or services. These building blocks cooperate to achieve the overall goal of the process. In many cases dependencies exist between the individual activities, i.e. the execution of one activity depends on another. Knowledge about dependencies is especially important for the management of the process at runtime in cases where problems occur and the process needs to be adapted. In this paper we present and compare two approaches for modeling dependencies as a base for managing adaptations of complex business processes. Based on two use cases from the domain of workflow management and service engineering we illustrate the need for capturing dependencies and derive the requirements for dependency modeling. For dependency modeling we discuss two alternative solutions. One is based on an OWL-DL ontology and the other is based on a meta-model approach. Although many of the requirements of the use cases are similar, we show that there is no single best solution for a dependency model."

To this end, the field of agile RE is emergent and different process models for agile RE have arisen. The aim of this paper is to build an abstract layer about the variety of existing process models by means of a metamodel for agile RE. It has been created in several iterations and relies on the evaluation of related process models. Furthermore, we have derived process models for agile RE in industry by presenting instances of the metamodel in two different cases: one is based on Scrum whereas the other is based on Kanban. This paper contributes to the software development body of knowledge by delivering a metamodel for agile RE that supports researchers and practitioners modeling and improving their own process models. We can conclude that the agile RE metamodel is highly relevant for the industry as well as for the research community, since we have derived it following empirical research in the field of ASD."
pub.1124373464,A Meta-model for context-aware adaptive Business Process as a Service in collaborative cloud environment," With the emergence of cloud computing, building and developing a new Software by SaaS composition becomes a major concern in today’s cloud business. First, the business analyst establishes the Business Process (BP) of the new SaaS. Then, the SaaS composer, based on functional and non-functional requirements, discovers and selects the potential SaaS components that can fill into each of the defined tasks in the BP. Currently, enterprises need more and more flexible SaaS business process as an adaptive composite SaaS from process vendors, which interest on context changes and needs evolutions. A meta-model is proposed in this paper dealing with different concepts involved in business cloud layer. This meta-model, in which both business process and service composition are considered, is accompanied by a case study. Then, an ontology has been developed and an extract of instances has been presented to demonstrate the adaptation process."

pub.1031068185,An intermediate metamodel with scenarios and resources for generating performance models from UML designs,"Performance analysis of a software specification in a language such as UML can assist a design team in evaluating performance-sensitive design decisions and in making design trade-offs that involve performance. Annotations to the design based on the UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance and Time provide necessary information such as workload parameters for a performance model, and many different kinds of performance techniques can be applied. The Core Scenario Model (CSM) described here provides a metamodel for an intermediate form which correlates multiple UML diagrams, extracts the behaviour elements with the performance annotations, attaches important resource information that is obtained from the UML, and supports the creation of many different kinds of performance models. Models can be made using queueing networks, layered queues, timed Petri nets, and it is proposed to develop the CSM as an intermediate language for all performance formalisms. This paper defines the CSM and describes how it resolves questions that arise in performance model-building."
pub.1152622408,A tool-assisted approach to engineer domain-specific languages (DSLs) using Rust,"Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are required in a wide range of contexts, implying different execution environments. The same DSL may even have to exist in different environments. We propose in this paper an approach to engineer a DSL using the Rust language, which can be used to target several environments. Our approach focuses on selecting an implementation language, Rust, that provides multiple compilation targets for a DSL definition. However, this is a rather laborious process because Rust is only partially object-oriented, while the definition of a metamodel-based abstract syntax is essentially object-oriented. For this reason, we offer a complete DSL's development method beginning with the metamodel definition in Ecore language, then the abstract syntax conversion in Rust with a code generation tool, and finally the deployment of the language in different execution environments. We evaluated our approach by creating two DSLs with it, a Petri nets DSL and a Finite State Machine (FSM) DSL. Finally, we discuss possible improvements for our Ecore2Rust conversion tool."

OSNs have become new opportunity that provides huge Masses of data about users', rich in their diversity and important in their quantity. Exploring the profiles data among these OSNs attract a great deal of attention among researchers in several research areas: social information retrieval systems, social recommendation systems. Social Recommender Systems aim to generate meaningful recommendations to a collection of users for items that might be interesting for them. In this paper we propose to investigate social recommender systems for improving Business process (BP) models reuse in process models repositories. The recommender system we propose to integrate we called SBPR recommender. SBPR recommender aims to recommend to the users of such repositories BP models for reuse. LinkedIn User profile is the source of social data for SBPR recommender; BP models are target items to be recommended to user. We propose a framework based on Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach where techniques of models, metamodels, transformation and weaving are used to implement a generic recommendation process."
pub.1018896110,An MDA‐based framework for collaborative business process modelling," Purpose This paper aims to present a new approach for developing a framework based on a model driven architecture (MDA) for the modelling of technology‐independent collaborative processes.   Design/methodology/approach The paper suggests a new collaborative process modelling approach based on an MDA and a metamodelling technique. The research method, based on the design science approach, was started by identifying the characteristics of the collaborative processes, which distinguish them from the classical intraorganizational ones. Then, the generic collaborative business process (CBP) modelling framework is developed based on MDA approach and definition of a set of transformation rules through three layers: business, process, and technical. After that, the core component of the framework was the proposition of a generic CBP metamodel at PIM/MDA level. The specific collaboration participant's business processes (expressed as BPMN model) are generated from the generic CBP model represented as an UML2 Profile activity diagram, which is compliant to CBP metamodel. Finally, as proof‐of‐concept, the architecture of an Eclipse‐based open development platform is developed implementing an e‐Procurement collaborative process.   Findings The proposed framework for CBP modelling and the generic CBP metamodel contribute towards a more efficient methodology and have consequences for BPM‐related collaboration, facilitating the B2B processes modelling and implementation. In order to demonstrate and evaluate the practical applicability of the framework, the architecture of an Eclipse‐based open development platform is developed implementing a collaborative business application on the basis of an e‐Procurement use case.   Research limitations/implications There is a need to focus future research efforts on the improvement of the semi‐automatic transformation phase from public to private processes which needs human intervention by adding a suitable interfaces at both sides of the B2B interaction. In addition, the problem of semantic heterogeneities regarding the partner's business process elements (business documents, activity/task names) should be tackled by developing an approach that uses ontology.   Practical implications Business processes developers find a B2B technology‐independent solution for implementing and using interorganizational information systems.   Originality/value The paper provides a framework that enables the CBP modelling and integrates a generic CBP metamodel. Currently, to the best of the authors' knowledge, such a generic metamodel and his instantiation have not so far been developed. "

pub.1167794283,SysML’ – incorporating component properties in early design phases of automated production systems,"Abstract Properties and environmental dependencies of mechatronic components like gear-drives and motors impact the overall performance of automated Production Systems. These properties, often in the form of characteristic curves, are only accessible from suppliers’ documents, like operating instructions or online catalogs. The proposed SysML’ profile integrates artifacts from SysML and UML into disciplinary views. It includes a reference mechanism to REXS (standard for gear properties) and ECLASS (standard for product data like UNSPSC) to overcome the semantic inconsistency of component properties and inclusion of curves. A metamodel is used for a more precise presentation of the proposed reference mechanism. Due to the static nature of a profile, a Business Process Modeling Notation is used to dynamically illustrate the benefits of SysML’ in the workflow."
pub.1016817912,Design for Reuse in Business Process: Method and Experiments,"<p>When modeling a business process or when updating an existing one, a business analyzer is available to reuse business parts already operational. Indeed, to minimize time of creation and to reduce cost and complexity, a solution can be given by the reuse of some existing business parts. The need to reuse of some business parts to fulfill companies’ requirements leads to the need of extracting business fragments from the business process model. The aim of this paper is to propose a method which enables to obtain a business fragments from a business process. The main idea is to decompose a business process into small fragments. These fragments have the ability to be reused for building a new business process or updating an existing one. The method the authors propose is presented as guidelines that allow the decomposition of business process to enable having a reusable business fragments, their method is based on variability in business process modeled in BPMN. The method also takes into account the business goal of each extracted fragment. The proposed method is presented as a process along with a meta-model to facilitate the understanding of the concepts related to BPMN. An algorithm that illustrates their method is also presented in order to use it for a further implementation. The paper also includes users’ experiments to validate our method.</p>"
pub.1008121894,Workflow-aware attention tracking to enhance collaboration management,"Current Workflow Management Systems only capture the start time and end time of tasks and it is difficult for managers to track how much time is actually spent on a particular task if multiple tasks are performed concurrently. Thus, managers may have problems accurately arranging tasks and evaluating costs. In order to facilitate collaboration management in multitasking environments, we propose a workflow-aware attention tracking framework that integrates the concept of attention with workflow models. We first design the meta-model of workflow-aware attention tracking. We further derive seven rules for attention tracking in multitasking collaboration using Object Constraint Language. Based on the rules and meta-model, we develop a procedure for attention rule verification, and present an architecture for workflow-aware attention tracking systems. This research contributes to workflow management by adding attention awareness for collaboration management in multitasking environments."

In the presented architecture, the business model consists of four types of sub-models: organization model, business process model, activity model and business document model. The relations among these sub-models were discussed and a roadmap from business model to platform specific model (PSM) was given. Then, an integrative, business-oriented meta-model for developing business-model driven MIS software was defined."

The approach is based on a process metamodel that extends the familiar input-process-output schema, and embodies the principle that the essential WHAT of a process is prior to any empirical and/or physical HOW. A structure of interrelated concepts can be derived from the metamodel. These can be used at logical level to define and analyze processes. They can also be implemented at a physical level—as an achievable and ideal integrated process architecture, or as a continuum of incremental control and integration improvements. Overall, the approach is to process what double entry is to accounting and the relational model is to data."

In cross-organizational business processes and heterogeneous organizations where multiple BPMLs are deployed there is a need for a unified view to ease communication and foster understandability. This paper proposes a language independent abstraction of seven mainstream BPMLs' concepts, in a unified meta-meta model based on an analysis of these modelling languages. Generic concepts are identified and a unified meta-model is developed. An ontological analysis of the representational capability of this meta-model is examined in relation to the Bunge-Wand-Weber ontology and applicability of the approach is demonstrated via an Example."

pub.1047113209,Towards a BPMN 2.0 Ontology,"The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard for business process modelling and maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG). However, the BPMN 2.0 specification is quite comprehensive and spans more than 500 pages. The definition of an element is distributed across different sections and sometimes conflicting. In addition, the structure of the elements and their relationships are described within the metamodel, however, further syntactical rules are defined within the natural text. Therefore, this paper defines an ontology that formally represents the BPMN specification. This ontology is called the BPMN 2.0 Ontology and can be used as a knowledge base. The description of an element is combined within the corresponding class and further explanations are provided in annotations. This allows a much faster understanding of BPMN. In addition, the ontology is used as a syntax checker to validate concrete BPMN models."
pub.1091587680,An Axiom Based Metamodel for Software Process Formalisation: An Ontology Approach,"Software development usually follows well known process models and standards for development processes. However, these are usually diverse and described in natural language which complicates their automation, adaptivity and verification. The need for process formalisation has long been highlighted, and we have provided a formalisation and translation algorithm to that effect in earlier work. However, to systematically and faithfully formalise heterogeneous processes from different standards and process models, there is a need to utilise uniform concepts to underpin the formalisation process. Metamodels and ontologies have been explored recently to lay a foundation for structuring and expressing additional rigour to process formalisation. In this study, we develop an axiom based metamodel utilising powertype patterns as a conceptual framework to underpin homogeneous process formalisation. The advantage of an axiomatic and powertype based metamodel approach lies in its potential to determine the metamodel basic constituents and formalism as well as its extensibility and adaptability. We formalise the metamodel using ontologies while adopting use cases from ISO/IEC 29110 and ISO/IEC 24744 standards for metamodel illustrations. Ontology based process descriptions enable process automated verification and adaptivity capability through the use of ontology reasoning support engines."
pub.1010555283,A Metamodel for Enabling a Service Oriented Architecture,"Process modelling initiatives generally develop their process models without much emphasis on data, burying their sequence of operations as a thread within a non-elementary process. More often than not, these buried operations are elementary atomic reusable components. The resulting models are generally not flexible or sufficiently reusable, suffering from update anomalies and redundancies. Addressing “service” as a major deliverable component, an ORM metamodel was developed in line with ISO 19763-5 Metamodel Framework for Interoperability: Metamodel for Process Model Registration, to harmonize atomic component processes using a control sequence and event models to enable the delivery of a totally flexible model set facilitating metamodel interoperability and cooperation between systems via their respective models. The paper provides a limited ORM based review of ISO 19763-5, and uses underlying component processes to develop a metamodel for a deliverable Services Oriented Architecture containing control sequence models, event models, and bridges to associated data models or web services."
pub.1137834591,A Method for Modeling Process Performance Indicators Variability Integrated to Customizable Processes Models,"Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are quantifiable metrics to evaluate the business process performance providing essential information for decision-making as regards to efficiency and effectiveness. Nowadays, customizable process models and PPIs are usually modeled separately, especially when dealing with PPIs variability. Likewise, modeling PPI variants with no explicit link with the related customizable process generates redundant models, making adjustment and maintenance difficult. The use of appropriate methods and tools is needed to enable the integration and support of PPIs variability in customizable process models. In this paper, we propose a method based on the Process Performance Indicator Calculation Tree (PPICT), which allows to model the PPIs variability linked to customizable processes modeled on the Business Process Feature Model (BPFM) approach. The Process Performance Indicator Calculation (PPIC) method supports PPIs variability modeling through five design stages, which concerns the PPICT design, the integration of PPICT-BMFM and the configuration of required PPIs aligned with process activities. The PPIC method is supported by a metamodel and a graphical notation. This method has been implemented in a prototype using the ADOxx platform. A partial user-centered evaluation of the PPICT use was carried out in a real utility distribution case to model PPIs variability linked to a customizable process model."
pub.1155266743,Enhancing Monte Carlo Workflows for Nuclear Reactor Analysis with Metamodel-Driven Modeling,"Monte Carlo codes are essential components of many reactor physics simulation workflows as high-fidelity continuous-energy neutron transport solvers. Among Monte Carlo radiation transport codes, MCNP is particularly notable due to its diverse simulation capabilities, large user base, and long validation history. Despite being a powerful simulation tool, MCNP provides limited capabilities to allow automated execution, model transformation, or support for user-defined logic and abstractions that limit its compatibility with modern workflows. To better integrate MCNP into a modern scientific workflow, we have developed an intuitive yet full-featured MCNP Application Program Interface (API) in Python, named MCNPy, which provides a specialized set of classes for MCNP input development. Moreover, to guarantee that our reading, writing, and modeling capabilities remain self-consistent (and to render the huge scope of the MCNP API manageable), we have adopted a strategy of model-driven software development in which a generalized model of the MCNP input format has been created. From this generalized model, or “metamodel,” problem-specific implementations such as an engine for input validation or a codebase for programmatic operations may be automatically generated. Since MCNPy primarily acts as a Python front-end to the underlying Java API that directly interfaces with the metamodel, it is intrinsically linked to the metamodel and thus remains maintainable. With MCNPy, users can programmatically read, write, and modify any syntactically valid MCNP input file regardless of its origin. These capabilities allow users to automate complicated tasks like design optimization and model translation for nuclear systems. As examples, this work demonstrates the use of MCNPy to find the critical radius of a plutonium sphere and to translate a 9000+ line MCNP input file into a corresponding OpenMC model."

pub.1009917031,Empirical Assessment of Business Model Transformations Based on Model Simulation,"Business processes are recognized by organizations as one of the most important intangible assets, since they let organizations improve their competitiveness. Business processes are supported by enterprise information systems, which can evolve over time and embed particular business rules that are not present anywhere else. Thus, there are many organizations with inaccurate business processes, which prevent the modernization of enterprise information systems in line with the business processes that they support. Therefore, business process mining techniques are often used to retrieve reliable business processes from the event logs recorded during the execution of enterprise systems. Unfortunately, such event logs are represented with purpose-specific notations such as Mining XML and still don’t apply the recent software modernization standard: ISO 19506 (KDM, Knowledge Discovery Metamodel). This paper presents an exogenous model transformation between these two notations. The main advantage is that process mining techniques can be effectively reused within software modernization projects according to the standard notation. This paper is particularly focused on the empirical evaluation of this transformation by simulating different kinds of business process models and several event logs with different sizes and configurations from such models. After analyzing all the model transformation executions, the study demonstrates that the transformation can provide suitable KDM models in a linear time in accordance with the size of the input models."
pub.1009349915,How far are we from the definition of a common software performance ontology?,"The recent approaches to software performance modeling and validation share the idea of annotating software models with information related to performance (e.g. operational profile) and transforming the annotated model into a performance model (e.g. a Stochastic Petri Net). Up to date, no standard has been defined to represent the information related to performance in software artifacts, although clear advantages in tool interoperability and model transformations would stem from it. This paper is aimed at questioning whether a software performance ontology (i.e. a standard set of concepts and relations) is achievable or not. We consider three meta-models defined for software performance, that are the Schedulability, Performance and Time profile of UML, the Core Scenario Model and the Software Performance Engineering meta-model. We devise two approaches to the creation of an ontology: (i) bottom-up, that extracts common knowledge from the meta-models, (ii) top-down, that is driven from a set of requirements."
pub.1014658033,Towards a Coordination-Centric Architecture Metamodel for Social Web Applications,"Social web applications like wikis, social networks, and crowdsourcing markets have provided people with new dynamic forms of communication and collaboration. Although communities have widely adopted these systems, the methodological support for their architecting is still at the beginning. Since social web applications are mediation environments for human interaction, environment-based coordination models like stigmergy have increased in relevance. Therefore, we propose the concept of a Stigmergic Information System (SIS) architecture metamodel, which embeds a stigmergy-like coordination model. The metamodel defines key system elements and organizes a system into four layers: agent, artifact data, analysis & control and workflow. The metamodel should support the systematic investigation of common architecture elements, their relations and interdependencies, and future approaches for the description and modeling of social web applications. In this work we introduce the SIS architecture metamodel and evaluate the metamodel’s validity with preliminary results from a pilot survey on groupware systems."

subject of a research paper, entitled Architecting Business Process Maps, for
which this report acts as a complement that details the underlying process map
conceptualisation."
pub.1018844394,Towards a Version-Based Approach to Deal with Business Process Evolution,"Competition in which enterprises and organizations are involved nowadays imposes them to often make evolve their business processes in order to meet, as quickly as possible while keeping effectiveness, new business or production requirements. This paper proposes to adopt a version-based approach to support these dynamic evolutions of business processes (BP). Adopting this approach permits to keep chronological BP changes since several instances of a same business process can own different schemas, each one representing a possible schema for the considered business process. Consequently, this approach is very suitable to deal with long-term business process evolution since it does not necessarily impose the adaptation and migration of running BP instances according to a new business process schema. The paper contribution is first a meta-model for designing versions of business processes considering the three dimensions of BP which are the informational, organizational and process dimensions. The paper also introduces a taxonomy of operations for business process version management."
pub.1034626080,Multilevel Object Core,"The multilevel object (m-object) is a versatile construct for modeling multilevel abstraction hierarchies with applications in domain modeling [77], ontology engineering [79], data warehousing [80, 116, 112], business model intelligence [113], and business process modeling [111, 114]. The employment of m-objects in the design process allows for the representation of heterogeneities while preserving advantages of homogeneous models, yielding hetero-homogeneous models. In this chapter we summarize the heterohomogeneous modeling approach and present a core metamodel for m-objects which generalizes the specializations for different application domains. We formally define the metamodel using UML; we employ OCL for the definition of consistency criteria and derivations. Although based on the foundational work on m-objects [76] we present an independent, generalized formalization which itself contributes towards a holistic understanding of m-objects."
pub.1000764076,Evolution of Service Processes by Rule Based Transformation,"The notion of service is closely coupled with the notion of process in general and of workflow in particular. Processes capture the coordination logic for the various resources involved in the realisation of the service content. Moreover, processes drive the actual delivery of a service. Internal processes underpin the capabilities of a service provider. Delivery processes underpin contractual agreements between service providers and consumers. In both cases, the ability to adapt service processes in response to changing environmental conditions is fundamental. Change must be rapid but at the same time accurate and consistent. In this paper, we present the framework for automated process transformation developed within the context of the FRESCO (Foundational Research on Service Composition) initiative. The conceptual part of the framework builds on the standard workflow meta-model proposed by the WfMC (Workflow Management Coalition). The change logic is expressed by transformation rules that can be automatically applied to the processes underpinning a service. The technical part of the framework specifically targets Web service platforms and BPEL (Business Process Execution Language)."
pub.1009455055,A metamodel to integrate business processes time perspective in BPMN 2.0,"ContextBusiness Process Management (BPM) is becoming a strategic advantage for organizations to streamline their operations. Most business experts are betting for OMG Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) as de-facto standard (ISO/IEC 19510:2013) and selected technology to model processes. The temporal dimension underlies in any kind of process however, technicians need to shape this perspective that must also coexist with task control flow aspects, as well as resource and case perspectives. BPMN poorly gathers temporary rules. This is why there are contributions that extend the standard to cover such dimension. BPMN is mainly an imperative language. There are research contributions showing time constraints in BPMN, such as (i) BPMN patterns to express each rule with a combination of artifacts, thus these approaches increase the use of imperative BPMN style, and (ii) new decorators to capture time rules semantics giving clearer and simpler comprehensible specifications. Nevertheless, these extensions cannot yet be found in the present standard.ObjectiveTo define a time rule taxonomy easily found in most business processes and look for an approach that applies each rule with current BPMN 2.0 standard in a declarative way.MethodA model-driven approach is used to propose a BPMN metamodel extension to address time-perspective.ResultsWe look at a declarative approach where new time specifications may overlie the main control flow of a BPMN process. This proposal is totally supported with current BPMN standard, giving a BPMN metamodel extension with OCL constraints. We also use AQUA-WS as a software project case study which is planned and managed with MS Project. We illustrate business process extraction from project plans.ConclusionThis paper suggests to handle business temporal rules with current BPMN standard, along with other business perspectives like resources and cases. This approach can be applied to reverse engineering processes from legacy databases."
pub.1107831695,Facet-oriented modelling: open objects for model-driven engineering,"Model-driven engineering (MDE) promotes models as the principal assets in software projects. Models are built using a modelling language whose syntax is defined by a metamodel. Hence, objects in models are typed by a metamodel class, and this typing relation is static as it is established at creation time and cannot be changed later. This way, objects in MDE are closed and fixed with respect to the type they conform to, the slots/properties they have, and the constraints they should obey. This hampers the reuse of model-related artefacts like model transformations, as well as the opportunistic or dynamic combination of metamodels. To alleviate this rigidity, we propose making model objects open so that they can acquire or drop so-called facets, each one contributing a type, slots and constraints to the object. Facets are defined by regular metamodels, hence being a lightweight extension of standard metamodelling. Facet metamodels may declare usage interfaces, and it is possible to specify laws that govern how facets are to be assigned to the instances of a metamodel. In this paper, we describe our proposal, report on an implementation, and illustrate scenarios where facets have advantages over other techniques."

Despite the advantages in the adoption of ITIL’s best practices, some problems have been identified: different interpretations due to the complexity of concepts with poor specification and formalization; different approaches to the same problems; difficulties exchanging process models in different process model languages. Besides all published work, is still missing a metamodel expressing the core concepts, their relationship, and constraints. In this paper, we propose an ITIL metamodel to reduce conceptual and terminological ambiguity, addressing the identified problems, namely: (1) describing the core concepts of ITIL to be used by other approaches; (2) allowing the integration, exchange, sharing and reutilization of models; and (3) the use of different modelling languages following the defined principles."

pub.1093599280,Considering Quality Factors for Business Processes During Requirement Engineering,"Business process (BP) modelling is considered as an important part of Requirement Engineering in describing the context within which requirements are articulated, specified and analysed. The intertwining of business and information systems imposes considerable stresses on requirements engineers to consider quality factors that need to be present in both business processes and the software that supports these processes. We argue that the quality of BPs has to be taken into account at the requirement engineering stage, where quality requirements are to be defined, along with the corresponding quality factors and the metrics that will be used to evaluate them. We consider that a BP is represented by a model and that quality requirements are to be examined within the BP model. In this work, our goal is to provide a support for evaluating the quality of a BP through the corresponding model. We present a quality framework for BPs and a quality-oriented BP metamodel. This metamodel is enriched with quality-related attributes that will be used to evaluate the quality factors. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed quality framework we will use a BP model relating to the management of spectators at an Olympics venue, we will show the instantiation of our meta model in this context along with evaluation results for some quality factors."
pub.1123796206,Dynamic Metamodel Approach for Government Enterprise Architecture Model Management," Enterprise Architecture (EA) is widely adopted by many organisations to align their business and IT together to ensure the resources optimization is achieved. This recent EA development not only brings positive impacts to the business organisation but the government organisation as well. Nevertheless, during the implementation of EA, one of the challenges is to create a standardised and dynamic metamodel that able to integrate the government agencies business models. To date, it is still yet to find any dynamic metamodel that designed for this purpose. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an EA dynamic metamodel design based on complex cognitive activities (CCA) concept. This study starts with an investigation of EA metamodel concept and current practice through literature review and preliminary interviews, followed by the design on EA dynamic metamodel for government agencies with a selection of Malaysian education EA Reference as a pilot case study. As a result, a Dynamic EA Metamodel by using CCA concept is proposed by utilizing the four layers of dynamic design using cognitive action (physical, perceptual, functional, conceptual) and Archimate generic metamodel schema. This is a new contribution to EA Body of Knowledge (EABoK) and EA practice as it helps for better management of EA models especially for a large and complex organisation of the government sector. This model will allow the EA team in multiple organisations to design and develop their EA models according to their own business process but yet still following the EA metamodel set by the top EA office."

The focus is on training of manufacturing system design skills both as HEI education and vocational training, but preliminary design of new manufacturing systems is also supported (e.g in the development of small business process scenarios).  We proposed a model-based methodology for solving of the manufacturing system design problems The methodology and the supporting tool are centred around a less abstract Domain-Specific Modelling Language (DSML). The language is easy to learn due to its few components. A modelling and simulation environment named Digital Production Planner Tool (DPPT) was generated from the metamodel of the DSML. The degree of abstraction used by this tool corresponds well to the intended use in training and preliminary design. Our method incorporates by design the possibility to impose constraints at the modelling language level to limit the modelling space to feasible/possible solutions. The resulting tool enforces these constraints in the use and supports the development of feasible designs even by inexperienced designers. The access to the conceptual model allows the translation of the model to other modelling language like Petri net. This extends the support for the design methodology. The whitepaper presents a use case for the developed method and tool: the design of a chocolate manufacturing line."

The main goal of this paper is to provide a proper mechanism for defining agent-based development process models. For achieving this goal, an open-source editor tool and a technique for defining process models with the mentioned tool are presented. Both the editor tool and the technique provide MAS designers with a suitable mechanism for defining process models and are based on the Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM). Although the main goal is to define process models for agent-based development, the proposed tool and technique can define any software process model, because they are based on a general-purpose software process metamodel.

With this representation the system is not only able to do intelligent failure handling, but can also support the workflow modelling and execution processes."
pub.1121896398,Application of formal methods to modelling and analysis aspects of business process reengineering,"
                    Purpose
                    Business process (BP) reengineering is defined as reinventing BPs either structurally or technically to achieve dramatic improvements in performance. In any business process reengineering (BPR) project, process modeling is used to reason about problems found in existing (as-is) process and helps to design target (to-be) process. BP model notation is a widely accepted standard for process modeling. “Expressiveness” and “missing formal semantics” are two problems reported to its modeling practices. In existing studies, solutions to these problems are also proposed but still have certain limitations. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    In proposed methodology, a meta-model is formally defined that is composed of commonly used modeling elements and their well-formedness rules to check for syntactic and structural correctness of process models. Proposed solution also check semantics of process models and allows to compare as-is and to-be process models for gap identification which is another important aspect of BPR. To achieve the first goal, Z specification is used to provide formal specifications of modeling constructs and their rules and Z3 (an SMT solver) is used for comparisons and verifying properties.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Proposed method addresses both “expressiveness” and “missing formal semantics” of BPR models. The results of its evaluation clearly indicate that using formally specified meta-model, BPR model is syntactically and structurally correct. Moreover, formal modeling of BPs in Z3 helped to compare processes and to check control flow properties.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    Although the proposed method is tested on an example that is widely used in BPR literature, the example is only covering modeling elements which are part of the proposed subset and are reported in literature as frequently used modeling elements. A separate detailed study is required to test it on more complex systems.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    Specifying process models using Z specification and Z3 solver requires certain expertise.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    The proposed method adds value to BPR body of knowledge as it proposes a method to ensure structural and syntactic correctness of models, highlighting the importance of verifying run time properties and providing a direction toward comparing process models for gap analysis.

pub.1181771126,A computer-based simulation methodology of the predetermined maintenance scheme of an irradiation facility,"This study presents a computational framework for maintenance modelling aimed at addressing the complexities of the test cell (TC) within the IFMIF DONES, a complex industrial facility in the realm of fusion materials irradiation and testing. The proposed framework, which provides an insight into the maintenance process, is based on high-level Petri nets and captures maintenance tasks, duration, delays, and interactions among components. The proposed method employs global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to gain a better understanding of the influence of the numerous parameters on the system’s performance. Three maintenance scenarios are explored, taking into account factors such as workforce assumptions, shift expenses, delays, and task completion timings. Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the probabilistic behaviour of the considered maintenance scenarios to allow for a thorough examination of the impact of uncertainties on maintenance operations. Examination of shift data yields insights into optimizing maintenance strategies minimizing downtime, and enhancing cost effectiveness. The results underscore the significance of implementing a night shift to improve facility availability. Furthermore, the proposed maintenance model is compared against a regression metamodel, which is validated by comparing Sobol indices derived from the Petri net. The novelty of this research is shown through combining shift data analysis, global sensitivity analysis, and innovative hybrid modelling aimed at enhancing maintenance planning within an irradiation facility."
pub.1131143598,A DSL for collaborative Business Process,"Business process modeling is now an essential point in building businesses; there is a wide choice of modeling language in the market, the most popular of which are UML and BPMN. However, when it comes to modeling a specific area, these languages remain restricted. A DSL, meanwhile, allows a concise representation of the semantics of a particular business field, which allows the development of coherent and expressive business process models. Thus, these models can be use not only for modeling a system but also for generating executable applications. Collaborative business processes are increasingly present in practice. Their modeling, integration or execution becomes more and more complex because it involves an exchange of resources and data between several partners. Current modeling languages such as BPMN do not allow detailed modeling of these environments. Thus, in this paper, we propose a DSL to model business processes in a collaborative environment. The creation of the latter goes through these stages: a) defining the abstract syntax of our language, which consists in the creation of our own metamodel. b) Define a semantics, which allow presenting the functioning of each element of our language. c) Finally, define a graphical language syntax that allows a clear visualization for modeling."

Due to proprietary data exchange formats and individual business processes, data harmonization and business process compliance are shortcoming. In this paper a meta-model to formulate requirements of service procurement collaborations with a combined view on information and control flow is presented. Our focus is on two constituent elements of the model: collaborative business processes and service objects. Both elements define features which are characteristic for investigated value constellations. Challenge at hand is to implement standardized interfaces easing seamless exchange of information between business partners. Existing procurement systems need enhanced process-awareness and compliance with service-dominant-logic. The meta-model also serves as reference framework which identifies and correlates typical entities of service procurement collaborations. Furthermore a domain specific meta-model extension for industrial service procurement is derived. This extension serves as basis for data harmonization of service procurement data and enacts compliance of business processes in industrial service procurement collaborations."

While used for many years in different shapes and forms, there is little shared understanding of the concept and its relationship to business process architecture. In this paper, we position the concept of process map within the domain of architecture description. By ?architecting? the concept of business process map, we identify and clarify diverging views of this concept as found in the literature and set requirements for describing process maps. A meta-model for a process mapping language is produced as a result. The proposed meta-model allows investigating the suitability of EA modelling languages as a basis for defining a domain-specific language for process mapping along with the creation of a better understanding of business process architecture in relation to enterprise architecture, which can be beneficial for both BPM and EA professionals.

pub.1093542096,Situation-Driven Processes for Semantic Web Services,"Process models to support user objectives are used across several domains, such as eLearning or Business Process Management. Usually, specific metadata schemas, such as the XML bindings of the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) or IMS Learning Design (IMS LD), are used to enable interoperability. Since Web services which are used throughout a process at runtime, are allocated statically within the process model at design-time, their dynamic adaptability to distinct situationsis highly restricted. Whereas the aforementioned process models define a process from a user perspective, Semantic Web Services (SWS) technologies, such as WSMO or OWL-S, define processes from a system perspective by enabling the semantic description of services and data to support their automatic discovery and invocation to achieve specific user tasks at runtime. However, until now, a common link is missingto bridge between a process' user perspective and its system perspective. In this paper wepropose a metamodel for Situation-Driven Processes (SDP) which enables the description of a processin terms of specific process situations which each is linked to a specific user Goal (user perspective) as well as a set of Brokered Goals (system perspective). Since Brokered Goals are gradually derived from SWS Goals, a process is accomplished dynamically at runtime in terms of SWS Goal achievements. As a result, following an approach of situation-driven process generation at runtime, we support the dynamic composition of a process appropriate for a given situation and its automatic transformation into distinct process metadata standards."

An IoRT is defined as the incorporation of IoT technology within robotic systems. In this setting, the business managers may improve performance and increase the productivity of their process by integrating the IoRT within their Business Processes (BPs). Nonetheless, this integration is not a trivial task due to the diversity of the IoT, robot, and BP concepts. In this paper, we address the incorporation of the IoRT within the BP through a lightweight extension of the Business Process Modeling Language 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) meta-model called IoRT-aware Business Process meta-model (IoRT-aware BP2M). Our proposed IoRT-aware BP2M allows, on the one hand, to represent the main concepts of IoT, robot and BP in a unique meta-model, and on the other hand to specify some practical constraints to select the suitable device. As a proof of concept, we generated an IoRT-aware BP model in the agriculture field with some implementation details. Besides, we used the Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) ontology to prove the proposed meta-model’s completeness and clarity. The obtained results show that the proposed meta-model has an acceptable completeness value and ontological expressiveness."

pub.1001167287,Metafore: The Afforest Deposition-Soil-Water-Vegetation Metamodel,"This chapter describes the development of the METAFORE metamodel for the AFFOREST project, focusing on aspects that are important in defining the role of the metamodel in the entire system. Two modes are distinguished: one in which the METAFORE metamodel operates in a batch mode for generating the AFFOREST-sDSS tables for decision support, and another mode of operating with an extended user interface and extended possibilities for evaluating detailed results. The various detailed process-based models are from different sources and each of the institutes had experts on the processes that were modelled. From these models, the individual partners developed meta-descriptions of their parts of the system. The task of the METAFORE metamodel was to combine all this knowledge into a single model executable, and assure a correct calculation of the values needed for the AFFOREST database and the AFFOREST-sDSS. The design of the METAFORE distinguishes a metamodel framework and the model components or submodels. The metamodel framework focuses on the interface and communication between the different submodels and it is responsible for the communication between the submodels. In this design, the submodels are merely servers, waiting to be initialized or called to perform one step of the simulation (i.e. one month or one year of the simulation). To do this, each submodel has only a limited set of exposed methods. Although the detailed process models, as part of their scientific development process, have been extensively validated and calibrated, this does not automatically assure a proper simulation of the processes by the metamodel. During the entire process of the development of METAFORE, the simulation behaviour of the METAFORE modules were constantly tested against the detailed process models. In the end, METAFORE has been developed as a simplification of the detailed models with a lesser demand on data. This means that the detailed behaviour in the process models can at best result in similar but aggregated behaviour in the METAFORE metamodel. It is concluded that the results are satisfactory."

There are many issues such as numerous sensors, sophisticated processing algorithms, and lacking of a unified process management about the operation control of the remote sensing data processing system. Therefore, the concept and characteristics of remote sensing big data workflows is reanalysed and the metamodel of remote sensing big data workflows from different aspects is constructed in order to establish a conceptual framework of them, and thus establish concept framework of Remote Sensing Big Data Workflow."
pub.1117740843,Enhancing the Correctness of BPMN Models,"While some of the OMG's metamodels include a formal specification of well-formedness rules, using OCL, the BPMN metamodel specification only includes those rules in natural language. Although several BPMN tools claim to support, at least partly, the OMG's BPMN specification, we found that the mainstream of BPMN tools do not enforce most of the prescribed BPMN rules. Furthermore, the verification of BPMN process models publicly available showed that a relevant percentage of those BPMN process models fail in complying with the well-formedness rules of the BPMN specification. The enforcement of process model's correctness is relevant for the sake of better quality of process modeling and to attain models amenable of being enacted. In this chapter we propose supplement the BPMN metamodel with well-formedness rules expressed as OCL invariants in order to enforce BPMN models' correctness."
pub.1104334755,Meta-model for collaboration modeling in legal sector,"Cost effective and best practice legal services are highly relying on the coordination of collaborativeworkflow activities as well as of several resources needed to perform these activities and their flow ofinformation exchanges among many different participants. In the context of ever increasing numbers of legal cases and involved stakeholders in multi-party collaborations, we have discovered the appropriateness of the adaptation of workflow management systems in legal sector to address the resulting complexities and performance issues in legal service collaborations. In this work, a meta-model for legal service collaboration modeling which includes the main semantics of modeling elements, has been introduced as the basis for defining the choreography for sector collaboration with the objective of facilitating legal collaboration modeling in such a way as to provide a useful input for the creation of legal workflow specifications for setting up legal workflow management systems. The meta-model was developed based on Business Transaction View meta-model in UN/CEFACT’s recommendations for business collaborations. The proposed modeling framework could facilitate and guide the complex legal collaboration modeling processes with promising results in workflow coordination."
pub.1015499596,Reusing metamodels and notation with Diagram Definition,"It is increasingly common for language specifications to describe visual forms (concrete syntax) separately from underlying concepts (abstract syntax). This is typically to enable interchange of visual information between graphical modeling tools, such as positions of nodes and routings of lines. Often overlooked is that separation of visual forms and abstract concepts enables languages to define multiple visual forms for the same underlying concepts and for the same visual form to be used for similar underlying concepts in different languages (many-to-many relationships between concrete and abstract syntax). Visual forms can be adapted to communities using different notations for the same concepts and can be used to integrate communities using the same notation for similar concepts. Models of concrete syntax have been available for some time, but are rarely used to capture these many-to-many relationships with abstract syntax. This paper shows how to model these relationships using concrete graphical syntax expressed in the Diagram Definition standard, examining cases drawn from the Unified Modeling Language and the Business Process Model and Notation. This gives definers of graphical languages a way to specify visual forms for multiple communities."
pub.1041709912,Reusable model transformations,"Model transformations written for an input metamodel may often apply to other metamodels that share similar concepts. For example, a transformation written to refactor Java models can be applicable to refactoring UML class diagrams as both languages share concepts such as classes, methods, attributes, and inheritance. Deriving motivation from this example, we present an approach to make model transformations reusable such that they function correctly across several similar metamodels. Our approach relies on these principal steps: (1) We analyze a transformation to obtain an effective subset of used concepts. We prune the input metamodel of the transformation to obtain an effective input metamodel containing the effective subset. The effective input metamodel represents the true input domain of transformation. (2) We adapt a target input metamodel by weaving it with aspects such as properties derived from the effective input metamodel. This adaptation makes the target metamodel a subtype of the effective input metamodel. The subtype property ensures that the transformation can process models conforming to the target input metamodel without any change in the transformation itself. We validate our approach by adapting well known refactoring transformations (Encapsulate Field, Move Method, and Pull Up Method) written for an in-house domain-specific modeling language (DSML) to three different industry standard metamodels (Java, MOF, and UML)."
pub.1049708218,A Fact-Based Meta Model for Standardization Documents,"Recently, the OMG has been working on developing a new standard for a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). This standard development has resulted in documents that contain the latest approved version of a standard or a standard proposal that can be ammended. Such a standard document also serves as a specification for BPMN modeling tool. In this paper we show how a fact-based approach can improve the completeness and maintenance of such a specification."
pub.1039888157,An Ontological Approach for Semantic Annotation of Supply Chain Process Models,"A Supply Chain Process involves various departments and organizations. However, terminology for supply chain process models doesn’t have formalized representations. Moreover, formal definitions of dynamic semantic of process models are commonly absent. Such problems discourage the integration of various process models from different partners. Thereafter, technologies of semantic annotation for business process models are developed to solve these problems. In this paper an ontological approach is proposed to annotate supply chain process models with semantic meanings. The ontology for supply chain process model, so-called scorBPMN ontology, is introduced for such semantic annotation, which specifies semantics of supply chain process models at both meta-model level and mode level. Then the similarity-based matching functionality is developed to link process model elements with concepts in the ontology. The proposed approach presents an ontological description of semantics of supply chain processes and similarity-based annotation of process models, so that various supply chain process models can be standardized and explained with unified semantic annotations, which is the basis for process integration, implementation and analysis."
pub.1094705560,Formalizing the Management Automation with Workflow of Software Development Process based on the SPEM Activities view,"Workflow technologies automate, totally or partially, the business processes. Such technologies use standard languages, like BPMN, to model business processes, BPMN. On the other hand, from the software engineering, OMG has defined a Metamodel for the Software Process Engineering (SPEM). This metamodel is used for describing a concrete software development process. The objective of this research work is to formalize the transformation of SPEM activities view into BPMN subprocesses view. In order to achieve such transformation, a language of formal specification RSL is used. This work is composed by three phases: an RSL formal specification of the SPEM view, an RSL formal specification of the BPMN view and an RSL formal specification of the relation between the concepts of both views. This way, any software development process described with SPEM can be converted into an input of a workflow engine. It would lead to obtain the automation of the management of the software development process."
pub.1084731217,Towards a meta-modeling approach for social business process requirements capture,"A Social Business Process (SBP) is the result of blending social computing (a.k.a. Web 2.0) with business process (BP). Despite the benefits of SBP to enterprises, several limitations continue to undermine them. In this paper, we address two specific limitations, namely the difficulty of capturing SBP's requirements and the lack of a definition for SBP. Thus, meta-modeling is used to capture requirements from organizational, technological, and management perspectives. In addition, we introduce a definition for SBP by enriching an existing BP meta-model with social concepts. To annotate the SBP model with its requirements, a BPMN extension is proposed. The proposed meta-models are evaluated in terms of completeness and clarity using the Bunge-Wand-Weber ontology."
pub.1106079610,CBG-Framework: A bottom-up model-based approach for Collaborative Business Process Management," Nowadays most existing products and services are the result of the collaboration of a large number of companies that form a value chain known as Supply Chain (SC). Then individual Business Process Management (BPM) requires a holistic vision that incorporates an inter organizational view that supports SC decision making. This study proposes a novel idea trying to address collaborative BP modelling problem with a new perspective, a bottom-up approach, reusing process models that each organization may have created with a different modelling language. Collaborative Business Generation (CBG) Framework, following Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm, includes a meta model, a method, a set of model transformations and a support tool to create collaborative BP models from individual ones, maintaining privacy and autonomy in decision making. This paper presents main CBG-Framework elements as well as a real world case study for early validation."

We review several types of AM process models and use the direct metal powder bed fusion AM process to provide illustrative examples of the proposed classification and metamodel approach. We describe how a coordinated approach can be used to extend modeling capabilities by promoting model composability. As part of future work, a framework is envisioned to realize a more coherent strategy for model development and deployment."
pub.1000520783,A service pattern model for service composition with flexible functionality,"A key feature with service-oriented-architecture is to allow flexible composition of services into a business process. Although previous works related to service composition have paved the way for automatic composition, the techniques have limited applicability when it comes to composing complex workflows based on functional requirements, partly due to the large search space of the available services. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, the prospect service. Unlike existing abstract services which possess fixed service interfaces, a prospect service has a flexible interface to allow functional flexibility. Furthermore, we define a meta-model to specify service patterns with prospect services and adaptable workflow constructs to model flexible and adaptable process templates. An automated instantiation method is introduced to instantiate concrete processes with different functionalities from a service pattern. Since the search space for automatically instantiating a process from a service pattern is greatly reduced compared to that for automatically composing a process from scratch, the proposed approach significantly improve the feasibility of automated composition. Empirical study of the service pattern shows that the use of the proposed model significantly outperforms manual composition in terms of composition time and accuracy, and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed automated instantiation method is efficient."
pub.1093184567,Requirements-based development of BPMN extensions: The case of clinical pathways,"In recent years, the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has evolved to one of the most applied modelling General Purpose Languages in the Business Process Management discipline. Due to its application in different domains, it becomes frequently necessary to extend the BPMN by domain-specific concepts. Extending the BPMN fosters an adequate communication between system engineers and domain experts and enhances the semantically correct representation of the domain. Therefore, the BPMN meta-model provides an extension mechanism. However, there is a remarkable lack in procedure models for the design of such extensions. This research article outlines an extension method that focuses on domain analysis, extension requirements and the derivation of domain-specific extension concepts within BPMN. Therefore, the method of STROPPI ET AL. (2011) is extended in regard to domain analysis. The approach is motivated and demonstrated by the case of Clinical Pathways (CPs)."
pub.1013026178,Adding Preciseness to BPMN Models,"BPMN is becoming the de facto standard for process description, analysis and simulation, in IT and many other business domains. BPMN supports different levels of abstraction, from high-level process models, to detailed models capable of being executed. Several tools now support, at least partly, OMG's BPMN metamodel specification. However, while several other OMG's metamodels include a formal specification of well-formedness rules, using OCL, the BPMN metamodel specification only includes those rules in natural language, scattered across several hundred pages of that document. Not surprisingly, we found that all mainstream BPMN tools do not enforce those well-formedness rules, while checking the correctness of process models. Model preciseness enforcement is important to mitigate ambiguity. The latter hampers the achievement of a shared meaning among process stakeholders, is detrimental to process reuse and is unacceptable if we look for executable processes. To enforce model preciseness we propose to supplement the OMG BPMN metamodel with well-formedness rules expressed as OCL invariants."
pub.1093420704,Supporting Organisational Evolution by Means of Model-Driven Reengineering Frameworks,"Enterprise systems need to evolve to be adapted with changes in their context. Model-driven reengineering frameworks have been developed in order to support post-delivery life cycle activities and software system maintenance (for instance, architecture-driven modernisation is an object management group initiative). However, existing proposals are general purpose and full support for an organisational reengineering framework is still needed. This paper presents a research effort aiming at designing and developing guidelines and tools for supporting model-driven organisational improvement. We propose to support model evolution by means of two artefacts: a pattern definition metamodel and an evolution metamodel. As a proof of concept, this paper applies the proposal to support business process evolution. We illustrate an instance of these metamodels by means of a laboratory-demo. We also discuss benefits and limitations of our proposal."
pub.1051548295,A collaborative design framework for the Korean automotive parts industry,"In the automotive industry, although small enterprises that supply car parts participate in the design phase of new car development, they do not communicate with each other for developing parts or modules because of the lack of a common communication protocol. In order to provide solutions to such problems, there has been an emergence of collaboration solutions among participants. Moreover, collaborative product lifecycle management (CPLM) is suggested as an alternative for providing such collaboration solutions. In order to develop CPLM, a framework that supports the understanding and sharing of business processes across business boundaries is necessary. Such a framework includes a reference model, business process model, and business process. The reference model explains the business domain, and it must be shared among participants for a common communication purpose. The business process model describes the collaborative design process, which can be defined by common principles in a meta-model. This paper suggests a new reference model for the design chain in the Korean automotive parts industry. Under a collaborative environment, the design process of the reference model may be classified into the mechanical and human-driven processes. In order to define both process types, a new integrated process model that combines the Component Collaboration Architecture (CCA) model of Enterprise Distributed Object Computing (EDOC) and Role Activity Diagram (RAD) models is suggested. We also introduce model driven approach (MDA) of Object Modelling Group (OMG) in order to describe an abstract level for common communication among business partners."
pub.1027452223,A complete approach for CIM modelling and model formalising,"ContextComputation Independent Model (CIM) as a business model describes the requirements and environment of a business system and instructs the designing and development; it is a key to influencing software success. Although many studies currently focus on model driven development (MDD); those researches, to a large extent, study the PIM-level and PSM-level model, and few have dealt with CIM-level modelling for case in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete.ObjectiveThis paper proposes a CIM-level modelling approach, which applies a stepwise refinement approach to modelling the CIM-level model starting from a high-level goal model to a lower-level business process model. A key advantage of our approach is the combination of the requirement model with the business model, which helps software engineers to define business models exactly for cases in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete.MethodThis paper, based on the model driven approach, proposes a set of models at the CIM-level and model transformations to connect these models. Accordingly, the formalisation approach of this paper involves formalising the goal model using the category theory and the scenario model and business process model using Petri nets.ResultsWe have defined a set of metamodels and transformation rules making it possible to obtain automatically a scenario model from the goal model and a business process model from the scenario model. At the same time, we have defined a mapping rule to formalise these models. Our proposed CIM modelling approach and formalisation approach are implemented with an MDA tool, and it has been empirically validated by a travel agency case study.ConclusionThis study shows how a CIM modelling approach helps to build a complete and consistent model at the CIM level for cases in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete in advance."
pub.1175217312,Microservices-Aware Business Process Modelling,"Microservices Architecture (MSA) is the de facto software architecture approach for highly scalable software systems. Organisations must design their structure and processes around business outcomes to reap MSA’s benefits. Also, MSA requires the domain model for each microservice to be minimal and avoid coupling with other microservices’ domain entities. However, such coupling might already occur during the design of the business process and then propagate along the development life cycle. The first opportunity to prevent coupling occurs while designing collaborations between different participants (organisational units, such as development teams) since assigning business responsibilities defines how much domain knowledge each participant must handle. This paper proposes a method to design business process models so the domain managed by each process participant matches the size and complexity required for MSA domain design, enabling the seamless use of MSA. We reviewed nine code repositories to characterise the size and complexity of MSA domain models and proposed a metamodel conceptualising the optimal microservice domain model. Then, taking as input BPMN’s Choreography diagrams describing interactions among participants, we propose (i) to specify the structure of the messages interchanged by the choreography participants, (ii) a set of process modelling guidelines to avoid domain coupling by preventing coarse interactions and heavy domain-savvy process participants, and (iii) a set of transformation guidelines to systematically derive the MSA domain model from the message structures. This contribution aims to help business process designers envision the domain complexity each process participant handles and prevent coupling business domains during process design. We provide a detailed example showing the approach’s feasibility and discuss the proposal’s implications, benefits and limitations."

The main idea of this workshop has been to bring together various unifying approaches from the areas of graph transformations, visual modeling techniques and Petri nets due to the increasing amount of divergent formalisms in each of these areas.According to this main idea, this volume presents uniform approaches and further introduces unifying and comparative studies between these fields and related areas.The first part contains contributions from the area of graph transformation with new aspects of GRACE by Kreowski et al. and high-level replacement systems by Parisi-Presicce as unifying approaches to graph transformations and related specification techniques. The main ideas concerning the common exchange formats for graphs and graph transformations discussed within the APPLIGRAPH project and a dynamic meta model for graph transformation approaches are presented in the papers by Taentzer and Heckel, Zündorf respectively. Related work can be found in the handbooks of graph grammars and computing by graph transformation as well as in the proceedings of GRATRA 2000, a satellite of ETAPS 2000.In the second part concerning visual modeling techniques, new aspects of the visual language environments GenGEd and DIAGEN are discussed by Ermel et.al. as well as Minas and Hoffmann respectively. Formal concepts improving different aspects of the UML are studied in three contributions by Groβe-Rhode, Schürr as well as Baresi and Pezze respectively. Related work has been presented at GT-VMT'00, a satellite of ICALP'00 in Geneve and will be presented at GT-VMT'01 as a satellite of ICALP'01 at Heraklion.In the third part, three unifying approaches for Petri nets are proposed by Dehnert et al., Meseguer et al. and by Juhás et al. The first contribution presents the second installment of the “Petri Net Baukasten” developed within the DFG research group “Petri Net Technology”. The first installment has been introduced already at the PNT-Colloquium 1999 in Berlin. A unified presentation of low- and high-level Petri nets is given by Meseguer using their famous unifying framework of rewriting logic.

pub.1093572945,Unified Metamodel for Orchestrating Different Domains in SDI,"Automation of business processes/operational workflows is an urgent issue for network service providers of today and Software-Defined Infrastructure (SDI) has emerged as a key enabler for software-based automated operation of various infrastructure domains. The “model-driven” nature of SDI sheds light on the significance of a solid metamodel, which provides a basic abstraction commonly observed in various application/infrastructure domains. We posit that, however, lacking such a simple unified metamodel for SDI today is the barrier preventing broad adoption of the SDI by network service providers. In this paper, we propose a metamodel for SDI management and orchestration. Our framework is extremely simple but sufficiently expressive to be able describe various application/infrastructure domains in SDI. It also provides loose coupling between these domains, allowing each domain to have a domain-specific view while maintaining a unified global view in the orchestrator. These properties make our proposal a promising candidate used in conjunction with the existing modeling languages toward the development of the unified SDI metamodel."
pub.1086114524,Visual ppinot: A Graphical Notation for Process Performance Indicators,"Process performance indicators (PPIs) allow the quantitative evaluation of business processes, providing essential information for decision making. It is common practice today that business processes and PPIs are usually modelled separately using graphical notations for the former and natural language for the latter. This approach makes PPI definitions simple to read and write, but it hinders maintenance consistency between business processes and PPIs. It also requires their manual translation into lower-level implementation languages for their operationalisation, which is a time-consuming, error-prone task because of the ambiguities inherent to natural language definitions. In this article, Visual ppinot, a graphical notation for defining PPIs together with business process models, is presented. Its underlying formal metamodel allows the automated processing of PPIs. Furthermore, it improves current state-of-the-art proposals in terms of expressiveness and in terms of providing an explicit visualisation of the link between PPIs and business processes, which avoids inconsistencies and promotes their co-evolution. The reference implementation, developed as a complete tool suite, has allowed its validation in a multiple-case study, in which five dimensions of Visual ppinot were studied: expressiveness, precision, automation, understandability, and traceability."
pub.1009568182,Identifying knowledge management problems using a process‐based method (a case study of process 137)," Purpose The aim of this paper is to develop, test and improve a method that draws upon business process improvement literature and combines it with knowledge management approaches for modeling and analyzing knowledge‐intensive business processes.   Design/methodology/approach  Analyzing and integrating previous meta models served in knowledge oriented business process researches, a preliminary meta model was developed for modeling knowledge‐intensive business processes. Then an initial version of Proper Arrangement of Knowledge Management Processes (PAKMP) framework was developed according to the knowledge management processes approaches. Third round of interviews with process 137 members were conducted in order to test applicability and completeness of both preliminary meta model and initial version of PAKMP framework in order to improve them. In addition, a five‐steps analysis method achieved through case study which is based on the application of both final Meta model and PAKMP framework. In fact this five‐steps method was applied in Tehran's Municipality which redounded to improve preliminary meta model and initial version of PAKMP framework and endorsed the applicability of the proposed method in real world.    Findings This paper has a contribution in enriching the literature related to integrating KM efforts and BPM efforts by presenting a five‐steps analysis method and testing it in a real case. This method considers both KM and business process management points of view.   Research limitations/implications The general applicability of the method due to the weak generalization of the single case study is a limitation.   Originality/value This paper combines the advantages of the business process improvement and knowledge management approaches and suggests a practical method for modeling and analyzing the knowledge management status in knowledge‐intensive business processes. After analysis, managers should put emphasis on improving the arrangement of KM processes for critical knowledge objects which led to improve the performance of knowledge‐intensive business process trough removing KM problems. The paper concludes by suggesting some topics for future research. "
pub.1095815576,Towards meta-model semantics,"In the filed of software process modeling, there are a lot of software process meta-models and software process modeling languages to define software process models. The main difference between them is that software process meta-models define an abstract syntax of software process models, while software process modeling languages focus on a concrete syntax. However, they do not take into account a precise description of software process models. Since semantics is essential to describe the meaning of process models for process modelers, it plays a very important role in process model analysis, verification, validation and execution. This paper presents an algebraic method in specifying process models semantics at different levels in the context of a specific metal-model. It aims to precisely express the semantics of process models at meta-model level and completely support process models execution. This work is a first step towards effectively verifying process properties over process models."

In the first phase of information systems development, the object system, the IS environment and the IS itself must be described. These descriptions must be formal in order to avoid incompleteness or ambiguity.

This framework consists of a metamodel akin to Petri nets for representing dynamic systems and a functional part for the definition of data structures and functions. The framework is supported by a software tool for creating, checking and interpreting the described systems.The present paper concentrates on using ExSpect for feasibility study, requirements engineering, cost-benefit analysis and change analysis of the object system."

The approach supports both top down (synergistic) and bottom up (opportunistic) modeling (middle-out), and utilizes UML collaboration diagrams and UML 2.0 component diagrams with a new concept of service interfaces. It is also linked into a business modeling framework with business process modeling (BPMN) and goal modeling (BMM).

pub.1000331372,An Approach for a Mutual Integration of the Web of Things with Business Processes,"The vision of a multitude of heterogeneous, connected devices interacting with parts of its physical environment, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has gained momentum over the last years. For traditional business information systems the integration of the IoT leads to the emergence of new value-added business processes that make use of its representative devices such as RFID, sensors and actuators, as entirely new resources. One promising approach in the IoT domain is a real-world service integration method based on Representational State Transfer (REST) principles expedited by the initiative Web of Things (WoT). The connection of classical Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems commonly based on service oriented architectures coming with heavy-weight services and the resource oriented WoT coming with RESTful services for its limited devices is still a complex problem on both sides. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional integration approach of current Business Process Management (BPM)-based ERP systems and the WoT to provide a foundation to connect and analyze legacy systems as well as Future Internet applications. By following a three phase BPM-lifecycle, we investigate how the process metamodel of the industry standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) can cover WoT specific components. Reversely, we examine how existing and useful business process information can be seamlessly included into the WoT respecting its essential architecture and applying a component-based approach."
pub.1030289386,Rule-Enhanced Business Process Modeling Language for Service Choreographies,"To address problem of modeling service choreographies, the paper tackles the following challenges of the state of the art in choreography modeling: i)  choreography models are not well-connected with the underlying business vocabulary models. ii) there is limited support for decoupling parts of business logic from complete choreography models. This reduces dynamic changes of choreographies; iii) choreography models contain redundant elements of shared business logic, which might lead to an inconsistent implementation and incompatible behavior. Our proposal --- rBPMN --- is an extension of a business process modeling language with rule and choreography modeling support. rBPMN is defined by weaving the metamodels of the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and REWERSE Rule Markup Language (R2ML)."
pub.1098528084,Simulation and Knowledge Based Process Planning Through the Use of Metamodels,"Planning a forming strategy to produce a complex geometry is still a challenge due to lack of intelligent software tools that support the designer. Finite element (FE) simulations can be used to predict material flow and feasibility of a metal forming process. In this work metamodels were used as a bridge to combine knowledge‐based layout of forming steps and simulation‐based process planning. This new approach makes it possible to suggest numerical validated process plans for a forming feature to the designer. The whole design space of possible process parameter variations was sampled regarding quality criteria (damage, topology deviations, maximum force) using computer experiments to get the support points of the metamodels. To handle this high workload of computer experiments an automated workflow was created based on scripts and FE tools. The fitted metamodels can be used to get hints regarding feasibility when no accurate numerical simulation results are yet available to the designer. Moreover the models can be used for fast optimization given the small computational cost of the function evaluation of metamodels. A computer aided process planning (CAPP) system was developed based on metamodels. The present concept is demonstrated for the forming feature “chimney extrusion”."

In particular, the Interaction Diagrams of UML do not have, according to the current metamodel, an operational semantics defining formally how such a diagram is executed. The objective of this article is twofold: i) to propose a step towards a formal semantics to the Interaction Diagrams of UML by defining a partial order between messages and actions, ii) to generate a Petri net that defines a semantic of this diagram. Such a semantics.can help the designer in the validation of his specifications, establishing a link between the Interaction Diagrams and the Activity Diagrams and also allowing to generate code."
pub.1135634604,Facet-oriented Modelling," Models are the central assets in model-driven engineering (MDE), as they are actively used in all phases of software development. Models are built using metamodel-based languages, and so objects in models are typed by a metamodel class. This typing is static, established at creation time, and cannot be changed later. Therefore, objects in MDE are closed and fixed with respect to the class they conform to, the fields they have, and the well-formedness constraints they must comply with. This hampers many MDE activities, like the reuse of model-related artefacts such as transformations, the opportunistic or dynamic combination of metamodels, or the dynamic reconfiguration of models.   To alleviate this rigidity, we propose making model objects open so that they can acquire or drop so-called facets . These contribute with a type, fields and constraints to the objects holding them. Facets are defined by regular metamodels, hence being a lightweight extension of standard metamodelling. Facet metamodels may declare usage interfaces , as well as laws that govern the assignment of facets to objects (or classes).  This article describes our proposal, reporting on a theory, analysis techniques, and an implementation. The benefits of the approach are validated on the basis of five case studies dealing with annotation models, transformation reuse, multi-view modelling, multi-level modelling, and language product lines."

To leverage those advantages, SOA must be integrated with other existing approaches like business process management and enterprise architecture management. The authors describe how they extended the enterprise architecture management and business process management modelling method ARIS. They first created a SOA meta model by abstracting from existing modelling methods as well as extracting expert knowledge through interviews. In a second step, they mapped the SOA meta model to ARIS to provide a concrete modelling language for service-oriented enterprises. The ARIS extension allows describing and governing service architectures, describing services, linking service development initiatives to projects and company strategy, and discovering services for business process automation."
pub.1095657413,m3po: An Ontology to Relate Choreographies to Workflow Models,"External business processes (choreography models) are currently disconnected from internal processes (workflow models), which leads to synchronisation and verification problems. Connecting these by directly mapping internal to external processes requires a quadratic amount of mappings; an intermediate ontology reduces the amount of necessary mappings but is not trivial to construct due to the variety in work-flow meta-models. We introduce our multi meta-model process ontology (m3po), which is based on various existing reference models and languages from the work-flow and choreography domain. The m3po ontology relates workflow models to choreography models and allows choreography extraction from internal workflow models. An initial validation is given by translating an IBM Websphere $MQ$ Workflow model into the m3po ontology and subsequently extracting an Abstract BPEL model from the ontology."
pub.1152027296,A Consolidated View on Specification Languages for Data Analysis Workflows,"Data analysis workflows (DAWs) are widely used in the scientific world. However, different communities created a plethora of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to specify their DAWs. Consequently, across DSLs, it is hard to perform operations on DAWs such as share, port, compare, re-use, adapt, or even merge. Thus, we have analyzed DAW specification languages and created a unified DAW metamodel. Given an instance of a DAW specification that can be matched to our metamodel, we are now able to apply CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), and can potentially translate between different DAW specification languages."
pub.1024354323,Defining and verifying behaviour of domain specific language with fUML,"The behavioural semantics of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) are the instructions on how to execute the language. In practice, such semantics are often documented by text, which leads to ambiguity and tool generation problems. Although some formal frameworks have been proposed to address these drawbacks, they only allow the correctness of a specification to be tested at a later stage, usually when the semantics are implemented. This paper presents a new framework for implementing the behavioural semantics of meta-model based DSLs and tools. The framework uses the foundational subset of executable UML (fUML) as its semantic base, and uses the fUML meta-model for modelling the abstract syntax and operational semantics of a DSL. The semantics specification can be verified at design time without the need to execute behaviour models. Thus, it can provide useful feedback to the DSL designer. The framework is demonstrated in a Petri-net example."
pub.1094877046,Checking Correctness and Compliance of Integrated Process Models,"Models of different kinds are used in the area of business process management. Abstract process knowledge as well as executable process definitions can be visualized and edited in a graphical manner. The same holds true for models of process instances in some process-aware information systems (PAIS), which allow for dynamic modifications in a process instance during process runtime. An appropriate modeling tool must not only provide means to graphically edit different kinds of models on different abstraction layers but also detect or prevent violations of certain model constraints. These constraints comprise a model's internal correctness as well as a model's compliance with general process knowledge expressed in another more abstract model. In this paper we contribute an approach that allows for uniformly specifying correctness as well as compliance checks for diverse graphical process models. This is achieved by means of an integrated meta-model for models of different kinds. The integrated meta-model is referenced by a fixed set of Object Constraint Language (OCL) expressions, which specify correctness and compliance checks. We exemplify some OCL expressions and their application within a prototypical modeling tool."
pub.1166949352,Experience in Specializing a Generic Realization Language for SPL Engineering at Airbus,"In software product line (SPL) engineering, feature models are the de facto standard for modeling variability. A user can derive products out of a base model by selecting features of interest. Doing it automatically, however, requires a realization model, which is a description of how a base model should be modified when a given feature is selected/unselected. A realization model then necessarily depends on the base metamodel, asking for ad hoc solutions that have flourished in recent years. In this paper, we propose Greal, a generic solution to this problem in the form of (1) a generic declarative realization language that can be automatically composed with one or more base metamodels to yield a domain-specific realization language and (2) a product derivation algorithm applying a realization model to a base model and a resolved model to yield a derived product. We describe how, on top of Greal, we specialized a realization language to support both positive and negative variability, fit the syntax and semantics of the targeted language (BPMN) and take into account modeling practices at Airbus. We report on lessons learned of applying this approach on Program Development Plans based on business process models and discuss open problems."

We demonstrate an efficient workflow for handling the 3D reservoir simulation data in a way which is orders of magnitude faster than the conventional routine. The workflow (we call it “Metamodel”) is based on a projection of the system dynamics into a latent variable space, using Variational Autoencoder model, where Recurrent Neural Network predicts the dynamics. We show that being trained on multiple results of the conventional reservoir modelling, the Metamodel does not compromise the accuracy of the reservoir dynamics reconstruction in a significant way. It allows forecasting not only the flow rates from the wells, but also the dynamics of pressure and fluid saturations within the reservoir. The results open a new perspective in the optimization of oilfield development as the scenario screening could be accelerated sufficiently."

Based on our experience in the industrial context, we proposed a methodological framework to tackle these issues. Among the lessons learned from the experimentation of this framework, the need to formally connect the different models used was identified. The approach presented in this paper advocates the use of a link meta-model to define this connection. Combined with Business Goal modelling and analysis of the gaps between models of the current and future situations, the link meta-model helps guiding the analysis of Business Process change for Information System adaptation. The link meta model is applied with the case study of an evolving Pizzeria company."

pub.1094219418,Modelling Flexible Processes with Business Objects,"Mainstream business process modelling techniques promote a design paradigm wherein the activities that may be performed within a case, together with their usual execution order, form the backbone on top of which other aspects are anchored. This Fordist paradigm, while effective in standardised and production-oriented domains, breaks when confronted with processes in which case-by-case variations and exceptions are the norm. We contend that the effective design of flexible processes calls for a substantially different modelling paradigm: one where processes are organized as interacting business objects rather than as chains of activities. This paper presents a meta-model for business process modelling based on business objects. The paper also presents a real-life case study in which a number of human service delivery processes were designed using the presented meta-model. The case study demonstrates that the meta-model addresses three key flexibility requirements encountered in this domain."

Change management is therefore a definitional part of CIS. We advocate a conceptual modeling strategy for addressing this task, and illustrate it with experiences gained in WibQuS, a project aimed at CIS support for Total Quality Management in manufacturing organizations. These experiences emphasize the role of meta models in focusing the change process. Specific meta models and supporting environments are presented for: cooperative business process modeling in distributed organizations; simulation analysis of short-term and long-term effects of information flow designs; forward and reverse mappings between a distributed (relational) system interoperability layer and the information flow model. Models are not just analyzed at change time, but also support planned and unplanned information flows at runtime."

There are a lot of process models and metamodels; however, the “one size fits all” motto has to be moderated: models have to be adapted to the specificities of the organizations or the projects. In order to help method engineers building adapted process models, we propose a method to build process metamodels and to instantiate them according to the organizations context. Our method consists of selecting the concepts needed from a conceptual graph, gathering the current knowledge of metamodelling concepts for information systems engineering processes, and integrating them in a new process metamodel that will be instantiated for any project in an organization. This method is supported by a tool."
pub.1009225135,A system dynamics metamodel for software process modeling,"Abstract In this paper we describe a metamodel to the system dynamics language that allows the development of software process models based on high‐level constructors instead of mathematical equations. These constructors represent software process domain concepts such as developers, activities, resources and artifacts. A domain model allows the translation of these concepts to traditional stock‐and‐flow diagrams, which can be simulated to evaluate the behavior of software process models. The proposed approach helps inexperienced modelers to build process models by reducing the semantic gap between system dynamics and the software process domain. Thus, resulting models are more readable, easier to understand and maintain. We provide an example of a process model built with the proposed approach presenting its translation and simulation processes. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

                    Purpose
                    – The purpose of this paper is to propose a representation scheme based on the i* strategic actor model to represent the process owner information and show how to incorporate this approach into the event driven process chain and Business Process Modeling Notation-BPMN meta-models and also into the aspect-oriented business process modeling (BPM) context.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    – The authors use a case study in a real setting to evaluate the proposal and a controlled experiment to get more evidence about its relevance.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    – The authors presented evidence both from a case study in a real-world library showing the importance of representing – previously unavailable – process owner information, and from an experiment which involved participants analyzing the same models of the case study, confirming the preliminary evidences. It is important to stress the recognition that the proposed representation provided more transparency, in terms of ownership, than the usual BPM models. These benefits are due to the combination of the aspect-oriented approach and the strategic actor model, providing ownership information in a more transparent way.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    – The authors not only argue the importance of clearly established process ownership, both of the core process and the aspectual process, but also the authors presented an approach to represent the actor involved in process and aspect ownership as an instantiation of the i* strategic actor. Using this approach, the process owner can be defined in terms of actors instead of the activities performed. It is also possible to define the aspect owner and to include the aspectual process concept in the business process model.

pub.1043141798,uBPMN: A BPMN extension for modeling ubiquitous business processes,"Context: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the de facto standard for business process modeling. It was developed by the Object Management Group with support of the major organizations in the fields of software engineering and information systems. Despite its wide use, when it comes to representing ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking.Objective: To address BPMN’s deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN).Method: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN.Results: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN’s capabilities and benefits with real-life examples.Conclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies."
pub.1043612845,Metamodel and Constraints Co-evolution: A Semi Automatic Maintenance of OCL Constraints,"Metamodels are core components of modeling languages to define structural aspects of a business domain. As a complement, OCL constraints are used to specify detailed aspects of the business domain, e.g. more than 750 constraints come with the UML metamodel. As the metamodel evolves, its OCL constraints may need to be co-evolved too. Our systematic analysis shows that semantically different resolutions can be applied depending not only on the metamodel changes, but also on the user intent and on the structure of the impacted constraints. In this paper, we investigate the reasons that lead to apply different resolutions. We then propose a co-evolution approach that offers alternative resolutions while allowing the user to choose the best applicable one. We evaluated our approach on the evolution of the UML case study. The results confirm the need of alternative resolutions along with user decision to cope with real co-evolution scenarios. The results show that our approach reaches 80 % of semantically correct co-evolution."
pub.1049706550,Hybrid genetic algorithm and association rules for mining workflow best practices,"Business workflow analysis has become crucial in strategizing how to create competitive edge. Consequently, deriving a series of positively correlated association rules from workflows is essential to identify strong relationships among key business activities. These rules can subsequently, serve as best practices. We have addressed this problem by hybridizing genetic algorithm with association rules. First, we used correlation to replace support-confidence in genetic algorithm to enable dynamic data-driven determination of support and confidence, i.e., use correlation to optimize the derivation of positively correlated association rules. Second, we used correlation as fitness function to support upward closure in association rules (hitherto, association rules support only downward closure). The ability to support upward closure allows derivation of the most specific association rules (business model) from less specific association rules (business meta-model) and generic association rules (reference meta-model). Downward closure allows the opposite. Upward-downward closures allow the manager to drill-down and analyze based on the degree of dependency among business activities. Subsequently, association rules can be used to describe best practices at the model, meta-model and reference meta-model levels with the most general positively dependent association rules as reference meta-model. Experiments are based on an online hotel reservation system."

pub.1101404210,Event-Driven Process Chain for Modeling and Verification of Business Requirements–A Systematic Literature Review,"Automation of any business process primarily requires the identification of clear and precise requirements. However, the initially collected business requirements are usually expressed in natural language that creates ambiguities among different stakeholders. To overcome this problem, various business process modeling languages (BPMLs) have been introduced to represent the business requirements graphically. In this context, event-driven process chain (EPC) is a well-known BPML that supports the modeling and verification of business requirements in early automation phases. Although EPC is frequently researched to improve its modeling and verification capabilities, there is no study available yet to the best of our knowledge that examines and summarizes the latest EPC developments. Therefore, in this article, we comprehensively investigate the latest EPC approaches, trends, and tools for the modeling and verification of business requirements. Particularly, a systematic literature review is carried out to select and analyze 73 research studies published during 1998–2017. Consequently, the selected studies are classified into six categories, i.e., modeling (14), transformation (13), verification (17), general (20), semantics (5), and requirement (4). Moreover, latest EPC modeling approaches are identified and analyzed, i.e., UML (2), meta-model (3), integration (5), and EPC notations (4). Furthermore, EPC verification methods are also investigated, i.e., EPC (6), petri-nets (8), and other languages (3). Finally, 25 leading EPC tools have been presented, i.e., existing tools (14), proposed/developed tools, (5) and additional tools (6). It has been concluded that EPC provides adequate approaches and tool support for the modeling and verification of simple business requirements through atomic events. However, the complex business requirements cannot be modeled and verified through EPC due to the lack of complex event processing. Consequently, there is a strong need to include the support for the modeling and verification of complex events in EPC to manage multifaceted business requirements."
pub.1035699605,Collaborative process cartography deduction based on collaborative ontology and model transformation,"With an increasing background in inter-enterprise collaboration and interoperability, the automatic deduction of collaborative business processes is increasingly being viewed as a crucial research subject. The common solution is believed to involve either semantic ontologies or metamodeling, which can be combined with semantic algorithms or transformation rules. However, from the viewpoint of enterprises, the modeling of collaborative processes should be software integrated and can be changed to workflow. The design of the targeted collaborative process model does not fit the need. This has led to a lack of concepts and transformation rules for the ontology or metamodel. In this paper, a new collaborative process model called collaborative process cartography is designed. Related collaborative ontology and its knowledge-expanding rules have also been updated. Collaborative ontology contains essential concepts for the collaborative situation and includes the rules and algorithms for process deduction. A prototype for the supporting tools is also provided."
pub.1027370938,Comparison of Three Model Transformation Languages,"In this paper we compare three model transformation languages: 1) Concrete syntax-based graph transformation (CGT) which is our emerging model transformation language, 2) Attributed Graph Grammar (AGG) representing traditional graph transformation, and 3) Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) representing model transformation. Our case study is a fairly complicated refactoring of UML activity models. The case study shows that CGT rules are more concise and requires considerably less effort from the modeler, than with AGG and ATL. With AGG and ATL, the transformation modeler needs access to and knowledge of the metamodel and the representation in the abstract syntax. In CGT rules on the other hand, the transformation modeler can concentrate on the familiar concrete syntax of the source and target languages."

The relevance of this approach is proven by applying it to a real-world industry scenario."
pub.1172790874,Social Media Initiatives through IoT to Link the Bridge between Industrial Demands with Higher Education Millennial Students through Experience Learning,"Despite recent improvements in e-Learning, additional work is necessary to enhance learning for everyone and fill the research gap in the artefacts that are now available. E-learning artefacts have limitations: First, they lack adaptability variants, since they only suggest communities, peers, or e-learning. Second, they often prioritize technology over e-learning theory and pedagogy. Finally, their focus on e-learning activities rather than processes prevents them from fully capturing the experience. The goal of this project is to improve the e-learning experience by examining the efficacy of combining three cutting-edge technologies (Business Process Modeling and Enactment, Semantics, and Service Oriented Computing) with learning methodology. The HeLPS e-Learning Framework, a hybrid process-based, semantically enhanced, and service-oriented framework, was created as a result of this research. A general e-learning process was developed bottom-up in this framework by evaluating a variety of e-learning models (practical artefacts) and related pedagogies/concepts (theories). An e-Learning Meta-Model captures the domain’s semantics and procedures. The e-Learning Meta-Model, which uses Semantic Web Rule Language to encapsulate domain rules, is a third major addition. Service-Orientation is promoted by creating a semantically enriched approach to recognize and locate online services from e-learning business process models."
pub.1131242909,NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (NFRS) TRACEABILITY METAMODEL FOR AGILE DEVELOPMENT,"Agile methodologies are well known for early and frequent releases. Besides, these methodologies also handle requirement changes well without causing delays. However, it has been noticed that the functional requirements changes can affect the non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as security and performance. It is also possible that the agile team is not even aware of these effects causing dysfunctional system. This issue could be addressed by offering traceability mechanism that helps to trace the effect of functional requirement changes on the non-functional requirements. Unfortunately, a few researchers have conducted studies regarding this issue. Thus, this study attempts to present a Traceability Process Model (TPM) to tackle the issue of tracing NFR especially security and performance. However, to materialize a full scale TPM, a metamodel is necessary. Therefore in this paper, we present a metamodel by integrating two existing metamodels. Then we validate the newly built metamodel with precision and recall methods. Lastly, we also develop a traceability tool that is based on the proposed metamodel."
pub.1020727782,MDE for BPM: A Systematic Review,"Due to the rapid change in the business processes of organizations, Business Process Management (BPM) has come into being. BPM helps business analysts to manage all concerns related to business processes, but the gap between these analysts and people who build the applications is still large. The organization’s value chain changes very rapidly; to modify simultaneously the systems that support the business management process is impossible. MDE (Model Driven Engineering) is a good support for transferring these business process changes to the systems that implement these processes. Thus, by using any MDE approach, such as MDA, the alignment between business people and software engineering should be improved. To discover the different proposals that exist in this area, a systematic review was performed. As a result, the OMG’s Business Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM) has been identified as the standard that will be the key for the application of MDA for BPM."

Our model is made of three workflows-framework, metamodel, and patterns-and three phases-inception, construction, and formalization. The main conclusion is that when developing a framework, we can produce with minimal overhead-almost as a side effect-a metamodel with an associated DSL and a pattern language. Both outputs will not only help the framework evolve in the right direction, but will also be valuable in themselves. In order to illustrate these ideas, we present a case study in the multimedia domain. For several years, we have been developing a multimedia framework. The process has produced a full-fledged domain-specific metamodel for the multimedia domain, with an associated DSL and a pattern language."

Domain-specific typing and polymorphism leverage the flexibility of processes by enabling the dynamic selection of process components. We present a modelling environment and a distributed execution engine for the meta-model. In addition, we discuss the use of semantic technologies for smart workflows."
pub.1093581905,Modeling Contextualized Flexible Cloud Workflow Services: An MDE Based Approach,"The evolution of the economy, competition, development of new technologies and globalization explain the blooming of inter-organizations cooperation. The inter-organizations cooperation represents a new opportunity to answer to complex challenges that a single organization can't face alone. Cloud Computing is an emerging computation paradigm in information technology and networking. Most recently business applications are leveraging the power of this novel technology. In this work, we are interested in the issue of Inter-organizations Cooperation in Cloud Computing environment. More precisely, this paper deals with Contextualized Flexible Cloud Workflow Services (CWS). By CWS, we mean services automating loosely coupled fragments of inter-organization business processes and whose description and execution are accessible through the Cloud. One possible way to deal with CWS modeling in a comprehensive conceptual framework is to use the Model-Driven Engineering. The basic principle of MDE is the separation of organizational concerns from their technical achievement. Therefore, business models are not corrupted by technical concerns and vice versa. Following this practice, we first propose the Cloud Workflow Service Meta-Model (CWS2M) by extending BPMN 2.0 to support the modeling of CWS. In order to deal with variability, evolution and adaptation of CWS, we also propose the Flexible Cloud Workflow Service Meta-Model (FCWS2M) as an extension of the CWS2M meta-model using the versioning technique. Finally, we propose the Contextualized Flexible Cloud Workflow Service Meta-Model (CFCWS2M) to characterize the situations in which CWS versions are executed. We illustrate our solution through the “Drug Development Process” case study."
pub.1023414898,Business process archeology using MARBLE,"ContextLegacy information systems age over time. These systems cannot be thrown away because they store a significant amount of valuable business knowledge over time, and they cannot be entirely replaced at an acceptable cost. This circumstance is similar to that of the monuments of ancient civilizations, which have aged but still hold meaningful information about their civilizations. Evolutionary maintenance is the most suitable mechanism to deal with the software ageing problem since it preserves business knowledge. But first, recovering the underlying business knowledge in legacy systems is necessary in order to preserve this vital heritage.ObjectiveThis paper proposes and validates a method for recovering and rebuilding business processes from legacy information systems. This method, which can be considered a business process archeology, makes it possible to preserve the business knowledge in legacy information systems.MethodThe business process archeology method is framed in MARBLE, a generic framework based on Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM), which uses the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) standard. The proposed method is validated using a case study that involves a real-life legacy system. The case study is conducted following the case study protocol proposed by Brereton et al.ResultsThe study reports that the proposed method makes it possible to obtain business process models from legacy systems with adequate levels of accuracy. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is also validated positively.ConclusionThe proposed method semi-automatically rebuilds the hidden business processes embedded in a legacy system. Therefore, the business process archeology method quickly allows business experts to have a meaningful understanding of the organization’s business processes. This proposal is less time-consuming and more exhaustive (since it considers the embedded business knowledge) than a manual process redesign by experts from scratch. In addition, it helps maintainers to extract the business knowledge needed for the system to evolve."
pub.1095448478,Patterns for integrating manufacturing product and process models,"In building models for manufacturing, product information has most often been handled separately from process information. The integration of product and process models in a unified data model could provide the means by which information could be shared across a manufacturing enterprise throughout the system lifecycle from design to production. Recently, attempts have been made to integrate these two separate views of systems through identifying common data models. This paper relates description-driven systems to multi-layer architectures and reveals where existing design patterns facilitate the integration of product and process models and where patterns are missing or where existing patterns require enrichment for this integration. It reports on the construction of a so-called description-driven system which integrates product data management (PDM) and workflow management (WfM) data models through a common meta-model."

The framework uses dynamic mapping rules set between the different meta-models as the basis for the transformation, and exerts transformation engine to accomplish the conversion. A grammar structure of the rules and a transformation algorithm are given and a framework of the prototype for workflow process definition transformation based on meta-model is designed and implemented.

pub.1024068156,An Ontological Approach for Defining Agents for Collaborative Applications,"Collaboration has become important especially in knowledge intensive applications. Computer support systems for collaborative work on The Web, however, usually grow in an ad-hoc manner. The paper suggests two reasons for such an ad-hoc approach. One is a lack of methods to map collaborative requirements into collaborative workspaces. The other is that collaborative processes themselves change over time. The paper proposes a metamodel that provides an ontology to support collaborative process modelling and use these to define generic agents, which can assist users to set up and change collaborative workspaces. The metamodel itself integrates social, organizational and workflow semantics providing the ability to describe complex collaborative processes. The metamodel concepts and the corresponding agents are generic in nature and the paper will describe ways to map such generic concepts to specific domain applications."
pub.1033726186,Object-Oriented Interactive Processes in Decentralized Production Systems,"Supervision and controlled execution of processes and parameters are core requirements in Digital Production. But even in rather homogeneous systems, deviation from defined workflows and even process change occur daily. To be able to react flexibly to changing market conditions and to respond to increasing individualization of products and their adjacent processes, even more and ad-hoc variants have to be created and supported by production planning and control systems. We solve this problem by introducing a semantic process model, which can be executed and extended using a decentralized, message-based system. In situations where unforeseen deviations and needs for interactive intervention occur or ad-hoc input from users is needed, a generic, model-based user interface is used to create correct interactions in such a context. Our contribution makes processes much more flexible and opens up a new way of creating correct interactions in unforeseen process contexts."
pub.1036950543,A formal framework to generate XPDL specifications from UML activity diagrams,"The XML Process Definition Language (XPDL) is a standardized language allowing process definitions interchange between a variety of tools ranging from workflow management systems to modeling and simulation tools. On the other hand, UML activity diagrams offer a convenient notation to depict synthetic and intuitive views of systems that facilitate stakeholder communication. However, there is currently no tool able to animate activity diagrams using workflow management systems. Moreover, despite standardization efforts, diagram interchange across different modeling tools remains an issue. Hence, transforming UML activity diagrams into XPDL specifications would preserve stakeholder communication while enabling animation tool support. This paper presents a formal and optimal transformation of UML activity diagrams into XPDL specifications. This mapping is described through a set of formal translation rules defined from the UML activity metamodel to the XPDL metamodel. We demonstrate that the defined mapping process preserves some structural properties specified on the translated UML activity diagram."

Secondly, integration metamodel based on the framework is introduced. Data, application system, function, component, workflow and their relationships are explained in detail. Finally, a system integration modeling language for application system design (SIML4ASD) based on the metamodel is defined by extending UML using profile mechanism. SIML4ASD is easy to learn, use and understand for the system designers and can be used to describe integration models clearly and exactly in multi-view."

In this paper, we proposed W2ME, a process-oriented meta model for OTO-oriented e-commerce. W2ME bases on the traditional activity network model and extends it. Based on the principle of minimum privileges in the authorization problem, W2ME propose the W2MEA algorithm which effectively reduces the complexity for authority management. Simulation results show that W2ME can save 20% CPU occupancy time and has 95thpercentile average success rate."
pub.1036048758,BPMN-Based Conceptual Modeling of ETL Processes,"Business Intelligence (BI) solutions require the design and implementation of complex processes (denoted ETL) that extract, transform, and load data from the sources to a common repository. New applications, like for example, real-time data warehousing, require agile and flexible tools that allow BI users to take timely decisions based on extremely up-to-date data. This calls for new ETL tools able to adapt to constant changes and quickly produce and modify executable code. A way to achieve this is to make ETL processes become aware of the business processes in the organization, in order to easily identify which data are required, and when and how to load them in the data warehouse. Therefore, we propose to model ETL processes using the standard representation mechanism denoted BPMN (Business Process Modeling and Notation). In this paper we present a BPMN-based metamodel for conceptual modeling of ETL processes. This metamodel is based on a classification of ETL objects resulting from a study of the most used commercial and open source ETL tools."
pub.1001030186,On the definition and design-time analysis of process performance indicators," A key aspect in any process-oriented organisation is the evaluation of process performance for the achievement of its strategic and operational goals. Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are a key asset to carry out this evaluation, and, therefore, having an appropriate definition of these PPIs is crucial. After a careful review of the literature related and a study of the current picture in different real organisations, we conclude that there not exists any proposal that allows to define PPIs in a way that is unambiguous and highly expressive, understandable by technical and non-technical users and traceable with the Business Process (BP). In addition, like other activities carried out during the BP lifecycle, the management of PPIs is considered time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, providing an automated support for them is very appealing from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose the PPINOT metamodel, which allows such an advanced definition of PPIs and is independent of the language used to model the business process. Furthermore, we provide an automatic semantic mapping from the metamodel to Description Logics (DL) that allows the implementation of design-time analysis operations in such a way that DL reasoners’ facilities can be leveraged. These operations provide information that can assist process analysts in the definition and instrumentation of PPIs. Finally, to validate the usefulness of our proposal, we have used the PPINOT metamodel at the core of a software tool called the PPINOT Tool Suite and we have applied it in several real scenarios."
pub.1094750453,Combining Rules and Activities for Modeling Service-Based Business Processes,"It is widely acknowledged that business process management would greatly benefit from integration with business rule management. But there is still no established solution to this integration problem, and the leading business process modeling language, BPMN, does not provide any explicit support for rules. In this paper, we are going to investigate the extension of BPMN by adding rules as a modeling concept in the form of a new gateway type, using the principles of Model-Driven Engineering. The integration will be done on the level of the metamodels of the involved languages, resulting in a new rule-based process modeling language called rBPMN (Rule-based BPMN)."
pub.1095044135,From Sequence Diagrams to Event B: A Specification and Verification Approach of Flexible Workflow Applications of Cloud Services Based on Meta-Model Transformation,"This paper presents a meta-model transformation based approach to reasoning about sequence diagrams using B event. We present an approach for the specification and the verification of flexible Workflow applications of cloud services. Our approach is based on the semiformal notation of UML sequence diagrams, and the formal method B event. We have developed a tool called SD2EventB supporting the proposed approach. This tool allows the specification of flexible Cloud service Workflow application models using predefined flexibility patterns generated automatically by this tool. Once the model is specified, it is transformed to an event B model to be verified. In order to ensure this verification, we have used the platform Rodin supporting the event B method. This platform has been integrated into our tool. The transformation, as well, has been developed as a function of our tool using the meta-model transformation environment KerMeta."
pub.1034522599,A Model-Driven Approach to Designing Cross-Enterprise Business Processes,"Modeling and managing business processes that span multiple organizations involves new challenges, mainly regarding the ability to cope with change, decentralization, and the required support for interoperability. In this paper, we present an approach to modeling cross-enterprise business processes based on the model-driven architecture (MDA). Starting from the ATHENA interoperability architecture, we propose a conceptual architecture for cross-enterprise business processes. Then, we present a methodical approach towards designing cross-enterprise business processes based on a model-driven architecture. The core contribution of the paper is a set of original mappings at and across different layers of the model-driven architecture, including a mapping from ARIS to UML and the Business Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM)."
pub.1013316193,A methodology proposal for collaborative business process elaboration using a model-driven approach,"Business process management (BPM) principles are commonly used to improve processes within an organisation. But they can equally be applied to supporting the design of an Information System (IS). In a collaborative situation involving several partners, this type of BPM approach may be useful to support the design of a Mediation Information System (MIS), which would ensure interoperability between the partners’ ISs (which are assumed to be service oriented). To achieve this objective, the first main task is to build a collaborative business process cartography. The aim of this article is to present a method for bringing together collaborative information and elaborating collaborative business processes from the information gathered (by using a collaborative situation framework, an organisational model, an informational model, a functional model and a metamodel and by using model transformation rules)."
pub.1095396421,A UML-based System Integration Modeling Language for the Application System Design of Shipborne Combat System,"The Shipborne combat system (SCS) includes many application systems. The integration of application systems is necessary because they are distributed and need to complete combat tasks together. For such integration, an integration model needs to be developed. Firstly, the integration framework of application systems of SCS is introduced, which involves three layers: data integration, function integration and workflow integration. Secondly, integration metamodel based on the framework is discussed. Data, application system, function, component, workflow and their relationships are explained in detail. Finally, a system integration modeling language for application system design (SIML4ASD) based on the metamodel is defined by extending UML using profile mechanism. A case study of antisubmarine combat is given to explain the use of SIML4ASD. Since it is an extension of UML, SIML4ASD is easy to learn, understand and use for the system designers and can be used to describe the integration model clearly and exactly in multi-view."
pub.1012571614,On Behavioural Model Transformation in Web Services,"Web Services are seen as one of the most promising solutions for the integration of autonomous, heterogonous e-business systems. Today’s e-commerce systems often involve a combination of multiple Web Services, which are implemented via a mix of technologies such as Business Process Markup Language (BPML), Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS), and Web Service Choreography Interface (WSCI).Recently, the application of Model Driven Architecture (MDA) to Web Services has received considerable attention. However, most of existing literature deals with the static aspects of Web Service modelling. This paper focuses on the behavioral aspect of the composition of Web Services using a Meta Object Facility (MOF) compliant metamodel for BPEL4WS. The paper presents a transformation of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) Activity diagram to the BPEL4WS."
pub.1003513227,Modeling Business Objectives for Business Process Management,"For application scenarios such as the management of business process variants or business process quality, business objective models assume the role of formal requirements definitions as in software engineering. However, effective concepts in this area still constitute a gap in the presently available array of business process management methods. To address this issue, this paper develops and shortly evaluates a refined business objective modeling approach. Our approach builds on use case-based effectiveness criteria, and on insights gained from assessing the state of the art. It derives required constructs and interrelations from application scenarios, and integrates these into a business objective meta-model. As an initial validation of our concept, we model a sample scenario and match the results against effectiveness criteria."
pub.1093604316,Workflow Meta-Model Extension for Pervasive Computing Environment,"Along with the rapid development of the Pervasive Computing and the SOA technology, the limitation of the traditional workflow modeling mechanisms is increasingly obvious in the aspects of supporting rules defining, resource using on demand and transparent accessing, goal-driven automatic composition of services etc. To adapt the request of the Pervasion Computing, for example environment perception, resource transparent accessing, application integration seamless, this paper extends the WFMC workflow process meta-model based on Ontology and Web service techniques. By adding goal definition of working task, using rules for web services, uniform abstract and definition mechanisms for application resource and physical resource, skill and knowledge demand for executive role, it provides modeling support for intellectualized and larger-granularity workflow activity definition. Sequentially, adapting various practical situations that possibility presences in the pervasive environment, this paper provides model support for resource automatic identification and dynamic binding, goal-driven dynamic composition of various computing services and intellectualized execution of workflow model defined."
pub.1010347297,Implementing Domain Specific Process Modelling,Business process modelling becomes more productive when modellers can use process modelling languages which optimally fit to the application domain. This requires the proliferation and management of domain specific modelling languages and modelling tools. In this paper we address the issue of providing domain specific languages in a systematic and structural way without having to implement modelling tools for each domain specific language separately. Our approach is based on a two dimensional meta modelling stack.
pub.1147264064,Reliability Analysis with Fragility Surfaces and a Workflow for Antifragility,"Failure is often defined by exceeding limits. Failure probabilities in dependence of input parameters, limit levels can be visualized as fragility curves or surfaces. Fragility curves, surfaces are useful in the whole product lifecycle from the early phase like product layout and manufacturing to product services for maintenance. In this paper several fragility curves and surfaces from applications in electronics reliability are shown and discussed. Using the fragility surfaces as metamodels for optimizations we can build workflows to improve the product quality during its lifetime."
pub.1093452372,EXTENDING DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION BY ADDING AN ACTIVITY CONCEPT FOR BUSINESS PROCESS MODELING AND SIMULATION,"We show how a basic discrete event simulation language can be enabled for business process modeling and simulation by adding an activity construct. While activities are often not considered at all or not treated in a conceptually satisfactory way in the discrete event simulation literature, the great majority of business process modeling languages are based on an activity construct. However, unlike a simulation language, the predominant business process modeling languages, including UML Activity Diagrams and the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), are not executable. So, the challenge for business process modeling is to define an executable semantics for activities, while the challenge for discrete event simulation is to find a way how to introduce an activity construct on top of the basic discrete event simulation concepts of objects and events. The main idea is to define an activity as a complex event having a start event and an end event. This idea is well-known from the business process modeling literature, e.g. from the Business Process Definition Metamodel (Bock 2008), but it has also been used in a rudimentary way in some discrete event simulation approaches, e.g. in (Fishman 2001). Our research contribution consists of two achievements: 1) we define a conceptual model of activities for discrete event simulation and implement it in our ER/AOR simulation language; 2) we show how to use BPMN for the purpose of simulation modeling."
pub.1001853016,Catch me if you can – debugging support for model transformations,"Model-Driven Engineering places models as first-class artifacts throughout the software lifecycle requiring the availability of proper transformation languages. Although numerous approaches are available, they lack convenient facilities for supporting debugging and understanding of the transformation logic. This is because execution engines operate on a low level of abstraction, hide the operational semantics of a transformation, scatter metamodels, models, transformation logic, and trace information across different artifacts, and provide limited verification support. To tackle these problems, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) on top of Colored Petri Nets (CPNs)—called Transformation Nets—for the execution and debugging of model transformations on a high level of abstraction. This formalism makes the afore hidden operational semantics explicit by providing a runtime model in terms of places, transitions and tokens, integrating all artifacts involved into a homogenous view. Moreover, the formal underpinnings of CPNs enable comprehensive verification of model transformations."
pub.1017659148,On the Evolution of OCL for Capturing Structural Constraints in Modelling Languages,"The Object Constraint Language (OCL) can be used to capture structural constraints in the context of the abstract syntax of modelling languages (metamodels) defined in the MOF metamodelling architecture. While the expression language of OCL has been revised and updated a number of times since its inception, the constructs used for capturing constraints (invariants) have remained unchanged. In this paper we argue that the abstract and concrete syntax of OCL invariants should also be updated to address a number of shortcomings and render OCL more usable in a contemporary modelling environment. To support our arguments we have implemented the proposed extensions in the prototype Epsilon Validation Language (EVL). To demonstrate the benefits delivered, we present and discuss a concrete example."
pub.1027312502,Choreographies as Federations of Choreographies and Orchestrations,"We propose a new conceptual model for choreographies of web-services. Choreographies are seen as virtual workflow models shared among participants. Subsets of these participants might have more refined models known only to them. So we see choreographies actually as federations of process models (choreographies as well as orchestrations). In this paper we discuss this layered concept, and present a metamodel with the following distinguishing features: It is fully distributed and does not require a central or global authority. It captures the control flow and the data flow aspects of the processes. Choreography models can be (re)used in several other choreographies. Additionally, we provide a procedure which checks whether choreographies fit together, i.e. the conformance of the federation relationship between models."
pub.1095329108,Propagating Requirement Change into Software High Level Designs towards Resilient Software Evolution,"Uncertain and incomplete requirements throughout the whole software life cycle contribute to volatility of the requirements. In a situation where the volatile requirement is changed to satisfy stakeholder needs, all the affected requirements and other impacted software artefacts (such as designs, codes, and tests) must be identified and changed accordingly. This paper introduces an approach to facilitate both engineers and users in propagating changes from requirements to the software high-level designs during software development and evolution. The two main pillars of this approach, namely product metamodel and process model are described in details. Firstly, the metamodel highlights on explicit conceptual model for volatile requirement and its characteristics. Next, the focus will be placed on the systematic process model specified using the SPEM that offers guidelines to perform the requirement change process. The applicability of the product metamodel and its elements are evaluated using the IFAMMS case study application."
pub.1041506876,Consistency Verification Between Goal Model and Process Model in Requirements Analysis of Networked Software,"In requirements analysis of networked software, achieving goal depends on the relevant business process, and each process associates with goal. On the one hand, the process can complete the corresponding function goal to directly realize the function needs from users; on the other hand, the process can promote the realization of the non-functional goals to improve the satisfaction of the non-functional goals. So, it requires that the goal model and process model of the networked software requirements meta-model must be consistent. This paper studies the consistency verification between goal model and process model. In our methods, GM model is used to describe goal model, and PZN model is used to describe process model, and their mapping relationship is reflected by selection set in GM and effective activity path in PZN. We analyze consistency through the mapping relationships between the whole goal model and the process model from atomic goal to atomic process. Under this way, it ensures that the process model can realize the users' demand correctly. Through the application in actual project, it shows that this method is effective to ensure the unity of the goal and the process during the requirement analysis."
pub.1095641800,A BPEL4WS Extension to Develop and Execute Grid Service Workflow Application,"The Grid service application workflow models are composed and built on an abstract level using UML Activity Diagram composition patterns. By following the MDA principals, the provided models represent the Platform Independent Model. To be executed, workflow activity diagram models should be translated into BPEL4WS models which will be executed by the BPEL4WS engine. To reach this objective, we define a metamodel based transformation from UML activity diagrams to BPEL4WS language. To ensure the transformation between all Activity Diagram composition patterns and BPEL4WS constructs, we propose in this paper an extension of the BPEL4WS construct set. The extension deals with the alternative service composition pattern."
pub.1033532024,Business Process Families Using Model-Driven Techniques,"Traditionally, businesses have used IT systems as mechanical advantage for automating static a-priori-defined repetitive tasks. Increased business dynamics has placed greater demands of adaptation and agility on to IT systems. Service oriented architecture is a step in this direction through separation of business process concerns from application functionality. There have been multiple attempts at improving adaptability of application services with varying degrees of success. But current business process modeling languages and execution platforms can at best support optimal point solutions that are not amenable for agile adaptation. Application services have benefited to some extent, from product-line architectures related to adaptation to a-priori known situations. We can apply the same idea to business processes. An extension of essential BPMN meta model supporting business process families, and a set of adaptation operators are presented in this paper. We describe their realization using model-driven techniques."
pub.1094324721,Debugging Model-to-Model Transformations,"Model-Driven Engineering places models as first-class artifacts throughout the software lifecycle requiring the availability of proper model transformation languages. Although numerous languages are available, they lack convenient facilities for debugging and supporting understanding of the transformation logic. This is not least because the underlying transformation engines operate on a low level of abstraction, hiding the operational semantics of a high-level language. Consequently, low-level debugging information is available only, e.g., variable values. To tackle these limitations, we propose a DSL on top of Colored Petri Nets (CPN s) - called Transformation Nets (TN s) - for the execution and debugging of model transformations. By integrating all artifacts of a transformation, i.e., metamodel elements, model elements, and transformation logic, a runtime model for model transformations is provided, making the afore hidden operational semantics explicit. Based on this runtime model we present various means for debugging by means of an example showing how a QVT-Relations (QVT-R) specification may be debugged using TNs."
pub.1120756810,An Experience in Modelling Business Process Architecture,"We present a mapping of a previously designed Business Process Architecture (BPA) meta-model onto ArchiMate, i.e., the de facto standard Enterprise Architecture (EA) modelling language. This construct mapping allows developing process maps, i.e., descriptions of (views of) the business process architecture of an organization. We demonstrate the development of these process maps using the Signavio Business Process Management (BPM) modelling platform. The developed process maps are part of the organization’s enterprise architecture model and are linked to BPMN process diagrams that detail the functional, control-flow, data and resource aspects of the business processes included in the process map. Our research contributes to the integration of BPM and EA by researching BPA as a concept common to both disciplines."
pub.1007673743,A Case Study for a Bidirectional Transformation Between Heterogeneous Metamodels in QVT Relations,"Model transformations constitute a key technology for model-driven software engineering. In additional to unidirectional transformations, bidirectional transformations may be required e.g. for round-trip engineering or bidirectional data conversion. Bidirectional transformations may be difficult to perform if the metamodels of source and target models differ significantly from each other, as it is the case for object-relational mappings. In this paper, we present a bidirectional transformation between Ecore models and relational schemata written in QVT Relations. The case study demonstrates that it is possible to encode a bidirectional transformation between heterogeneous metamodels in a single relational specification. Simultaneously, the case study also shows some inherent limitations of what can be achieved by bidirectional transformations."
pub.1095144354,A Framwork for Grid Workflow Scheduling with Resource Constraints,"In order to process workflow application more efficiently, we propose a workflow scheduling framework with resource constraints. The proposed framework is defined in three independent layers: concept, logic and physical ones, where an improved process definition meta-model, which unifies the process, activity, and transition, is proposed to support the recursive composition. Furthermore, the application of workflow scheduling framework in grid environment with the resources constraints is discussed."
pub.1010983554,A Design Process Model for Handling Multiple-Design-Object Models,"An intelligent CAD system aims at serving a designer as an intelligent, integrated design environment. For building such a system, development of a large scale knowledge base is necessary. To do so, design knowledge must be systematically formalized, made computable, and organized. Design knowledge has two categories ; i.e., design object knowledge and design process knowledge. In our previous reports, we have formalized a computable design process model to represent design process knowledge and the concept of a metamodel dealing with multiple design object models. This paper proposes a framework to achieve a harmonized combination of these two. In this framework, the computable design process model navigates the metamodel mechanism to generate and modify models of the design object. We describe a prototype system and illustrate an example of ship design."
pub.1126014066,Metamodels in Computational Mechanics for Bayesian FEM Updating of Ancient High-Rise Masonry Structures,"In order to estimate their behaviour as realistic as possible, masonry structures and historical complex buildings are frequently assessed with demanding non-linear procedures, whether for static or dynamic purposes. However, uncertainties related to the epistemic and aleatory field, especially for historical masonry, can widely influence the output reliability and diminish the value of the deterministic approach (one input – one output) in a decision making workflow: for instance, the necessity for urgent structural interventions or even the possibility to close the building or civil object for safety reasons. This paper aims to show how these uncertainties could be quantified, based on a multi-parameter input approach, and consequently handled. In sequence, (i) the knowledge, based on the state-of-the-art survey of the object (geometry, quality and characteristics of the materials, etc.) and scientific or engineering contents (constitutive laws, possible sources of excitation, solution methods, etc.) can be put inside a numerical model in order to find a solution for the desired output, (ii) input parameters could be treated as variables, so that the model space could be explored for different sets of values and (iii) a probabilistic model or distribution could be adopted for each parameter, based on previous known observations. The outputs of such a model will be of statistic nature and will have a probabilistic distribution as well: based on this data, produced by the numerical model (f.i. a finite element model), a relationship between inputs and outputs could be established in an approximated mathematical formulation, the so-called metamodel. In this context, the newly generated (meta)model has the following characteristics: (i) it has been validated as the correct representation of the original model, (ii) it is much less computationally demanding than the original model, (iii) it establishes a direct relationship between the input parameters and the output, (iv) it can be used both for input parameters calibration, based on new observations, and, possibly, for the risk assessment. Based on these considerations, the metamodel could be assumed as a fast and validated decision-making tool. An elucidating example is herein discussed with reference to a historic masonry tower."
pub.1115214630,Business Process Compliance Despite Change: Towards Proposals for a Business Process Adaptation,"Business Process Compliance (BPC) denotes the execution of business processes in accordance with applicable compliance requirements. BPC can be satisfied through compliance processes that are integrated into the business process. In addition, compliance requirements place demands against IT components that are sometimes necessary to execute business or compliance processes. Various factors, such as outsourcing or business process reengineering can lead to a change of processes or IT components and thus to a violation of BPC. Consequently, our goal is to provide proposals for a business process adaptation to further ensure BPC. Following the design science research methodology, we developed two artifacts to reach our goal. First, we developed a meta-model that represents the interrelations between alternative compliance process patterns and compliance processes that satisfy the same compliance requirement. Second, we developed a method to automatically put forward proposals for a business process adaptation through the integration of alternative compliance processes to further ensure BPC."
pub.1117877662,From BPMN2 to Event B: A Specification and Verification Approach of Workflow Applications,"The BPMN2 language suffers from the absence of a precise formal semantics of the various notations used, which often leads to ambiguities. In addition, this language does not have a proof system that validates a BPMN2 specification. Consequently, the use of a formal method, such as Event B, is a solution for dealing with the shortcomings found in the BPMN2 language. We propose in this paper a model-driven approach based on meta-model and meta-model transformation implemented in KerMeta to specify and formally verify workflows."
pub.1094929619,"A reflective approach to process model customization, enactment and evolution","Software processes are enacted instances of process models. Process models are themselves instances of process meta-models that provide the various abstractions in terms of which process models can be described. This paper introduces a unified framework for software process modeling, enactment and evolution. The approach supports the customization/evolution of a process model and of its underlying meta-model. The process model and its meta-model are both described as specializations of kernel object classes using an object-oriented definition toolkit. Classes at one level become object instances at the upper level. The customization/evolution of models and meta-models is supported in a uniform way by creation/modification of kernel objects and by specialization of their classes. The overall approach is illustrated through a number of simple examples. Our definition toolkit has been written in Standard ML. This choice allows a precise semantics to be assigned to the various constructs using denotational semantics description techniques; at the same time executable prototypes of process-driven environments are produced from such descriptions.<>"
pub.1071882717,Context-Aware Business Process Versions Management,"<p>This work deals with a very active and promising research area that is the Business Process (BP) flexibility. One possible way to deal with this flexibility is the conjoint use of versioning and contextualization techniques. Versioning permits BP evolution by supporting the alternative use of BP versions. Contextualization ensures the definition of use conditions of BP versions to help the designer choosing a version among several ones. In a previous work, BP flexibility had been addressed using only versioning technique by considering the informational, organizational and process perspectives. In this work, the authors show how they conjointly use both versioning and contextualization techniques to address the BP flexibility. More precisely, they propose an extension of the VBP2M meta-model (Versioned Business Process Meta Model), introduced in their previous work, by adding a contextual perspective that offers two levels of contexts granularity (local and global). This perspective is illustrated using a well-known case study «automatic production process of mineral water bottle ». An extension of the VBPQL language (Versioned Business Process Query Language) is also introduced to allow the definition, manipulating and querying of BP versions' contexts. Furthermore, the authors propose an ontology-based method to select the appropriate BP version. Finally, they present our tool that represents the implementation of the proposed solution.</p>"
pub.1018991956,Iterative and Incremental Model Generation by Logic Solvers,"The generation of sample instance models of Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifications has become an active research line due to its increasing industrial relevance for engineering complex modeling tools by using large metamodels and complex well-formedness constraints. However, the synthesis of large, well-formed and realistic models is still a major challenge. In this paper, we propose an iterative process for generating valid instance models by calling existing logic solvers as black-box components using various approximations of metamodels and constraints to improve overall scalability. (1) First, we apply enhanced metamodel pruning and partial instance models to reduce the complexity of model generation subtasks and the retrieved partial solutions initiated in each step. (2) Then we propose an (over-)approximation technique for well-formedness constraints in order to interpret and evaluate them on partial (pruned) metamodels. (3) Finally, we define a workflow that incrementally generates a sequence of instance models by refining and extending partial models in multiple steps, where each step is an independent call to the underlying solver (the Alloy Analyzer in our experiments)."
pub.1119274984,Design Patterns for Description-Driven Systems,"In data modelling, product information has most often been handled separately
from process information. The integration of product and process models in a
unified data model could provide the means by which information could be shared
across an enterprise throughout the system lifecycle from design through to
production. Recently attempts have been made to integrate these two separate
views of systems through identifying common data models. This paper relates
description-driven systems to multi-layer architectures and reveals where
existing design patterns facilitate the integration of product and process
models and where patterns are missing or where existing patterns require
enrichment for this integration. It reports on the construction of a so-called
description-driven system which integrates Product Data Management (PDM) and
Workflow Management (WfM) data models through a common meta-model."
pub.1021440386,Efficient reliability analysis based on Bayesian framework under input variable and metamodel uncertainties,"In the reliability analysis, input variables as well as the metamodel uncertainties are often encountered in practice. The input uncertainty includes the statistical uncertainty of the distribution parameters due to the lack of knowledge or insufficient data. Metamodel uncertainty arises when the response function is approximated by a surrogate function using a finite number of responses to reduce the costly computations. In this study, a reliability analysis procedure is proposed based on a Bayesian framework that can incorporate these uncertainties in an integrated manner into the form of posterior PDF. The PDF, often expressed by arbitrary functions, is evaluated via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which is an efficient simulation method to draw random samples that follow the distribution. In order to avoid the nested computation in the full Bayesian approach, a posterior predictive approach is employed, which requires only a single loop of reliability analysis. Gaussian process model is employed for the metamodel. Mathematical and engineering examples are used to demonstrate the proposed method. In the results, comparing with the full Bayesian approach, the predictive approach provides much less information, i.e., only a point estimate of the probability. Nevertheless, the predictive approach adequately accounts for the uncertainties with much less computation, which is more advantageous in the design practice. The smaller the data are provided, the higher the statistical uncertainty, leading to the higher (or lower) failure probability (or reliability)."
pub.1151952709,Visualization of Digital-Enhanced Enterprise Modeling,"Since the METI of Japanese Government has published the Digital Transformation (DX) report in 2018, DX is now widely attracted in Japan. Although the DX report provided guidelines to promote DX, it just generally explained DX policies. In this chapter, we describe a visualization approach to promote DX by using ArchiMate which is a widely known Enterprise Architecture modeling language. The proposed approach derives value analysis, business model, and business process diagrams from the DX promotion index description which is also published to evaluate the DX provision state of enterprises by METI in 2019. In this chapter, a meta model for describing value analysis, business model and business process is introduced. Then, visualization patterns using ArchiMate are shown using the meta model. An Application example is also explained for the DX in the healthcare domain. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed visualization approach based on the application and related work."
pub.1126666449,Combining Domain Ontologies and BPMN Models at the CIM Level to generate IFML Models," The use of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has been widely adopted by several research studies as one of the standard metamodels dedicated to the representation and design of business processes at the CIM level of MDA-oriented approaches. However, all of these researches don’t include semantic data that accompanies business processes in the early stages of software development. Thus, the involvement of domain ontologies in this software development phase is key for a complete representation of the CIM level. This article presents a new modeling approach based on a model-driven development process, starting with the representation of BPMN and ODM models as CIM Models, then transforming them into an IFML diagram by applying a transformation engine. We can obtain easily a final code from the abstract model generated. A case study illustrates our approach. It represents a scenario of managing medications of an eHealth information system."
pub.1095377366,OWL model to support business process and web services in SOA Environments,"With the emergence of SOA (service oriented architecture), a business process can be realized as a Web service. A business process can be viewed as a requirement phase artifact and Web service can be viewed as a development phase artifact. By reducing the gap between a business process and Web service, we can extend the reusability, flexibility, and pursued business agility. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an ontology model for managing a business process and Web service effectively within a single meta-model. In addition, we propose an inference rule for the search and discovery of related Web services and business processes in our proposed ontology model. By using our proposed model, we can effectively manage business processes and Web services, decrease maintenance costs, and increase the productivity of system development process through the reuse of well organized business processes and related Web services."
pub.1149727624,A Process Warehouse for Process Variants Analysis,"Process model variants are collections of similar process models evolved over time because of the adjustments that were made to a particular process in a given domain, e.g., order-to-cash or procure-to-pay process in reseller or procurement domain. These adjustments produce some variations between these process models that mainly should be identical but may differ slightly. Existing approaches related to data warehouse solutions suffer from adequately abstracting and consolidating all variants into one generic process model, to provide the possibility to distinguish and compare among different parts of different variants. This shortcoming affects decision making of business analysts for a specific process context. This paper addresses the above shortcoming by proposing a framework to analyse process variants.The framework consists of two original contributions: (i) a novel meta-model of processes as a generic data model to capture and consolidate process variants into a reference process model; (ii) a process warehouse model to perform typical online analytical processing operations on different variation parts thus providing support to decision-making through KPIs; The framework concepts were defined and validated using a real-life case study."
pub.1008600768,Workflow View Driven Cross-Organizational Interoperability in a Web-Service Environment,"In an E-service environment, workflow involves not only a single organization but also a number of business partners. Therefore, workflow interoperability in such an environment is an important issue for enacting workflows. In this paper, we introduce our approach of using workflow views as a fundamental support for E-service workflow interoperability and for controlled (sub-) workflows visibility to external parties. We present a meta-model of workflow views and their semantics with example usage. We develop an interoperation model based on workflow views, with a supply-chain E-service cross-organization workflow example. We also propose an implementation of workflow view and cross-organizational interoperability based on contemporary Web service [14] technology, with respect to our E-ADOME workflow engine."

As systematic approach to handling identified risks is crucial to achieving success by the organization, modern business modeling standards and techniques are supposed to take risk-related features into account. The article is devoted to elaborating and exemplifying an extension aimed at risk handling for OMG’s Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), one of the most prospective standards for business process modeling. After an introduction, key risk management concepts are discussed. Section 3 discusses extensions introduced within BPMN meta-model, while section 4 exemplifies proposed concepts. The article is concluded with a summary."
pub.1093197094,"Introducing VIP Business Modeling Framework for Innovative, Information-Rich and Process-Aware E-Commerce Web Applications","Current web application modeling approaches lack certain key aspects. Firstly, these approaches do not incorporate value-based requirement engineering as an integral part. Secondly, these approaches typically provide modeling of information aspects at the system design level; however, there is a need to model information at the level of understanding business needs while carrying out analysis. Thirdly, today's ‘information-rich’ and ‘functionally-complex’ web applications necessitate merging both of these aspects; hence as one of the available options, the business information models may be merged to business process models. In this paper, we propose a framework-VIP Business Modeling Framework, incorporating all the above mentioned aspects, during analysis phase, using three different models. First, we emphasize the need for the proposed framework, and then present the related modeling concepts with the help of metamodels. Moreover, we very briefly outline the idea of developing these models with the help of an example."

In this paper, a multiple response model is developed to jointly model the quantile with a correlated and less-noisy expectation to improve the fit and predictions from the quantile metamodel. We first extend the standard stochastic Gaussian process model to the multi-response case and then use a simple $m$-design-point example to analytically study the benefits of the joint model over the single model. Several other numerical experiments are also conducted, and the results show that the joint model can provide better performance and thus improve quantile predictions."
pub.1106195053,A model‐based solution for process modeling in practice environments: PLM4BS,"Abstract  Today's world economic situation is ruled by issues such as reducing cost, improving quality, maximizing profit, and improving and optimizing processes at organizations. In this context, business process management can be an essential strategy, but it is not usually consolidated at software organizations because software process properties involve a complex business process management application on software lifecycle. Consequently, software organizations often focus on Software Process Modeling (SPM), and each involved role performs process execution and orchestration independently and manually. This fact makes software processes maintenance, monitoring, and measurement become difficult tasks. This paper proposes a model‐based approach for SPM taking into account concepts related to process execution, orchestration, and monitoring. It is framed into a model‐driven engineering‐based and tool‐based framework: Process Lifecycle Management for Business Software (PLM 4 BS). We present a SPM metamodel and its concrete syntax (through Unified Modeling Language profiles) that lays the foundation for extending PLM 4 BS. Its underlying metamodel allows managing processes automatically. Furthermore, PLM 4 BS improves current state‐of‐the‐art proposals in 6 dimensions: expressiveness, understandability, granularity, measurability, orchestrability, and business variables and rules. Also, PLM 4 BS has been evaluated in a multiple‐case study, in which the 6 mentioned dimensions were already validated. "
pub.1093713658,VLab-CC: A Generic Framework of Virtual Laboratory Based on Component Composition,"A generic framework of virtual laboratory based on component composition technique called VLab-CC was presented, mainly aimed at the flexibility and interoperability of laboratory system. In VLab-CC, the laboratory resources would be encapsulated into standardized page components or function components. These components facilitated resource share and system reconfiguration. An experiment meta-model (EM-Model) was put forward, in which experiment application available to learners was assembled with components. VLab-CC was designed to implement EM-Model by mapping it to workflow process meta-model of WfMC. An experiment application could be defined as workflow process, and was able to be created or modified easily at run time by using visual workflow modeling tool. Driven by the workflow engine, connector component invoked deferent function components for page components dynamically. So the separation of representation layer and logic layer of experiment application came true. Finally, an Operating System virtual laboratory was developed on the basis of VLab-CC."
pub.1151492727,Thermal Model Simplification of Mobile Device with Adaptive Metamodel of Optimal Prognosis (AMOP),"The effective performance of system on chip (SOC) is tightly coupled with transient thermal behavior. To consider multiple design parameters in the limited development time budget, a simple and accurate thermal model is required. Conventional workflow is inefficient to develop equivalent simple set models and tune the thermal properties with trial and error. We introduce the workflow to develop a simplified thermal model using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver driven by process integration and design optimization (PIDO) platform. The process contains design of experiment (DOE), sensitive analysis, advanced metamodel of optimal prognosis (AMOP), evolution algorithm (EA), and optimization. Smartphone model with application processor (AP) was used for a proof of concept. By using the AMOP + EA approach, a simple thermal model was developed successfully within acceptable error. To verify the benefit of this method, the best simple model from optimization tool and full set model were compared for two different types of AP packages, package on package (POP) and single chip package (SCP)."
pub.1105195644,Business Process Variability and Public Values,"A business process is a structure of inter-related activities that are executed in order to achieve a specific business objective. Organizations often maintain multiple variants of a given business process because of changing conditions, different regulations in different countries, or other contextual factors. We aim at specifying the relationship between a generic business process and its different variants, taking the perspective of public values, such as privacy, accountability, and transparency. The business process variants in turn may be a basis for software specifications – in this, business processes would be bridging between societal demands (possibly concerning public values) and the corresponding technical (software) functionalities. Our contribution is featuring a meta-model that describes business processes on a value-independent level; they can be extended towards value-specific business process variants that can be related in turn to software architectures. We reflect this in proposed value operationalization guidelines, using concepts from business process design as a basis; those guidelines assume coming firstly through technology-independent artefacts and secondly – through technology-specific artefacts, to arrive at software specifications that are adequate with regard to public-values-related demands."
pub.1113943009,Viewpoint-specific Model-driven Microservice Development with Interlinked Modeling Languages,"Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel approach to the development and deployment of distributed, service-oriented software architectures. To this end, MSA puts a strong emphasis on service-specific independence regarding functional, technological, and organizational aspects. Based on that independence, MSA fosters the adoption of agile and DevOps-based development practices. On the other hand, Model-driven Development (MDD) is a software engineering approach that abstracts a software's design leveraging models. In particular, the development of complex, distributed software architectures is considered to benefit from MDD techniques like dedicated modeling languages, model validation, and model transformation. In this paper, we present an approach to employ MDD for MSA engineering. Therefore, we introduce a set of modeling languages for a model-driven workflow of microservice development in distributed, DevOps-based teams. The workflow considers the different DevOps roles of the teams' members on the basis of dedicated modeling viewpoints. Each modeling viewpoint clusters the modeling concerns of a certain DevOps role and is captured in its own metamodel. Starting from the metamodels, a set of modeling languages is derived to practically enable team members to construct models for their specific viewpoint on the microservice architecture. To foster the collaboration among team members of different DevOps roles, the metamodels and hence the modeling languages are interlinked. This interlinkage enables model reuse across viewpoints and subsequent composition of comprehensive architectural models of MSA-based software systems."
pub.1150793573,A Data-Centric Approach to Design Resilient-Aware Process Models in BPMN,"The widespread diffusion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies is prompting organizations to rethink their business processes (BPs) towards incorporating the data collected from IoT devices directly into BP models for improved effectiveness and timely decision making. Nonetheless, IoT devices are prone to failure due to their limitations in terms of computational power and energy autonomy, leading to compromise the availability and quality of the collected data, with the risk to prevent the correct execution of the entire BP. To mitigate this issue, resilience is a feature that any data-aware BP should support at design-time, by focusing on the role of available - as an alternative to unreliable - data as a resource for increasing BP robustness to failures. In this paper, we formalize an approach for designing and evaluating resilient-aware BP models in BPMN (Business Process Modeling and Notation) through a maturity model that takes into account their degree of awareness through levels of resilience, which can be computed using the provided formalization. In addition, we show how to extend the metamodel of BPMN 2.0 to address the proposed resiliency levels, and we investigate the feasibility of the approach through a user evaluation."

pub.1016150694,Semi-formal transformation of secure business processes into analysis class and use case models: An MDA approach,"ContextModel-Driven Development (MDD) is an alternative approach for information systems development. The basic underlying concept of this approach is the definition of abstract models that can be transformed to obtain models near implementation. One fairly widespread proposal in this sphere is that of Model Driven Architecture (MDA). Business process models are abstract models which additionally contain key information about the tasks that are being carried out to achieve the company’s goals, and two notations currently exist for modelling business processes: the Unified Modelling Language (UML), through activity diagrams, and the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN).ObjectiveOur research is particularly focused on security requirements, in such a way that security is modelled along with the other aspects that are included in a business process. To this end, in earlier works we have defined a metamodel called secure business process (SBP), which may assist in the process of developing software as a source of highly valuable requirements (including very abstract security requirements), which are transformed into models with a lower abstraction level, such as analysis class diagrams and use case diagrams through the approach presented in this paper.MethodWe have defined all the transformation rules necessary to obtain analysis class diagrams and use case diagrams from SBP, and refined them through the characteristic iterative process of the action-research method.ResultsWe have obtained a set of rules and a checklist that make it possible to automatically obtain a set of UML analysis classes and use cases, starting from SBP models. Our approach has additionally been applied in a real environment in the area of the payment of electrical energy consumption.ConclusionsThe application of our proposal shows that our semi-automatic process can be used to obtain a set of useful artifacts for software development processes."
pub.1054632174,Estimation of input parameters in complex simulation using a Gaussian process metamodel," The unknown input parameters of a simulation code are usually adjusted by the nonlinear least squares estimation (NLSE) method which minimizes the sum of differences between computer responses and real observations. However, when a simulation program is very complex and takes several hours for one execution, the NLSE method may not be computationally feasible. In this case, one may build a statistical metamodel which approximates the complex simulation code. Then this metamodel is used as if it is the true simulation code in the NLSE method, which makes the problem computationally feasible. This ‘approximated’ NLSE method is described in this article. A Gaussian process model is used as a metamodel of complex simulation code. The proposed method is validated through a toy-model study where the true parameters are known a priori. An application to nuclear fusion device is presented."

pub.1094544937,A novel approach to process mining: Intentional process models discovery,"So far, process mining techniques have suggested to model processes in terms of tasks that occur during the enactment of a process. However, research on method engineering and guidance has illustrated that many issues, such as lack of flexibility or adaptation, are solved more effectively when intentions are explicitly specified. This paper presents a novel approach of process mining, called Map Miner Method (MMM). This method is designed to automate the construction of intentional process models from process logs. MMM uses Hidden Markov Models to model the relationship between users' activities logs and the strategies to fulfill their intentions. The method also includes two specific algorithms developed to infer users' intentions and construct intentional process model (Map) respectively. MMM can construct Map process models with different levels of abstraction (fine-grained and coarse-grained process models) with respect to the Map metamodel formalism (i.e., metamodel that specifies intentions and strategies of process actors). This paper presents all steps toward the construction of Map process models topology. The entire method is applied on a large-scale case study (Eclipse UDC) to mine the associated intentional process. The likelihood of the obtained process model shows a satisfying efficiency for the proposed method."
pub.1094125655,Method Architecture For Situational Method Engineering,"Situational method engineering can be done using either method module based or Intention-Architecture, MIA, based approaches. The latter is organized in the three stages of requirements, design, and construction engineering. We focus here on elaborating the relationship between design and construction engineering of the MIA approach. The key concept in design engineering is that of method architecture. We define method architecture as an abstraction of the common properties of methods and propose a method architecture meta-model. At the construction engineering level, we represent a method as a method organisation. Method architecture can be implemented as one or more method organisations. We show that the MIA based approach is generic and can be used to engineer Information Systems Development Methods as well as Business Process Models."

Such e-services typically require collaborative enactment of workflows across multiple organizations. In this paper, we propose the use of workflow views as a fundamental support mechanism for the interoperability of multiple workflows across business organizations. We present a meta-model of workflow views and their semantics using a cross-organization workflow example based on a supply-chain e-service. We also formulate an interoperation model of workflow views and its consistency criteria. Finally, this paper presents an implementation of the model based on XML and contemporary Web services technologies, with adaptation to our E-ADOME workflow engine."
pub.1119428108,Semantics of UML 2.0 Activity Diagram for Business Modeling by Means of Virtual Machine,"The paper proposes a more formalized definition of UML 2.0 Activity Diagram
semantics. A subset of activity diagram constructs relevant for business
process modeling is considered. The semantics definition is based on the
original token flow methodology, but a more constructive approach is used. The
Activity Diagram Virtual machine is defined by means of a metamodel, with
operations defined by a mix of pseudocode and OCL pre- and postconditions. A
formal procedure is described which builds the virtual machine for any activity
diagram. The relatively complicated original token movement rules in control
nodes and edges are combined into paths from an action to action. A new
approach is the use of different (push and pull) engines, which move tokens
along the paths. Pull engines are used for paths containing join nodes, where
the movement of several tokens must be coordinated. The proposed virtual
machine approach makes the activity semantics definition more transparent where
the token movement can be easily traced. However, the main benefit of the
approach is the possibility to use the defined virtual machine as a basis for
UML activity diagram based workflow or simulation engine."

Almost no program code has to be written by business process designers for defining the possible order of activities. For another important aspect of business processes – assigning actors to activities – no such simple and standardized way of modelling exists. This causes problems at business process implementation projects in practice. We explain such aspects and shortcomings of current commercial PMS that lead to these problems.

First, it defends that versions are an interesting solution to deal with both a priori (when designing BPs) and a posteriori (when executing BPs) flexibility. It also explains why previous contributions about versions of BPs are incomplete, and need to be revisited. Then, the paper presents a meta-model for BP versions, which combines five perspectives -the functional, process, informational, organizational and operation perspectives- for BP modelling, and which allows a comprehensive description of versionalized BPs."
pub.1146588473,Patterns for Improving Business Processes: Defined Pattern Categorization,"Business process improvement (BPI) is a theme that is widely studied in business process management. It permits the continuous improvement of a process by considering the impact of changes on its performance. One of the most highly cited solutions for BPI is the use of patterns: they allow presenting a set of reusable models aiming to transform the as-is model into an improved model. Our research work is devoted to the act of improvement of business processes. More precisely, we aim to put forward an approach for BPI based on a set of improvement patterns, classified according to their application context. The purpose of this paper is to present our proposed pattern categories by detailing the structure of two types of patterns and demonstrating the way a selected pattern in one of these categories would be applied. The definition of these patterns was primarily based on a pattern meta-model describing the structure of BPI patterns. It was defined in our previous research work where we identified a general meta-model and four specific pattern models applicable to specific contexts. To validate their usefulness, we choose to apply the proposed approach to the process of examining patients in an emergency service."
pub.1047788855,Design patterns for description-driven systems in High Energy Physics,"In data modeling, product information has most often been handled separately from process information. The integration of product and process models in a unified data model could provide the means by which information could be shared between High Energy Physics (HEP) groups throughout the system lifecycle from design through to production. Recently attempts have been made to integrate these two separate views of systems through identifying common data models. This paper relates description-driven systems to multi-layer architectures through the CRISTAL project and reveals where existing design patterns facilitate the integration of product and process models, where patterns are missing or require enrichment for integration. It reports on the construction of a so-called description-driven system which integrates Product Data Management (PDM) and Workflow Management (WfM) models through a common meta-model."
pub.1039858587,vBPMN: Event-Aware Workflow Variants by Weaving BPMN2 and Business Rules,"When workflows are modeled for practical use, workflow variants often have to be considered to fit dynamically changing context factors. If there is a rich workflow context with a large value space, contemporary BPM solutions lack the support for on-the-fly generated variants, requiring explicit one-by-one modeling instead. Researchers have recognized the value of business rules for variant and adaptation support. However, there is still a need for dedicated standards-based constructs for context-dependent event- and exception-handling. Motivated by a realistic example, we therefore foster a framework for the combined use of business rules with a BPMN adaptation pattern catalogue. As the core contribution of this work, we substantiate our framework with a metamodel called vBPMN, which is weaved from BPMN2 and the R2ML rule language and allows for the convenient definition of variant models."
pub.1040341536,Towards the Harmonisation of UML and SDL,"UML and SDL are languages for the development of software systems that have different origins, and have evolved separately for many years. Recently, it can be observed that OMG and ITU, the standardisation bodies responsible for UML and SDL, respectively, are making efforts to harmonise these languages. So far, harmonisation takes place mainly on a conceptual level, by extending and aligning the set of language concepts. In this paper, we argue that harmonisation of languages can be approached both from a syntactic and semantic perspective. We show how a common basis can be derived from the analysis of the UML meta-model and the SDL abstract grammar. For this purpose, conceptually sound and well-founded mappings from meta-models to abstract grammars and vice versa are defined and applied. The long term objective is the syntactic and semantic integration of UML and SDL. The key to achieving this objective is a common language core, which can then be extended in different ways to cover further, more specific language concepts, and is sufficiently flexible to support future language add-ins."

Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Functions, Gaussian Process and Nonlinear regression are used to build metamodels. The examples used showcase a broad range of industrial applications in aircraft engines and gas turbines. Although Radial Basis Functions and Gaussian Process models are robust for small data sets, their high computational cost for large datasets reduces their practical application.

Recently they have made increasing although informal use of UML to metamodel and hence to clarify the concepts involved. However, the relationships between those concepts (for example, positioning the modelling constructs within a framework) have not been defined to the degree of precision required. This paper describes an approach as a work-in-progress, which proposes to use metamodelling to ground the concepts within the framework, and so to resolve difficult issues such as federated views on an enterprise model.

The method allows graphical and executable language models. These models are easy to read by humans and are formal enough to be processed in a generic model interpreter.

We argue that for prototyping a DSML on the platform independent level, its semantics should not only be described in a transformational but also in an operational fashion. For this, we use standard modelling means, i.e. MOF and QVT Relations. We combine operational semantics descriptions with existing metamodel-based editor creation technology. This allows for cheap prototyping of visual interpreters and debuggers. We exemplify our approach with a language for Petri nets and assess the manual work necessary. Finally, we present EProvide, an implementation of our approach based on the Eclipse platform, and we identify missing features in the Eclipse tools we used."
pub.1116623325,System of Systems Process Model,"For lifecycle work on systems of systems, use of the traditional systems engineering process models seriously underestimates the adequacy and sequencing for proper inputs of artifacts from constituent systems. The result is a broad mix of unpredicted and undesirable simple, weak, strong, and spooky emergents. While the current use of process models ignores the requirement for emergent properties from interplay of conjoined yet opposed factors from the domains that constituent systems and system of systems artifacts, the situation of uncontrolled emergents is aggravated by the lack of proper sequencing of domain traits and attributes. This research fills the gap between misuses of systems engineering process models and metamodel-based systems of systems structuring of artifacts to meliorate traditional systems engineering process models so they can be used validly. Emergents can then be predicted, managed, and properly dealt with using standard systems engineering methods when a formal metamodel of system of systems activities and its artifacts are incorporated into standard systems engineering process models. This chapter introduces a metaprocess model for developing, enhancing, and sustaining lifecycles of complex systems of systems. This metamodel is a heterarchical conglomerate of domains of artifacts for constituent systems and corresponding domains of artifacts for the system of systems. The chapter presents an ontological framework premised on a physics-based model of emergence. It discusses a strict mathematical formulation following the formal logic of objects and processes laid down by Stanislaw Lesniewski. The chapter deals with a physics-based model of emergence and then incorporates emergence in the lifecycle of a system of systems; followed by the strict conditions for aggregations of objects, process models, ontology, principles, and essential foundational definitions. It shows how to formalize the artifacts for the specific requirements. Intermingling artifacts from the constituent systems domain with those artifacts from the system of systems domain without proper sequencing is akin to disruptive syntax that obscures or minimizes meaning."
pub.1068367734,INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL FEATURE,"The paper deals with creation of integrated information system architecture capable of supporting management decisions using behavioral features. The paper considers the architecture of information decision support system for production system management. The behavioral feature is given to an information system, and it ensures extraction, processing of information, management decision-making with both automated and automatic modes of decision-making subsystem being permitted. Practical implementation of information system with behavior is based on service-oriented architecture: there is a set of independent services in the information system that provides data of its subsystems or data processing by separate application under the chosen variant of the problematic situation settlement. For creation of integrated information system with behavior we propose architecture including the following subsystems: data bus, subsystem for interaction with the integrated applications based on metadata, business process management subsystem, subsystem for the current state analysis of the enterprise and management decision-making, behavior training subsystem. For each problematic situation a separate logical layer service is created in Unified Service Bus handling problematic situations. This architecture reduces system information complexity due to the fact that with a constant amount of system elements the number of links decreases, since each layer provides communication center of responsibility for the resource with the services of corresponding applications. If a similar problematic situation occurs, its resolution is automatically removed from problem situation metamodel repository and business process metamodel of its settlement. In the business process performance commands are generated to the corresponding centers of responsibility to settle a problematic situation. "
pub.1181359842,Automated workflow generation supporting the value stream design of reconfigurable robot assembly cells,"The paper addresses the automated generation of value stream optimized assembly workflows for reconfigurable robot cells. The focus is on the generation of asynchronous concurrent action workflows from assembly task descriptions. The main motivation is to enable automated search for optimized solutions within the enormous design spaces of these systems which results from their structural and procedural configurability. The proposed approach conducts task assignment, task sequencing and logical task planning (AI Planning) for multiple agents. The approach combines existing methods from the distinct research fields of robot task sequencing and discrete task planning. The contribution of the research is twofold. Firstly, the paper proposes a generic domain meta model enabling automated workflow generation for multi-agent assembly tasks. Secondly, a workflow generation approach based on artificial intelligence planning combined with the game-theoretic concept of extensive form games is presented. The approach iteratively generates a cooperative strategy for acting agents which is subsequently optimized in terms of individual strategies. The obtained logical action plans are further transformed into parametric concurrent action schedules to support downstream design activities. Both the meta model and the workflow generation approach are applied in a case study and provide valuable information on achievable assembly speedup."

How-ever, the resulting models are complex and can often not be communicated successfully to the organizational stakeholders. Similarly, assessment methods rely strongly on the expertise of the assessors translating their perception of an organization into an assessment outcome. These assessments often carry a subjective component and are hard to compare. Moreover, they lack efficient traceability mechanisms as organizations evolve. Additionally, mainstream methods such as ISO 15504 and SCAMPI are complex, expensive and resource demanding, which place them out of reach for many organizations. This paper describes a research approach that builds on Enterprise Architecture models and IT Governance frameworks to guide the definition of a simple process metamodel for maturity assessment. This simple meta-model is used to create an intermediary representation that can be communicated to stakeholders. A formal expression of maturity conditions in SPARQL queries increases the objectivity of the assessment and separates it from the collected and formalized evidence. We discuss our model and method and report on a preliminary case study."
pub.1119335943,Calculations of Sobol indices for the Gaussian process metamodel,"Global sensitivity analysis of complex numerical models can be performed by
calculating variance-based importance measures of the input variables, such as
the Sobol indices. However, these techniques, requiring a large number of model
evaluations, are often unacceptable for time expensive computer codes. A well
known and widely used decision consists in replacing the computer code by a
metamodel, predicting the model responses with a negligible computation time
and rending straightforward the estimation of Sobol indices. In this paper, we
discuss about the Gaussian process model which gives analytical expressions of
Sobol indices. Two approaches are studied to compute the Sobol indices: the
first based on the predictor of the Gaussian process model and the second based
on the global stochastic process model. Comparisons between the two estimates,
made on analytical examples, show the superiority of the second approach in
terms of convergence and robustness. Moreover, the second approach allows to
integrate the modeling error of the Gaussian process model by directly giving
some confidence intervals on the Sobol indices. These techniques are finally
applied to a real case of hydrogeological modeling."
pub.1045822456,A process for continuous validation of self-adapting component based systems,"In this paper we propose an approach to integrate the use of time-related stochastic properties in a continuous design process based on models at runtime. Time-related specification of services are an important aspect of component-based architectures, for instance in distributed, volatile networks of computation nodes. The models at runtime approach eases the management of such architectures by maintaining abstract models of architectures synchronized with the physical, distributed execution platform. For self-adapting systems, prediction of delays and throughput of a component assembly is of utmost importance to take adaptation decision and accept evolutions that conform to time specifications. To this aim we define a metamodel extension based on stochastic Petri nets as an internal time model for prediction. We design a library of patterns to ease the specification and prediction of common time properties of models at runtime and make the synchronization of behaviors and structural changes easier. Our prediction engine is fast enough to perform prediction at runtime in a realistic setting and validate models at runtime."
pub.1032890077,Unsupervised discovery of intentional process models from event logs,"Research on guidance and method engineering has highlighted that many method engineering issues, such as lack of flexibility or adaptation, are solved more effectively when intentions are explicitly specified. However, software engineering process models are most often described in terms of sequences of activities. This paper presents a novel approach, so-called Map Miner Method (MMM), designed to automate the construction of intentional process models from process logs. To do so, MMM uses Hidden Markov Models to model users' activities logs in terms of users' strategies. MMM also infers users' intentions and constructs fine-grained and coarse-grained intentional process models with respect to the Map metamodel syntax (i.e., metamodel that specifies intentions and strategies of process actors). These models are obtained by optimizing a new precision-fitness metric. The result is a software engineering method process specification aligned with state of the art of method engineering approaches. As a case study, the MMM is used to mine the intentional process associated to the Eclipse platform usage. Observations show that the obtained intentional process model offers a new understanding of software processes, and could readily be used for recommender systems."
pub.1072080931,Knowledge Management Model Definition Language and its Application,"Knowledge management modeling is foundation of knowledge management practice. Previous work of knowledge management modeling is mainly about concept architecture. Its tools and methods are not strong. This paper suggested a new knowledge management meta-model based on the analyzing and integration of knowledge management model. The core of the meta-model includes organizational structure, business process, resource and knowledge. A knowledge management definition language (KMDL) is proposed, which defines a least set of knowledge management modeling components and properties. It also offers a shareable exchange format in common sense. Based on the meta-model and KMDL, we developed a knowledge management modeling tool."
pub.1136514920,A Design Process Model With Multiple Design Object Models,"Abstract
                  An intelligent CAD system is not merely a set of intelligent design tools, but rather it must be an intelligent, integrated design environment. This requests it must be equipped with a large scale knowledge base in which design knowledge is intensively and systematically stored. To do so, design knowledge must be systematically formalized, made computable, and organized. The present paper investigates fundamental issues of systematization of design knowledge. Design knowledge has two categories; i.e., design object knowledge and design process knowledge. In our previous reports, we have formalized a computable design process model to represent design process knowledge and the concept of metamodel dealing with multiple design object models. This paper proposes a framework to achieve harmonized combination of these two. In this framework, the computable design process model navigates the metamodel mechanism to generate and modify models of the design object. We describe a prototype system and illustrate an example of ship design."
pub.1072435572,Managing Functional Safety Processes for Automotive E/E Architectures in Integrated Model-Based Development Environments,"The international standard ISO 26262 for functional safety of road vehicles claims processes and requirements for the entire product lifecycle of automotive electric and electronic systems. The demanded activities and work products within the standard are highly interconnected. Additionally, references to exemplarily external quality management standards or commonly recognized industry sources are given. Therefore, the application of functional safety processes in distributed development is challenging regarding description, understanding, analysis and planning of processes. To overcome these inconveniences, we provide a meta model extension for model-based architecture description languages regarding process description, organizational structures and resource assignment. This is related to the established “Business Process Model and Notation” (BPMN) according to ISO/IEC 19510:2013. Our integration in a domain specific environment for large-scaled electric and electronic (E/E) architectures provides graphical modeling of processes. The process model artifacts can be linked to data model artifacts of the E/E architecture. Additionally, analysis and planning based on the process model is supported. As a research case study this was applied to the functional safety processes described in ISO 26262."
pub.1153291562,Metamodel-based Design and Optimization of a Spoke-Type Interior Permanent Magnet Machine for a Vehicle Traction Application,"Interior permanent magnet machines are a popular solution for traction applications. Within the frame of this paper, an air-cooled spoke interior permanent magnet machine is designed and optimized with respect to the maximum average torque and minimum magnet mass. Several performance constraints, such as the permissible torque ripple and the relative thermal loading, have been considered in the design workflow. A metamodel, (or surrogate model) optimization is utilized with the help of Ansys OptiSLang tool. Within an initial sensitivity study, the metamodel predicts the optimal design space which shortens the cumulative optimization time from typical 1-2 weeks to approximately one day. It is shown that this simplification marginally reduces the solution accuracy (±4 %). The obtained Pareto front is verified using the finite element analysis through Ansys Motor-CAD proving that the selected optimized design meets all set requirements. The novelty of the proposed design is reflected in the combination of pole shaping strategy and rotor mass minimization by implementation of inter pole holes."

pub.1062959503,ACTIVITY BASED CIM MODELING AND TRANSFORMATION FOR BUSINESS PROCESS SYSTEMS,"Computation-Independent Model (CIM) to capture domain requirements and the transformation from CIM to the Platform-Independent Model (PIM) are two crucial parts of the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). This paper presents an ontology-activity-based CIM modeling approach to achieve a semi-automatic transformation from CIM to PIM. It proposes that the key elements in business process modeling are activities and these should therefore form the basis in constructing the domain ontology. Aiming to provide the key description capability for the process model, it discusses the hierarchy of the model by adding an activity dimension between the object and process tiers. It also proposes a model-relevance-calculation-based method for extracting ontology activities from the process meta-models. Based on the presented model acquisition method, a decomposition approach is proposed to simplify the complexity of the transformation relationships between the CIM and PIM by introducing the concepts of ontology activities. A general framework surrounding the transformation from CIM to PIM is discussed. It uses the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to describe the ontology activity and considers the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to be the PIM."

In this paper, we show that efficient composition of system specifications (which, in our case, are expressed as models) is also possible using (i) a domain-specific workflow model that guides the composition and (ii) a set of domain-specific templates for model transformations. We illustrate the entire approach on a product line for versioning systems, define a metamodel for workflow models and postulate a measure for estimating the benefits of the proposed approach."
pub.1093338682,Comparing models of computation,"We give a denotational framework (a meta model) within which certain properties of models of computation can be understood and compared. It describes concurrent processes as sets of possible behaviors. Compositions of processes are given as intersections of their behaviors. The interaction between processes is through signals, which are collections of events. Each event is a value-tag pair, where the tags can come from a partially ordered or totally ordered set. Timed models are where the set of tags is totally ordered. Synchronous events share the same tag, and synchronous signals contain events with the same set of tags. Synchronous systems contain synchronous signals. Strict causality (in timed systems) and continuity (in untimed systems) ensure determinacy under certain technical conditions. The framework is used to compare certain essential features of various models of computation, including Kahn process networks, dataflow, sequential processes, concurrent sequential processes with rendezvous, Petri nets, and discrete-event systems."
pub.1113143756,Toward Adapting Metamodeling Approach for Legacy to Cloud Migration,"Migration of legacy application to Cloud is a fast-growing area of knowledge. Many IT-based organizations inclined toward empowering their legacy application with cloud computing capabilities. Many researchers, academicians, national, and international bodies are creating knowledge models to allow knowledge sharing and provide effective cloud migration model. This knowledge is scattered and huge, but lack of knowledge management. Our motive is to produce a metamodel, which could be able to generalize the cloud migration domain. Metamodel approach is an approach, to gather all domain concepts and their relationships. Using the metamodel, variety of domain solution models can be built. It can act as a language infrastructure which unifies describing the process model of moving legacy enterprise applications to the cloud environments. The benefits of the metamodel include simplifying the migration process, guidance, reuse specialized migration knowledge and support training and knowledge management activities. Furthermore, it reduces complexity and ambiguity in cloud migration domain."
pub.1166063084,Scalable simulation-based inference for implicitly defined models using a metamodel for Monte Carlo log-likelihood estimator,"Models implicitly defined through a random simulator of a process have become
widely used in scientific and industrial applications in recent years. However,
simulation-based inference methods for such implicit models, like approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC), often scale poorly as data size increases. We
develop a scalable inference method for implicitly defined models using a
metamodel for the Monte Carlo log-likelihood estimator derived from
simulations. This metamodel characterizes both statistical and simulation-based
randomness in the distribution of the log-likelihood estimator across different
parameter values. Our metamodel-based method quantifies uncertainty in
parameter estimation in a principled manner, leveraging the local asymptotic
normality of the mean function of the log-likelihood estimator. We apply this
method to construct accurate confidence intervals for parameters of partially
observed Markov process models where the Monte Carlo log-likelihood estimator
is obtained using the bootstrap particle filter. We numerically demonstrate
that our method enables accurate and highly scalable parameter inference across
several examples, including a mechanistic compartment model for infectious
diseases."

Current research lacks the optimization design method about them. To solve this problem. Firstly, this paper analyzed the data meta-models related to operational activities, proposed the process of optimal design of the operational activities and processes. Secondly, the objective function of the optimization of operational activities and processes are studied considering the time, success rate and cost. Thirdly, the process of simulation evaluation of operational activities and processes is designed, then we propose the method of how to convert activity-related architecture data into object Petri-net simulation model. Finally, three means of improving the operational activities and processes are given to arrive the optimal design objectives."
pub.1044729327,HOLON-ORIENTED B2M PROCESS MODELLING APPROACH FOR APPLICATIONS INTEROPERABILITY IN MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENT,"Enterprise-control system integration between business systems, manufacturing execution systems and shop-floor process-control systems remains a key issue for facilitating the deployment of plant-wide information-control systems. This integration leads to strengthen the paradigm of Business to Manufacturing (B2M) interoperability. However, this needs establishing standards and protocols for data exchange between different enterprise and manufacturing applications. Nevertheless, since there is no methodology for collecting data, exchanged information is generally incomplete. Business process modelling aims at specifying objects flows and processes inside an enterprise levels and among networked enterprises. However, the increased complexity of these models does not help at ensuring coherent relationships between its components. In this paper, we discuss a B2M Process Modelling approach for defining and building B2M process models, based on the concept of Holon. This approach aims at increasing the models abstraction in order to simplify its initial comprehensiveness, after while we draft the integration of a proposed Holon meta-model in existing methods for enterprise applications interoperability. Finally, an example is presented using the implementation of the meta-model in an enterprise modelling tool."
pub.1015011630,Patterns as an Artifact for Business Process Improvement - Insights from a Case Study,"Several approaches were developed for business process improvement (BPI) (e.g. Six Sigma). However, it is often stated that these approaches do not provide sufficient support for the performers of a BPI initiative, especially concerning the phase where applicable measures that provoke improvement (act of improvement) are needed. In this paper, we suggest BPI patterns as a means to directly support the act of improvement. Even though the common concept of patterns had great success in other domains of information systems (IS), the concept has not been transferred to BPI so far. In this paper, the demonstration of BPI patterns in a case study is focused. The BPI patterns, which represent the artifact in this design science research, are derived on the basis of a previously developed metamodel. The results from the demonstration were discussed with the process owners to get a first evaluation of the developed BPI patterns."
pub.1017334030,Identifying Variability in Process Performance Indicators,"The performance perspective of business processes is concerned with the definition of performance requirements usually specified as a set of Process Performance Indicators (PPIs). Like other business process perspectives such as control-flow or data, there are cases in which PPIs are subject to variability. However, although the modelling of business process variability (BPV) has evolved significantly, there are very few contributions addressing the variability in the performance perspective of business processes. Modelling PPI variants with tools and techniques non-suitable for variability may generate redundant models, thus making it difficult its maintenance and future adaptations, also increasing possibility of errors in its managing. In this paper we present different cases of PPI variability detected as result of the analysis of several processes where BPV is present. Based on an existent metamodel used for defining PPIs over BPs, we propose its formal extension that allows the definition of PPI variability according to the cases identified."

However, the limitations of its static descriptive form render it unable to support the further analysis for the dynamic behaves of complex integrated system. Therefore, an executable model is needed to fulfill the requirement of analysis, validation and evaluation. Aimed at creating an executable model that has complete bi-directional traceability between the static representations and the dynamic properties, a four-dimension modeling approach based on Meta Model Mapping (M3) is developed to support the derivation of a Hierarchical Colored Petri Nets (HCPN) model that can reveal the logical and behavioral characteristics of the system architecture from a set of DoDAF products. The semantic corresponding relations between DoDAF state transition description and HCPN occurrence graph are also explored, which is served as the basis of the model validation."

Traditional workflow modeling methods cannot express this kind of cooperation completely. Furthermore, current workflow systems lack adaptability and flexibility. Firstly, this paper made use of the basic cooperative unit and virtual cooperative unit to model cooperation within one organization or among organizations. Then, it used knowledge related to them to express the cooperation. After that, a collaborative process based on cooperative units meta-model was proposed. On the basis of the meta-model, a knowledge-based adaptive collaborative work system implementation framework was designed. In this framework, knowledge management for cooperative units was involved, which give collaborative process better adaptability and flexibility."

This work presents a complementary method that can assist in such situations. The proposed tool uses kriging metamodels to provide global multiparametric metamodels that approximate the optimal solutions as functions of the problem uncertain parameters. The method has been tested with two benchmark problems of different characteristics, and applied to a case study. The results show the high accuracy of the methodology to predict the multiparametric behavior of the optimal solution, high robustness to deal with different problem types using small number of data, and significant reduction in the solution procedure complexity in comparison with classical multiparametric programming approaches."

This work proposes to view a workflow as a set of cooperative and adaptive agents interleaving its design and its execution leading to an emergent workflow. We use the theory of Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) to provide agents with adaptive capabilities and the whole multi-agent system with emergent “feature”. We provide a meta-model linking workflow and AMAS concepts, and the specification of agent behavior and the resulting collaborations. A simulator has been implemented with the Make Agent Yourself platform."
pub.1125553140,Adaptive design of experiments for global Kriging metamodeling through cross-validation information,"This paper discusses a new sequential adaptive design of experiments (DoE) approach for global Kriging metamodeling applications. The sequential implementation is established by using the current metamodel, formulated based on the existing experiments, to guide the selection of the optimal new experiment(s). The score function, defining the DoE objective, combines two components: (1) the metamodel prediction variability, expressed through the predictive variance, and (2) the metamodel bias, approximated through the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) error. The latter is used as a weighting factor to extend traditional DoE approaches that focus solely on the metamodel prediction variability. Two such approaches are considered here, adopting either the integrated mean squared error or the maximum mean squared error as the basic component of the score function. The incorporation of bias information as weighting within these well-established approaches facilitates a direct extension of their respective computational workflows, making the proposed implementation attractive from computational perspective. An efficient optimization scheme for identification of the next experiment, as well as the balancing of exploration and exploitation between the two components of the score function, are also discussed. The incorporation of LOOCV weightings is shown to be highly beneficial in a total of six analytical and engineering examples. Furthermore, these examples demonstrate that for DoE approaches which use LOOCV information as weights, it is preferable to update the predictive variance to explicitly consider the impact of the new experiment, rather than relying strictly on the current metamodel variance."

However, until now there are few works focusing on its realization mechanism, i.e. the communication between views and their source entities. In this paper, we extend the object deputy model to the workflow deputy model supporting the interaction of workflow views in a systematic way. In this workflow deputy model, we formally specify the deputy class and the deputy algebra for workflow classes. According to the process meta-model of XPDL, deputy operations are defined for each kind of workflow component class specifically. Based on this deputy mechanism, workflow views are presented in forms of deputy classes. Lastly, several modeling issues are discussed."

Kriging (or the Gaussian process model) is a very popular metamodel form for deterministic and, recently, stochastic simulations. This article proposes a two-stage sequential framework for the optimization of stochastic simulations with heterogeneous variances under computing budget constraints. The proposed two-stage framework is based on the kriging model and incorporates optimal computing budget allocation techniques and the expected improvement function to drive and improve the estimation of the global optimum. Empirical results indicate that it is effective in obtaining optimal solutions and is more efficient than alternative metamodel-based techniques. The framework is also applied to a complex real ocean liner bunker fuel management problem with promising results."
pub.1000868200,Model Checking Healthcare Workflows Using Alloy,"Workflows are used to organize business processes, and workflow management tools are used to guide users in which order these processes should be performed. These tools increase organizational efficiency and enable users to focus on the tasks and activities rather than complex processes. Workflow models represent real life workflows and consist mainly of a graph-based structure where nodes represent tasks and arrows represent the flows between these tasks. From workflow models, one can use model transformations to generate workflow software. The correctness of the software is dependent on the correctness of the models, hence verification of the models against certain properties like termination, liveness and absence of deadlock are crucial in safety critical domains like healthcare. In previous works we presented a formal diagrammatic framework for workflow modelling and verification which uses principles from model-driven engineering. The framework uses a metamodelling approach for the specification of workflow models, and a transformation module which creates DiVinE code used for verification of model properties. In this paper, in order to improve the scalability and efficiency of the verification, we introduce a new encoding of the workflow models using the Alloy specification language, and we present a bounded verification approach for workflow models based on relational logic. We automatically translate the workflow metamodel into a model transformation specification in Alloy. Properties of the workflow can then be verified against the specification; especially, we can verify properties about loops. We use a running example to explain the metamodelling approach and the encoding to Alloy."
pub.1029114310,An Object-Oriented and Business Process-Based Meta Model of an Architecture for Management Support Systems,"The current enterprise environment is especially characterized by changes. Reasons are for example the constantly progressive change from supplier- to buyer-markets, the increasing internationalism of the markets and the distinct customers’ demands forcing the enterprises to an intensified market- and customer- orientation. As a consequence, the result from the economical activities of an enterprise depends more and more on its speed of response and its adaptability towards changing constraints - both internal and external. The enterprises come to meet this external change internally with more flexibility. A quick reaction and adaption towards changed constraints and a corresponding enterprise management require a permanent availability of complete, decision relevant and current information for the management. As a result, effective and efficient management support systems (MSS) especially supporting strategic decisions are called for by enterprises that want to retain their market position successfully.

pub.1042088275,Knowledge Engineering in Business Process Management,"Business Process Management (BPM) has become a commodity nowadays. It has undergone an evolution from the initial business process re-engineering in the 1980s to a well-established management approach, which is extensively discussed in this book (See introduction chapter of Harmon on the Scope and Evolution of Business Process Management). This chapter deals with the increasingly important domain of knowledge-sensitive BPM as a current challenge imposed from semantic web, the cloud, social networks or Web 2.0 not only to provide new technologies for BPM but also trigger a cultural change of people involved. Three aspects of knowledge sensitiveness in BPM are proposed. First, BPM can be seen as a domain itself focusing on BP-frameworks identifying basic concepts such as business model, domain, regulation, or model processing (See introduction chapters by Rosemann and vom Brocke on the Six Core Elements of BPM). Second, BPM needs to be applied using a management method such as the BPMS methodology. Third, BPM needs to be executed within an environment; hence, it is deployed. BPM can be seen as a basic concept for corporate knowledge leading to knowledge-sensitive BPM. Studying the knowledge-sensitiveness two forms of interpretation are distinguished: (1) knowledge engineering (KE) focusing on machine interpretable knowledge and (2) knowledge management (KM) relating to human interpretation of knowledge. In the following, the focus lies upon KE distinguishing three viewpoints: (a) KE is established in BP-frameworks as a realization within the used meta models for those frameworks; (b) knowledge-intensive actions within the BP method – which is typically performed by business process (BP) analysts – is supported by KE techniques; (c) deployment of BPM within a typical execution environment is likely including knowledge-based applications, hence those knowledge concepts need to be reflected. KE techniques are proposed for the areas above and empirical experiences as results of research projects are described. As a conclusion an outlook on the conceptual and technical integration summarizes the chapter."
pub.1089974659,Towards Extending Business Process Modeling Formalisms with Information and Knowledge Dimensions,"Abstract
Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs) modeling has become an effective way of managing and developing organization’s knowledge which needs to be capitalized. These processes are characterized by a high complexity and dynamism in their execution, high number of critical activities with intensive acquisition, sharing, storage and (re)use of very specific crucial knowledge, diversity of knowledge sources, and high degree of collaboration among experts. Hence, we propose a semantically rich conceptualization for describing an SBP organized in a generic Business Process Meta-model for Knowledge Identification (BPM4KI), in order to develop a rich and expressive representation of SBPs to identify and localize the crucial knowledge. BPM4KI covers all aspects of business process modeling: the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. This paper aims to introduce a more explicit border between information and knowledge concepts and dimensions which are relevant in SBP models, based on «core» domain ontologies."
pub.1095788665,Modeling Service Choreographies with Rule-enhanced Business Processes,"The research community has so far mainly focused on the problem of modeling of service orchestrations in the domain of service composition., while modeling of service choreographies has attracted less attention. The following challenges in choreography modeling are tackled in this paper: i) choreography models are not well-connected with the underlying business vocabulary models. ii) there is limited support for decoupling parts of business logic from complete choreography models. This reduces dynamic changes of choreographies; iii) choreography models contain redundant elements of shared business logic, which might lead to an inconsistent implementation and incompatible behavior. Our proposal- rBPMN - is an extension of a business process modeling language with rule and choreography modeling support. rBPMN is defined by weaving the metamodels of the Business Process Modeling Notation and REWERSE Rule Markup Language. To evaluate our proposal., we use service-interaction patterns and compare our approach with related solutions."

It covers all aspects of business process modeling and knowledge management: the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. The aim of BPM4KI is to develop a rich and expressive graphical representation of SBPs in order to identify and localize the crucial knowledge that is mobilized and created by these processes. In this research work, we focus more specifically on the description of the « Functional Perspective», which represents the core dimension in SBP modeling, exploring the collaboration, interaction and knowledge aspects. Besides, we evaluate the relevance of some proposed concepts through a real SBP scenario from medical domain in the context of the organization of protection of the motor disabled people of Sfax-Tunisia (ASHMS)."
pub.1009089528,Conceptual modeling and specification generation for B2B business processes based on ebXML,"In order to support dynamic setup of business processes among independent organizations, a formal standard schema for describing the business processes is basically required. The ebXML framework provides such a specification schema called BPSS (Business Process Specification Schema) which is available in two stand-alone representations: a UML version, and an XML version. The former, however, is not intended for the direct creation of business process specifications, but for defining specification elements and their relationships required for creating an ebXML-compliant business process specification. For this reason, it is very important to support conceptual modeling that is well organized and directly matched with major modeling concepts. This paper deals with how to represent and manage B2B business processes using UML-compliant diagrams. The major challenge is to organize UML diagrams in a natural way that is well suited with the business process meta-model and then to transform the diagrams into an XML version. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of conceptually modeling business processes by prototyping a business process editor tool called ebDesigner."
pub.1094256381,Weaving Definition and Execution Aspects of Process Meta-Models,The life-cycle of a workflow may be basically summarized to the two following steps: build-time (the process is defined) and run-time (the process definition is used to control and facilitate its enactments). Specific formalisms have been developed for defining processes and controlling their executions. The problem is that these formalisms are separate. The relation between a process definition and its executions is not made explicit. However the behaviour of a process at run-time may impact its definition. There is thus a need for weaving definition and execution aspects. Meta-modeling techniques may bring some relevant answers to this particular issue as they allow the definition of separate aspects of a system and their combination. This is what we attempt to show in this paper by studying the binding between two well-known workflow formalisms (the WfMC process definition meta-model and the OMG Workflow Management Facility).
pub.1094196399,Enhancing UML Activity Diagrams using OCL,"Business process automation is very much important for the customer satisfaction and for good productivity. UML Activity diagram is a behavioral diagram which is suitable to model business process. The activity diagram can be enhanced using Object Constraint Language (OCL). This elaboration will help us to include more implementation specific details in the activity diagram. In this paper we present different possibilities to include OCL in the activity diagram and their metamodels. The paper proposes an algorithm to convert the OCL statements to a target code. The OCL enhanced activity diagram can be converted to any target language like Java, C++ etc. In this paper we are converting the system design, represented in activity diagram, to Java code. We also present a prototype of the code generator named ActivityOCLKode and we evaluate the prototype with parameters like complexity, percentage of code generated."
pub.1052725959,A Compositional Model for Gesture Definition,"The description of a gesture requires temporal analysis of values generated by input sensors and does not fit well the observer pattern traditionally used by frameworks to handle user input. The current solution is to embed particular gesture-based interactions, such as pinch-to-zoom, into frameworks by notifying when a whole gesture is detected. This approach suffers from a lack of flexibility unless the programmer performs explicit temporal analysis of raw sensors data. This paper proposes a compositional, declarative meta-model for gestures definition based on Petri Nets. Basic traits are used as building blocks for defining gestures; each one notifies the change of a feature value. A complex gesture is defined by the composition of other sub-gestures using a set of operators. The user interface behaviour can be associated to the recognition of the whole gesture or to any other sub-component, addressing the problem of granularity for the notification events. The meta-model can be instantiated for different gesture recognition supports and its definition has been validated through a proof of concept library. Sample applications have been developed for supporting multitouch gestures on iOS and full body gestures with Microsoft Kinect."
pub.1015408737,Cross-Organizational and Context-Sensitive Modeling of Organizational Dependencies in,"Almost every application used to run a business relies on a model of the organization structure, the roles and the actors in order to define access rights or assign tasks. This article proposes a novel approach to organizational modeling. It also describes a way to connect internal and external organizational models in order to implement cross-organizational processes. It demonstrates the approach on two examples. One of them is a cross-organizational business process and the other a joint research project. The paper includes a description of the metamodel that constitutes the approach for context-sensitive modeling. It shows concrete language expressions that describe sets of actors and how these expressions are interpreted on the organizational model. The article concludes with a short overview of a prototypical implementation of the system $$\mathcal{C-ORG}$$."
pub.1102222416,Integrating Ontology into Sbvr,"The Semantics for Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) was released in 2005 by the Object Modeling Group (OMG) as the industry standard for business semantics. However, the lack of an integrated ontology limits the reasoning ability of SBVR. The purpose of this paper is to outline the metamodel of ontology taught in the Accelerating Business Process Engineering and Systems Development with Reusable Business Knowledge course at the University of Arizona, and display how integration into the SBVR could improve future releases of the standard. As supplements to the course material, materials from three books by Amit Mitra and Amar Gupta were referenced. We will illustrate how the integration of the metamodel of ontology could enable the SBVR to reason and thus provide the requisite agility to create resilient business processes and agile automation. We will also attempt to reconcile terms and describe gaps between the models taught in the course mentioned above; as referenced to throughout this paper as AMAG models, and SBVR."
pub.1018525086,Operational and strategic alignment in the decision process of molecule substitution,"We propose a methodological frame aiming at satisfying the operational and strategic alignment in the decision process of molecule substitution. It relies upon a hierarchical representation of chemical companies: manager, business process expert, chemical engineering expert and chemical expert; and three layers of abstraction: the real system, the system model and the metamodel to which the system model must conform. Applied to molecule substitution by using a CAMD approach in the context of healthier, greener and safer products, this model driven architecture enables experts at each level to set the constraints that the molecule should satisfy, thanks to approaches such as business rules and business process management modelling, modelling languages and XML Schema Description. This frame generates the information feeding our CAMD software tool."
pub.1093876421,Generation of Dynamic Process Models for Multi-metamodel Applications,"Multi-metamodel application development processes have to deal with specific needs including flexible support for structured artifacts like models, multi-layered modeling support and dynamic process updates. In order to deal with the requirements of dynamic process updates and multi-layered modeling support, we propose to model the processes in multiple abstraction levels. The use of conditions on structured artifacts, considered as models, allows enhanced activity interactions, specifically for iterative interactions. This endeavor presented as CAMA Process Modeling Framework (CPMF) counts towards the greater goal of automation of software development processes in the future."
pub.1124178851,A new approach for workflow evolution using MDA technology,"Most companies, independently of their sizes and activities types, do not provide sufficient adaptability and evolution of their workflow needed to deal with changes in business agreements and organisation methods. In this paper, we treat the adaptability and evolution of workflow based on MDA technology. And we present our new approach for workflow evolution at the design-time, in this approach, the workflow model is described by a specification at a very high level of abstraction using meta-model concepts. The workflow model can be evolved by the workflow designer using model evolution operations. The evolution of models can be managed in different ways. The designers can refine the workflow model according to the evolution scenario proposed by the company manager. In this work, we have developed endogenous rules in ATL which allow the transformation and evolution of workflow model, and among these rules, we have used the endogenous transformation model that affects models expressed in the same language."
pub.1037954674,Object-Oriented Development of Adaptive Workflows for Customer Flow Management Processes,"Customer Flow Management (CFM) systems are used to manage queues and support customer service business processes at various companies. The customer experience could be improved and waiting time reduced, if the service provisioning adapts to the context. To solve this problem, an approach for design and implementation of CFM systems on the basis of adaptive workflows is proposed. The adaptive workflows are modeled using BPMN and implemented using the object-oriented approach. To support model-driven implementation of adaptive workflows, the BPMN meta-model is extended to represent adaptive features and to support reuse of workflow activities across multiple alternative implementations of workflow execution variants. To illustrate the approach, a prototype of the dynamic luggage registration and online ticket re-registration in case of flight cancellation CFM system is developed."

We present in this paper the design concept and working principle of an inter-organizational workflow process management system for virtual healthcare enterprises. We propose an extended WFMC process Meta model and a new concept of Partial View of Virtual Process for representation and enactment of cross-organizational processes. Using this approach, local processes of participating organizations can be integrated with other external processes quickly. The joining and disjoining a virtual enterprise by an organization is also transparent to all except the directly interacting organizations."
pub.1137570063,Estimating the influence of building and urban form on the thermal loads of urban dwellings in the Mediterranean climate using machine learning,"The paper presents a novel method of generating metamodels that can quantify the influence of urban form on the heating and cooling loads of dwellings for the Mediterranean climate. The goal of the metamodels is to inform the early urban design process with quick and accurate feedback on the energy demand of a given urban configuration. The proposed method generates training datasets through Monte Carlo dynamic energy simulations of a single thermal zone. The study focuses on the geometrical parameters that affect building energy balance at the urban scale, such as dwelling shape, compactness, adjacencies and shading, utilizing a set of morphological indicators to relate these parameters to heating and cooling loads. The study focuses on the Mediterranean climate of Thessaloniki, Greece and utilizes several open-source tools (Ladybug Tools, EnergyPlus and Scikit-learn) under a streamlined workflow. The metamodels, which are trained using the Random Forest algorithm are then validated on 12 real-world urban sites of Thessaloniki with a reported Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) of 12% and 15% for heating and cooling loads, respectively."
pub.1146535317,The Use of Metamodel-based Approach for Designing Healthcare Applications,"Recently, the use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) via metamodeling approach is gaining more attention for software applications development. The community from the healthcare domain also attempts to employ the metamodel approach for producing quality healthcare applications. Healthcare applications have become an imperative in every attempt to improve healthcare management. Numerous studies reported that the healthcare domain is seen as a complex and unique domain, which involves dynamic characteristics. In addition, it is widely recognized that the increase of information exchange in the healthcare domain is caused by the diversity of healthcare data. This has led to the increase use of information technologies in the healthcare industry so as to enhance the healthcare delivery process via healthcare applications. However, the complexity of healthcare information leads to ineffective models and design of healthcare applications. Modeling the healthcare processes and developing healthcare applications are challenging tasks.  Hence, the advances of MDE have influenced the use of the metamodeling technique in the development of healthcare applications. Various metamodels are developed as a solution to provide a clear healthcare process model and a correct healthcare application. The aim of this paper is to analyse the use of the metamodel-based approach in designing healthcare applications. We believe that the metamodel-based approach would improve the development of healthcare applications."
pub.1006558163,Knowledge Engineering in Business Process Management,"Business Process Management (BPM) is a commodity today after an evolution from the initial business process re-engineering in the 1980s to a well-established management approach. This chapter proposes three aspects of knowledge engineering (KE) in BPM. First, BPM can be seen as a domain itself focusing on the BP-framework that identifies the basic concepts of business model, domain, regulation, and model processing. Second, BPM needs to be applied by a management method. Third, BPM needs to be executed within an environment; hence, it is deployed. BPM can be the basic concept for corporate knowledge leading to knowledge-sensitive BPM. Studying the knowledge-sensitiveness according to the four dimensions (1) form, (2) content, (3) use, and (4) interpretation, KE and knowledge management support can be distinguished. In the following, the focus is on KE. KE in BP-frameworks can be established by models using the meta-model approach for integration. Knowledge-intensive actions within the BP-management method can be supported by KE techniques that are proposed on the basis of the results of demonstrations in research projects. The deployment of BPM within an execution environment that uses KE requires consideration of the KE concepts also in BPM. This chapter, therefore, argues to support BPM in the three areas, BP-framework, BP-management method, and BP-deployment. KE techniques are proposed, the experiences in the demonstration of research projects are described, and an outlook on the conceptual and technical integration, is given."
pub.1093826985,REA-XML: An unambiguous language for REA business models,"Conceptual languages to describe business models - not business process models - become increasingly important. One of the most expressive approaches towards business models is the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology. REA has a substantial back-up in economic and accounting theory, but did lack a dedicated representation language for many years. Recently, we have introduced a domain specific modeling language including a REA meta model and a pertinent graphical notation. In this paper we build upon our previous work, but aim for a representation language that is able to serve as a serialization syntax also for other REA modeling approaches using UML class diagrams or OWL, etc. As a result we come up with REA-XML, an XML schema that allows a precise, tool-independent representation of REA models and that may also serve as an REA model exchange language between different tools."
pub.1113861893,A generic traceability metamodel for enabling unified end-to-end traceability in software product lines,"Mature development methodologies like software product line engineering or model-driven engineering are more and more adopted in software development. Accordingly, the resulting development processes combine artifacts from different disciplines and on different abstraction levels. It is crucial that the relationship between these artifacts is explicitly maintained to be able to track the development process and the reasons for design decisions. This problem becomes exacerbated if variability is considered since it is a cross-cutting concern that impacts all disciplines and artifacts. Traceability links support the linking of artifacts across model boundaries in an end-to-end manner. However, existing traceability solutions are either limited to specific development processes, tools, and artifact types, lack in uniformity, or do not consider variability. Thus, this paper introduces a MOF-based generic traceability metamodel for establishing uniform traceability-enabled workflows in a variability-aware and model-based environment. Necessary steps for instantiating the metamodel to specific artifact types of certain development processes are described. We evaluate the proposed solution with an exemplar of a car headlight and demonstrate the benefits of a consistent traceability concept."
pub.1059167166,Robustness and sensitivity analysis of a virtual process chain using the S-rail specimen applying random fields,"An important part in robustness evaluation of production processes is the identification of shape deviations. A systematic approach is typically based on the numerical evaluation of a DoE and the application of metamodels. They provide knowledge on solver noise and sensitivities of individual model parameters. This article presents the sensitivity analysis workflow of a linked deep drawing and joining process chain. LS-DYNA®, optiSLang and SoS is used. The challenge is to separate simulative from process and material parameters of AA 6014. Spatial quantities like variations in geometry, thinning and strain have to be considered in the next process steps. At the same time the number of required virtual CAE model evaluations must be limited. The solution is based on nonlinear metamodels and random fields."
pub.1008916407,Role of Model Transformation in Method Engineering,"This paper discusses two applications of model transformation to method engineering; one is method assembly of diagram based methods and formal methods and the other one is providing formal semantics with meta models by means of the transformation of the meta model descriptions into the formal descriptions. We use Class Diagram to define the meta models, and the models following the meta model can be represented with instance graphs. Thus our model transformation is based on graph grammars. To show and clarify the benefits of model transformation in method engineering, we illustrate the transformation rules and how to transform models. We use two examples; one is a method assembly of Class Diagram and Z and the other one is defining formal semantics of the meta model of Class Diagram."
pub.1005554417,eSPEM – A SPEM Extension for Enactable Behavior Modeling,"OMG’s SPEM – by means of its (semi-)formal notation – allows for a detailed description of development processes and methodologies, but can only be used for a rather coarse description of their behavior. Concepts for a more fine-grained behavior model are considered out of scope of the SPEM standard and have to be provided by other standards like BPDM/BPMN or UML. However, a coarse granularity of the behavior model often impedes a computer-aided enactment of a process model. Therefore, in this paper we present eSPEM, an extension of SPEM, that is based on the UML meta-model and focused on fine-grained behavior and life-cycle modeling and thereby supports automated enactment of development processes."
pub.1165179206,LABPMN: Location-Aware Business Process Modeling and Notation,"The combination of IoT and BPM enables new possibilities for the use of contextual information during the modeling and execution of process models. Nevertheless, many approaches for the use of location data only exist as concepts, and most existing extensions for BPMN do not fully use the potential gained through IoT.In this paper, we introduce a novel BPMN Extension for location awareness that is, conceptually well-defined and adheres to the BPMN meta-model, and can be used both graphically, and during the execution of a process. We introduce two new main elements: The possibility of dynamically assigning or allocating actors to one or a number of tasks, and different location-based events to be able to react to location changes of active and passive resources during process execution."
pub.1033342279,Ontological Foundations of Multi-agent Framework for Organizational Diagnosis,"In order to support management functions in dynamically changing corporate enterprises, adequate information systems need to be built, automating desirable adaptation of inter- and intra- organizational business processes. This paper therefore introduces a new approach to the design of multi-agent information systems meant for planning, discovering, monitoring deviations, and optimizing business processes. Expected qualitative breakthrough in the system’s capacity is based on the matching of its constructional and behavioral perspective with the ontological model of supported enterprise. Besides, conformity between organizational and information systems is supplemented by their conceptual alignment in the description of states and processes. The method of multi-agent framework construction and its application for traceability in supply chains are presented in this paper."
pub.1023777133,Leveraging Model-Based Tool Integration by Conceptual Modeling Techniques,"In the context of model-based tool integration, model transformation languages are the first choice for realizing model exchange between heterogenous tools. However, the lack of a conceptual view on the integration problem and appropriate reuse mechanisms for already existing integration knowledge forces the developer to define model transformation code again and again for certain recurring integration problems in an implementation-oriented manner resulting in low productivity and maintainability of integration solutions.In this chapter, we summarize our work on a framework for model-based tool integration which is based on well-established conceptual modeling techniques. It allows to design integration models on a conceptual level in terms of UML component diagrams. Not only the design-time is supported by conceptual models, but also the runtime, i.e., the execution of integration models, is represented by conceptual models in terms of Coloured Petri Nets. Furthermore, we show how reusable integration components for resolving structural metamodel heterogeneities, which are one of the most frequently recurring integration problems, can be implemented within our framework."

pub.1040257947,Sharing scientific models in environmental applications,"Environmental applications have been stimulating the cooperation among scientists from different disciplines. There are many examples where this cooperation takes place through exchanging scientific resources, such as data, programs and mathematical models. Finding the right model to apply in an environmental problem is a difficult task. Usually, this decision is based on previous experience. To facilitate the exchange and dissemination of information we propose a scientific resources architecture, where scientists may share their data, programs and models. We also present a scientific publishing metamodel for scientific resources description. The main goal of the proposed architecture is to provide scientific metadata support to effective model sharing, representing an innovative contribution to environmental applications. Scientific experiments and workflows are also considered as scientific resources that need to be shared. We believe that the proposed scientific publishing metamodel could be naturally extended to include these other scientific resources."
pub.1006034744,Information Systems Architecture for Business Process Modeling,"The purpose of this chapter is to present our contribution in business process modeling within the CAS (CIMOSA Application Server) project. In this project, a referential, which helps enterprises to model their internal or collaborative activities within an enterprise chain (i.e., extended enterprise) is proposed. The referential is supported by a meta-model, which consists of a process modeling concept and a methodology as a user modeling guide. Enterprise activities modeling is based on a business process approach CIMOSA-based and that we define into an enterprise system. In this manuscript, the implementation of the referential is detailed within an information system by a component approach and a framework, which integrates the modeling methodology. The referential components are developed with .NET Microsoft technology."
pub.1142655037,Design and Metamodel-Based Optimization of a High Power Density Wound Field Traction Motor,"Traction motors onboard electric vehicles (EVs) are faced with ever-increasing power density requirements and cost reduction challenges. Although permanent magnet (PM) traction motors have been favored for their potential of higher power densities, the price and supply volatilities of PM materials are the major drawbacks. Instead of a single load point, the performance of a traction motor needs to be optimized over various combinations of torque and speed to represent real-world vehicular driving scenarios, which tends to be a time-consuming task with direct optimizations. In this paper, as a PM-free solution, a wound field synchronous motor (WFSM) is designed and optimized using a metamodel-based approach to maximize its efficiency over a custom set of load points, while utilizing a fully per-unitized geometry template. The workflow has proven to be timesaving and the selected design is prototyped."
pub.1028902473,Use of repeated cross-sectional travel surveys to develop a Meta model of activity-travel generation process models: accounting for changing preference in time expenditure choices,"The paper presents an investigation of the temporal transferability of activity generation process models. Three repeated cross-sectional household travel survey data sets collected in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area in the years 2001, 2006, and 2011 are used for the investigation. A multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model is used to develop an activity-travel generation model and separate models are estimated for non-workers and workers. Models are developed for individual years and then for the pooled data set of three cross-sectional years to develop a Meta model of activity generation processes. Individual year-specific models are used to increase knowledge about the temporal stability of different parameters of the model so that the Meta model could capture the non-linear evolution of some key parameters of the model. Different transferability indices are used to test temporal transferability of cross-sectional year-specific modes and the Meta model. The results show that, in general, the activity-travel generation process model shows good temporal transferability. The Meta models reveal that the use of multiple repeated cross-sectional data sets considered as a pseudo-panel data improves temporal transferability of an activity generation model significantly."
pub.1050215241,The Dichotomy of Modeling and Execution,"This chapter introduces a set of languages intended to model and run business processes. The Business Process Modeling Notation 1.1 (BPMN) is a notation used to graphically depict business processes. BPMN is able to express choreographies, i.e. the cooperation of separate, autonomous business processes to jointly achieve a larger scenario. Since BPMN is only a notation, there is no specification for a meta-model that allows rendering BPMN choreographies into an executable form. This chapter describes how the Service Component Architecture (SCA) and the Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) help to close that gap. BPMN, SCA and WS-BPEL can jointly be used and combined to model, deploy and execute business process choreographies. We will also integrate the related BPEL4People specification, since BPMN allows human ‘user tasks’, but WS-BPEL focuses only on automated business process. The authors argue that, based on these specifications, the dichotomy between modeling and execution can be addressed efficiently. In this chapter, we will show that a key aspect of the future of Business Process Management is to combine graphical modeling (via BPMN) with a precise specification of an executable business process (via WS-BPEL and related standards)."
pub.1093913038,A formal meta-model of software process,"Software process play an important role in improving the quality of software products. Formal software process model is conducive to the accurate description of software processes. A software process meta-model is a formal tool used to define software process models. In this paper, a software process meta-model SPMM is designed. Firstly, five important properties in software processes are discussed. Furthermore, based on CSP and Hoare Logic, the definition of SPMM and the rules to build software process models are proposed. In SPMM, not only are the important components, e.g. tasks, activities and software processes in software processes, formally defined, but also the five important properties of software process are embodied. Therefore, SPMM can model software processes at different abstract levels. Thus, the basis to simulate, control, analyze, measure and improve software processes is established."
pub.1048064949,Supporting knowledge‐intensive work in public administration processes,"Abstract Knowledge management efforts focus much on the strategic applications of knowledge‐related initiatives and not so much on their implications at the level of concrete business processes. On the other hand, business process management efforts have not concentrated on leveraging knowledge. In this paper we attempt to fill that gap by developing a tool for proactive, context‐sensitive delivery of knowledge. We focus on the modelling of knowledge‐intensive business processes and we develop a framework for modelling this type of processes that explicitly considers knowledge‐related tasks and knowledge objects. We present a tool that is an implementation of our theoretical meta‐model and realises proactive, context‐sensitive delivery of knowledge, integrated with the workflow enactment. As an example, we sketch one case study, the process for granting full old‐age pension as it is performed in the Greek Social Security Institution, discussing the benefits derived from applying our tool. Finally, we draw the main conclusions of our work and discuss further research directions. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
pub.1094837998,An Object-Oriented Modeling Method for Workflow Applications,"Based on the analysis of the workflow applications, the modeling process of workflow applications is divided into four levels in this paper. They are Application level, Structure and information level, Execution control level, and Implementation level. An object-oriented model corresponding to the four-level modeling process is also given, expressed in UML. Event mechanism is employed in this paper to realize both the control and distribution mechanism in the logical modeling of workflow applications, illustrated by an event meta-model consisting of four basic event classes. The event definition and notification mechanisms are separated from the event reaction objects, and also the definition of functions and the triggering mechanism of the functions are separated. This may facilitate the dynamic modification of the workflow definitions and also facilitate the description of the distribution of workflow applications."

Nevertheless, when modeling Software Development Processes using BPMN, one can observe the lack of an important feature: process tailoring. This article proposes the BPMNt, a BPMN conservative extension that aims to aggregate a tailoring mechanism presented in SPEM 2.0. BPMNt uses the extensibility classes already present in the BPMN meta-model. Also, it proposes a set of consistency rules used to evaluate the final process."
pub.1024845041,Sequential Dynamic Optimization of Complex Nonlinear Processes based on Kriging Surrogate Models,"This paper presents a sequential dynamic optimization methodology applicable to solve the optimal control problem of complex highly nonlinear processes. The methodology is based on the use of kriging metamodels to obtain simpler, accurate, robust and computationally inexpensive predictive dynamic models, derived from input/output (training) data eventually generated using the original complex first principles process model (mathematical or analytical model) or from the real system. Then these metamodels can easily take the place of the complex first principles process model in any of the well-tailored computational schemes of sequential dynamic optimization. The results of applying this approach to three well known problems from the process systems engineering area are compared with the ones obtained using the corresponding first principles models, showing how the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational effort required to get very accurate solutions, and so enables the use of dynamic optimization procedures in applications where robustness and immediacy are essential practical constraints."
pub.1149411868,MBSE Process Modeling Based on Development Process Space Metamodel,"In the mechatronics field, the application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is more and more widespread. Research on system development process is an important means to support MBSE application. There is a lack of a general model that can describe the hierarchical level and multiple iterations of MBSE development process in the existing literature. In this paper, a general Development Process Space Metamodel (DPSM) is proposed. A vector in DPSM can be used to determine the unique state of the system development process, which meets the modeling needs of hierarchical and iterative MBSE development process. In the case study, a development process model of MBSE methodology called ARCADIA is established with DPSM to illustrate the universality of DPSM. DPSM provides alternative way for modeling and analysis of MBSE development process in the future."
pub.1042356173,Evaluating the sources of water to wells: Three techniques for metamodeling of a groundwater flow model,"For decision support, the insights and predictive power of numerical process models can be hampered by insufficient expertise and computational resources required to evaluate system response to new stresses. An alternative is to emulate the process model with a statistical “metamodel.” Built on a dataset of collocated numerical model input and output, a groundwater flow model was emulated using a Bayesian Network, an Artificial neural network, and a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree. The response of interest was surface water depletion expressed as the source of water-to-wells. The results have application for managing allocation of groundwater. Each technique was tuned using cross validation and further evaluated using a held-out dataset. A numerical MODFLOW-USG model of the Lake Michigan Basin, USA, was used for the evaluation. The performance and interpretability of each technique was compared pointing to advantages of each technique. The metamodel can extend to unmodeled areas."
pub.1004428476,An efficient methodology for modeling complex computer codes with Gaussian processes,"Complex computer codes are often too time expensive to be directly used to perform uncertainty propagation studies, global sensitivity analysis or to solve optimization problems. A well known and widely used method to circumvent this inconvenience consists in replacing the complex computer code by a reduced model, called a metamodel, or a response surface that represents the computer code and requires acceptable calculation time. One particular class of metamodels is studied: the Gaussian process model that is characterized by its mean and covariance functions. A specific estimation procedure is developed to adjust a Gaussian process model in complex cases (non-linear relations, highly dispersed or discontinuous output, high-dimensional input, inadequate sampling designs, etc.). The efficiency of this algorithm is compared to the efficiency of other existing algorithms on an analytical test case. The proposed methodology is also illustrated for the case of a complex hydrogeological computer code, simulating radionuclide transport in groundwater."
pub.1049034846,Transforming Object-Oriented Models to Process-Oriented Models,"Object-oriented modelling is an established approach to document the information systems. In an object model, a system is captured in terms of object types and associations, state machines, collaboration diagrams, etc. Process modeling on the other hand, provides a different approach whereby behaviour is captured in terms of activities, flow dependencies, resources, etc. These two approaches have their relative advantages. In object models, behaviour is split across object types, whereas in process models, behaviour is captured along chains of logically related tasks. Also, object models and process models lend themselves to different styles of implementation. There is an opportunity to leverage the relative advantages of object models and process models by creating integrated meta-models and transformations so that modellers can switch between these views. In this paper we define a transformation from a meta-model for object behavior modeling to a meta-model for process modeling. The transformation relies on the identification of causal relations in the object model. These relations are encoded in a heuristics net from which a process model is derived."
pub.1093901830,Using Component-oriented Process Models for Multi-Metamodel Applications,"Recent advancements in Model Driven Engineering (MDE) call for the corresponding software development processes. These processes need to be able to assist multimetamodel development by extending support for the usage of models and transformations. Business processes are sequenced on the basis of their sequential contingencies whereas we argue that software development processes are meant to be sequenced along their intrinsic factors. In this paper, we present a process metamodel from our framework, inspired from the component based paradigm, to automate the software development processes. This approach presents the concept of structured artifacts and exploits the activity sequencing based on events and constraints."
pub.1160203557,Hybrid Security Approach for Behavioural Privacy of Business Processes in a Cloud Environment,"Business processes are surely at the heart of companies but they are also the target of numerous security attacks, especially when using nowadays technologies like Cloud computing. Hence, ensuring business processes’ security is one of the main concerns in both industry and research area. Securing a business process involves securing its three main aspects namely, the informational, the logical (behavioural), and the organisational aspect. While most of the works in the literature focus on the security of the informational aspect, Goettelmann et al. in [9] propose an obfuscation technique that aims to guarantee explicitly the security of the logical aspect of a business process i.e. persevering the privacy of the company’s know-how expressed through the business process. This paper proposes an alternative solution to the obfuscation technique that is based on the strengths of this latter while addressing its identified limits. Our approach combines the ideas of the obfuscation technique and security annotations. The proposed solution is described via a metamodel that exhibits the main concepts it is based on, and a global functional architecture describing the principal steps of the solution, mainly a deployment configuration of the business process, meeting a set of defined constraints (and rules). A comparison between the obfuscation technique and our proposed approach according to security level and deployment costs is also illustrated, through examples."
pub.1166972152,Language usage analysis for EMF metamodels on GitHub,"ContextEMF metamodels lie at the heart of model-based approaches for a variety of tasks, notably for defining the abstract syntax of modeling languages. The language design of EMF metamodels itself is part of a design process, where the needs of its specific range of users should be satisfied. Studying how people actually use the language in the wild would enable empirical feedback for improving the design of the EMF metamodeling language.ObjectiveOur goal is to study the language usage of EMF metamodels in public engineered projects on GitHub. We aim to reveal information about the usage of specific language constructs, whether they match the language design. Based on our findings, we plan to suggest improvements in the EMF metamodelling language.MethodWe adopt a sample study research strategy and collect data from the EMF metamodels on GitHub. After a series of preprocessing steps including filtering out non-engineered projects and deduplication, we employ an analytics workflow on top of a graph database to formulate generalizing statements about the artifacts under study. Based on the results, we also give actionable suggestions for the EMF metamodeling language design.ResultsWe have conducted various analyses on metaclass, attribute, feature/relationship usage as well as specific parts of the language: annotations and generics. Our findings reveal that the most used metaclasses are not the main building blocks of the language, but rather auxiliary ones. Some of the metaclasses, metaclass features and relations are almost never used. There are a few attributes which are almost exclusively used with a single value or illegal values. Some of the language features such as special forms of generics are very rarely used. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions to improve the EMF language, e.g. removing a language element, restricting its values or refining the metaclass hierarchy.ConclusionsIn this paper, we present an extensive empirical study into the language usage of EMF metamodels on GitHub. We believe this study fills a gap in the literature of model analytics and will hopefully help future improvement of the EMF metamodeling language."
pub.1024112517,On the Systematic Development of Domain-Specific Mashup Tools for End Users,"The recent emergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end user development, i.e., on enabling end-users without programming skills to compose their own applications. Yet, similar to what happened with analogous promises in web service composition and business process management, research has mostly focused on technology and, as a consequence, has failed its objective. In this paper, we propose a domain-specific approach to mashups that is aware of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is comfortable with. We show what developing a domain-specific mashup tool means, which role the mashup meta-model and the domain model play and how these can be merged into a domain-specific mashup meta-model. We exemplify the approach by implementing a mashup tool for a specific domain (research evaluation) and describe the respective user study. The results of the user study confirm that domain-specific mashup tools indeed lower the entry barrier to mashup development."
pub.1092843453,Simulation Optimization for Computer Models With Multivariate Output,This paper explores the potential of Gaussian process based Metamodels for simulation optimization with multivariate outputs. Specifically we focus on Multivariate Gaussian process models established through separable and non-separable covariance structures. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each approach and their potential applicability in manufacturing systems. The advantageous features of the Multivariate Gaussian process models are then demonstrated in a case study for the optimization of manufacturing performance metrics.Copyright © 2017 by ASME
pub.1138374278,Multi-objective aerodynamic optimization using active multi-output Gaussian process and mesh deformation method,"A wing is an important part of the aircraft to improve aerodynamic performance. The current study is focused on an adaptive surrogate algorithm for airfoil aerodynamic optimization, which is based on a multi-output Gaussian process model. The conventional design method seriously relies on wind tunnel experiments and expensive computational simulations. The metamodels can significantly improve design efficiency and hence reduce the overall design costs. An active learning algorithm is proposed to improve the effectiveness of the multi-output Gaussian process model. The NSGA-II algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal Pareto set with the optimization objectives of lift and drag coefficients for adaptive airfoil shapes. Besides, the Bezier curve and radial basis function are utilized in this study for airfoil mesh deformation. The results show that the airfoil shape can be obtained effectively by integrating the metamodel, active learning algorithm, and multi-objective optimization algorithm. The optimized results are of great engineering applications."
pub.1095457061,Improvement View: Extension of Seven Views Approach,"Business process improvement is an important phase that must be introduced as soon as the phase of theoretical modeling of a new process. Indeed, it is based on the main aspects of the process such requirements, artefacts, and stakeholders. In this paper, we use the MDE approach to create our meta-model of process extended to improvement cycles. We generate this meta-model from the fusion of several meta-models: Process Structure View and concept View proposed in the framework of Seven Views approach, and the Meta model of improvement cycles which is in this case based on the PDCA approach. The proposed Meta model will facilitate the task in terms of the collection and sharing data for process improvement. We qualify here the process life cycle as intelligent cycle in the measure where several repositories containing information collected as soon as the theoretical modeling will be accessible and updated during each phase of the cycle, avoiding the need to repeat the same tasks. The objective of this paper is to propose an extension of Seven Views approach, by adding an eighth view which focuses on process improvement. The meta-model proposed is generic and will be valid for any type of information system."

pub.1053048171,Aspects of the BPRIM Language for Risk Driven Process Engineering,"Nowadays organizations are exposed to frequent changes in business environment requiring continuous alignment of business processes on business strategies. This agility requires methods promoted in enterprise engineering approaches. Risk consideration in enterprise engineering is getting important since the business environment is becoming more and more competitive and unpredictable. Business processes are subject to the same quality requirements as material and human resources. Thus, process management is supposed to tackle value creation challenges but also the ones related to value preservation. Our research considers risk driven business process design as an integral part of enterprise engineering. A graphical modelling language for risk driven business process engineering was introduced in former research. This paper extends the language and handles questions related to modelling risk in organisational context."
pub.1005152062,Choreography of ebXML business collaborations,"The ebXML framework consists of eight loosely coupled specifications for conducting e-Business. The choreography of ebXML business processes is defined by instances of the business process specification schema (BPSS). The BPSS is defined as an XML schema. It specifies elements describing the inter-organizational business processes, called business collaborations, but does not concentrate on intra-organizational business processes. Most of the underlying semantics were derived from the meta model of the UN/CEFACT Modeling Methodology (UMM). In this paper we describe the characteristics of ebXML business collaborations. We demonstrate how these concepts are captured by UMM and BPSS. These concepts must be supported by any proposed alternative business process interchange format in order to bridge between ebXML and other approaches, or even to replace BPSS."
pub.1119335892,An efficient methodology for modeling complex computer codes with Gaussian processes,"Complex computer codes are often too time expensive to be directly used to
perform uncertainty propagation studies, global sensitivity analysis or to
solve optimization problems. A well known and widely used method to circumvent
this inconvenience consists in replacing the complex computer code by a reduced
model, called a metamodel, or a response surface that represents the computer
code and requires acceptable calculation time. One particular class of
metamodels is studied: the Gaussian process model that is characterized by its
mean and covariance functions. A specific estimation procedure is developed to
adjust a Gaussian process model in complex cases (non linear relations, highly
dispersed or discontinuous output, high dimensional input, inadequate sampling
designs, ...). The efficiency of this algorithm is compared to the efficiency
of other existing algorithms on an analytical test case. The proposed
methodology is also illustrated for the case of a complex hydrogeological
computer code, simulating radionuclide transport in groundwater."

pub.1134598721,Using Metamodels to Improve Model-Based Testing of Service Orchestrations,"Online model-based testing is one of the most suitable techniques to assess the proper behavior of service orchestrations. However, the diverse panorama in terms of modeling languages and test case generation tools is a limitation to widespread adoption. We advocate that the application of Model-Driven Engineering principles as meta-modeling and model transformation can cope with this problem, improving the interoperability of artifacts in the test case generation process, thus bringing benefits in case of agile development processes, where system and technology evolution is frequent. In this paper, we present our contribution to this idea, introducing i) a reference metamodel, which stores the business process behavior and the information to generate input models for testing tools, and ii) transformations from orchestration languages towards testing tools. The proposed approach is implemented in a testing framework and evaluated on a case study where multiple orchestrations are expressed in two languages. Also, the paper presents how test cases are appropriately generated and successfully executed, starting from an orchestration model as a consequence of successful transformations."
pub.1094006759,A Model Transformation Approach Based on Homomorphic Mappings between UML Activity Diagrams and BPEL4WS Specifications of Grid Service Workflows,"We use a Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on UML activity diagrams to specify and compose systematically workflow models from Grid services. To be executed, workflow activity diagram models should be translated into BPEL4WS models which will be executed by the BPEL4WS engine. To reach this objective, we propose a meta-model based transformation from UML activity diagrams to BPEL4WS language. To ensure the correctness and the completion of the transformation, we propose a graph homomorphic mapping between the activity diagram and BPEL4WS language elements."
pub.1047344465,Model Driven Formal Development of Digital Libraries,"This paper shows our model-driven approach for the formal construction and validation of Digital Libraries (DLs). We have defined a Domain Specific Visual Language (DSVL) called VisMODLE, which allows the description of a DL using five different viewpoints: services, behaviour, collections, structure and society. From a meta-model based description of the different viewpoints, we have generated a modelling environment for VisMODLE. We have provided the environment with a code generator that produces XUL code for the DL’s user interface and composes the application using predefined components that implement the different services. Moreover, we have also added validation and simulation capabilities to the environment. Using the behavioural models (state-machine based), we can visually animate the system. In addition, the combined behaviour of actors and services can be transformed into a Petri net for further analysis."
pub.1094606911,"Towards Automated, Formal Verification of Model Transformations","Verification of models and model processing programs are inevitable in real-world model-based software de-velopment. Model transformation developers are interested in offline verification methods, when only the definition of the model transformation and the metamodels of the source and target languages are used to analyze the properties and no concrete input models are taken into account. Therefore, the results of the analysis hold for each output model not just particular ones, and we have to perform the analysis only once. Most often, formal verification of model transformations is performed manually or the methods can be applied only for a certain transformation or for the analysis of only a certain property. Previous work has presented a formalism to describe the characteristics of model transformations in separate formal expressions called assertions. This description is based on the first-order logic, therefore, if deduction rules are provided, a reasoning system can use an assertion set to automatically derive additional assertions describing additional properties of model transformations. In this paper, we propose deduction rules and present the verification of a model transformation of processing business process models."
pub.1125308911,Towards a BPMN Security Extension for the Visualization of Cyber Security Requirements,"Business process modeling notation (BPMN) is a widely used business model process. The importance of security is apparent, but traditionally, it is considered after the business processes definition. There is a need for integrated tools and a methodology that allows for specifying and enforcing compliance and security requirements for business process-driven enterprise systems. Therefore, it is very important to capture the security requirements at conceptual stage in order to identify the security needs. BPMN is lacking the ability to model and present security concepts. This will increase the vulnerability of the system and make the future development of security for the system more difficult. This article proposes a novel extension to BPMN notation based on cyber security ontologies. The authors incorporate visual constructs for modeling security requirements. In order to provide a commonly usable extension, these enhancements were implemented as BPMN metamodel extension. The authors illustrate capabilities and benefits of extension with a real-life example."
pub.1048404792,"Business Process and Value Delivery Modeling Using Possession, Ownership and Availability (POA) in Enterprises and Business Networks","ABSTRACT This paper describes a metamodel and notation for value delivery business process modeling, describing value delivery as flows of possession, ownership, and availability of economic resources between economic agents, value creation, and consumption, and a transfer of resources between agents' repositories. The motivation of the solution was to refine the REA ontology by replacing the generic concept of change in an economic resource with more specific concepts of change in ownership, change in possession, and change in the availability of an economic resource. The concepts of possession and ownership map directly to the same concepts in property law. The expressive power of the POA model covers traditional accounting, the REA ontology, and value networks. A POA model has the graphical notation and semantic precision that is required for model-driven design of ERP applications, supply chain applications, and enterprise information systems."
pub.1006260325,Implementing Business Process Recovery Patterns through QVT Transformations,"Traditionally, software maintenance takes only technical information into account to evolve legacy systems. However, business knowledge, which could help to improve the comprehension of legacy systems, is rarely recovered. Probably, that knowledge is not considered due to the fact that business knowledge recovery is a problem with a non trivial solution. This paper contributes to the solution of this problem through the use of a set of patterns and the implementation through QVT transformations, which takes KDM (Knowledge Discovery Metamodel) models concerning the system and obtains BPMN (Business Processes Model and Notation) models to represent the embedded business knowledge. A case study reports that the transformation obtains cohesive and loosely-coupling business processes diagrams; and it is scalable to large systems. As a consequence, the business processes recovery can enhance the maintenance since they provide the business concept location in legacy systems, among other improvements."
pub.1150459867,Generating Assurance Cases Using Workflow+ Models,"The increasing complexity and scale of safety-critical systems makes it challenging to perform necessary safety analyses and document them convincingly in an assurance case. In previous work we introduced Workflow+$$^+$$, a model-based framework for modelling the processes and work products in both the development and safety assurance life cycles. WF+$$^+$$ metamodels not only serve as templates that guide the development of a safe system, they also facilitate generation of an assurance case.

pub.1100424157,Towards a Taxonomy of Human Resource Allocation Criteria,"Allocating the most appropriate resource to execute the activities of a business process is a key aspect within the organizational perspective. An optimal selection of the resources that are in charge of executing the activities may contribute to improve the efficiency and the performance of the business processes. Despite the existence of resource metamodels that seek to provide a better representation of resources, a detailed classification of the allocation criteria that have been used to evaluate resources is missing. In this paper, we provide an initial proposal for a resource allocation criteria taxonomy. This taxonomy is based on an extensive literature review that yielded 2,370 articles regarding the existing resource allocation approaches within the business process management discipline, from which 95 articles were considered for the analysis. The proposed taxonomy points out the most frequently used criteria for assessing the resources from January 2005 to July 2016."
pub.1002095892,A generic and customizable framework for the design of ETL scenarios,"Extraction–transformation–loading (ETL) tools are pieces of software responsible for the extraction of data from several sources, their cleansing, customization and insertion into a data warehouse. In this paper, we delve into the logical design of ETL scenarios and provide a generic and customizable framework in order to support the DW designer in his task. First, we present a metamodel particularly customized for the definition of ETL activities. We follow a workflow-like approach, where the output of a certain activity can either be stored persistently or passed to a subsequent activity. Also, we employ a declarative database programming language, LDL, to define the semantics of each activity. The metamodel is generic enough to capture any possible ETL activity. Nevertheless, in the pursuit of higher reusability and flexibility, we specialize the set of our generic metamodel constructs with a palette of frequently used ETL activities, which we call templates. Moreover, in order to achieve a uniform extensibility mechanism for this library of built-ins, we have to deal with specific language issues. Therefore, we also discuss the mechanics of template instantiation to concrete activities. The design concepts that we introduce have been implemented in a tool, arktos ii, which is also presented."
pub.1093361912,Integrating Software Process Assessment Models using a Process Meta Model,"Software process improvement (SPI) is motivated by the need to increase the quality and productivity of software work. It is a widely accepted fact that the quality of the software product is largely determined by the quality of the process used to develop and maintain it. SPI requires knowledge of what is needed, awareness of what is feasible, and a long-term commitment to its investment. Software process assessment helps software organizations improve themselves by identifying their critical problems and establishing improvement priorities. The assessment takes place by comparing the state of the organization's software process against the model and the improvement scale. An assessment is usually based on a software process model and an improvement roadmap. [20] The interest in software process improvement has created dozens of international software process models and standards. CMMl [4] and SPICE [13] are two most widely used process assessment models in the SPI work today. In order to help software companies, a SPI support tool is currently being developed [17]. The SPI support tool guides the users through software process improvement, diminishing the need for continuous external consultations and assessors. Software process models form the central part of this support tool. In order to implement various process models into the support tool, the structure of the models should be analyzed and integrated into one common meta model. We have previously conducted conceptual analyses of SPICE and CMMI where the structure of both models has been studied [16]. In this paper we describe the result of the conceptual synthesis of these process models – integration of SPICE and CMMI through a meta model. The integrated meta model contributes to a more complete process assessment, since it includes elements of various process models."
pub.1004591371,D2WORM,"Unlike traditional activity-flow-based models, data-centric workflows primarily focus on the data to drive a business. This enables the unification of operational management, concurrent process analytics, compliance with process or associated data constraints, and adaptability to changing environments. In this demonstration, we present D2Worm, a Distributed Data-centric Workflow Management system. D2Worm allows users to (1) graphically model data-centric workflows in a declarative fashion based on the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model, (2) automatically compile the modelled workflow into several fine-granular workflow units (WFUs), and (3) deploy these WFUs on distributed infrastructures. A WFU is a system component that manages a subset of the workflow's data model and, at the same time, represents part of the global control flow by evaluating conditions over the data. WFUs communicate with each other over a publish/subscribe messaging infrastructure that allows the architecture to scale from a single node to dozens of machines distributed over different data-centers. In addition, D2Worm is able to (4) concurrently execute multiple workflow instances and monitor their behavior in real-time."
pub.1101106417,Connecting databases with process mining: a meta model and toolset,"Process mining techniques require event logs which, in many cases, are obtained from databases. Obtaining these event logs is not a trivial task and requires substantial domain knowledge. In addition, an extracted event log provides only a single view on the database. To change our view, e.g., to focus on another business process and generate another event log, it is necessary to go back to the source of data. This paper proposes a meta model to integrate both process and data perspectives, relating one to the other. It can be used to generate different views from the database at any moment in a highly flexible way. This approach decouples the data extraction from the application of analysis techniques, enabling the application of process mining in different contexts."

However, their application faces several challenges, particularly in their usability and integration. The ENCORE project addresses these challenges by introducing a new workflow for the sharing and creation of OERs, which includes the collaboration on and definition of key technological components. A central feature of this approach is the development of a meta-model that standardizes OER structures, thereby improving their discoverability and ease of sharing. Additionally, the project proposes a Generative AI service designed to generate assessment activities based on these OERs. This integrated approach, combining the meta-model and workflow, seeks to seamlessly connect the discovery and use of resources, fostering an engaged and collaborative environment for OERs."
pub.1123815155,Bridging Ontology and Implementation with a New DEMO Action Meta-model and Engine,"We consider current Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) Action Rules Specification to be unnecessarily complex and ambiguous. Even while using a “structured English” syntax similar to the one used in SBVR, such specifications are: incomplete while not containing enough ontological information to derive a functional implementation; and complex by containing mostly unneeded specifications. We propose a new meta-model for DEMO’s Action Model in the form of an EBNF syntax which is being implemented in a prototype that directly executes DEMO models as an Information and Workflow System. This prototype includes an action engine that runs DEMO transactions and the enclosed actions specified in our approach. We are currently integrating Blockly in our solution to allow syntactically correct visual programming of our proposed new Action Rule language that includes constructs to evaluate logical conditions, update the state of internal or external information systems, obtain input and provide output (formatted with WYSIWYG template editor) to users, among others."
pub.1110932568,Preventing Omission of Key Evidence Fallacy in Process-Based Argumentations,"Process-based argumentations argue that a safety-critical system has been developed in compliance with the development process defined in the standards and provide the evidence for certification of compliance. However, the process-based argumentations cannot ensure that the evidences are sufficient to support the claim. If the argumentations are insufficient (i.e., fallacious) they may result in a loss of confidence on system's safety. It is thus crucial to prevent or detect fallacies in the process-based argumentations. Currently, argumentations review process to detect fallacies largely depends on the reviewers' expertise, which is a labour-intensive and error prone task. This paper presents an approach that validates the process models (compliant with Process Engineering Metamodel 2.0), and prevent the occurrence of fallacy, specifically, omission of key evidence in process-based argumentations. If fallacies are detected in the process models, the approach develops the recommendations to resolve them; afterwards the process and/or safety engineers modify the process models based on the provided recommendations. Finally, the approach generates the safety argumentations (compliant with Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) from the modified process models by using model-driven engineering principles that are free from the fallacies. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated in the context of ECSS- E-ST-40C (Space engineering-Software) standard."
pub.1048453920,Implementation of Policy Based Management in Workflow Management System,"The foundation of a traditional workflow management system is process-based management. We have proposed to integrate policy-based management in workflow management systems to improve the flexibility and the dynamic behavior. In this paper, how to implement policy-based management in a workflow system is discussed. To construct policy model, a meta modeling method with four layer structure is introduced. The main tasks in each layer of the meta modeling architecture are described. To define where and when to apply policies in a workflow, a Control Point model is introduced. A workflow process meta model supporting policy-based management is presented. The architecture of a simple prototype system to support policy based management is also presented. The new approach has better flexibility in design time and higher adaptability at run-time."
pub.1047472829,Model-Driven Quality Engineering of Service-Based Systems,"Web services are the building blocks of systems based on service-oriented architectures. A web service is a self-describing, open component that supports rapid composition of distributed applications. Web service definitions are used to describe the service capabilities in terms of the operations of the service and the input and output messages for each operation. Such definitions are expressed in XML by use of the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL). Unfortunately, a WSDL description only addresses the functional aspects of a web service without containing any useful description of non-functional or quality of service (QoS) characteristics. This paper introduces a lightweight WSDL extension for the description of QoS characteristics of a web service. The extension is carried out as a metamodel transformation, according to principles and standards recommended by the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The WSDL metamodel is introduced and then transformed into the Q-WSDL (QoS-enabled WSDL) metamodel. As an example application of Q-WSDL, the paper illustrates a model-driven method that exploits Q-WSDL in order to automatically predict and describe the QoS of systems based on composite web services specified by use of the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL). The paper specifically addresses the prediction of the reliability attribute of QoS and is illustrated by use of an example application to a composite web service for travel planning."
pub.1033692654,"Workflow Data Patterns: Identification, Representation and Tool Support","Workflow systems seek to provide an implementation vehicle for complex, recurring business processes. Notwithstanding this common objective, there are a variety of distinct features offered by commercial workflow management systems. These differences result in significant variations in the ability of distinct tools to represent and implement the plethora of requirements that may arise in contemporary business processes. Many of these requirements recur quite frequently during the requirements analysis activity for workflow systems and abstractions of these requirements serve as a useful means of identifying the key components of workflow languages. In this paper, we describe a series of workflow data patterns that aim to capture the various ways in which data is represented and utilised in workflows. By delineating these patterns in a form that is independent of specific workflow technologies and modelling languages, we are able to provide a comprehensive treatment of the workflow data perspective and we subsequently use these patterns as the basis for a detailed comparison of a number of commercially available workflow management systems, workflow standards and web-service composition languages."
pub.1172094146,Alignment of Business Process and Information System Models Through Explicit Traceability,"In the software development lifecycle, business process models (BPMs) turn out to play an ever more pivotal role in the development and continued management of information systems (ISs). However, BPMs and IS models (ISMs) are traditionally expressed separately. This separation causes drift between them, impedes their interoperability, and thus builds up misaligned models. Traceability in software development proves its ability to link together related artifacts from different sources within a project (for examples, business modelling, requirements, design models), improves project outcomes by assisting designers and other stakeholders with common tasks such as impact analysis, etc. In this paper, we propose an improvement and an extension of an existing requirement traceability method in order to tackle the traceability between design, requirement and BPMs. In fact, the extension consists in adding the UML class diagram concepts structured according to the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern to be traced with BPMN and UML use cases models in a single unified model. This method is based on the integration mechanism, acts at the model and the meta-model levels, and can be used to develop a new IS and/or to examine the misalignment of the existing ISMs and the BPMs after BPM/ISM evolution."
pub.1095357765,Flexible modeling and execution of workflow activities,"While today's workflow management systems are well suited for the controlled execution of completely specified processes, support for dynamically changing processes is rather weak. However, new applications in the business domain and in non-traditional domains like the natural sciences or laboratory environments require support for flexibility like user interventions in workflow executions and dynamic modifications. Based on an activity meta model and an activity instance model, the paper discusses dynamic modifications and user interventions and shows how their implications to activity models and to concurrent and future activity instances can be described. Finally, we show how the basic concepts presented in the paper are realized in a prototypical implementation."
pub.1039388300,A Proof of the Correctness of a Transformation Approach from UML Activity Diagrams to Event-B Models,"We propose a workflow application constructive approach in which Event B models are built incrementally from UML AD models. Following our proposed approach, to be verified, workflow activity diagram models should be translated into Event B models which will be proved using the RODIN tool. To reach this objective, we propose, in this paper, a meta-model based transformation from UML AD to Event B models. To ensure the correctness and the completion of the transformation we propose a graph homomorphic mapping between the activity diagram and Event B models elements. By an example of workflow application we illustrate the proposed technique."
pub.1122091612,Polynomial and nonparametric regressions for efficient predictive proxy metamodeling: Application through the CO2-EOR in shale oil reservoirs,"An integrated optimization workflow combining Particle Swarm and Non-parametric Proxy Metamodels was adopted with reservoir simulation to optimize oil production in CO2-EOR in shale oil reservoirs. The cyclic-CO2 flooding optimization consisted of injection, soaking, and production durations over the prediction period. Also, Minimum bottom hole pressure, maximum oil production rate, and water cut were optimized for the production wells, and maximum bottom hole injection pressure and maximum gas injection rate were optimized for the injection wells. To reach the optimal solution, 176-candidate solutions were created as training experiments with 4 successive iterations of approximately 20 experiments each. The optimal solution increased oil production by 322,675 surface barrels. Next, a 2nd order polynomial regression, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Random Forest Model proxy models were constructed to metamodel the large reservoir simulator. The polynomial proxy has the least prediction error among other approaches to simplify the reservoir evaluation and optimization process."
pub.1040007627,"Towards Generic MDE Support for Extracting Purpose-Specific Healthcare Models from Annotated, Unstructured Texts","Once healthcare-specific models have been captured formally (i.e., in a metamodel-based language), the application of model transformation, analysis and code generation techniques is rather straightforward. Unfortunately, in many healthcare settings valuable domain knowledge is hidden in unstructured text (e.g., in a research paper or a national report on clinical guidelines). This motivates the need for tools to annotate such texts with metadata. Such tools can be prototyped easily for one type of healthcare artifacts (e.g., for clinical guidelines or care pathways) and one purpose (e.g., for workflow management or decision support) but it is a research challenge to build a robust and generic (i.e., metamodel-independent) tool for this important type of model extraction support. This paper desribes our ongoing work to building such a tool on top of a state-of-the-art MDE platform."
pub.1163657125,Implementation of a Metamodel-Based Optimization for the Design of a High Power Density Wound Field Traction Motor,"Traction motors onboard electric vehicles (EVs) are faced with ever-increasing power density requirements and cost reduction challenges. Although permanent magnet (PM) traction motors have been favored for their potential of higher power densities, the price and supply volatility of PM materials are the major drawbacks. Instead of a single load point, the performance of a traction motor needs to be optimized over various combinations of torque and speed to represent real-world vehicular driving scenarios, which tends to be a time-consuming task with direct optimizations. In this article, as a PM-free solution, a wound field synchronous motor (WFSM) is designed and optimized using a metamodel-based approach to maximize its efficiency over a custom set of load points, while utilizing a fully per-unitized geometry template. The workflow has proven to be timesaving and the optimal design is prototyped and tested."
pub.1112142256,A BPMN-based language for modeling corporate communications,"Communications essentially affect corporate success, which highlights the need for their standardized modeling and management. However, while systems and software have standardized languages for their visual representations, communications lack them. Accordingly, the main objective of our efforts was to define a visual language for the modeling of corporate communications, based on the Business Process Model and Notation standard. To achieve the stated objectives, we applied a system design approach as follows. Based on the literature and by identifying the potential use-cases, the technological requirements of the language were specified. On that basis, we defined a notation, a meta-model and an Extensible markup language based representation of the proposed solution and finally validated it via modeled diagrams. The main result is a standard-based and interchangeable language for representing corporate communications. Additionally, we demonstrated all of its capabilities in two illustrative examples and positioned the proposed language within an organizational setting."
pub.1094111688,Cross-Functional Operations Modeling as a Nexus of Commitments A new approach for improving business performance and value-creation,"Business processes have played a central role in improving enterprise performance. These improvements have taken place through the implementation of maturing processes with enterprise resource planning systems and the redesign of operations by using business process management methods. However, even in those organizations that have benefited from these practices, performance problems still persist. In particular, operations that go across the enterprise are a cause of bottlenecks. While this topic has been the target of models and consulting methods, performance shortfalls still persist, thus showing that organizations have not dealt with this integration challenge successfully. In this paper we introduce the notion of a Business Value Subject (BVS) endowed with a partially ordered set of Commitments as the modeling basis to establish a cross-organizational “contract” to be agreed upon by responsible role players as being essential in pursuit of sought business outcomes. We also introduce the notion of Nexus of Commitments across a family of BVSs as a governance mechanism for ensuring visibility and value-creation. This model of the enterprise operations departs fundamentally from workflows, cases, and other behavior-centric modeling principles. We also relate this model to other practical contributions in the context of the broad lean six-sigma techniques such as value-stream mapping (VSM) and SIPOC, as well as the fields of business process management and the resource-based view of organizations. In this paper, we address the foundational principles, formal definitions, and some examples. We introduce the main model by using a real-world example and also, present a rigorous formalization under the form of a metamodel. In addition, we present an Information System realization of the model with the goal of providing business visibility and performance management instrumentation."

pub.1120190483,Towards the Meta-Modeling of Complex Inter-Organisationnel Collaborative Processes,"Enterprises are progressively embedded in business to business atmospheres, in order to achieve their common business objectives. Such collaborations lead to Inter-Organizational Business Processes. Therefore, IOBP modeling involves new challenges, mainly the ability to deal with autonomy, privacy, heterogeneity. As a contribution in this area, a IOBP meta-model was designed. This model takes into account the maximum concepts related to the collaboration. Where, the process is complex, and its model in a global way affects its vision and complicates its implementation and hence the idea of its analysis into sub-IOBP to reduce the complexity of the global collaborative process, to streamline information exchange and to facilitate the understanding of the process by partners. A set of Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) transformation rules has been defined to convert Unified Modeling Language (UML) models to Business Process Model and Notation. Finally, the application of our approach has been demonstrated through a framework which can solve the problem of generic IOBP."
pub.1094137883,BPMN4CP Revised — Extending BPMN for Multi-Perspective Modeling of Clinical Pathways,"Clinical Pathways (CPs) can be seen as business processes of hospitals or clinical institutions. Modeling these pathways is an emerging field of research, as it provides promising benefits for systems integration, quality management and documentation. The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) provides a range of process-related concepts but naturally lacks in representing specific aspects from the CP domain. Therefore, the BPMN extension BPMN4CP was designed in a previous research project. In accordance with research guidelines from Design Science, the extension ran through an iteration based on its practical application within a telemedical project. Based on several new requirements, the extension was revised regarding to the integration of resources, documents, objectives and quality indicators. These concepts were assigned to particular perspectives and diagrams in order to support model complexity management and provide appropriate diagrams for respective stakeholders. In order to provide a commonly usable extension, these enhancements were implemented as BPMN meta model extension."
pub.1094559402,Extending Role-based Access Control for Business Usage,"Role-based access control (RBAC) is used for managing authorisation in IT systems, by utilising the concept of roles. Existing approaches do not clearly define the term “role” in its different contexts as well as not considering the relation between roles and business process modelling. Therefore this work introduces business and system role-based access control (B&S-RBAC). Established role-based access control models are extended with a business perspective and the term role is defined from a business and from an IT perspective, resulting in business and system roles. The relation between them is shown in a meta-model and the usage of business roles for secure business process modelling is explained."

However, the importance of role is not emphasized. In fact role is critical to determine the RESTful services description and to control the services composition. This paper presents a role-centric RESTful services description and composition mechanism to implement business process. Firstly a resource meta-model is proposed, and then process and role are formally defined, RESTful services description is then generated based on role and BPEL is extended by introducing the concept of role to control the access to resources. A case study is also given to illustrate the approach and the desirable features of the approach are discussed."
pub.1093345455,An Approach Based on Ontology for Discovering Data Impacting the Execution of a Business Process,"Organizations have an increasing need to adapt faster their Information Systems to technical, functional and legal changes. One way proposed in the literature is to make a deep process analysis in order to have a better comprehension of the business process (BP) and adapt it to its new context. In this paper, we propose a meta model for a BP contextualization solution. The solution links a BP with business data and contextual data (weather, urban traffic, etc.) using semantics. We apply it to a commodity palletization process from our commodity traceability project and we conclude that it provides business expert with additional contextual data that impacted the BP execution."
pub.1103820787,Leveraging a design of experiments methodology to enhance impacts of modeling and simulations for engineered resilient systems,"System engineers rely on a variety of models and simulations to help understand multiple perspectives in several domains throughout a system’s life-cycle. These domain models include operational simulations, life-cycle cost models, physics-based computational models, and many more. Currently, there is a technical gap with regard to our ability to untangle system design drivers within system life-cycle domains. This article provides a procedural workflow that addresses this technical gap by leveraging the methods of experimental design in order to clearly identify tradable variables and narrow the search for viable system variants. Our purpose is to illuminate trade decisions across several different viewpoints by integrating metamodels that approximate the behavior of multiple domain models; a metamodel is a statistical function that acts as a surrogate to a model. Model inputs often represent value properties that define a system alternative configuration or environmental conditions that represent uncertain factors within the system boundary. Model outputs represent measures of performance or effectiveness that allow us to compare alternatives and understand the tradeoffs among several objectives. In order to illuminate the tradeoffs that exist in a complex system design problem we propose an approach that approximates model input and output behavior using the functional form of statistical metamodels. After performing an experimental design, we can fit a metamodel with a functional form known as a response surface. We utilize contour profilers that show horizontal cross sections of multiple response surfaces to visualize where key trade decisions exist. Our research supports the tradespace analytics pillar for the development of the engineered resilient system (ERS) architecture. The article concludes with instructions on how to perform simulation experiments to construct a dynamic dashboard that illuminates system tradeoffs."
pub.1118742850,On the Use of Variability Operations in the V-Modell XT Software Process Line,"Software process lines provide a systematic approach to develop and manage
software processes. It defines a reference process containing general process
assets, whereas a well-defined customization approach allows process engineers
to create new process variants, e.g., by extending or modifying process assets.
Variability operations are an instrument to realize flexibility by explicitly
declaring required modifications, which are applied to create a procedurally
generated company-specific process. However, little is known about which
variability operations are suitable in practice. In this article, we present a
study on the feasibility of variability operations to support the development
of software process lines in the context of the V-Modell XT. We analyze which
variability operations are defined and practically used. We provide an initial
catalog of variability operations as an improvement proposal for other process
models. Our findings show that 69 variability operation types are defined
across several metamodel versions of which, however, 25 remain unused. The
found variability operations allow for systematically modifying the content of
process model elements and the process documentation, and they allow for
altering the structure of a process model and its description. Furthermore, we
also find that variability operations can help process engineers to compensate
process metamodel evolution."
pub.1094810270,Service Composition with Functional Flexibility Using Nondeterministic Service Interface,"Although previous works pertaining to Web service composition have paved the way for resolving the automatic composition issue with considering single IOPE goal, functional flexibility of service composition with complex workflow is not well-addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel service type, namely prospect service that possesses nondeterministic service interface beyond concrete and abstract services used by current service composition methods, to improve functional flexibility of service composition. Furthermore, we define a meta-model including prospect service and adaptable workflow template to provide comprehensive constructs for modeling flexible and adaptable workflow templates while developing an automatic instantiation method to instantiate concrete workflows with different functionalities from a template. Several experiments are also conducted to evaluate the performance of the automated method under different contexts."
pub.1001132050,Towards an Inter-organizational Collaboration Network Characterization,"Nowadays in the international trade, there are many aspects that influence the interactive relationships between several types of organizations. Modeling such kinds of organizational interactions needs the consideration of a maximum of concepts related to the inter-organizational collaboration in general, in order to cover any kind and any case of collaboration. For this purpose, we present in this paper an inter organizational collaboration Meta Model dedicated to the generation of a knowledge-based used for inter organizational collaborative process modeling. The purpose is to build an inter-organizational collaboration Meta-model which covers the majority of the aspects and the concepts related to the inter-organizational collaboration, found in the literature. At this level it’s necessary to identify and extract the objectives and knowledge about the collaboration environment. These knowledge can be acquired from many different sources in many different ways such as interview, conversation, software, documentation, experiences, professional social web, etc. This knowledge acquisition is done to define the collaboration Meta-Model. At the end of this paper we are going to present the instantiation of our meta-model through a case study."
pub.1132320053,Simultaneous Development of a Self-learning Engineering Assistance System,"In order to support the design of sheet-bulk metal formed parts, a self-learning engineering assistance system (SLASSY) was developed during the course of the project. SLASSY can help in product development of sheet-bulk metal forming (SBMF) mainly in two ways. On the one hand, it facilitates the knowledge transfer from manufacturing experts back to product developers and on the other hand, it enables product developers to optimize their part designs based on the metamodels created from simulation and experimental parameter studies. The key scientific findings are the generalized workflow for creating these metamodels, which allows the creation of knowledge very soon during the development of a new manufacturing technology like SBMF. Based on this, metamodels allow the automatic generation of design alternatives, which are also valuable and manufacturable. Potential applications for this self-learning engineering assistance system can be found in every manufacturing-related industry, since it enables product developers to keep up with the development of a new or newly introduced manufacturing technology in their respective field. The methods developed can be applied to all fields, where simulations and experimental studies are applied to find new knowledge in a given manufacturing domain."

Firstly, the definition of a BP meta-model (MM) consisting of a set of rules that guide the BP designers in their work. Secondly, given a BP, the BPAL platform allows for the automatic verification of the compliance (well-formedness) of a given BP w.r.t. the defined MM. Finally, the execution semantics of a BP is given in term of its instances (referred to as traces) to provide services for i) checking if the actual execution of a BP has been carried out in accordance with the corresponding definition, ii) simulating executions by trace generation. The proposed platform is open since it can easily be enhanced by adding other logic-based modeling, reasoning, and querying functionalities."
pub.1094326597,Conceptual Modeling of Web Application Transactions: Towards a Revised and Extended Version of the UWA Transaction Design Model,"Business Web applications are complex data- and operation-intensive Web applications intended to support business processes. In this kind of application, the user executes sets of activities organized into transactions (also generally called workflows) in order to accomplish one of his/her tasks or fulfill one of his/her goals. The way these transactions are structured, the properties associated with their component activities and the way each activity is implemented by the Web application are a consequence of the transaction design as well as the business rules implied by the business process. The Ubiquitous Web Applications (UWA) design framework explicitly includes a design activity and a related meta-model, called the Transaction Design Model, specifically focused on the conceptual design of Web application transactions (Web Transactions for short). This paper describes preliminary steps towards a revised and extended version of the UWA Transaction Design Model that emphasizes a user-centered approach, is easier to adopt and manages the information, navigation and operation aspects involved in a Web Transaction in a comprehensive and integrated way."

Multiple perspectives of business process design must be supported and integrated. Enterprise architecture frameworks provide a useful context to define and categorise these multiple perspectives. Levels of abstraction of business, systems and technology represent the lifecycle phase ranging from business requirements definition through to execution. Different deliverables are relevant to each level of abstraction. The business architecture consists of a set of modeling perspectives (process, activity, resource and management) that represent types of business requirements. The technology architecture defines a classification of execution architectural styles. The systems architecture consists of a meta-model that defines the fundamental concepts underlying business requirements definition facilitating the integration of multiple modeling perspectives and mapping to multiple execution architectural styles, thereby facilitating execution of the business requirements."
pub.1014724656,A novel approach for No Fault Found decision-making,"Within aerospace and defence sectors, organisations are adding value to their core corporate offerings through services. These services tend to emphasise the potential to maintain future revenue streams and improved profitability and hence require the establishment of cost effective strategies that can manage uncertainties within value led services e.g. maintenance activities. In large organisations, decision-making is often supported by information processing and decision aiding systems; it is not always apparent whose decision affects the outcome the most. Often, accountability moves away from the designated organisation personnel in unforeseen ways, and depending on the decisions of individual decision makers, the structure of the organisation, or unregulated operating procedures may change. This can have far more effect on the overall system reliability – leading to inadequate troubleshooting, repeated down-time, reduced availability and increased burden on Through-life Engineering Services.This paper focuses on outlining current industrial attitudes regarding the No Fault Found (NFF) phenomena and identifies the drivers that influence the NFF decision-making process. It articulates the contents of tacit knowledge and addresses a knowledge gap by developing NFF management policies. The paper further classifies the NFF phenomenon into five key processes that must be controlled by using the developed policies. In addition to the theoretical developments, a Petri net model is also outlined and discussed based on the captured information regarding NFF decision-making in organisations. Since NFF decision-making is influenced by several factors, Petri nets are sought as a powerful tool to realise a meta-model capability to understand the complexity of situations. Its potential managerial implications can help describe decision problems under conditions of uncertainty. Finally, the conclusions indicate that engineering processes, which allow decision-making at various maintenance echelons, can often obfuscate problems that then require a systems approach to illustrate the impact of the issue."
pub.1083894402,A Proposal to Model Knowledge Dimension in Sensitive Business Processes,"Knowledge development in organizations relies on Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs), which are characterized by a high complexity and dynamism in their execution, high number of critical activities with intensive acquisition, sharing, storage and (re)use of very specific crucial knowledge, diversity of knowledge sources, and high degree of collaboration among experts. In this paper, we propose a semantically rich conceptualization for describing a SBP organized in a new Business Process Meta-model for Knowledge Identification (BPM4KI), in order to develop a rich and expressive graphical representation of SBPs to identify and localize the crucial knowledge. BPM4KI covers all aspects of business process modeling: the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. We focus more specifically on Knowledge Perspective which has not yet evolved into BP models. This perspective is semantically rich and well founded is on the «core» domain ontologies. Besides, we evaluate the relevance of some proposed concepts through a real SBP scenario from medical domain in the context of the organization of protection of the motor disabled people of Sfax-Tunisia."
pub.1051078740,Towards a Generic Model for Situational Method Engineering,The work presented in this paper is related to the area of Situational Method Engineering (SME) which focuses on project-specific method construction. We propose a generic process model supporting the integration of different existing SME approaches. This model shall help the method engineer either selecting one SME approach or combining several approaches that best fit the situation of the method engineering project at hand. The generic model presented in this paper already contains three SME techniques: (1) to assemble method chunks (2) to extend an existing method and (3) to generate a method by abstraction/instantiation of a model/meta-model. The paper presents and illustrates these three techniques and show how other SME techniques could be integrated in the model.
pub.1022602540,Generating transformation rules from examples for behavioral models,"Behavioral UML models like sequence diagrams (SD) lack sufficient formal semantics, making it difficult to build automated tools for their analysis, simulation and validation. A common approach to circumvent the problem is to map these models to more formal representations. In this context, many works propose a rule-based approach to automatically translate behavioral models like SD into colored Petri nets (CPN). However, finding the rules for such SD-to-CPN transformations manually may be difficult, as the transformation rules are usually not obviously defined. We propose a solution that starts from the hypothesis that examples of good transformation of SD-to-CPN can be useful to automatically generate transformation rules. To this end, we describe an automated approach to find the rules that best match the meta-model elements of SD to corresponding elements in the CPN meta-model. Thus, our approach starts by randomly generating a set of rules, executing them to generate some target models. Then, it evaluates the quality of the proposed solution (rules) by comparing the generated target models to the expected ones in the base of examples. In this case, the search space is large and heuristic-search is needed. To achieve our goal, we combine two algorithms for global and local search, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Our empirical results show that the generated rules derive CPNs similar to the expected ones."

Supporting emergent processes is one of the key issues for collaborative knowledge sharing. This paper first introduces a component-based workspace metamodel used to support emergent processes. A loose-coupled collaborative process management model WorkPath is proposed based on the workspace structure to support flexible process evolution management and coordination among processes. Key elements that construct workspace and WorkPath, such as role, action, artifact, workspace and reference relation, are described in detail.

They are difficult to learn and to use; they are complex, sequential and rigid and thus far from being adapted, reliable and efficient. This paper presents M2Flex, a process metamodel for highly supporting flexibility. M2Flex is based on a recent definition of flexibility along four dimensions: (1) variability, the existence of equivalent choices, (2) granularability, the existence of different levels of details, (3) completeness, the possibility of defining optional components and pre-defined reusable results, and (4) distensibility, the capacity of the resulting process model to be extended or reduced at runtime. This paper shows how M2Flex is original by the flexibility it offers to designers and developers at runtime."
pub.1110717823,Categorical Modeling Method of Intelligent WorkFlow,"Abstract
A category as well as a model is a mixture of graphical information and algebraic operations. Therefore, category language seems to be the most general to describe the models. It can provide us with the features that must characterize both the DSL language and the Modeling Method concept.
The theory of categories works with patterns or forms in which each of these forms describe different aspects of the real world. Category theory offers both, a language, and a lot of conceptual tools to efficiently handle models.An important aspect of modeling is building complex functions from a given set of simple functions, using different operations on functions such as composition and repeat composition. Category theory is exactly the right algebra for such constructions.The category theory creates the premises for the development of intelligent workflow modeling tools equipped with advanced analysis tools and automated learning mechanisms adapted to analyze and improve processes. The model allows on-line process information extraction, automatic learning from these data and self-improvement."
pub.1093206588,A Model Driven Approach to Compose and Develop Grid Service Workflow Applications,"We use a Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on UML activity diagrams (UML-AD) to specify and compose systematically workflow models from Grid services. To be executed, workflow activity diagram models should be translated into BPEL4WS models which will be executed by the BPEL4WS engine. To reach this objective, we propose a meta-model based transformation from UML activity diagrams to BPEL4WS language. To ensure the correctness and the completion of the transformation, we propose a graph homomorphic mapping between the activity diagram and BPEL4WS language elements. To execute the BPEL4WS provided model, we propose in this paper an execution infrastructure based on The Globus Tool Kit."
pub.1095110517,Model Driven Data Service Development,"Data integration (DI) is usually used to combine a myriad of configurations, databases and applications. However, it has been implemented in a tactical and monolithic manner. Applications are tightly bound to their DI-specific logics, including creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) data, data validation, transformation, and movement. Data Services are introduced to enable the insulation of applications and business services from the physical implementation of data integration, enabling greater flexibility and optimization of data placement, access and quality. Model driven technologies for SOA and data centric applications are developed separately, modeling the SOA application using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Business Process Model (BPM) with BPEL, and modeling the databases using conceptual, logical or physical datamodel. To satisfy the Data Service's requirement, these two areas should be linked together to improve the traceability and agility from Data, IT and business perspectives. In this paper, firstly we improve the traditional data modeling technology and propose a unique Information Liquidity Model (ILM) to take care of different aspects and patterns of data integration. After that, we setup the two-way linkage between our existing SOA service metamodel and new ILM, the true model-driven data service development can be implemented from PIM to PSM."

This paper mainly researches the rules during the conversion process, achieves the definition of transformation rules and implements the definition with the Java Rule Engine– Drools. In order to validate this rule definition, the transformation rule data bases are created from XPDL to BPEL and from BPEL to XPDL, and the transformation of the instance is achieved. The results show that the method of transformation rules proposed in this paper is valid."
pub.1044489734,A reference model for team-enabled workflow management systems,"Today's workflow systems assume that each work item is executed by a single worker. From the viewpoint of the system, a worker with the proper qualifications selects a work item, executes the associated work, and reports the result. There is usually no support for teams, i.e., groups of people collaborating by jointly executing work items (e.g., the program committee of a conference, the management team of a company, a working group, and the board of directors). In this paper, we propose the addition of a team concept to today's workflow management systems. Clearly, this involves a marriage of workflow and groupware technology. To shed light on the introduction of teams, we extend the traditional organizational meta model with teams and propose a team-enabled workflow reference model. For this reference model and to express constraints with respect to the distribution of work to teams, we use object constraint language (OCL)."

However., such diagrams are widely used in domains that require a certain degree of confidence. To enhance confidence level of UML AD., we provide a formal definition of their syntax and semantics in Event B. The main interest of our approach is that we chose UML AD., which are recognized to be more tractable by engineers. We outline the translation of UML AD into Event B in order to verify functional properties of workflow models (such as deadlock-inexistence., liveness., fairness) automatically., using the B powerful support tools like RODIN. we propose a meta-model based transformation from UML activity diagrams to Event B Models. To ensure the correctness and the completion of the transformation., we propose a graph homomorphic mapping between the activity diagram and Event B models elements."

Clear and simple vision is a prerequisite for defining proper and framed strategic goals. Strategies that enterprise has to implement through the set of activities should be defined and analyzed. One of the proven ways of defining the strategies is using the SWOT analysis. This analysis, used in a standard way, does not give sufficient guarantee for success in the strategic planning process. Therefore, this paper gives a meta-model of extended SWOT analysis, as well as a workflow model of its implementation. The meta-model is developed as entity relationship attribute (ERA) diagram, while the workflow model is developed using BPMN notation. These two models, combined together, give us a tool for keeping important data generated in the strategic planning process in a form of unique repository. This repository is a basis for development of a CASE tool that can help managers in managing the enterprise towards achieving its strategic goals."
pub.1015221878,"Visualization, Simulation and Analysis of Reconfigurable Systems","Meta-modeling is well known to define the basic concepts of domain-specific languages in an object-oriented way. Based on graph transformation, an abstract meta-model may be enhanced with information on concrete visualization of objects and relations, and the language syntax is defined by a graph grammar. Moreover, graph transformation can also formalize the semantic aspects of models, thus providing a basis for model validation by simulation.Apart from editing and simulating the behavior of a system, there may be necessary reconfiguration operations which change the underlying system structure at runtime. In this paper, we focus on the interrelation of simulation and reconfiguration operations using formal verification techniques based on graph transformation. Our approach is demonstrated by the definition of a domain-specific language for building, simulating and reconfiguring small railway systems, using the Tiger tool environment. For further verification, we define a model transformation from the railway domain to Petri nets."

Finding the optimal deployment in terms of task distribution, parallelization, collocation and resource assignment for each execution is a step-wise process involving both human input with domain-specific knowledge about the tools as well as the acquisition of new knowledge based on the actual execution history. In this paper, we present motivating scenarios as well as an architecture for adaptive and reflective middleware that supports smart cloud-based deployment and execution of engineering workflows. This middleware supports deep inspection of the workflow task structure and execution, as well as of the very specific mathematical tools, their executions and used parameters. The reflective capabilities are based on multiple meta-models to reflect workflow structure, deployment, execution and resources. Adaptive deployment is driven by both human input as meta-data annotations as well as the actual execution history of the workflows."

Standardisation bodies, providers, researchers and policies ensure progress towards this goal. Nonetheless, the availability of these services questions the use and reuse of information resources in terms of their appropriate context, scale, sensitivity and quality. The outcome(s) delivered from a workflow chaining data and processes that were not necessarily elaborated with the implicit aim of this workflow, may vary accordingly. Decisions to modify or adapt the workflow needs to be controlled. Qualifying a workflow model with additional metadata associated with the chosen datasets and the chosen sub-models is essential to help scientists in assessing the reliability of outcomes but also to refine the corresponding GEOSS-based model. This paper investigates different approaches to control the validity of such workflow and for assessing its quality and sensitivity. A meta-model integrating metadata measures compatible with current standards is investigated."
pub.1033267976,Contract-Based Analysis of Automotive and Avionics Applications: The SPEEDS Approach,"The Speeds project has developed a layered meta-model of heterogeneous rich components and standardized approaches for the integration of commercial industry standard modeling tools to assemble system-level design models with contract-baed interface specifications by combining models expressed in any authoring tool compliant to the integration standard, including Matlab-Simulink/Stateflow, Rhapsody, and Scade. It is currently integrating a range of analysis methods supporting interface compliance testing and dominance analysis between contracts expressed in extended automata model, subsuming timed automata. The presentation focuses on real-time analysis methods, and demonstrates a methodology for assessing realizability of end-to-end latencies at system level, exploring the design space of possible system configurations meeting vertical resource assumptions, and assessing compliance to such vertical assumptions based on distributed real-time schedulability analysis for FlexRay and CAN bus based target architectures."
pub.1017283619,Adaptive Design of Cross-Organizational Business Processes Using a Model-Driven Architecture,"To enable enterprises to keep up with the constant change in business relationships and cross-organizational value chains, it is crucial to develop adaptive business systems and value chains. In order to achieve this, methodologies, methods, and infrastructures to support end-to-end modeling of cross-organizational business processes are required, allowing changes to business processes being defined at the business level and providing well-defined (and possibly largely automated) model transformations and refinements down to the level of information and communication technology systems.The contribution of this paper is threefold: First, we present a conceptual architecture for modeling collaborative business processes based on a model-driven architecture; second, we propose a design approach suitable to the model-driven architecture, and third, we provide two model transformations (mappings) to implement our design approach, thus enabling the smooth transition from an ARIS model via a computation-independent BPDM model to a platform-independent BPDM model."
pub.1033315087,Preface UNIGRA'03 - Uniform Approaches to Graphical Process Specification Techniques,"This volume contains selected papers of the proceedings of the workshop on Uniform Approaches to Graphical Process Specification Techniques (UNIGRA'03). The workshop was held in Warsaw, Poland, on April 5 and 6, 2003, as a satellite event of the sixth European Joint Conference on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2003). The workshop continues the UNIGRA workshop in 2001 which has been a successful satellite event of ETAPS 2001.Workshop ObjectivesDue to the increasing amount of divergent formalisms, the main idea of the UNIGRA workshops is to bring together people working especially in the following three areas: •Low Level and High-Level Petri Nets•Graph Transformation and High-Level Replacement Systems•Visual Modeling Techniques including UMLIn each of these areas there is a large variety of different approaches, however, first attempts for uniform approaches have been made already. According to the main idea and in order to further stimulate the research in this important area, this volume presents some uniform approaches and further introduce unifying and comparative studies across the borders of the three and related areas.Workshop ProgramIn the first part, unifying approaches for low-level and high-level Petri nets are proposed:The contribution by Ehrig shows how the notions occurrence net and process can be generalized from low-level to high-level Petri nets, and studies the behavior and instantiations of this new view of processes for high-level nets.In his overview on new developments in the area of Petri net transformations for Software Engineering, Urbášek presents recent work on net model transformations and net class transformations. Both kinds of transformations are studied with regard to the preservation of system properties such as safety properties or liveness. The formalization of Petri net transformations is originally based on the theory of graph transformation.Padberg considers a case study (the call center of a phone company)which is modeled using Petri net modules for structuring the operational behavior of the system. The notion of Petri net modules was achieved by a transfer from the concepts of algebraic module specifications to the modeling of component-based systems by Petri nets.Desel, Juhás and Lorenz deal with the semantics of place/transition nets. The authors relate the process semantics based on partial orders (individual token semantics) to the collective token semantics by defining partial orders associated to process terms of place/transition nets.In the second part concerning graph transformation and high-level replacement systems, new aspects of component modeling and application of graph transformation techniques are discussed:In their contribution on components for algebra transformation systems, Ehrig and Orejas define a component transformation semantics in terms of the semantics of the specifications included in the components. The underlying formal basis of the instantiation of their generic compone"

EP is defined in terms of three environmental impact categories: (1) carbon sequestration (2) groundwater recharge and (3) nitrate leaching. The core of the sDSS is a raster based geographical database which allows for queries addressing 14 types of questions on where, how and how long to afforest in order to reach a desired EP or change in EP due to afforestation of the agricultural land. First the study area is differentiated according to the site conditions (based on soil texture, soil drainage, initial land use, yearly average precipitation, and yearly average N deposition. Then the EP for every site class is computed as a function of time using the VSAM metamodel. VSAM results from a conceptual simplification of an existing mechanistic point model, the forest process model SMART2. Input data for the metamodel are limited to the classified site conditions, the tree species used for afforestation, the afforestation strategy and the evaluation time. Besides limiting the data requirements, the metamodel approach allows for rapid and flexible computations on large numbers of pixel classes. Finally, depending on the type of question, the sDSS creates georeferenced outputs based on SQL-type spatial or attribute queries and more advanced multiple goal programming techniques."
pub.1008876851,Defining visual notations and their manipulation through meta-modelling and graph transformation,"This paper presents a framework for the definition of visual notations (both syntax and semantics) based on meta-modelling and graph transformation. With meta-modelling it is possible to define the syntax of the notations we want to deal with. Meta-modelling tools are able to generate environments which accept models in the defined formalisms. These can be provided with further functionality by defining operations that can be performed to the models. One of the ways of defining such manipulations is through graph grammars, because models and meta-models can be represented as attributed, typed graphs. In this way, computations become high-level models expressed in the formal, graphical and intuitive notation of graph grammars. As an example, AToM3 is used to automatically generate a tool for a Discrete Event Simulation notation. The tool's functionality has been completely defined in a visual way through graph grammars, and includes a simulator (formalism's operational semantics), a transformation into Timed Transition Petri nets (denotational semantics), an optimizer and a code generator for a GPSS simulator."
pub.1025701430,Early modeling and validation of timed system requirements using Timed Use Case Maps,"There is a general consensus on the importance of good requirements engineering for achieving high-quality software. Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system in terms of services, tasks, or functions the system is required to perform, while non-functional requirements capture required properties of the system, such as timing, performance, and security. These non-functional requirements play a crucial role during system development life cycle serving as selection criteria for choosing among myriads of design decisions. The ability to model and validate the system non-functional properties at the requirements level supports the detection of design errors during the early stages of a software development life cycle and helps reduce the cost of later redesign activities. The widespread interest in time modeling and analysis techniques at the requirements phase provides the major motivation for this research. This paper presents a novel and fully automated approach to describe and validate high-level timed requirements using the Timed Use Case Maps language.
 We extend the, ITU-T standard User Requirements Notation, Use Case Maps metamodel with time requirements. The resulting extensions are implemented within the jUCMNav tool and formalized using Abstract State Machines allowing for automated simulation and analysis. We illustrate the applicability of our approach using a business process model (conference review process model) and a real-time system model (IP multicast routing case study)."
pub.1093651820,Subject-Oriented Modeling and Execution of Multi-agent Business Processes,"This paper addresses a gap in handling multi-agent business processes that has prevented their larger-scale adoption in practice: the lack of a conceptual modeling approach that is easily understandable by business domain experts and sufficiently formal for direct transformation into executable systems. The emerging paradigm of subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM), which has been evaluated through academic research and is increasingly deployed in commercial applications, has the potential to augment multi-agent system (MAS) models with a process-centric layer that preserves autonomy and concurrent interaction of agents as essential system characteristics. In this paper we provide an aligned meta-model and illustrate its operational benefits with examples from business process applications."
pub.1095285212,Process lines: a product line approach designed for process model development,"Standard process models like RUP or the German V-Modell XT are developed to be used in an organizational environment. Yet introducing such a process model into an organization is no simple task. It is usually accompanied by either reorganizing internal processes to comply with a standard process model or by adaptation of the process model to organizational structures. The latter is an approach that can often be found in practice and is subject to this paper. The paper describes a generalization of the process model architecture of the V-Modell XT 1.3. Compared to the previous version 1.2.1.1, its metamodel has completely been revised with respect to a new adaptation concept. We will see how this concept allows the implementation of a so called process line. Software process lines are derived from software product lines and can be used for the adaptation of standard processes during process model development, project initialization and project runtime."
pub.1009980992,Meta-model to Support End-User Development of Web Based Business Information Systems,"End-user development is proposed as a solution to the issues business people have when getting web applications developed. In this paper, we have presented a meta-model for web based information systems to support End-user Development. End-users can actively participate in web application development using tools to populate and instantiate the meta-model. The meta-model we created is based on three abstraction levels: Shell, Application, and Function. At Shell Level, we model aspects common to all business web applications such as navigation and access control. At Application Level, we model aspects common to specific web applications such as workflows. At Function Level, we model requirements specific to the identified use cases. Inheritance and Overriding properties of the meta-model provide a balance between ease and flexibility when developing business information systems. The key aspect that underpinned this research work is the view- “software is a medium to capture knowledge rather than a product”. Meta-model will help end-users to participate in web application development activities."
pub.1047483586,Modeling shared information spaces (SIS),"Many companies experience that their corporate intranet is getting complex and poorly manageable. We believe that developing a model for the website, or shared information space will make the management easier and provide solutions that support collaboration and knowledge sharing within the enterprise. The present paper proposes a meta model defining the conceptual building blocks of an information space. The meta model takes knowledge as well as information sharing into account by letting ontologies represent problem domains important to the enterprise, and be used as means of imposing structure on available information. To support the different needs of the employees the ability to interact with the information space through different perspectives is essential. An example of how the meta model can be deployed to support contextual retrieval of information in a workflow management application is described."
pub.1018375951,Towards a MOF/QVT-Based domain architecture for model driven security,"The Sectet-framework realizes an extensible domain architecture for the collaborative development and management of security-critical, inter-organizational workflows. Models integrate security requirements at the abstract level and are rendered in a visual language based on UML 2.0. The models form the input for a chain of integrated tools that transform them into artefacts configuring security components of a Web services-based architecture. Based on findings of various projects, this contribution has three objectives. First, we detail the MOF based metamodels defining a domain specific language for the design of inter-organizational workflows. The language supports various categories of security patterns. We then specify model-to-model transformations based on the MDA standard MOF-QVT. The mappings translate platform independent models into platform specific artefacts targeting the reference architecture. Third, we exemplarily show how model-to-code transformation could be implemented with an MDA-framework like openArchitectureWare."
pub.1032630599,Flexible software process lines in practice: A metamodel-based approach to effectively construct and manage families of software process models,"Process flexibility and adaptability is a frequently discussed topic in literature, and several approaches propose techniques to improve and optimize software processes for a given organization- or project context. A software process line (SPrL) is an instrument to systematically construct and manage variable software processes, by combining pre-defined and standardized process assets that can be reused, modified, and extended using a well-defined customization approach. Hence, process engineers can ground context-specific process variants in a standardized or domain-specific reference model that can be adapted to the respective context. In this article, we present an approach to construct flexible software process lines and show its practical application in the German V-Modell XT. The presented approach emerges from a 10-year research endeavor and was used to enhance the metamodel of the V-Modell XT and to allow for improved process variability and lifecycle management. Practical dissemination and complementing empirical research show the suitability of the concept. We therefore contribute a proven approach that is presented as metamodel fragment for reuse and implementation in further process modeling approaches."
pub.1169601666,Process modelling of biodiesel production process using genetic programming,"Biodiesel production is a complex process that involves a number of process parameters. These process parameters must be carefully optimized to increase its yield. In this paper, a process model for biodiesel production is developed by using genetic programming (GP). A case study on biodiesel production from palm oil transesterification is selected from the literature to analyze the proposed methodology. The dataset from literature is based on a central composite design (CCD) with four process parameters (namely methanol-to-oil ratio ( x 1 ), catalyst loading ( x 2 ), reaction time ( x 3 ) and reaction temperature ( x 4 )). The FAME yield % is the target response. The available CCD data is divided into dedicated training (90 %) and testing (10 %) sets to analyze and evaluate the predictive power of the GP metamodel. The GP metamodel is trained using the tuned parameters and validated on the testing data using various statistical metrics. A high accuracy with an R2 of 0.9676 for training data and 0.8834 for testing data is obtained. This study shows that the GP metamodel is a robust and accurate approach to model biodiesel production processes."
pub.1038780007,Form Follows Function,"We argue that, for certain constrained domains, elaborate model transformation technologies—implemented from scratch in general-purpose programming languages—are unnecessary for model-driven engineering; instead, lightweight configuration of commercial off-the-shelf productivity tools suffices. In particular, in the CancerGrid project, we have been developing model-driven techniques for the generation of software tools to support clinical trials. A domain metamodel captures the community’s best practice in trial design. A scientist authors a trial protocol, modelling their trial by instantiating the metamodel; customized software artifacts to support trial execution are generated automatically from the scientist’s model. The metamodel is expressed as an XML Schema, in such a way that it can be instantiated by completing a form to generate a conformant XML document. The same process works at a second level for trial execution: among the artifacts generated from the protocol are models of the data to be collected, and the clinician conducting the trial instantiates such models in reporting observations—again by completing a form to create a conformant XML document, representing the data gathered during that observation. Simple standard form management tools are all that is needed. Our approach is applicable to a wide variety of information-modelling domains: not just clinical trials, but also electronic public sector computing, customer relationship management, document workflow, and so on."
pub.1027353929,Automated Resource Assignment in BPMN Models Using RACI Matrices,"Organizations need to manage the responsibility of their employees with respect to all the activities that are daily carried out within them. Process-oriented organizations need to do it, in addition, in accordance to the business processes their members participate in. However, powerful mechanisms to manage responsibility in combination with business processes are missing in current modelling notations, usually limited to indicating who is in charge of undertaking the activities. RACI matrices, on the contrary, were specifically conceived to provide responsibility management information. They enable the specification of the level of responsibility each human resource has with regard to each activity carried out in a company, ranging from the performer of the work to the resource that must approve it or receive certain notifications. In this paper, we propose the use of RACI matrices together with business process models to manage human resource responsibilities in processes. Focused on a concrete type of RACI matrices, called RASCI, we introduce a novel approach to automatically generate a BPMN model with RASCI information given a BPMN model that does not handle resources, and a RASCI matrix. The resulting model is BPMN-compliant and, thus, it is ready to be executed in existing business process management systems. With this approach, the assignment of responsibilities and the management of processes can be designed separately, while being executed together."
pub.1092812183,Ontology-Based Laser and Thermal Metamodels for Metal-Based Additive Manufacturing,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising technology that is expected to revolutionize industry by allowing the production of almost any shape directly from a 3D model. In metal-based AM, numerous process parameters are highly interconnected, and their interconnections are not yet understood. Understanding this interconnectivity is the first step in building process control models that help make the process more repeatable and reliable. Metamodels can be used to conceptualize models of complex AM processes and capture diverse parameters to provide a graphical view using common terminology and modeling protocols. In this paper we consider different process models (laser and thermal) for metal-based AM and develop an AM Process Ontology from first-principles. We discuss and demonstrate its implementation in Protégé.Copyright © 2016 by ASME"
pub.1035158542,A Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering Method for Business Processes,"Central to the development of BPMS technology was the promotion of a new language, Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). The primary goal of BPMN is to provide a common language for describing process behaviour, shareable by business and IT, which includes business users, business analysts, and technical developers. What seems to be missing in the way that business users are supposed to use BPMN, is an explicit consideration of the strategic rationale of having certain business processes as well as support for describing business processes in terms familiar to business people. We extended current work on Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) for business process design, i.e., B-SCP framework [1] and the work of Lapouchnian et al. [2], in order to obtain an appropriate GORE for BPMN modelling method. Our first contribution is the introduction of a B-SCP metamodel, which has been implemented by means of the Eclipse Modelling Framework. Our second contribution is an Eclipse-based B-SCP editor that enables business users to specify their strategic requirements and operational tasks. Our third contribution consists of model transformations to generate BPMN skeletons out of the B-SCP model, which were implemented by means of the Atlas Transformation Language."
pub.1004888948,Managing software process measurement: A metamodel-based approach,"The evaluation of software processes is nowadays a very important issue due to the growing interest of software companies in the improvement of the productivity and quality of delivered products. Software measurement plays a fundamental role here. Given the great diversity of entities which are candidates for measurement in the software process improvement context (process models, projects, resources, products) this measurement must be performed in a consistent and integrated way. This will facilitate the making of decisions in process improvement. In this paper, a proposal for the integrated management of the software measurement is presented. The goal is to provide companies with a generic and flexible environment for software measurement which facilitates and establishes the basis for a common and effective measurement process and which is not restricted to only one kind of software entity or to a single quality or evaluation model. In order to achieve this, the proposal adopts the Model Driven Engineering philosophy and provides: a metamodel for the definition of software measurement models; a flexible method to measure any kind of software entity represented by its corresponding metamodel and GenMETRIC, which is the software tool that supports the framework."
pub.1118295472,Elements of style of BPMN language,"Several BPMN graphical tools support, at least partly, the OMG's BPMN
specification. The BPMN standard is an essential guide for tools' makers when
implementing the rules regarding depiction of BPMN diagrammatic constructs.
Process modelers should also know how to rigorously use BPMN constructs when
depicting business processes either for business or IT purposes. Several
already published OMG's standards include the formal specification of
well-formedness rules concern-ing the metamodels they address. However, the
BPMN standard does not. Instead, the rules regarding BPMN elements are only
informally specified in natural language throughout the overall BPMN
documentation. Without strict rules concerning the correct usage of BPMN
elements, no wonder that plenty of available BPMN tools fail to enforce BPMN
process models' correctness. To mitigate this problem, and therefore contribute
for achieving BPMN models' correctness, we propose to supplement the BPMN
metamodel with well-formedness rules expressed by OCL invariants. So, this
document contributes to bring together a set of requirements that tools' makers
must comply with, in order to claim a broader BPMN 2 compliance. For the
regular process modeler, this report provides an extensive and pragmatic
catalog of BPMN elements' usage, to be followed in order to attain correct BPMN
process models."
pub.1038922413,On the use of variability operations in the V‐Modell XT software process line,"Abstract Software process lines provide a systematic approach to develop and manage software processes. It defines a reference process containing general process assets, whereas a well‐defined customization approach allows process engineers to create new process variants, for example, by extending or modifying process assets. Variability operations are an instrument to realize flexibility by explicitly declaring required modifications, which are applied to create a procedurally generated company‐specific process. However, little is known about which variability operations are suitable in practice. In this article, we present a study on the feasibility of variability operations to support the development of software process lines in the context of the V‐Modell XT. We analyze which variability operations are defined and practically used. We provide an initial catalog of variability operations as an improvement proposal for other process models. Our findings show that 69 variability operation types are defined across several metamodel versions of which, however, 25 remain unused. The found variability operations allow for systematically modifying the content of process model elements and the process documentation, and they allow for altering the structure of a process model and its description. Furthermore, we also find that variability operations can help process engineers to compensate process metamodel evolution. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
pub.1095143945,Business Processes and Technical Processes A comprehensive meta model for execution and development,"The interaction between business processes and technical processes is getting more and more important. Throughout this paper, we present how concepts that are used in automation technology can be transferred into concepts that are suitable for use in business process modeling, too. An important aspect is the description of the procedures which have to be executed. In contrast to technical systems, humans as executing agents can, but do not have to follow predefined procedures due to their ability to use their knowledge to work independently in different situations. In a second part, the paper discusses the generation of business processes by project business processes on a meta model, and provides a reference model for a project business layer model."
pub.1095266397,Research on virtual laboratory information management based on metadata,"To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency in the virtual laboratory management, a VLIMS (virtual laboratory information management system) is needed. A meta-model and architecture for the VLIMS was discussed. The meta-model consisted of 6 basic entities. Using an expanded Web services description and search process, the architecture assembled the experimental workflow management of multi-heterogeneous system and supported data mining process, based on the metadata repository. The schema integration and evolution operation were analyzed, in order to implement schema matching and version management. The financial business example of Web services composition showed the services configuration and metadata function."
pub.1010210188,Modelling and engineering the requirements engineering process: An overview of the NATURE approach,This paper presents an overview of the process theory developed in the context of the ESPRIT project NATURE.1 This theory proposes means for modelling and engineering the requirements engineering (RE) process. The key element of this theory is a situation-and decision-based process meta-model independent of any RE methodology. The process meta-model acts as a shell for defining process models by instantiation. An enactment mechanism implemented in a tool environment has been defined. It allows execution of process models and provides effective guidance to the requirements engineer. Construction of process models is also supported based on generic method knowledge chunks. The formalization of our approach is based on a free algebra.
pub.1095708781,Using Agent Technology for Coordination in Loose Inter-Organizational Workflow,"This paper deals with coordination in the context of loose Inter-Organizational Workflow (IOW). The aim of IOW is to support the cooperation between business processes running in different organizations. Loose IOW refers to occasional cooperation between organizations, free of structural constraints, where the organizations involved and their number are not predefined. This paper shows that the agent technology is appropriate to coordinate business processes in the context of loose IOW. More precisely, this paper proposes an agent-oriented architecture, compliant with the Workflow Management Coalition reference architecture, which represents business processes as agents and uses mediators to coordinate them. This paper also defines an agent-oriented organizational model that describes the business processes coordination according to the Agent-Group-Role meta model."
pub.1104339660,Towards a meta-model for data ecosystems,"Data Ecosystems are socio-technical networks that enable collaboration between autonomous actors such as enterprises, institutions, and individuals. While Data Ecosystems are thus gaining importance, research into Data Ecosystems is still in its infancy stages. The terminology and definitions for Data Ecosystem vary greatly. This diversity imposes a pressing problem for the development of a clear understanding of the new opportunities and emergent challenges in exploiting Data Ecosystems. Accurate definitions are required to get a mutual understanding of what Data Ecosystems involve. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, a model for describing a Data Ecosystem and its essential concepts has not been proposed yet. In this work, we aim to fill these gaps by reviewing the Data Ecosystem literature, and based on the field literature, we propose a meta-model for describing Data Ecosystems. In particular, the proposed meta-model describes the Data Ecosystem fundamental concepts and their inter-relationships for enabling analysis and description of ecosystems. Especially, the meta-model declares explicitly how all these concepts are related to each other in such holistic view, hence facilitating knowledge creation and management in the ecosystem."
pub.1094600623,Integrated Enterprise Modelling Based on OMG Specifications,"A solid business model (describing the business strategy, a business vocabulary, business rules as well as business processes) plays an essential role when building an IT-architecture for agile enterprises. Recently the object management group (OMG) has developed a set of specifications that standardize such business models. This presentation briefly introduces the OMG specifications business motivation model (BMM), semantics of business vocabularies and rules (SBVR), business process modeling notation (BPMN) and organization structure metamodel (OSM). Then, by means of further OMG specifications, such as executable UML (xUML), Systems Modelling Language (SysML) and model driven architecture (MDA) it is shown, how such business models may be transformed into a SOA-based IT-landscape."

An important aspect of this method is access control rules that determine what users can access what data under what conditions. This paper describes an extension of Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) for defining these access control rules. A tool supports the creation of these data access control rules by a combination of a matrix format and conditions given in SBVR Structured English. The rules are stored according to the SBVR metamodel, and may be visualized either as individual rules or in a matrix."

While carrying out empirical process research in software companies in order to model reusable process components with SPEM, we have faced issues that concern Software Process Improvement (SPI) more generally. To understand the general context we have structured these issues into five important aspects of SPI. In this paper we present each aspect through its challenges and opportunities from the process modeling point of view. Consequently, we claim that by overcoming the challenges, process modeling will bring new concrete opportunities for SPI."

pub.1039814415,A metamodeling framework for extending the application domain of process‐based ecological models,"Process‐based ecological models used to assess organisms' responses to environmental conditions often need input data at a high temporal resolution, e.g., hourly or daily weather data. Such input data may not be available at a high spatial resolution for large areas, limiting opportunities to use such models. Here we present a metamodeling framework to develop reduced form ecological models that use lower resolution input data than the original process models. We used generalized additive models to create metamodels for an existing model that uses hourly data to predict risk of potato late blight, caused by the plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans. The metamodels used daily or monthly weather data, and their predictions maintained the key features of the original model. This approach can be applied to other complex models, allowing them to be used more widely."
pub.1009503507,Multiparametric Metamodels for Model Predictive Control of Chemical Processes,"This work proposes a Data-Based MultiParametric-Model Predictive Control (DBMP-MPC) methodology, which enables simple implementations of explicit MPC in situations when the deep mathematical knowledge required to develop traditional MP-MPC techniques is not available. Additionally, it can also assist in situations when it is difficult to apply traditional MP-MPC, due to the process model complexity or high nonlinearity. The proposed method uses machine learning techniques (Ordinary Kriging (OK), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)), which are trained offline using input-output information. During the online application, the optimal control is calculated through simple interpolations using these multiparametric metamodels, avoiding the need for dynamic optimization. The method is tested with benchmark problems used in the MP-MPC literature. The results show high accuracy and robustness using a simple method, bypassing complex mathematical formulations."
pub.1155196601,Integration of Internet of Things in BPM Lifecycle: Concepts and Comparison of Approaches,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that appeared in 1998; it describes a world made up of intelligent devices organized in a network, which can be connected to each other but also to the external environment. The technology of IoT touches several fields of application among them the field of business process management (BPM) where intelligent devices are considered as additional resources delivering a huge amount of data (big data) and have effect on the execution of business process instances. The integration of connected objects in a business process improves business performance where IoT devices are managed in an efficient manner. The objective of this paper is to define the main concepts related to BPM and IoT and propose a meta-model highlighting the links between these concepts. Also, the paper synthesizes existing works addressing the integration of IoT technology in the life cycle of BPM and shows the impact of IoT on each phase of the BPM lifecycle. Finally, the paper evokes open questions of BPM in the context of IoT."
pub.1006941964,From conceptual process models to running systems: A holistic approach for the configuration of enterprise system processes,"This paper proposes a method which aims at increasing the efficiency of enterprise system implementations. First, we argue that existing process modeling languages that feature different degrees of abstraction for different user groups exist and are used for different purposes which makes it necessary to integrate them. We describe how to do this using the meta models of the involved languages. Second, we argue that an integrated process model based on the integrated meta model needs to be configurable and elaborate on the enabling mechanisms. We introduce a business example using SAP modeling techniques to illustrate the proposed method."

pub.1162964069,A Proposal for a Continuum-aware Programming Model: From Workflows to Services Autonomously Interacting in the Compute Continuum,"This paper proposes a continuum-aware programming model enabling the execution of application workflows across the compute continuum: cloud, fog and edge resources. It simplifies the management of heterogeneous nodes while alleviating the burden of programmers and unleashing innovation. This model optimizes the continuum through advanced development experiences by transforming workflows into autonomous service collaborations. It reduces complexity in positioning/interconnecting services across the continuum. A meta-model introduces high-level workflow descriptions as service networks with defined contracts and quality of service, thus enabling the deployment/management of workflows as first-class entities. It also provides automation based on policies, monitoring and heuristics. Tailored mechanisms orchestrate/manage services across the continuum, optimizing performance, cost, data protection and sustainability while managing risks. This model facilitates incremental development with visibility of design impacts and seamless evolution of applications and infrastructures. In this work, we explore this new computing paradigm showing how it can trigger the development of a new generation of tools to support the compute continuum progress."
pub.1035500146,Enabling Self-adaptive Workflows for Cyber-physical Systems,"The ongoing development of Internet of Things technologies leads to the interweaving of the virtual world of software with the physical world. However, applying workflow technologies for automating processes in these Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) poses new challenges as the real world effects of a process have to be verified to provide a consistent view of the cyber and physical world executions. In this work we present a synchronization and adaptation mechanism for processes based on the MAPE-K feedback loop for self-adaptive systems. By applying this loop, sensor and context information can be used to verify the real world effects of workflow execution and adapt the process in case of errors. The approach increases autonomy and resilience of process execution in CPS due to the self-adaptation capabilities. We present generic extensions to process meta-models and execution engines to implement the feedback loop and discuss our approach within a smart home scenario."
pub.1112668458,Infracomposer: Policy-driven adaptive and reflective middleware for the cloudification of simulation & optimization workflows,"The simulation and optimization of complex engineering designs in automotive or aerospace involves multiple mathematical tools, long-running workflows and resource-intensive computations on distributed infrastructures. Finding the optimal deployment in terms of task distribution, parallelization, collocation and resource assignment for each execution is a step-wise process involving both human input with domain-specific knowledge about the tools as well as the acquisition of new knowledge based on the actual execution history. In this paper, we present a policy-driven adaptive and reflective middleware that supports smart cloud-based deployment and execution of engineering workflows. This middleware supports deep inspection of the workflow task structure and execution, as well as of the very specific mathematical tools, their executions and used parameters. The reflective capabilities are based on multiple meta-models to reflect workflow structure, deployment, execution and resources. Adaptive deployment is driven by both human input as meta-data annotations as well as adaptation policies that reason over the actual execution history of the workflows. We validate and evaluate this middleware in real-life application cases and scenarios in the domain of aeronautics."

In this paper, by analyzing quality problem tracing-back process and resource configuration optimization process, aiming at multi-failure, multi-resource configuration and multi-targets optimization of quality problem tracing-back, the technology of workflow is applied, quality problem tracing-back and failure information management workflow meta-model is established, then quality problem tracing-back management workflow resource model is designed, and based on this model, the resource configuration optimization model is designed which is aiming at minimizing cost and time. In this way, optimum resource chain is obtained considering cost and time synthetically, which provide the support for tracing-back multi-failure problem fast and effectively. Then, the realization mechanism of workflow model is researched and information of the quality problem tracing-back workflow process is monitored, which improve the work efficiency and collaboration of dealing with failure problem in the process of quality information management. Finally optimization model and method is analyzed by an instance of quality problem tracing-back process of an engine's vane."

This ability should be defined by different uncertain computer-based components inside the classic BPMSs operations. This study proposed autonomous and combinatorial optimal process management architecture to increase the ability, flexibility, and accuracy of uncertain processes management. The autonomous architecture based on the bi-level optimization approach has been constructed inward a meta-model of multi-agent system technology, optimal Neural Network and Cellular Learning Automata in different agents.

pub.1008527029,A Meta-model for Analyzing the Influence of Production-related Business Processes,"The improvement of business processes is viewed as a key to competitive success. Since the beginning of the 1990s, many companies could increase their efficiency through initiatives improving the production process. Despite the existence of numerous different scientific approaches to improve the supporting processes of indirect business areas, comparable successes could not be achieved. In the literature for business process management, the described guidelines and methods for process prioritization are often of very high level and hence not of much assistance when attempting to use them on production-related business processes. Further approaches focus the modelling and analyzing of single processes. These are often very detailed and do not taking into account the interrelations and influences that arise between the processes. An analysis and comparative evaluation of the production-related business processes of indirect areas does not exist. This paper presents an approach to analyze the influence of supporting business processes on the goals of their core process. Therefore, a meta-model is introduced to describe different types of interrelations between processes within in a process system by specific characteristics. The considered system includes the manufacturing process and its support processes as the interrelating elements. Based on the meta-model, influencing factors of the support processes on the characteristic values of the manufacturing process are determined. The paper contributes to theories on business process architecture and the modeling of process systems as well as the basics on system theory. In the literature review of this paper, different approaches for the selection of critical processes, the modelling of process systems and the interdependencies between processes are discussed."
pub.1119464833,DiscopFlow: A new Tool for Discovering Organizational Structures and Interaction Protocols in WorkFlow,"This work deals with Workflow Mining (WM) a very active and promising
research area. First, in this paper we give a critical and comparative study of
three representative WM systems of this area: the ProM, InWolve and
WorkflowMiner systems. The comparison is made according to quality criteria
that we have defined such as the capacity to filter and convert a Workflow log,
the capacity to discover workflow perspectives and the capacity to support
Multi-Analysis of processes. The major drawback of these systems is the non
possibility to deal with organizational perspective discovering issue. We mean
by organizational perspective, the organizational structures (federation,
coalition, market or hierarchy) and interaction protocols (contract net,
auction or vote). This paper defends the idea that organizational dimension in
Multi-Agent System is an appropriate approach to support the discovering of
this organizational perspective. Second, the paper proposes a Workflow log
meta-model which extends the classical one by considering the interactions
among actors thanks to the FIPA-ACL Performatives. Third, it describes in

pub.1155154422,Product-Line Architecture Designing with SMartyComponents,"The SPL Architecture (PLA) is one of the main artifacts of an SPL. It represents an abstraction of all possible products that can be generated from an SPL. Important PLA requirements include (i) remain stable during the SPL lifetime, (ii) easy integration of new features during the architecture life cycle, and (iii) explicit representation of variability for providing reuse. Therefore, this chapter presents the SMartyComponents process for designing UML-based PLAs. SMartyComponents is based on the UML Components process and provides systematic activities to modeling component-based PLAs based on the SMarty approach, mainly focused on component diagram elements, such as components, interfaces, ports, and operations according to the standard UML metamodel. Workflows of SMartyComponents include: Requirements Workflow and Specification Workflow. The former is composed of activities as Develop Business Concept Model, Develop Business Processes, and Identify Use Cases. The latter activities are Component Identification, Component Interactions, and Component Specification. The main product developed using SMartyComponents is a component-based PLA with variabilities modeled in components, interfaces, ports, and operations."

pub.1119411456,SLALOM: a Language for SLA specification and monitoring,"IT services provisioning is usually underpinned by service level agreements
(SLAs), aimed at guaranteeing services quality. However, there is a gap between
the customer perspective (business oriented) and that of the service provider
(implementation oriented) that becomes more evident while defining and
monitoring SLAs. This paper proposes a domain specific language (SLA Language
for specificatiOn and Monitoring - SLALOM) to bridge the previous gap. The
first step in SLALOM creation was factoring out common concepts, by composing
the BPMN metamodel with that of the SLA life cycle, as described in ITIL. The
derived metamodel expresses the SLALOM abstract syntax model. The second step
was to write concrete syntaxes targeting different aims, such as SLA
representation in process models. An example of SLALOM's concrete syntax model
instantiation for an IT service sup-ported by self-service financial terminals
is presented."

This step is a strongly cooperative process that brings into interaction three roles with different skills and prerequisites. This paper proposes a workflow-based solution providing a cooperative space for these involved roles and an execution environment of the instances of the law study process. In addition, it also allows the assessment and the validation of the resulting legal requirements through a law meta-model."

The examples used in the article are motivated by the insurance company domain.
pub.1101459442,Using Ontologies for Business Capability modelling: Describing What Services and Processes Achieve,"In current business process modelling environments, the functional perspective (also can be referred to in the literature as business capability, functionality or business function) for each process activity is limited to its label. Using labels only prevents stakeholders from easily and quickly understanding what business processes or services achieve. In this paper, we define a business capability meta-model that can be used for modelling business capabilities as entities composed of a set of actions and related properties. This meta-model is implemented as Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies that help experts design their domain-specific high-level business capabilities that can be used for annotating their processes, services, applications, etc. We validate the business capability meta-model by using two evaluation methods: (1) ontological evaluation in order to make sure that there is no semantic ambiguity among its constructs; (2) interviews with domain experts to assess the ability of the model to represent real capabilities and to evaluate their point of view with respect to our approach."
pub.1005867071,A Goal-Oriented Meta-Model for Scientific Research,"In many research domains, studies need to be addressed in a multidisciplinary manner: each expert deals with a particular aspect of the problem. It may be useful for experts to take into account new data, share partial results, and update their own indicators and models, in order to take advantage of new measures and updated indexes in real time. For this, an easily-understandable knowledge model for any raw data source, statistical operator, indicator or business process to be available for experts, is needed. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented meta-model, to index and reuse treatments and an extension of existing semantic Web standards to index goal-oriented services and assist and/or automate their selection. These features enable capabilities for interoperability and information exchange between three layers of knowledge: goal, domain and data layers. An application with an existing ontology of the agriculture domain and farm durability indicators will be proposed."

Managing a software process in which team members are physically distributed is challenging. How to use the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) in geographically distributed development is an area with a number of open research issues. We define a CMM Software Process (CSP) by a set of generic process elements in accordance with the requirements of the CMM. Using the Model Driven Architecture (MDA), the CSP model can be transformed into distributed CMM implementation process models. This paper presents a metamodel for the CSP model, named MM-CSP, and provides the abstract syntax and the semantic of the MM-CSP as well as a UML profile for the MM-CSP. Based on the MM-CSP, a prototype tool for CSP modeling is developed."
pub.1007656439,"“Adore”, a logical meta-model supporting business process evolution","The Service Oriented Architecture (Soa) paradigm supports the assembly of atomic services to create applications that implement complex business processes. Since “real-life” processes can be very complex, composition mechanisms inspired by the Separation of Concerns paradigm (e.g. features, aspects) are good candidates to support the definition and the upcoming evolutions of large systems. We propose Adore, “an Activity meta-moDel supOrting oRchestration Evolution” to address this issue. The Adore meta-model allows process designers to express in the same formalism business processes and fragments of processes. Such fragments define additional activities that aim to be integrated into other processes and adequately support their evolution. The underlying logical foundations of Adore allow the definition of interference detection rules as logical predicate, as well as the definition of consistency properties on Adore models. Consequently, the Adore framework supports process designers while they design and then apply evolutions on large processes, managing the detection of interferences among fragments and ensuring that the composed processes are consistent and do not depend on the order of the composition."
pub.1094432938,Interactive-Event-Based Workflow Simulation in Service Oriented,"The evolution of grid technologies has brought to the world a loosely coupled environment that enables flexible integration among heterogeneous systems. On building a service-oriented architecture for grid systems, more and more research is focused on service composition, in which workflow and simulation techniques have shown great potential. Simulation of services' interaction is important since the services ecosystem is unstable and in continuous evolution. However, there is a lack in the research of services' simulation, especially models and methods for simulating interactions between composite services. In this paper a workflow simulation method based on interactive events is proposed to fulfil this requirement. By introducing an event submodel in the workflow meta-model, the event interaction pattern is achieved from both the build-time and run-time perspectives. With an example simulated in the prototype system developed according to our method, the advantages of our method in model verification and QoS evaluation for service composition are also highlighted"
pub.1094301270,ARDE: A Novel Framework to Define Workflow Participants,"The organizational structures-based workflow participant definition, which appoints activity executors according to user's role, department or ID, is widely used in commercial workflow management systems presently. This approach lacks of flexible mechanisms for complex participants assignment. This paper described a novel approach (ARDE) to define workflow participants. ARDE defines participant from four facets, namely Assignment, Rule, Duration and Exception. Assignment uses an SQL-like language to define the qualification that activity participants must meet. Rule expresses a regulation to choose user(s) from all of qualified participants to undertake the task at runtime. The regulation considers the use's context, including workload, online and vacancy, etc. Duration is the interval during which the task starts and completes. Exception represents the handling strategy when a task cannot be finished in the planned duration. In order to enforce the expression capacity, an organizational meta-model, several built-in functions and an entity outdata are introduced in this article."
pub.1094665344,Using Work System Theory to Link Managerial and Technical Perspectives on BPM,"Work system theory (WST) provides a bridge between managerial and technical perspectives on BPM that often seem distant from each other. In combination, the work system framework, underlying work system metamodel, and the work system life cycle model provide a number of bridges between those perspectives. In relation to managerial BPM, the work system framework treats “business process” as one of nine elements in a basic understanding of a work system. The others are participants, information, technology, products/services, customers, environment, infrastructure, and strategies. The underlying metamodel outlines a precise structure for analysis and design of work systems and for links to technical aspects of BPM. It provides details that are omitted from the work system framework, which has proven useful for initial high level summaries but is not granular enough to support detailed design and documentation. The work system life cycle model combines planned and unplanned (emergent) change through which work systems evolve. This paper explains where WST fits in the general realm of BPM-related topics and how WST might help in developing BPM further. It also identifies challenges and next steps related to using WST to expand the scope of BPM."
pub.1036851048,Test Data Generation for Model Transformations Combining Partition and Constraint Analysis,"Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a software engineering paradigm where models play a key role. In a MDE-based development process, models are successively transformed into other models and eventually into the final source code by means of a chain of model transformations. Since writing model transformations is an error-prone task, mechanisms to ensure their reliability are greatly needed. One way of achieving this is by means of testing. A challenging aspect when testing model transformations is the generation of adequate input test data. Most existing approaches generate test data following a black-box approach based on some sort of partition analysis that exploits the structural features of the source metamodel of the transformation. However, these analyses pay no attention to the OCL invariants of the metamodel or do it very superficially. In this paper, we propose a mechanism that systematically analyzes OCL constraints in the source metamodel in order to fine-tune this partition analysis and therefore, the generation of input test data. Our mechanism can be used in isolation, or combined with other black-box or white-box test generation approaches."
pub.1044015233,Evaluating Maintainability of MDA Software Process Models,"The description of a software process is called a process model. As well as traditional software processes/methods (e.g. RUP, XP, OSDP, etc.) an MDA software process requires the selection of metamodels and mapping rules for the generation of the transformation chain that produces models and application code. Before software process enactment, process models should be evaluated in order to improve some quality attributes and maintainability is one of the main factors for software process reuse and improvement. This paper presents a conceptual framework including a metrics suite to evaluate maintainability of MDA process models. We also describe an empirical assessment involving three case studies where the metrics suite was applied to over five MDA process models. We compared the results indicated by the measurements with software engineer opinions surveyed by an online questionnaire. We found that the results from the metrics-based conceptual framework application match software engineers’ perceptions."
pub.1027598635,On the Equivalence of Incremental and Fixpoint Semantics for Business Artifacts with Guard-Stage-Milestone Lifecycles,"Business artifacts (BAs, or artifacts) are used to model conceptual entities that are central to guiding the operations of a business, and whose content changes as they move through those operations. The recently introduced Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model for artifact lifecycles is declarative in nature, and allows concurrent execution of long-running (possibly human-executed) activities. Modularity is incorporated through the use of hierarchical clustering of activities. The GSM operational semantics is based on a variant of Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules, which are used to control the start and termination of individual and composite activities. This paper introduces, in an abstract setting, three different and provably equivalent formulations of the GSM operational semantics. The semantics is specified in terms of how a single external event is incorporated into the current “snapshot” (i.e. full description) of a running execution of an artifact model. The “incremental” formulation corresponds to the sequential application of the ECA-like rules in response to the event; the “fixpoint” formulation characterizes the mathematical properties of pairs of snapshots corresponding to the full impact of incorporating the event; and the “closed-form” formulation captures the fixpoint one in terms of first-order logic. The paper introduces a formally specified well-formedness condition on GSM models that guarantees the equivalence of the three formulations while permitting all of the commonly arising patterns for using GSM constructs to model business operations."
pub.1147938835,Executable modeling method based on the ROAD-CPN business architecture,"The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) business architecture is a benchmark for data architecture, application architecture and technical architecture, and occupies a guiding role in the design of enterprise system architecture. However, due to the limitation of its description form, it cannot analyze the dynamic characteristics of the business architecture. In this paper, a colored petri net (CPN) executable model generation method based on ROAD business architecture is proposed. The method is based on the four types of models proposed by the division of the ACF meta-model of TOGAF business architecture - Rule Model (RM), Organization Model (OM), Activity Model (AM) and Data Model (DM), establishes the correspondence between the different description forms of the four types of models and the CPN modeling language, and then proposes the five-stage modeling method of executable models with RM, OM, AM and DM as the main body. Finally, the feasibility of the method is verified by taking the business architecture of the kindergarten intelligent morning inspection robot system as an example. It achieves creation of CPN executable model and breaks the limitations of business architecture’s modeling languages and CPN model’s modeling language."
pub.1048556678,Modeling Organizational Structures and Agent Knowledge for Mulan Applications,"In software engineering the initial setup of a system, as well as the self-adaptation processes within a system are challenging tasks. We address these challenges by providing explications of organizational structures through modeling. In this paper we present a service-oriented perspective on the organizational structure of MAS and we present modeling techniques and tools for supporting this perspective. We pursue a model-driven approach and a tight integration between various models on the one hand and between the models and the generated code on the other hand. In particular, we use ontologies to define a meta-model for organizational structures in a way that we can easily generate the initial content of agent knowledge bases in the form of FIPA semantic language (SL) fragments, depending on the positions the agents occupy in the context of the organizational structure. This allows the agents to reason and to communicate about their organizational embedding, which is a prerequisite for self-adaptation in multi-agent systems."
pub.1061173935,A framework for comparing models of computation,"We give a denotational framework (a ""meta model"") within which certain properties of models of computation can be compared. It describes concurrent processes in general terms as sets of possible behaviors. A process is determinate if, given the constraints imposed by the inputs, there are exactly one or exactly zero behaviors. Compositions of processes are processes with behaviors in the intersection of the behaviors of the component processes. The interaction between processes is through signals, which are collections of events. Each event is a value-tag pair, where the tags can come from a partially ordered or totally ordered set. Timed models are where the set of tags is totally ordered. Synchronous events share the same tag, and synchronous signals contain events with the same set of tags. Synchronous processes have only synchronous signals as behaviors. Strict causality (in timed tag systems) and continuity (in untimed tag systems) ensure determinacy under certain technical conditions. The framework is used to compare certain essential features of various models of computation, including Kahn process networks, dataflow, sequential processes, concurrent sequential processes with rendezvous, Petri nets, and discrete-event systems."
pub.1086686331,BPMN-Based Model-Driven Testing of Service-Based Processes,"Executable Business Processes realized in WS-BPEL and BPMN2 are used more and more for automating digitalized core processes in organizations. Due to their critical nature for the organization, these processes need to be developed with high quality standards. Existing literature concentrates on testing such processes, but do not offer integration into the development lifecycle and validation with other stakeholders. Our approach is based on Test Models that allow both the easier definition of automated test cases as well as discussion with non-technical stakeholders and, thus, can be used for business process validation and process modeling support. We define a meta-model for the BPMN-based Test Models that has been validated in a case study in an industrial project."
pub.1142171100,BPMN2EVENTB Supporting Transformation from BPMN2.0 to Event B Using Kermeta,"Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) has acquired increasing relevance in business process modeling. However, it suffers, as all semi-formal languages, from the lack of rigorous semantic which hinder its full adoption and makes impossible the verification of relevant properties. In this paper, a model-driven approach for the verification of BPMN2.0 models using the Event B method is proposed. When the complexity of the target system increases, the traceability of Event B model elements back to the original BPMN model becomes a tedious task and failures to verify properties can be difficult to understand. For this reason, the proposed approach is adapted to keep trace of the transformation process in the format of a serialized file. It is automated through mapping rules implemented in a first prototype tool called BPMN2EVENTB."
pub.1085532613,Automated Uncertainty Quantification Through Information Fusion in Manufacturing Processes,"Abstract Evaluation of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as energy consumption is essential for decision-making during the design and operation of smart manufacturing systems. The measurements of KPIs are strongly affected by several uncertainty sources such as input material uncertainty, the inherent variability in the manufacturing process, model uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the sensor measurements of operational data. A comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty sources and their effect on the KPIs is required to make the manufacturing processes more efficient. Towards this objective, this paper proposed an automated methodology to generate a hierarchical Bayesian network (HBN) for a manufacturing system from semantic system models, physics-based models, and available data in an automated manner, which can be used to perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis. The semantic system model, which is a high-level model describing the system along with its parameters, is assumed to be available in the generic modeling environment (GME) platform. Apart from semantic description, physics-based models, if available, are assumed to be available in model libraries. The proposed methodology was divided into two tasks: (1) automated hierarchical Bayesian network construction using the semantic system model, available models and data, and (2) automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis. A metamodel of an HBN was developed using the GME, along with a syntax representation for the associated conditional probability tables/distributions. The constructed HBN corresponding to a system was represented as an instance model of the HBN metamodel. On the metamodel, a model interpreter was written to be able to carry out the UQ analysis in an automated manner for any HBN instance model conforming to the HBN metamodel. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated using an injection molding process."
pub.1093419580,Methodological Limitations of Modeling Languages BPMN and ARIS,In this paper we briefly explain the main idea of business process management and its general importance as well as connected necessity of the unity of the technology and business perspectives. Then we discuss those general problems of modeling languages BPMN and ARIS which are important at the above mentioned business-technology border. As a basis for deriving the critical requirements for a language as well as for comparing both languages we use the “MMABP Business Process Meta-Model”. This semi-formal specification expresses the basic requirements for the modeling languages from both technical as well as business perspectives and abstracts their non essential features. It allows us to focus on just those features of the given language which are essential from both perspectives. In conclusions we summarize main findings and outline the corresponding primary fields of the future development of standards of this type.
pub.1024264452,Towards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages,"The increasing interest in process engineering and application integration has resulted in the appearance of various new process modelling languages. Understanding and comparing such languages has therefore become a major problem in information systems research and development. We suggest a framework to solve this problem involving several instruments: a general process meta-model with a table, an analysis of the event concept, and a classification of concepts according to the interrogative pronouns: what, how, why, who, when, and where. This framework can be used for several purposes, such as translating between languages or verifying that relevant organisational aspects have been captured. To validate the framework, three different process modelling languages have been compared: Business Modelling Language (BML), Event-driven Process Chains (EPC) and UML State Diagrams."
pub.1169400625,A semantic model-based systems engineering approach for assessing the operational performance of metal forming process,"Metal Forming is a basic and essential industrial process to provide materials for constructing complex products. To design an efficient metal forming process, the functional requirements and operational performance are two important aspects to be considered. In this paper, a semantic Model-based Systems Engineering (sMBSE) approach is proposed to support the design of the entire metal forming process. A multi-architecture modeling language KARMA is used to develop meta-models and architecture models of the metal forming process from the perspectives of mission, operation, function, logic flow and physical structure. Enabled by customized software, the KARMA models are transformed to ontology models, which are then converted to Petri Net (PN) models. Simulations are conducted based on the PN models to evaluate the operational performance of the created processes. A case study based on a real metal forming scenario is conducted to evaluate the proposed approach using quantitative and qualitative analysis. The result proves that the proposed approach enables to formalize the entire architecture modeling for metal forming process; and to provide an efficient approach for evaluating the operational performance of the designed solution for initial verification."
pub.1049401960,Quantifying uncertainty on Pareto fronts with Gaussian process conditional simulations,"Multi-objective optimization algorithms aim at finding Pareto-optimal solutions. Recovering Pareto fronts or Pareto sets from a limited number of function evaluations are challenging problems. A popular approach in the case of expensive-to-evaluate functions is to appeal to metamodels. Kriging has been shown efficient as a base for sequential multi-objective optimization, notably through infill sampling criteria balancing exploitation and exploration such as the Expected Hypervolume Improvement. Here we consider Kriging metamodels not only for selecting new points, but as a tool for estimating the whole Pareto front and quantifying how much uncertainty remains on it at any stage of Kriging-based multi-objective optimization algorithms. Our approach relies on the Gaussian process interpretation of Kriging, and bases upon conditional simulations. Using concepts from random set theory, we propose to adapt the Vorob’ev expectation and deviation to capture the variability of the set of non-dominated points. Numerical experiments illustrate the potential of the proposed workflow, and it is shown on examples how Gaussian process simulations and the estimated Vorob’ev deviation can be used to monitor the ability of Kriging-based multi-objective optimization algorithms to accurately learn the Pareto front."
pub.1093398583,An IT-Driven Business Model Design Methodology and Its Evaluation,"IT has changed business model and business process, and has become an essential ingredient for the competitive advantage. Under such circumstances, a conventional requirements engineering methodology is not sufficient. We propose an IT-driven business model design methodology in order to take advantage of innovative information technologies. The proposed methodology includes XBMC (eXtended BMC), an extension of BMC (Business Model Canvas) of BMG (Business Model Generation) as a framework to visualize a business architecture with a holistic view, and SMC (System Model Canvas) as a new model to visualize overall system architecture, correspondingly. In addition, we propose BSTM (Business-System Translation Meta-model) to align business architecture and system architecture based on the business meta-model and goal model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by applying it to the case of a mobile music delivery business."
pub.1042273646,Bridging the Gap between Business Processes and Service Composition through Service Choreographies,"Inter-organizational business processes implementations using service composition approaches are being more and more used. We want to reduce the semantic gap that exists between both worlds (business processes and services) through service choreographies, a composition approach that we think it is semantically close to multi-party business processes. We rely on modeling techniques as abstraction layers and view separation to achieve our goal. Our start point is a web service choreography meta-model presented in three abstraction layers where each layer is divided in a structural and a behavioral view. The meta-model can be used in a top-down or a bottom-up approach to make a progressive transition between the business process and the service world."
pub.1007817905,A Reference Methodology for Conducting Ontological Analyses,"The ontological analysis of conceptual modelling techniques is of increasing popularity. Related research did not only explore the ontological deficiencies of classical techniques such as ER or UML, but also business process modelling techniques such as ARIS or even Web services standards such as BPEL4WS. While the selected ontologies are reasonably mature, it is the actual process of an ontological analysis that still lacks rigor. The current procedure leaves significant room for individual interpretations and is one reason for criticism of the entire ontological analysis.

pub.1095548847,Knowledge Framework for Clinical Processes Architecture and Analysis,"Last decades have introduced different improvements into health care information systems domain including features like open interfaces to clinical facilities, improved patients registers, connectivity to insurance companies, and clinical pathways and workflows. The last named - clinical pathways and workflows - is a part of a complex area known as process modeling and architecture and except the control and management it also offers additional advantages like process optimization, re-engineering, analysis, and automatized process execution. This paper discusses application of explicit knowledge profiles based on process meta-model within clinical processes, alignment with visual process modeling, and further analysis with simulation and reverse engineering methods."
pub.1095446467,Process-Service Interactions Using a SOA-BPM-Based Methodology,"Reducing the gap between the definition, modeling and management of business definition, modeling and management of business processes and the realization of the main processes functions through software services requires a methodological approach. Addressing such gap, this paper focuses on the interactions between the activities of a business process and the functionality provided by software services. It presents a meta-model to formally specify such interactions. The proposed meta-model is instantiated through a case study. Lessons learnt through the development of an example were used to define a graphic editor prototype, as an automated tool for managing interactions between business processes and software services. The proposed approach enables the alternative application of top-down and bottom-up analysis techniques for modeling processes and services, and assists developers with an integrated tool for modeling business processes and software services in a seamlessly combined way."
pub.1050872661,Enabling Ad-hoc Business Process Adaptations through Event-Driven Task Decoupling,"The ability to adapt running process instances is a key requirement to handle exceptions in service orchestrations. The design of the orchestration middleware and its underlying meta-model plays an important role to fulfill this requirement. However, current service orchestration middleware such as BPEL engines suffer from their imperative and tightly coupled task execution mechanisms making it difficult to adapt running process instances. In this paper we present a novel service orchestration middleware and its underlying meta-model to overcome this limitation. To achieve this, we combine the benefits of the models@runtime concept with the event-driven publish-subscribe mechanism. We evaluate our approach for its support to process instance adaptation and compare its performance to an existing orchestration runtime."

pub.1014795982,Modeling Group-Based Education,"Currently, one of the most important application domains for Software Engineering is distance education and e-learning. There exist some standards/specifications that deal with the definition of both the data models and services needed in this environment. Among them, Educational Modelling Languages (EMLs) define the content and process within a unit of instruction. Nevertheless, current EMLs do not completely cover the whole educational scenarios. This paper uses workflow management techniques to present a conceptual meta-model for group-based educational design. This meta-model includes all required elements, flows and policies needed in this domain. Lacks in current Educational Modelling Languages will be identified to model group-based education."
pub.1095457243,Modeling and Management of Baoxie Sensor Web Resources based on the Node Meta-Model,"Sensor web is a complex system consisting of various distributed node resources. The standardized modeling and integrated management of heterogeneous nodes would lay the foundation for constructing efficient and reliable sensor web systems. This paper presents an approach for node modeling and management based on the sensor web node meta-model. According to the nine-tuple node metadata structures defined in the meta-model framework, the node modeling workflow is designed and applied in the experimental field in Baoxie Town. The soil moisture monitoring nodes are selected as examples to test the availability of the proposed modeling method. With the core unit and service connection features described, the different resource models and services could be integrated into one unified management platform through model reuse and service combination. The experiments of Baoxie sensor web system prove that the proposed method can provide a powerful tool for the integrated management of node resources."
pub.1094291402,The Verification Approach to Complex Tasks' Functional Specification in Software Crowdsourcing,"Software crowdsourcing is an emerging approach that involves delegating varieties of tasks to a decentralized, multiscale and unknown workforce. Preparing a complex development job for crowdsourcing markets requires careful attention to workflow design, the process of decomposing job into multiple subtasks. This paper presents a general-purpose approach to verify the complex task's decomposition scheme and its functional specification. Our meta-model adopts the structured objectoriented formal language (SOFL) to accurately describe the task decomposition scheme, avoiding the fuzziness and ambiguity with the natural language. Based on this meta-model, we present a formal approach to verifying the functional specification of task decomposition. This approach can verify the decomposition specification of each subtask's internal inconsistencies and determine whether it is consistent with its original task. We describe our meta-model, verification approach and a case study on a software crowdsourcing task that demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach."

pub.1042500271,A Meta-model-Framework for Structuring the Requirement Analysis in Process Design,"Today, with process management generally established as an integrated management tool, there is a strong interest in process modeling. The organizations spent time and effort in generating the optimal process model. Although there is a multitude of process modeling techniques available, the modeling process is often inefficient and the results are not satisfying. As each use case makes other demands on a process modeling language and tool it may be due to the neglect of some aspect of the design phase supposed to include a comprehensive requirement analysis and the implementation of these in an appropriate language and tool. Thus we want to offer a framework which focuses more on the design phase. The approach is based on a meta model hierarchy, focusing on modeling. This hierarchy is extended with a design phase. The increased quality of the final process models will also influence the whole process life cycle."
pub.1008378881,Toward a theoretical model of evaluation utilization,"Implicit evaluation utilization process-models were constructed from evaluation theorists, ideas, and explicit evaluation utilization process-models (i.e. already developed models) were located in the literature. The meta-model (i.e. a model developed from other models) was developed from the implicit and explicit process-models and from important ideas reported in recent research on evaluation use (e.g. participation, organizational development and complexity). The model depicts evaluation use as occurring in an internal environment situated in an external environment. The three sets of variables in the theoretical model are the background variables, the interactional or social psychological variables and the evaluation use variables. It is contended that evaluation-for-use will result in longer term effects when ideas from complexity theory, organizational learning and organizational design are employed. The meta-model reported here should be viewed as a theoretical model, offered in an attempt to promote theory development in the evaluation utilization literature."
pub.1013250530,Case-based reasoning for information system design,"We present a process model that applies case-based reasoning techniques to information system design. Describing the process model we focus on similarity and case adaption aspects. We are currently implementing the process model in a research prototype called CBModeler.The CBModeler project shows how the development of information systems can be supported by reusing design specifications from former projects. It assumes that all designs are derived from a reference model that describes the most important aspects of a specific information system domain. Thus we are also integrating schema-based and model-based reasoning techniques.We introduce the notion of design and design component, similarity and adaption process. Furthermore, we describe how a meta-model can be used to preserve system wide consistency and a reference model to preserve consistency in a domain. Finally, we give a simple design scenario."
pub.1009066048,A Meta-Method for Defining Software Engineering Methods,"Today’s software systems demand for sophisticated software engineering processes and methods. Especially the globally distributed development of large software systems requires precise and documented methods, but also lightweight and agile methods need to have a precise foundation. Effort that is invested once in the methods can be systematically reused in projects. We describe MetaME, a meta-method for modeling and tailoring software engineering methods. It builds on a meta-model of software engineering concepts. MetaME combines ideas from meta-modeling and method engineering. The meta-method comprises a product dimension and a process dimension. When the meta-method is applied, software development concepts are paired with languages for their representation to form artifact types. In the process dimension of the software engineering method, software development tasks are described as operations that act upon the artifacts. These tasks are performed as activities in the method’s process workflow model. Tools can then be built that use the artifact model as the foundation of their repository structure and the task and workflow models as the basis for the supported functionality."
pub.1094944854,Model-Driven Development of Simulation-Based System Design Tools,"Analysis and validation using simulation is a helpful tool in systems engineering, but requires in-depth knowledge of various aspects of the system itself, used model classes, and an appropriate software tool. Usually, this expertise is spread over a number of team members, thus making it a non-trivial task. A domain-specific simulation-based system design tool (termed here simulation-based application, SBA) could fill this gap. It hides the complexity of the model from the system designer and allows to configure parameters and analyze results in one single application. The necessary extra effort in software development compared to a bare modeling tool can be reduced with techniques for model-driven development. This paper presents an approach to use such methods to improve the development of SBA as a case of domain-specific software product lines. The workflow is described as well as the existing meta-model and applied techniques from model-driven development. The paper also shows the necessary elements of a meta model to describe SBAs. An example shows the complete workflow using an example of a wireless sensor networks for avionic applications."

Using one such situational method engineering approach, the OPEN Process Framework, we show how the full set of these newly identified agile method fragments, each created from the relevant powertype pattern as standardized in the Australian Standard methodology metamodel of AS 4651, can be used to recreate four of the currently available agile methods: XP, Scrum, and two members of the Crystal family—thus providing an initial validation of the approach and the specifically proposed method fragments for agile software development."
pub.1168382557,Regression Metamodel-Based Digital Twin for an Industrial Dynamic Crossflow Filtration Process,"Dynamic crossflow filtration (DCF) is the state-of-the-art technology for solid-liquid separation from viscous and sensitive feed streams in the food and biopharma industry. Up to now, the potential of industrial processes is often not fully exploited because fixed recipes are usually applied to run the processes. Therefore, a digital twin has been developed to optimize an industrial brownfield DCF plant. The core of the digital twin is a mechanistic-empirical process model combining fundamental filtration laws with process expert knowledge. The effect of variation of selected process and model parameters on plant productivity has been assessed using a model-based design-of-experiments approach and a regression metamodel has been trained with the data. A cyclic program that bidirectionally communicates with the DCF asset serves as frame of the digital twin. It monitors the process dynamics membrane torque and transmembrane pressure and feeds back the optimum permeate flow rate setpoint to the physical asset in almost real-time during process runs. The presented digital twin framework is a simple example how an industrial established process can be controlled by a hybrid model-based algorithm. With a digital process dynamics model at hand, the presented metamodel optimization approach can be easily transferred to other (bio)chemical processes."
pub.1109991960,Use of repeated cross-sectional travel surveys for developing meta models of activity-travel scheduling processes,"The paper presents an investigation of the temporal transferability of activity scheduling process models and a Meta model of activity scheduling processed by using repeated cross-sectional datasets. Three repeated cross-sectional household travel survey datasets collected in the greater Toronto and Hamilton Area in the years 2001, 2006, and 2011 are used for the investigation. A random utility maximization based dynamic activity scheduling model is utilized to develop activity-travel scheduling models for non-workers and workers separately. Individual year-specific models are compared to identify the temporal stability of the effects of different variables in the model. Results are used to define temporal evolution components in the Meta models. Estimated models are tested for temporal transferability. Different transferability measures are used to test the temporal transferability of cross-sectional year-specific and the Meta models. Results demonstrate an approach of effectively using multiple repeated cross-sectional datasets as pseudo panel data to develop Meta models to improve the temporal transferability of activity scheduling models."
pub.1095596984,The Epsilon Pattern Language,"We present the Epsilon Pattern Language (EPL), a textual language that supports expressing and detecting patterns on models conforming to arbitrary metamodels and captured using diverse modelling technologies. EPL provides out-of-the-box integration with existing languages that target a wide range of related model management activities (such as model validation, model-to-model and model-to-text transformation), thus enabling code reuse and seamless runtime interoperability across complex Model-Driven Engineering workflows. We discuss the syntax and semantics of EPL, its supporting development tools, and demonstrate how instances of patterns detected using EPL can be consumed and further processed by other model management programs."
pub.1043851254,Realizing software process lines: insights and experiences,"Software process lines provide a systematic approach to construct and manage software processes. A process line defines a reference process containing general process assets, whereas a well-defined customization approach allows process engineers to create new process variants by, e.g., extending or altering process assets. Variability operations are a powerful instrument to realize a process line. However, little is known about which variability operations are suitable in practice. In this paper, we present a study on the feasibility of variability operations to support process lines in the context of the German V-Modell XT. We analyze which variability operations were defined and used to which extent, and we provide a catalog of variability operations as an improvement proposal for other process models. Our findings show 69 variability operations defined across several metamodel versions of which 25 remain unused. Furthermore, we also find that variability operations can help process engineers to compensate process metamodel evolution."
pub.1040630850,Revising the UML Collaborations: A Well-Founded Approach,"We first argue that in some software development areas the need emerges of modelling structural and behavioural aspects of a community of objects cooperating to achieve a specific purpose, say a cooperation, for short. The notion of cooperation is formalized, with a first citizenship status, in the UML 2, as a collaboration. There are however some unclear and problematic spots both on some syntactic and semantic aspects of the UML collaboration. The main goal of this paper is to present first a much simplified metamodel for defining a collaboration, still producing the same notation, with an associated semantics. Rather surprisingly different useful semantic interpretations may be given and are discussed."
pub.1093521389,A Modeling Framework for Business Process Reengineering Using Big Data Analytics and a Goal-Orientation,"A business process is a collection of activities to create more business values and its continuous improvement aligned with business goals is essential to survive in fast changing business environment. However, it is quite challenging to find out whether a change of business processes positively affects business goals or not, if there are problems in the changing, what the reasons of the problems are, what solutions exist for the problems and which solutions should be selected. Big data analytics along with a goal-orientation which helps find out insights from a large volume of data in a goal concept opens up a new way for an effective business process reengineering. In this paper, we suggest a novel modeling framework which consists of a conceptual modeling language, a process and a tool for effective business processes reengineering using big data analytics and a goal-oriented approach. The modeling language defines important concepts for business process reengineering with metamodels and shows the concepts with complementary views: Business Goal-Process-Big Analytics Alignment View, Transformational Insight View and Big Analytics Query View. Analyzers hypothesize problems and solutions of business processes by using the modeling language, and the problems and solutions will be validated by the results of Big Analytics Queries which supports not only standard SQL operation, but also analytics operation such as prediction. The queries are run in an execution engine of our tool on top of Spark which is one of big data processing frameworks. In a goal-oriented spirit, all concepts not only business goals and business processes, but also big analytics queries are considered as goals, and alternatives are explored and selections are made among the alternatives using trade-off analysis. To illustrate and validate our approach, we use an automobile logistics example, then compare previous work."
pub.1053677836,Multi-model driven collaborative development platform for service-oriented e-Business systems,"Enterprises need to be responsive to meet dynamic businesses and requirements. Service-oriented architecture and Web services can improve e-Business systems to be integrated and flexible. This paper proposes a multi-model driven collaborative development platform for service-oriented e-Business systems. The platform provides engineers/consultants with three views, i.e., business view, process view, and service view to support service-oriented software engineering, top-down business design and bottom-up service composite and development. The views are kept consistent through model-driven translation mechanisms. The platform employs three models, i.e., service meta-model, process model and business model to implement the translation. On the platform, business and technical consultants/engineers can use the views designated for their roles to collaborate for a service-oriented e-Business system based at the distributed sites of, e.g., IT vendors and their clients. The collaboration is featured with visual development and rapid demonstration. Comparingly, most of the mainstream development environments focus on object-oriented application development other than service-oriented business process modeling. The platform has been developed and deployed in an innovation centre to be evaluated by visiting customers."

pub.1093698709,Deriving Project-Specific Processes from Process Line Architecture with Commonality and Variability,"Definition and utilization of project-specific processes is important for effectively conducting industrial information system development. Process tailoring is an approach of achieving processes optimized for the characteristics of a project. However, conventional tailoring techniques such as component-based ones and generator ones lack a way to address the overall consistency or reuse process fragments. In this paper, we propose a technique for establishing process lines, which are sets of common processes in particular problem domains, and process line architectures that incorporate commonality and variability. Process line architectures are used as a basis for deriving process lines from the perspective of overall optimization. The proposed technique includes some extensions to the Software Process Engineering Metamodel for clearly expressing the commonality and variability in the process workflows when modeling the workflows as UML activity diagrams. As a result of applying the proposed technique to hardware/software co-design processes in an embedded system development domain, it is found that the proposed technique is useful for defining consistent and project-specific processes efficiently."

This paper proposed a meta-model of adaptive software architecture based on RGPS meta-modeling of requirement framework. This meta-model takes the reflection architecture as foundation, and takes goal as unit, combines goal model, process model with services, while transformation of the processes and selection of the services are achieved by meta-objects in the meta-level, consequently it realizes adaptability of the software architecture to different demands."
pub.1139008337,Development of Industry 4.0 predictive maintenance architecture for broadcasting chain,"Industry 4.0 Predictive Maintenance (PdM 4.0) architecture in the broadcasting chain is one of the taxonomy challenges for deploying Industry 4.0 frameworks. This paper proposes a novel PdM framework based on advanced Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) to reduce operation and maintenance costs. This framework includes real-time production monitoring, business processes, and integration based on Design Science Research (DSR) to generate an innovative Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) meta-model. The addressed model visualizes sub-processes based on experts' and stakeholders' knowledge to reduce the cost of maintenance of audiovisual services including satellite TV, cable TV, and live audio and video broadcast services. Based on the recommendation and the concept of Industry 4.0, the proposed framework tolerates the predictable failures and further concerns in similar related industries. Some empirical experiments have been conducted by using the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting’s (IRIB) high-power station (located near the capital city of Iran, Tehran) to evaluate the functionality and efficiency of the proposed predictive maintenance framework. Practical outcomes demonstrate that interval times between data collection should be increased in audio and video broadcasting predictive maintenance because of the limitation of the internal processing performance of equipment. The framework also indicates the role of the Frequency Modulation (FM) transmitters’ data clearance to reduce the instability and untrustworthy data during data mining. The proposed DSR method endorses using a customized RAMI 4.0 meta-model framework to adapt distributed broadcasting and communication with PdM 4.0, which increases the stability as well as decreasing maintenance costs of the broadcasting chain in comparison to state-of-the-art methodologies. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed framework outperforms the best-evaluated methods in terms of acceptance."
pub.1032038167,A Transformation from SBVR Business Rules into Event Coordinated Rules by Means of SBVR Patterns,"SBVR is becoming more and more popular as the metamodel for defining vocabulary based business rules. In an extended form SBVR can be used to declare a whole spectrum of business rules including control-flow and organizational rules. Enforcing the rules of the business in information systems is however not straightforward. SBVR leaves open the gap between defining business rules and actually enforcing them. In this paper, we examine if and how business rules can be expressed in SBVR and translated using patterns into a more uniform event mechanism, such that the event handling could provide an integrated enforcement of the defined business rules."
pub.1018907795,A methodology for deriving extreme nearshore sea conditions for structural design and flood risk analysis,"Extreme sea conditions in the nearshore zone are required for coastal flood risk analysis and structural design. Many multivariate extreme value methods that have been applied in the past have been limited by assumptions relating to the dependence structure in the extremes. A conditional extremes statistical model overcomes a number of these previous limitations. To apply the method in practice, a Monte Carlo sampling procedure is required whereby large samples of synthetically generated events are simulated. The use of Monte Carlo approaches, in combination with computationally intensive physical process models, can raise significant practical challenges in terms of computation. To overcome these challenges there has been extensive research into the use of meta-models. Meta-models are approximations of computationally intensive physical process models (simulators). They are derived by fitting functions to the outputs from simulators. Due to their simplified representation they are computationally more efficient than the simulators they approximate.Here, a methodology for deriving a large Monte Carlo sample of extreme nearshore sea states is described. The methodology comprises the generation of a large sample of offshore sea conditions using the conditional extremes model. A meta-model of the wave transformation process is then constructed. A clustering algorithm is used to aid the development of the meta-model. The large sample of offshore data is then transformed through to the nearshore using the meta-model. The resulting nearshore sea states can be used for the probabilistic design of structures or flood risk analysis. The application of the methodology to a case study site on the North Coast of Spain is described."
pub.1033501911,A Unified RGPS-Based Approach Supporting Service-Oriented Process Customization,"Software as a Service (SaaS) aims to provide utility-oriented software delivery and provisioning. While software being published as reusable Web APIs, users can quickly compose multiple services into a new value-added process: a mashup. However, various users may have different requirements, thus preferring to compose the same set of services in different ways. Therefore, there is a need to provide a unified way for users to configure and compose services. RGPS (Role, Goal, Process, and Service) is an ongoing ISO-standard meta-model framework for describing service usage requirements. This chapter presents an approach of leveraging RGPS to help users configure a personalized service-based mashup. Based on users’ requirements, a hierarchical goal tree is generated for users to further refine their business goals. According to mappings between goals and variation points in business process templates, a personalized business process will be created. One task in a business process may be realized by an external service. Corresponding visualization tools are introduced to assist users. This chapter also describes a case study of customizing a mashup over an established service supermarket."
pub.1152622324,Migrating from proprietary tools to open-source software for EAST-ADL metamodel generation and evolution,"Open-source software has numerous advantages over proprietary commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software. However, there are modeling languages, tool chains, and tool frameworks that are developed and maintained in an open-source manner but still incorporate COTS tools. Such an incorporation of COTS tools into an overall open-source approach completely annihilates the actual open-source advantages and goals. In this tool paper, we demonstrate how we eliminated a COTS tool from the otherwise open-source-based generation and evolution workflow of the domain-specific modeling language East-Adl, used in the automotive industry to describe a variety of interdisciplinary aspects of vehicle systems. By switching to a pure open-source solution, East-Adl becomes easier to inspect, evolve, and develop a community around. We compare both the mixed COTS/open-source and the open-source-only workflows, outline the advantages of the open-source-only solution, and show that we achieve equivalent tooling features compared to the original approach."

pub.1093655357,"Modeling and Supporting ETL Processes via a Pattern-Oriented, Task-Reusable Framework","ETL processes are difficult components of modern Data Warehousing architectures, which are gaining momentum thanks the renewed interest stirred-up by the emerging Big Data paradigm. Due to the complexity of modeling ETL processes, various alternatives appeared in the literature. But several limitations arise, such as the poor attention to the flexibility of models. Following the drawbacks of actual proposals, in this paper we argue that a novel approach based on a pattern-oriented and task-reusable framework may convey in lot of advantages for the ETL process (conceptual) modeling itself. Our proposal is thus represented by a pattern-oriented meta-model for supporting the conceptual modeling of ETL processes in next-generation Data Warehousing environments. The most distinctive characteristic of our framework consists in the reusability of task-oriented components, with clear advantages for the flexibility and the extendibility of the final ETL process model so-determined. To validate our proposal, we exploit the YAWL workflow modeling language, and develop a suitable pattern for validating target ETL processes."
pub.1045370505,Software Support for User Interface Description Language,"A User Interface Description Language (UIDL) is a formal language used in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in order to describe a particular user interface independently of any implementation. Considerable research effort has been devoted to defining various meta-models in order to define rigorously the semantics of a UIDL. These meta-models adhere to the principle of separation of concerns. Any aspect of concern should univocally fall into one of the following meta-models: context of use (user, platform, environment), task, domain, abstract user interface, concrete user interface, usability (including accessibility), workflow, organization, evolution, program, transformation, and mapping. Not all these meta-models should be used concurrently, but may be manipulated during different steps of a user interface development method. In order to support this kind of development method, software is required throughout the user interface development life cycle in order to create, edit, check models that are compliant with these meta-models and to produce user interfaces out of these methods. This workshop is aimed at reviewing the state of the art of software support for a UIDL in the context of any development method (e.g., formal method, model-based, model-driven). From this review, a taxonomy of software support for UIDLs will emerge that will serve for describing, comparing, and exploring software support for UIDLs."
pub.1014221855,Semantic Annotation Framework to Manage Semantic Heterogeneity of Process Models,"Effective discovery and sharing of process models within and/or across enterprises are important in process model management. A semantic annotation approach has been applied for specifying process semantic heterogeneity in the semantic process model discovery in our previous work. In this paper, the approach is further developed into a complete and systematic semantic annotation framework. Four perspectives are tackled in our framework: basic description of process models (profile annotation), process modeling languages (meta-model annotation), process models (model annotation) and the purpose of the process models (goal annotation). Ontologies, including modeling ontology, domain specific ontology and goal ontology, are used for annotation of process models to achieve semantic interoperability. A set of mapping strategies are defined to guide users to annotate process models."
pub.1030528993,Checking Compliance of Execution Traces to Business Rules,"Complex and flexible business processes are critical not only because they are difficult to handle, but also because they often tend to loose their intelligibility. Verifying compliance of complex and flexible processes becomes therefore a fundamental requirement. We propose a framework for performing compliance checking of process execution traces w.r.t. expressive reactive business rules, tailored to the MXML meta-model. Rules are mapped to Logic Programming, using Prolog to classify execution traces as compliant/non-compliant. We show how different rule templates, inspired by the ConDec language, can be easily specified and then customized in the context of a real industrial case study. We finally describe how the proposed language and its underlying a-posteriori reasoning technique have been concretely implemented as a ProM analysis plug-in."

Different business‐rule categories are discussed and the relationships that exist between business rules and other business‐related concepts are presented. The paper also introduces a business activity meta‐model as an integration link between business and information modelling. Its motivation is to help establish an environment in which business rules can be traced from their origin in the business environment through to their implementation in information systems.

Unfortunately, industrial procedures have reached a certain complexity making the designing task complex enough to discourage businesses facing the blank page. Moreover, the 21st century witnesses the emergence of myriads of norms and external regulations that businesses want to abide by. Although domain experts have a limited process modelling and norm interpretation knowledge, they know how to describe their activities and their sequencing. With progresses made in the artificial intelligence, particularly in the natural language processing domain, it becomes possible to automatize the task of creating a process in compliance with norms. This paper presents a business-oriented prototype assisting users in getting certifiable specific business processes. We detail the metamodel used to separately model norms and business’ existing procedures and then, the algorithm envisaged to deduce a corresponding cartography of processes."

The service compatibility checking algorithm based on the Mediation model, which can provide multi-level service checking compatibility, and realize the goal of Service Cooperation or the demand of Value-Added Services. Based on BPMN specification, a task modeling and management tool was proposed to support the service components for assembly component. It supports both Web service automatic retrieval and service content analysis based on QoS information, and the task execution model between the BPMN specification task descriptions was transformed into the BPEL specification task description model. Finally, a model transformation strategy based on meta-model mapping was put forward. The algorithm was designed and examples were given to demonstrate the efficiency of 3D Printing WS-BPEL."
pub.1044821688,UN/CEFACT’S Modeling Methodology (UMM): A UML Profile for B2B e-Commerce,"The United Nation’s Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) is an e-business standardization body. It is known from its work on UN/EDIFACT and ebXML. One of its on-going work items is the UN/CEFACT modeling methodology (UMM) for modeling global choreographies of B2B scenarios. The goal of UMM is defining a shared business logic between business partners and fostering reuse of standardized process building blocks. The latest UMM version is defined as a UML 1.4 profile. In this paper we introduce the main concepts of UMM to realize its vision. Furthermore, the paper elaborates on the necessary UML meta model work-arounds we – as part of the specification’s editing team – took in order to accomplish the B2B requirements. Then we propose a move towards UML 2 that eliminates some of those workarounds."
pub.1142696044,FaultFlow: a tool supporting an MDE approach for Timed Failure Logic Analysis,"In the application of software intensive systems to business-critical processes, tool-supported connection between the perspectives of Software Engineering and Reliability Engineering may largely help conciliation of the contrasting needs of reliability and complexity. In this paper, we present FaultFlow, a newborn tool enabling a Model-Driven Engineering approach for supporting specification, analysis, and simulation of failure logic in component-based systems. The tool exploits a meta-model combining the representation of system configuration hierarchies together with a decoupled representation of its stochastically-timed failure logic. FaultFlow is available in a as-a-service mode through a Web Application deployed on the cloud as well as in a standalone mode, featuring a well-crafted Java API enabling effective specification of the system hierarchy as well as of intra-component fault-to-failure and inter-component failure-to-fault propagation models, respectively starting from SysML Block Definition Diagrams and stochastic Fault Trees representations. The automated transformation towards Stochastic Time Petri Nets enables integration with external reliability tools for quantitative evaluation through numerical solution or simulation. We illustrate FaultFlow key benefits by experimenting the approach on a case study contextualised in an Internet of Things scenario modelling a Pollution Monitor System within a Smart City."

pub.1027905499,A metamodelling approach to behavioural modelling,"In this paper we propose a metamodelling approach to behavioural modelling. The approach combines diagrammatic modelling with formal foundations based on category theory and graph transformations. The static semantics of behavioural models is represented by instances of (meta)models, while their dynamic semantics is represented by transition systems. Transitions are described by coupled model transformations. To illustrate the approach, we present a running example of a workflow model for health services delivery."
pub.1011910514,The Process Enactment Tool Framework—Transformation of software process models to prepare enactment," Rich development process models contain information about structures for project organization and also for concrete outcomes of a project. However, rich processes are hard to implement. They often contain hundreds of pages of documentation. Development teams tend to be skeptical about rich processes in fear of additional effort, risking the benefits of rich tool support for enactment. Process enactment is a challenging task. There is no common methodology to quickly “implement” a development process in a tool or a set of tools. Often specialized tools are used to provide assistance during the project and it is the project manager’s task to consolidate the information with the rest of the team. The Process Enactment Tool Framework (PET) is a software tool that supports the transformation of a given formal development process into a format that project tools can work with. PET is an instrument to import processes based on a metamodel and provide exports for a specific project environment. PET takes an input software development process model and transforms it into an intermediate format that serves as the basis for a second transformation step into data formats of tools such as office suites or comprehensive ALM platforms. In this paper we present the tool framework and show how metamodel-based processes can be transformed into an environment that is ready to use for a project team. We show how PET is applied for the German V-Modell XT and for SPEM-based processes to generate, e.g., process templates for the Team Foundation Server or work product document templates."
pub.1146183170,Tool Support for Fractal Enterprise Modeling,"This chapter discusses the authors’ experience of building tool support for a modeling technique called Fractal Enterprise Model (FEM) using the ADOxx metamodeling environment. FEM is introduced as a means for helping the management to comprehend how their organization operates, giving a picture understandable for the management team. It depicts interconnections between the business processes in an enterprise and connects them to the assets they use and manage. Assets considered in the model could be tangible (buildings, heavy machinery, etc.) and intangible (reputation, business process definitions, etc.). First, the chapter presents FEM informally—as a text with examples—and formally, as a metamodel. Then, the authors present the requirements on a tool support for FEM and discuss how these requirements were fulfilled in a tool called the FEM toolkit developed with the help of ADOxx."
pub.1100254721,Optimal Path-Finding in a Context-Aware Workflow Support System for Process and Automation Engineering of Plants,"This paper describes a novel approach for a plant and automation engineering workflow support system. This approach utilizes context modeling techniques combined with optimal path-finding methods and offers the optimal next engineering step to users. For this purpose, the concept of objects lifeflows, which is an alternative to project's workflows, is utilized. Lifeflows are predefined engineering paths that every single object in the datamodel should go through until it reaches an engineering maturity in the plant datamodel. A lifeflow for an object instance is inherited from its class in the Metamodel. A workflow support system can assist engineers in bringing these objects to their next design steps. Such system first has to evaluate the current context of the object in the datamodel including its relations and states of other objects. Then feasible and low effort paths for the next design steps, and consequences of selecting each of these paths on the other related objects will be considered. After analysis of the context and activation of one possible lifeflow among many alternatives for an object, the state of the object will be updated, and the responsible user will receive tasks for performing respective engineering activities. In this contribution, the conceptualisation and the prototypic implementation of the above-mentioned concept and main characters of its prerequisites will be elaborated and discussed. Moreover, a validation of the concept, developed tools and algorithms, which were utilized in different examples and use cases, will be described."
pub.1095842958,Towards Flexible and Secure End-to-End Communication in Industry 4.0,"The digital transformation of industrial production is driven by the advance of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) within which raw materials, machines and operations are interconnected to form a sophisticated network. Making such systems self-adaptable is a priority concern for the future implementation of Industry 4.0 application scenarios. In this position paper, we design a meta-model and use it as a tool to describe an end-to-end communication use case from an ongoing research project. Based on this use case we develop a business process performance and security trade-off model, which shows that maximazing both parameters at the same time is not possible, thus an efficient balance between them has to be achieved. Motivated by the result, we propose self adaptation as a solution towards a flexible and secure end-to-end communication in Industry 4.0. To identify and document the self-adaptation points in a structured methodological and lightweight way we use the bespoken meta-model."
pub.1044544104,A Pattern-Knowledge Base Supported Establishment of Inter-organizational Business Processes,"In the domain of business-to-business (B2B) collaboration, companies are pursuing the objective of electronically linking their business processes for improving their supply chains. For creating such inter-organizational collaboration, intra- and inter-organizational knowledge workers (IKWs) function as assisting experts. However, IKWs must not constantly ”reinvent the wheel” but should instead be supported by a repository that contains knowledge about how to design business processes. Thus, this paper proposes the support of IKWs by a pattern repository for the effective and efficient design of inter-organizational business processes. A pattern is conceptually formulated knowledge that is technology independent. By storing patterns in a uniform specification template of a meta model, it is possible to perform systematic reasoning. Having information readily available about the technology support of individual patterns, IKWs can quickly analyse with which intersection of pattern sets it is possible to link intra-organizational business processes."
pub.1004920873,Role and Rights Management,"Role and rights management of today’s IT landscape is a challenging task that causes problems concerning the redundancy of organizational knowledge. This knowledge is the basis for specifying access rights and task assignment. As a consequence, the widespread technological methods are prone to inconsistencies on organizational changes, such as employees leaving, joining or moving within the organization. For this purpose, an approach is needed that offers both a comprehensive organizational meta-model and a declarative organization query language. The central meta-model helps to partially overcome the redundancy problem. In conjunction with the organization query language, the problems caused by redundancy is minimized. A query language expression describes formally characteristics of agents that are assigned to access rights, or tasks. Accordingly, this new approach uses a descriptive approach instead of total enumeration as required by other approaches. Thus, query expressions stay unmodified even if the organization changes."
pub.1010492452,Distributed Co-operative Modelling of Production Systems,"For some years the understanding of planners has been rising which has meant that not only the manufacturing and information technology of an enterprise are considered important factors for success but also its staff, organisation and processes, particularly the mutual connections between these components. Various specialists should also collaborate in order to complete such demanding, complex and extensive tasks. Thus it is necessary for experts from various fields such as factory planners, business organisers, and systems analysts to be involved in planning manufacturing. Much distributed planning consists of tasks within groupware processes. By means of the computer-aided concept presented here, the co-operative and distributed collaboration of planning experts is considerably improved and developed with regard to the efficiency as well as the quality of planning projects."
pub.1024799260,Towards workflow simulation in service‐oriented architecture: an event‐based approach,"Abstract The emergence of service‐oriented architecture (SOA) has brought about a loosely coupled computing environment that enables flexible integration and reuse of heterogeneous systems. On building a SOA for application systems, more and more research has been focused on service composition, in which workflow and simulation techniques have shown great potential. Simulation of services' interaction is important since the services ecosystem is dynamic and in continuous evolution. However, there is a lack in the research of services' simulation, especially models, methods and systems to support the simulation of interaction behavior of composite services. In this paper, an enhanced workflow simulation method with the support of interactive events mechanism is proposed to fulfill this requirement. At build time, we introduce an event sub‐model in the workflow meta‐model, and our simulation engine supports the event‐based interaction pattern at run time. With an example simulated in the prototype system developed according to our method, the advantages of our method in model verification and QoS evaluation for service compositions are also highlighted.

pub.1085123595,A Fact-Based Meta Model for BPMN,"Abstract
Recently, the OMG has been working on developing a new standard for a business process management notation (BPMN). This standard development results in documents that contain the newest approved version of a standard or a standard proposal that can be amended. It is our vision that such a standard document, that also serves as a specification for BPMN modeling tool developers could benefit from a fact-based model in which the same domain knowledge is represented conceptually as a list of concept definitions (including naming conventions), a set of information structure diagrams and the constraints or business rules that govern the instances of the information structure diagrams. In this paper we will show precisely, how such a fact-based conceptual view on a standard document can be created, and we will show how a fact-based approach can improve the completeness of a specification."
pub.1094661936,A 3-level e-Business Registry Meta Model,"Business partners willing to do business electronically with each other must reach an agreement (1) on the economic level, (2) on the inter-organizational process choreography, and (3) on the services implementing the choreography. In order to search for a potential business partner, one will first look for a partner who offers a required service on the economic level and who supports a complementary role in a choreography, before binding to its IT services. Inasmuch, a registry for inter-organizational systems should cover all three levels and maintain the dependencies between them. In this paper we set up on well accepted approaches on the different levels, i.e. (1) the $e^{3}$ value ontology, (2) the UN/CEFACT modeling methodology (UMM), and (3) the business process execution language (BPEL). We specify a registry meta model on top of ebRIM registering the artifacts on the different levels and defining their inter-dependencies."
pub.1041793994,A Comparative Analysis between BPMN and SPEM Modeling Standards in the Software Processes Context,"The main objective of this paper is to analyze the representativeness of the SPEM (Software Process Engineering Metamodel Specification) and the BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) standards in the software processes modeling context. To perform this analysis, it was adopted a standard structure to define a software process based upon a process ontology. Then, the SPEM and BPMN standards notations and their semantically corresponding elements in the default process were identified. This mapping also includes components of the CMMI-DEV (Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development) and MR-MPS (Reference Model for Software Process Improvement) quality models. This was necessary to assist in the mapping evaluation through a case study which models the best practices of these quality models. Finally, we carried out an analysis of these standards through specific characteristics considered necessary to model and to represent software processes."

These later facilitate the readability of a process model or control some of its fragments. In many cases of process models merging, control parts can cause conflicts (called control conflicts), that must be identified and resolved to ensure the reliability of the merged process model.We study in this article a control conflict, related to the control element Choice along with a task outflows, when merging process models. We propose the resolution of this conflict in the various scenarios that can arise, in order to ensure a reliable merging result."
pub.1062959447,MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE FLOWS IN SOFTWARE PROCESSES THROUGH THE EXTENSION OF THE SOFTWARE PROCESS ENGINEERING METAMODEL,"Knowledge is a key asset in software engineering. Facilitating access to the knowledge that software engineers require for the task at hand can therefore bring many benefits. To accomplish this, it is important to understand how knowledge flows through the organization, to identify problems that may hinder a suitable flow, and to define strategies with which to address them. Process modeling has proved to be a useful technique for analyzing knowledge flows. Traditional process modeling languages do not, however, provide primitives to explicitly represent the knowledge involved in the processes within the models. In this paper, we illustrate how the Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) can be adapted, to be used as a process modeling language for analyzing knowledge flows in software processes. We have extended SPEM to represent knowledge and its sources in process models in an explicit way. We also discuss the experiences obtained from using this extension in a software organization and the lesson we have learned from it."
pub.1094419387,Requirements evolution in the midst of environmental change: a managed approach,"Requirements evolve, not only during system development but also after a system has been installed. The aim of the work on the EVE (Evolution Engineering) project is to develop practical methods for dealing with requirements evolution. The paper presents the early output from our work-the EVE framework for requirements evolution. The EVE framework is comprised of two components: a meta model and an associated process model. The EVA meta model captures a set of modelling concepts in requirements evolution, including change, impact, risk and viewpoint. The EVA process model provides technologists with a framework for handling the emergence of new or changing requirements during the lifetime of a system. The paper illustrates the EVA framework on a simple example, and highlights the importance of social and environmental responsibility in requirements evolution."
pub.1136618616,Risk-aware business process management using multi-view modeling: method and tool,"Risk-aware Business Process Management (R-BPM) has been addressed in research since more than a decade. However, the integration of the two independent research streams is still ongoing with a lack of research focusing on the conceptual modeling perspective. Such an integration results in an increased meta-model complexity and a higher entry barrier for modelers in creating conceptual models and for addressees of the models in comprehending them. Multi-view modeling can reduce this complexity by providing multiple interdependent viewpoints that, all together, represent a complex system. Each viewpoint only covers those concepts that are necessary to separate the different concerns of stakeholders. However, adopting multi-view modeling discloses a number of challenges particularly related to managing consistency which is threatened by semantic and syntactic overlaps between the viewpoints. Moreover, usability and efficiency of multi-view modeling have never been systematically evaluated. This paper reports on the conceptualization, implementation, and empirical evaluation of e-BPRIM, a multi-view modeling extension of the Business Process-Risk Management-Integrated Method (BPRIM). The findings of our research contribute to theory by showing, that multi-view modeling outperforms diagram-oriented modeling by means of usability and efficiency of modeling, and quality of models. Moreover, the developed modeling tool is openly available, allowing its adoption and use in R-BPM practice. Eventually, the detailed presentation of the conceptualization serves as a blueprint for other researchers aiming to harness multi-view modeling."
pub.1095726232,Modeling Process Patterns and Their Application,"Process pattern is an emerging approach for process reuse. Representing process models based on process patterns to explicit process solutions and factor recurrent process constituents is useful for process understanding as well as process modeling. This subject, however, is still a challenge for the software process technology community. In this paper, we present a UML-based process meta-model that allows explicit representation of process patterns in process models. The novel of our proposition is to enable the application of different process knowledge kinds not only for building but also for improving process models."
pub.1167943893,Requirement-Based Automated Test Case Generation: Systematic Literature Review,"There exist multiple techniques of software testing like requirement-based testing (RBT) an approach of software testing from which the tester can generate test cases on the base of requirements without considering the internal system’s structure. In the current area, automation testing is used to minimize time, cost, and human effort. As compared to automated testing, manual testing processes consume more human effort and time. Requirements are documented in natural language so there is no extra training required to understand requirements, RBT is the most used testing technique. Test cases generated with customer requirements are mainly focused on functional test cases. Most approaches focus on real-time embedded systems rather than UML diagrams because non-functional needs are not captured in test cases derived from UML diagrams. Metamodels can be used to extract information from requirements in some cases. Active testing approaches, bounded model checking, activity diagrams, Petri nets round strip strategy, and extended use cases are just a few of the typical ways used to generate test cases. In this article, multiple techniques of automated test case generation have been discussed which are not being addressed in state-of-art literature reviews. Studies included in this systematic literature review (SLR) are built on a set of three research objectives and a variety of high-quality evaluation criteria. Taxonomy has been presented based on test case generation with requirement-based techniques and tools. In the end, gaps and challenges have been discussed to assist researchers to pursue future work."

Our simulation of software process (the dynamic part) is extended by static aspects (mainly resources) and thus we could obtain even more accurate data on how software process behaves under scenarios possible only by adding resources into the equation. And of course, use those results to analyze, verify and improve the process itself. All of this using standard UML and CPN, based on our Unified Process Meta-model."
pub.1004120747,Error estimation properties of Gaussian process models in stochastic simulations,"The theoretical relationship between the prediction variance of a Gaussian process model (GPM) and its mean square prediction error is well known. This relationship has been studied for the case when deterministic simulations are used in GPM, with application to design of computer experiments and metamodeling optimization. This article analyzes the error estimation of Gaussian process models when the simulated data observations contain measurement noise. In particular, this work focuses on the correlation between the GPM prediction variance and the distribution of prediction errors over multiple experimental designs, as a function of location in the input space. The results show that the error estimation properties of a Gaussian process model using stochastic simulations are preserved when the signal-to-noise ratio in the data is larger than 10, regardless of the number of training points used in the metamodel. Also, this article concludes that the distribution of prediction errors approaches a normal distribution with a variance equal to the GPM prediction variance, even in the presence of significant bias in the GPM predictions."
pub.1052523206,A precedence-based approach for proactive control in software process modelling,"We present the proactive behavioural features of PROMENADE, a process modelling language for formalizing the construction of software process models. PROMENADE aims at improving expressiveness, standardization, flexibility and reuse in software process modelling. In this article we focus on expressiveness, which is achieved by means of a declarative (instead of imperative) proactive control-flow based on precedence relationships. Different families of such precedences have been defined within the language (namely, basic, derived and dynamic). Also, PROMENADE provides (1) a comprehensive parameter task-binding mechanism to keep track of document-flow between tasks; (2) a high level notation to define new precedence relationships, which may be used to tailor the language to the specific needs of each user and process; (3) the definition of flexible models by leaving some parts undefined until enactment time. The specific concepts necessary to model a software process are defined and integrated into the UML metamodel. The extended metamodel is converted into a UML profile using stereotypes, constraints and tag definitions."
pub.1128872217,COMPUTER-AIDED WORKFLOW DESIGNING FOR QOS CONTROL BASED ON ONTOLOGY,"Background. The rapid development of technologies in various fields of business, including in telecommunications requires an increasing level of service provision, because the formation of a market for network communication services has increased attention to issues of quality control, both by regulators and by the providers themselves. In order to meet a given level of quality of service, telecommunication operators develop algorithms and solutions for providing quality control services based on various criteria. However, these solutions are not universal for different types of indicators (quantitative, qualitative, etc.) of quality of service. Objective. The paper presents the approach to automating workflows and their components (functional services, connections and rules of interaction) by designing processes based on computer-aided generation of both a set of services that are components of workflows and the sequence of their execution using ontologies. Ontology serves as meta-model of the workflow, services, subject domain and logical rules that establish relationships between functional services. Methods. The implementation of the proposed approach was realized using an ontological modeling, workflow modeling standards and methods of computer-aided designing. Results. An ontological model of service quality indicators was developed, as well as dynamically changing workflow that guarantees the quality of service control universality was designed. For computer-aided workflows generation the software environment has been developed, the performance of which is tested on the example of workflow designing tool IT TODOS for developing and modifying ontologies and generating workflow scheme using BPMN. Conclusions. The proposed approach makes the process of quality of service control more transparent and reduces the involvement of analysts in this process. Such an approach is flexible and universal for usage in any subject domain by uploading relevant data to the registers. It also provides the process of the quality of service control automation and the solution encapsulation enabling employees to use the solution provided at any level without the expert analyst involvement."
pub.1152683321,Printed Circuit Board Orthotropic Material Calibration for Static and Dynamic Loading,"This paper presents a printed circuit board (PCB) material characterization by calibrating natural frequency, acceleration response, and surface strain to an orthotropic material law. The calibration procedure consists in creating a metamodel in OptiSLang software. A sensitivity analysis ranks the investigated parameters, and an optimization algorithm determines the design best fitting the experimental data. The procedure simultaneously calibrates an effective PCB section for all responses. There is excellent agreement between simulation and experiments. With low-cost measurements, the workflow captures the specific response of the PCB. We conclude with an overview of PCB analysis's most common FEA approaches. A lumped, transverse isotropic PCB model accommodates most applications, while the described multi-objective material calibration can efficiently characterize technology-specific PCBs."
pub.1119527724,Learning Heterogeneous Similarity Measures for Hybrid-Recommendations in Meta-Mining,"The notion of meta-mining has appeared recently and extends the traditional
meta-learning in two ways. First it does not learn meta-models that provide
support only for the learning algorithm selection task but ones that support
the whole data-mining process. In addition it abandons the so called black-box
approach to algorithm description followed in meta-learning. Now in addition to
the datasets, algorithms also have descriptors, workflows as well. For the
latter two these descriptions are semantic, describing properties of the
algorithms. With the availability of descriptors both for datasets and data
mining workflows the traditional modelling techniques followed in
meta-learning, typically based on classification and regression algorithms, are
no longer appropriate. Instead we are faced with a problem the nature of which
is much more similar to the problems that appear in recommendation systems. The
most important meta-mining requirements are that suggestions should use only
datasets and workflows descriptors and the cold-start problem, e.g. providing
workflow suggestions for new datasets.
  In this paper we take a different view on the meta-mining modelling problem
and treat it as a recommender problem. In order to account for the meta-mining
specificities we derive a novel metric-based-learning recommender approach. Our
method learns two homogeneous metrics, one in the dataset and one in the
workflow space, and a heterogeneous one in the dataset-workflow space. All
learned metrics reflect similarities established from the dataset-workflow
preference matrix. We demonstrate our method on meta-mining over biological
(microarray datasets) problems. The application of our method is not limited to
the meta-mining problem, its formulations is general enough so that it can be
applied on problems with similar requirements."
pub.1000793502,Introducing the Guard-Stage-Milestone Approach for Specifying Business Entity Lifecycles,"A promising approach to managing business operations is based on business entities with lifecycles (BEL’s) (a.k.a. business artifacts), i.e., key conceptual entities that are central to guiding the operations of a business, and whose content changes as they move through those operations. A BEL type includes both an information model that captures, in either materialized or virtual form, all of the business-relevant data about entities of that type, and a lifecycle model, that specifies the possible ways an entity of that type might progress through the business by responding to events and invoking services, including human activities. Most previous work on BEL’s has focused on the use of lifecycle models based on variants of finite state machines. This paper introduces the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model for lifecycles, which is an evolution of the previous work on BEL’s. GSM lifecycles are substantially more declarative than the finite state machine variants, and support hierarchy and parallelism within a single entity instance. The GSM operational semantics are based on a form of Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules, and provide a basis for formal verification and reasoning. This paper provides an informal, preliminary introduction to the GSM approach, and briefly overviews selected research directions."

pub.1160834445,Modeling Design Process,"This article discusses building a computable design process model, which is a prerequisite for realizing intelligent computer-aided design systems. First, we introduce general design theory, from which a descriptive model of design processes is derived. In this model, the concept of metamodels plays a crucial role in describing the evolutionary nature of design. Second, we show a cognitive design process model obtained by observing design processes using a protocol analysis method. We then discuss a computable model that can explain most parts of the cognitive model and also interpret the descriptive model. In the computable model, a design process is regarded as an iterative logical process realized by abduction, deduction, and circumscription. We implemented a design simulator that can trace design processes in which design specifications and design solutions are gradually revised as the design proceeds."
pub.1025696420,Models for forms,"To make reliable, safe, and effective use of data outside the context of its collection, we require an adequate understanding of its meaning. In data-intensive science, as in many other applications of computing, this necessitates the association of each item of data with complex, detailed metadata. The most important, most useful piece of metadata is often a description of the form used in data acquisition. This paper discusses, with examples, the requirements for standard metamodels or languages for forms, sufficient for the automatic association of form data with a computable description of its semantics, and also for the automatic generation of form structures and completion workflows. It explains how form models in specific domains can be used to facilitate data sharing, and to improve data quality, and semantic interoperability."

Process line architectures are used as a basis for deriving process lines from the perspective of overall optimization. The proposed technique includes some extensions to the Software Process Engineering Metamodel for clearly expressing the commonality and variability in the process workflows described as UML activity diagrams. As a result of applying the proposed technique to hardware/software co-design processes in an embedded system domain, it is found that the proposed technique is useful for defining consistent and project-specific processes efficiently."
pub.1093832945,A Framework of Workflow-based Software Development Process Supported Platform,"This paper demonstrates a systematic framework of software development process supported platform, WSDPP, which takes PSAF-based meta-model workflow engine as its core and Agent-assisted PSP Client as the interface between a developer and platform. Based on this platform, the development process of software organizations can be fully automatically controlled. In this way, not only the imbedded development process of RUP/TSP/PSP may be efficiently supported, but the task assignment and work load balance in TSP can be effectively accomplished and wholly gather productivity data of organizations, teams and individuals, so as to realize quantity management. Based on WSDPP, automatization development process of norm implementation will overcome most problems in the process of development, and effectively develop high-quality software products."

Through this work, we try to clarify the definition of process components in order to be able to construct and execute MBE processes “On-Demand”."
pub.1175917975,AI-Based Finite-Element Simulation Automation Workflow Applied to Automotive Electronics Field,"Electronic component is one of the key design elements considered during the development of automotive ECU (Electronic Control Unit). As the current state-of-the-art method, FEM (Finite-Element Method) simulation is widely used for thermal design optimization and solder joint reliability assessment of electronics at early stage of ECU development. To address the challenges of modeling fidelity and efficiency, the AI (Artificial Intelligence) integrated automated simulation workflow platform is developed. Leveraging standard and Bosch in-house developed Python libraries called “pyact”, an Ansys-based automation toolset has been developed which accelerates the simulation workflow. With the assistance of AI methodologies, more precise electronic component models could be expected during calibration process. This paper presents 3 different industrial practices and examples focusing on the board level thermal management and solder joint reliability assessment. The first industrial example presents the standardization and automatization of the reliability simulation workflow of chip-resistor components. Utilizing Ansys ACT (Application Customization Toolkit), basic APIs (Application Programming Interface) of ACT are encapsulated into the Python library as pyact, enabling a fully automated simulation workflow to predicted solder joint lifetime. To further realize the fast assessment of reliability and component virtual release, an AI metamodel is derived from automated simulation-based DoE (Design of Experiments). For pursuit of accuracy for simulation models, the second industrial example presents the combination of Bayesian Optimization with BGA (Ball Grid Array) warpage calibration process to outperform the traditional manual methods. The third industrial example outlines another application of Bayesian optimization into the Zth (Transient Thermal Impedance) calibration process for component thermal models. Utilizing the multi-objective optimization algorithm, the Zth curves from different sources & thermal paths can be fitted with high-quality by the machine. In conclusion, the integration of AI with simulation automation significantly benefits thermal management and solder joint reliability evaluations in ECU development."
pub.1095275488,Flexible Specification of Data Models for Neuroscience Databases,"Scientific progress depends increasingly on collaborative efforts that involve exchange of data and re-analysis of previously recorded data. With increasing complexity of the data it becomes more difficult to access both data and metadata for application of specific analysis methods, for exchange with collaborators, or for further analysis some time after the initial study was completed. This effort causes a major barrier to fully exploit the scientific potential of experimental data. In order to make data analysis, re-analysis, and data sharing efficient, data together with metadata should be managed and accessed in a unified and reproducible way, so that the researcher can focus on the scientific questions rather than on problems of data management. We present a metamodel for formal specification of data models using concepts of entity relationship diagrams and database system catalogs. We are currently applying this metamodel to a data management system which is based on relational database technology, together with mechanisms to account for the heterogeneity of electrophysiological data (www.g-node.orgldata). This approach provides (automatically generated) interfaces to analysis tools and programming languages that are commonly used in neurophysiology. It thus will enable researchers to seamlessly integrate data access into their daily laboratory workflow and efficiently perform management and selection of data in a systematic and largely automatized fashion for data sharing and analysis."
pub.1006331492,Towards a Methodology for Nursing-Specific Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS),"Despite significant advances in Clinical Decision Support Systems, they have not been extensively used in nursing practice to date. One key problem is the failure of these systems to fully support actionable nursing practices that guide nurse decision-making. In addition, current workflow-related systems have failed to consider the specific workflow challenges associated with acute-care nursing. In response to these challenges, we describe a novel three-stage approach that builds and evaluates a meta-model that addresses key requirements of multi-level guideline-based clinical nursing-specific decision support. This research-in-progress presents the first two stages of this approach, highlighting the importance of meta-modelling as a tool to identify the essential system-centric information that underpins acute-care nursing practice."
pub.1028604816,DPF Workbench: A Diagrammatic Multi-Layer Domain Specific (Meta-)Modelling Environment,"This paper presents the DPFWorkbench, a diagrammatic tool for domain specific modelling. The tool is an implementation of the basic ideas from the Diagram Predicate Framework (DPF), which provides a graph based formalisation of (meta)modelling and model transformations. The DPFWorkbench consists of a specification editor and a signature editor and offers fully diagrammatic specification of domain-specific modelling languages. The specification editor supports development of metamodelling hierarchies with an arbitrary number of metalevels; that is, each model can be used as a metamodel for the level below. The workbench also facilitates the automatic generation of domain-specific specification editors out of these metamodels. Furthermore, the conformance relations between adjacent metalevels are dynamically checked by the use of typing morphisms and constraint validators. The signature editor is a new component that extends the DPF Workbench with functionality for dynamic definition of predicates. The syntax of the predicates are defined by a shape graph and a graphical icon, and their semantics are defined by validators. Those predicates are used to add constrains on the underlying graph. The features of the DPF Workbench are illustrated by a running example presenting a metamodelling hierarchy for workflow modelling in the health care domain."
pub.1093324821,The use of a meta-model to support multi-project process measurement,"In today's environment, software companies are engaged in multiple projects delivered on heterogeneous platforms for a wide class of applications in disparate application domains. They are increasingly engaged in the co-development of software systems through joint software development projects including staff from partners and customers as well as their own. As a result, they must support multiple software development processes while trying to guarantee uniform levels of process enactment, and product quality across all projects. Our approach is capable of providing process measurement in a joint-project, multi-process model business environment. It is based on a simple meta-model for computing across-process, multiple-project metrics designed to permit monitoring of CMMI compliance. The open source tool Spago4Q has been developed to support our approach and is capable of producing the measurements needed for monitoring of a set of large-scale development projects using different process models, in a real industrial setting in Europe. The results support the view that that it will not always be possible to aggregate the same set of metrics across disparate process models."
pub.1093184747,Research on meta-model of driver behavior in agent-based traffic evacuation simulation,"Driver behavior diversity affects traffic process greatly especially for the traffic evacuation process. Taking the driver behavior diversity into consideration, this paper developed a meta-model of driver behavior in microscopic traffic evacuation simulation, named DGIT frame, which are Decision, Game, Individual and Transform. DGIT frame integrates heterogeneous models in different levels into a unified workflow. By using this frame, driver behavior models can be coupled in various scenarios, between different agents, during multi-period and within big data resources. Based on integrating models with different structures or functions, DGIT may describe driver behavior diversity satisfactorily. A simulation system is developed in this paper with DGIT frame, and comparison simulation experiments were performed. Simulation results prove the capability of DGIT frame for describing diversity and evaluating plan and decision strategy."
pub.1094699296,Agent-Based Negotiation between Partners in Loose Inter-Organizational Workflow,"This paper deals with negotiation between partners (organizations) in the context of loose Inter-Organizational Workflow (IOW). By negotiation between partners, we mean all the conversation acts made between a requester partner looking for a workflow service and one or several selected provider partner(s) able to provide the requested service. The agent technology is at the basis of our proposition since (i) it provides natural abstractions to deal with distribution, heterogeneity and autonomy which are inherent to loose IOW, (ii) it introduces powerful concepts such as groups and roles useful to describe in details the coordination of the different partners involved in the negotiation, and (iii) it has investigated the problem of negotiation between agents. In this paper, we first answer the following question “What kind of negotiation is suitable in loose IOW?” identifying what kind of agent behavior (competitive or cooperative) and what kind of negotiation protocol (auction, heuristic, argumentation or Contract-net) better suit loose IOW We also propose an agent-based architecture, compliant with the Workflow Management Coalition reference architecture, to support negotiation between partners, and an organizational model based on the AGR (Agent-Group-Role) meta model, which structures the negotiation in terms of Agents, Groups and Roles."
pub.1084920762,Rethinking BPM in a Cognitive World: Transforming How We Learn and Perform Business Processes,"If we are to believe the technology hype cycle, we are entering a new era of Cognitive Computing, enabled by advances in natural language processing, machine learning, and more broadly artificial intelligence. These advances, combined with evolutionary progress in areas such as knowledge representation, automated planning, user experience technologies, software-as-a-service and crowdsourcing, have the potential to transform many industries. In this paper, we discuss transformations of BPM that advances in the Cognitive Computing will bring. We focus on three of the most signficant aspects of this transformation, namely: (a) Cognitive Computing will enable “knowledge acquisition at scale”, which will lead to a transformation in Knowledge-intensive Processes (KiP’s); (b) We envision a new process meta-model will emerge that is centered around a “Plan-Act-Learn” cycle; and (c) Cognitive Computing can enable learning about processes from implicit descriptions (at both design- and run-time), opening opportunities for new levels of automation and business process support, for both traditional business processes and KiP’s. We use the term cognitive BPM to refer to a new BPM paradigm encompassing all aspects of BPM that are impacted and enabled by Cognitive Computing. We argue that a fundamental understanding of cognitive BPM requires a new research framing of the business process ecosystem. The paper presents a conceptual framework for cognitive BPM, a brief survey of state of the art in emerging areas of Cognitive BPM, and discussion of key directions for further research."
pub.1050752616,User Interface eXtensible Markup Language SIG,"A User Interface Description Language (UIDL) is a formal language used in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in order to describe a particular user interface independently of any implementation. Considerable research effort has been devoted to defining various meta-models in order to rigorously define the semantics of such a UIDL. These meta-models cover different aspects: context of use (user, platform, environment), task, domain, abstract user interface, concrete user interface, usability (including accessibility), workflow, organization, evolution, program, transformation, and mapping. A complete development method is typically made up of the following elements: models that capture various aspects of an interactive application (compliant with the previous meta-models), a language that expresses these models, a development life cycle, and software that support this method. This Special Interest Group is aimed at presenting User Interface eXtensible Markup Language (UsiXML), a particular UIDL that is of interest to a wide audience. Then, the UsiXML End User Club is introduced so that any person, group, or organization could observe, test, or contribute to the UsiXML technology. The SIG will present the potential benefits so that everyone can use it."
pub.1095526239,A-posteriori typing for Model-Driven Engineering,"Model-Driven Engineering is founded on the ability to create and process models conformant to a meta-model. Hence, meta-model classes are used in two ways: as templates to create objects, and as classifiers for them. While these two aspects are inherently tied in most meta-modelling approaches, in this paper, we discuss the benefits of their decoupling. Thus, we rely on standard mechanisms for object creation and propose a-posteriori typing as a means to reclassify objects and enable multiple, partial, dynamic typings. This approach enhances flexibility, permitting unanticipated reutilization (as existing model management operations defined for a meta-model can be reused with other models once they get reclassified), as well as model transformation by reclassification. We show the underlying theory behind the introduced concepts, and illustrate its applicability using our MetaDepth meta-modelling tool."
pub.1095808677,A Cooperative Framework for Inter-Organizational Workflow System,"Workflow management systems (WfMSs) are accepted worldwide due to their capability to model and control business processes. With WfMS, enterprises can improve work efficiency and react to the emergent situation quickly. However, most WfMSs adopt the centralized architecture in an organization so that they usually lack of a cooperative communication mechanism across different organizations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative framework for inter-organizational workflow systems. The framework consists of an inter-workflow meta-model, CA-PLAN (Cooperative Agentflow Process LANguage), and a prototype system based on Agentflow, a system developed in our laboratory. The cooperation mechanism between WfMSs in CA-PLAN is modeled as a Remote Call Process (RCP) paradiem. A Process Service is a mechanism that defines a process to participate in an inter-organizational process among different WfMSs and specifies the associated arguments in and out. A Remote Process is a proxy mechanism that refers to a process service on another WfMS. RCP provides the mechanism by which the process service and the remote process communicate and pass information back and forth and process monitor mechanism. The mechanism, also allowing dynamic changes and reconfiguration, can adapt dynamic and competitive business environment. Through RCP, the cooperative process across organizations becomes simple, faster, and flexible."
pub.1140869435,A domain specific language notation for a language learning activity generation tool,"Globalization has increased the need for society to master new languages. This need has encouraged the launch of many applications dedicated to language learning. This paper presents a graphical notation for a domain specific language to represent language learning activities. It describes how this notation enables developers to represent language learning activity characteristics using workflow, presentation, content, media and activity model conforming a metamodel that defines the abstract syntax of the domain specific language. This notation is implemented as part of an integrated development environment to build model-based applications. Finally, this proposal is evaluated with a framework that uses the cognitive dimensions of notations for notational systems. The proposed graphic diagram editor exceeds the experience that the user has with the reflexive model editor. In relation to the creation and editing of workflow models and presentation/activity models, the proposed graphical notation its more intuitive and easy to maintain visually than the traditional reflexive tree notation used by many model-based development frameworks."
pub.1085134699,Structural reliability analysis for p-boxes using multi-level meta-models,"In modern engineering, computer simulations are a popular tool to analyse, design, and optimize systems. Furthermore, concepts of uncertainty and the related reliability analysis and robust design are of increasing importance. Hence, an efficient quantification of uncertainty is an important aspect of the engineer's workflow. In this context, the characterization of uncertainty in the input variables is crucial. In this paper, input variables are modelled by probability-boxes, which account for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. Two types of probability-boxes are distinguished: free and parametric (also called distributional) p-boxes. The use of probability-boxes generally increases the complexity of structural reliability analyses compared to traditional probabilistic input models. In this paper, the complexity is handled by two-level approaches which use Kriging meta-models with adaptive experimental designs at different levels of the structural reliability analysis. For both types of probability-boxes, the extensive use of meta-models allows for an efficient estimation of the failure probability at a limited number of runs of the performance function. The capabilities of the proposed approaches are illustrated through a benchmark analytical function and two realistic engineering problems."
pub.1017868565,A Draft Systems Engineering Tools Taxonomy and Mapping to a Meta‐Process Model,Abstract The goal of this paper is to provide a draft classification of tools that may be useful to systems engineers in understanding tool choices for the automation of their work. An accepted classification will require input from NCOSE members and modification of the draft. The tools automate the systems engineering process. Each kind of tool performs particular functions and captures particular sets of information. In this paper the tools are mapped to a meta‐model for the systems engineering process. That meta‐model describes the core systems engineering steps and gives an information model for each step. Mapping the tools to the meta‐model defines the functions performed by each tool type and the information it captures. The mapping also establishes the interfaces between tool types.

pub.1051060132,A Survey on Approaches to Modeling Artifact-Centric Business Processes,"Business Process Modeling using artifact-centric approach has gained increasing interest over the past few years. The ability to put data and process aspects on an equal footing has made it a powerful tool for efficient business process modeling. The artifact-centric approach is based on key business-relevant entities called business artifacts, which are central for guiding business operations as they navigate through the business operations. The artifact-centric modeling approach can be laid in a four dimensional framework called BALSA for defining business processes, where the four dimensions include business artifacts, lifecycles, services and associations. Based on this data-centric paradigm, several artifact-centric meta-models have been emerged in the recent years. Although all the proposed models claim to support the artifact-centric approach, their support in specifying the BALSA elements of artifacts was not clearly described in the existing literature. This paper reviews all existing approaches to artifact-centric modeling and also discuss to what extent they align with the BALSA framework."
pub.1016588227,Measuring Method Complexity of the Case Management Modeling and Notation (CMMN),"In 2014, the Object Management Group (OMG) published the Case Management Modeling and Notation (CMMN) version 1.0 specification, which is a new process modeling specification to complement its Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) specification. The declarative nature of CMMN is intended to supplement the procedural perspective of BPMN. CMMN takes a data-centric view to process modeling based on business artifacts to provide flexibility for knowledge workers, while retaining the advantages of business process management (BPM) systems. As far as the researchers are aware, this research is among the first contributions to the understanding of CMMN's method complexity in the context of other process modeling notations. We used the meta-model-based method complexity approach introduced by Rossi and Brinkkemper to evaluate the method complexity of CMMN. The results were compared with other popular process methods, including BPMN, Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity diagrams, and Event-driven Process Charts (EPC), all of which have undergone similar evaluations by other researchers. The initial results indicated that CMMN 1.0 compares favorably with BPMN 1.2."
pub.1149553859,BPMN4SBP for Multi-dimensional Modeling of Sensitive Business Processes,"This research article proposes a conceptual solution for the Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs). It aims at systematically developing a valid and rigorous BPMN extension, called “BPMN4SBP”, supporting the multi-dimensional modeling of SBPs (i.e., the knowledge, functional, organizational, behavioral, informational and intentional dimensions). The objective of the new extension is to explicitly integrate all the relevant issues and aspects relevant at the coupling/intersection of the busine ss process modeling (BPM) domain and the knowledge management (KM) domain for improving the identification and management of crucial knowledge which are mobilized and created by these processes. Based on a Core Ontology of SBP, need for extension is identified and the valid BPMN4SBP extension is designed by the construction of a conceptional domain model and the corresponding BPMN extension model. This extended BPMN4SBP meta-model is derived by applying model transformation rules and by adapting, also, the UML profile mechanism to BPMN."
pub.1093752905,A Lightweight Aspect Modelling Approach for BPMN,"Aspectual Business Process Modelling is not a new concept in business process based development to support the separation of the cross cutting concerns. Most of the researchers use the concept of the heavyweight extensions of the business processes to incorporate the aspects. This requires changes in the meta-models of the languages and the tool infrastructures, which is not a feasible option. Some of the researchers also provide lightweight extensions in the form of profiles, but these are mostly incomplete and do not provide solutions for modelling some important aspectual concepts like Pointcuts effectively. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we provide a lightweight extension of the business processes expressed in BPMN to incorporate the aspect specific concepts in it. We propose a profile ABPMN which uses the existing notations of the BPMN models for expressing aspectual concepts. Further, we developed a language PCDL to express the pointcuts in an effective way. The language is implemented using XText in Eclipse. To evaluate the applicability of our approach, we applied it on a case study of the E-Bidding system."

This issue has mainly been investigated in the context of intra-organizational processes but it received little attention in the context of Inter-organizational Processes (IoP), which correspond to processes crossing the boundaries of companies. This paper deals with IoP flexibility modeled as collaborations and choreographies in BPMN, advocating a version-based approach. Firstly, the paper introduces the provided extensions to BPMN 2.0 meta-model to take into account the notion of version considering both static and dynamic aspects of collaboration versions. Secondly, it presents a mapping approach for deducing version of choreography from version of collaboration. Thirdly, it introduces the BPMN4V-Modeler, which is an implementation of BPMN4V on top of the well-known BPMN-Modeler Eclipse plug-in."

However, in doing so, IT complexity will admittedly increase and IT managers then are in need of effective governance techniques covering both strategic initiatives, BPM and SOA. This contribution re-examines the problem domain in the novel Enhanced Process-Driven Architecture (ePDA) model in order to systematically derive the requirements for combined BPM and SOA governance. We then formulate a semantic meta model capable of capturing necessary artifacts and describe its technical implementation in Software AG’s and Fujitsu’s joint CentraSite governance re gis try/repository. As ""lessons learned"" from several projects we systematically derive governance benefits using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and highlight measures on software deployment issues."

While for the pattern recognition aspects involved, the required processing steps can be related to fingerprint biometrics, the common biometric model needs to be extended to face the variety of characteristics of different surfaces and image qualities and to keep the chain of custody. Therefore, we introduce a framework for automated forensic analysis of latent fingerprints. The framework consists of a generic process model for multi-branched process graphs w.r.t. security aspects like integrity, authenticity and confidentiality. It specifies a meta-model to store all necessary data and operations in the process, while keeping the chain of custody. In addition, a concept for a technical implementation of the meta-model is given, to build a container format, which suits the needs of an automated forensic analysis in research and application."
pub.1136536669,Method for process-based modeling of combat scenarios using interaction analysis weapon systems,"With technological advancements, weapon system development has become increasingly complex and costly. Using modeling and simulation (M&S) technology in the conceptual design stage is effective in reducing the development time and cost of weapons. One way to reduce the complexity and trial-and-error associated with weapon development using M&S technology is to develop combat scenarios to review the functions assigned to new weapons. Although the M&S technology is applicable, it is difficult to analyze how effectively the weapons are functioning, because of the dynamic features inherent in combat scenario modeling, which considers interrelations among different weapon entities. To support review of weapon functions including these characteristics, this study develops a process-based modeling (PBM) method to model the interactions between weapons in the combat scenario. This method includes the following three steps: (1) construct virtual models by converting the weapons and the weapon functions into their corresponding components; (2) generate the combat process from the combat scenario, which is derived from the interrelations among weapons under consideration using reasoning rules; (3) develop a process-based model that describes weapon functions by combining the combat process with virtual models. Then, a PBM system based on this method is implemented. The case study executed on this system shows that it is useful in deriving process-based models from various combat scenarios, analyzing weapon functions using the derived models, and reducing weapon development issues in the conceptual design stage."
pub.1032333300,Parallel Processing for Business Artifacts with Declarative Lifecycles,"The business artifact (a.k.a. business entity) approach to modeling and implementing business operations and processes is based on a holistic marriage of data and process and enables a factoring of business operations based on key business-relevant conceptual entities. The recently introduced Guard-Stage- Milestone (GSM) artifact meta-model provides a hierarchical and declarative basis for specifying artifact lifecycles, and is substantially influencing OMG’s emerging Case Management Modeling Notation standard. In previous papers one characterization of the operational semantics for GSM is based on the incremental, strictly serial firing of Event-Condition-Action (ECA) like rules. This paper develops a parallel algorithm equivalent to the sequential one in terms of externally observable characteristics. Optimizations and analysis for the parallel algorithm are discussed. This paper also introduces a simplification of the GSM meta-model that provides more flexibility and makes checking for well-formedness of GSM models simpler and more intuitive than in the preceding works on GSM."
pub.1050872827,Developing domain-specific mashup tools for end users,"The recent emergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end user development, i.e., on enabling end users without programming skills to compose own applications. Yet, similar to what happened with analogous promises in web service composition and business process management, research has mostly focused on technology and, as a consequence, has failed its objective. Plain technology (e.g., SOAP/WSDL web services) or simple modeling languages (e.g., Yahoo! Pipes) don't convey enough meaning to non-programmers. We propose a domain-specific approach to mashups that ""speaks the language of the user"", i.e., that is aware of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is comfortable with. We show what developing a domain-specific mashup tool means, which role the mashup meta-model and the domain model play and how these can be merged into a domain-specific mashup meta-model. We apply the approach implementing a mashup tool for the research evaluation domain. Our user study confirms that domain-specific mashup tools indeed lower the entry barrier to mashup development."

pub.1019863185,Specifying Business Policy Using Agent-Contract Meta-Constructs,"Business policy is a set of rules, regulations, invariants and definitions that govern the behavior of an enterprise. It is typically formulated by business people and formalized by lawyers. Business policy is often written down. However, much policy exists only in the memories of those who work for or with an enterprise. Still other policy is embedded in the code of enterprise software systems.Solution developers have long realized that software is a means of promulgating and enforcing business policy. Without a correct or complete understanding of that policy, software will not function as required by the business. In addition, software that indiscriminately mixes policy and technology is difficult to maintain and reuse. Finally, as the only place where much business policy is documented, software commonly becomes de facto policy.For all of the importance of business policy to behavior in general and software in particular, it is curious that most businesses have no formal business policy management processes. It is ironic that the haphazard business policy management that is done is almost untouched by automation.A new meta-model dubbed the “agent-contract” meta-model was created recently by the IBM Consulting Group in collaboration with several of IBM’s industry solution units. This model was created as a means to integrate of IBM’s existing and future industry models. During the development process, it became clear that this meta-model would also provide direct support for business policy analysis and management. This essay describes the major concepts in the meta-model and connects the work to the growing rules/invariants movement within the object community."
pub.1154792225,Using the ORIS Tool and the SIRIO Library for Model-Driven Engineering of Quantitative Analytics,"We present a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach to quantitative evaluation of stochastic models through the ORIS tool and the SIRIO library. As an example, the approach is applied to the case of a tramway line with reduced number of passengers to contain the spread of infection during a pandemic. Specifically, we provide a meta-model for this scenario, where, at each stop, only a certain number of people can ride the tram depending on the current tram capacity, the length of the queue of people waiting at the stop, and the number of passengers on the tram. Then, the ORIS tool and the SIRIO library are used as a software platform to derive a Stochastic Time Petri Net (STPN) representation for each tramway stop and to perform its regenerative transient analysis to obtain quantitative measures of interest, such as the expected number of people waiting at each stop and the expected number of tram passengers over time. Experimental results show that the approach facilitates exploration of the space of design choices, providing insight about the effects of parameter changes on quantitative measures of interest and allowing balanced queue sizes at different stops."
pub.1103441998,A Meta-model based Approach for LCA-oriented Product Data Management," The collection of useful information from all stages of product lifecycle is on the premise to complete a life cycle assessment (LCA) study of the product. This naturally leads to the necessity to provide computerized tools to support a humanexpert. Unfortunately, most current employed information systems in the industry do not effectively support LCA-oriented data management. In this paper, a meta-model based approach for LCA oriented product life cycle related data retrieval and integration is proposed, which not only increases the efficiency but also ensure the consistency and traceability of data collection for LCA study.In this study, product life cycle is characterized from perspectives of product entity, operations upon the product entity and resulting process inventory. Then, a data meta model that defines the basic structure and contents of LCA-oriented dataset of the identified life cycle stage of identified product entity is proposed. Based on the proposed meta model, the multi-layer architecture of a LCA-oriented data service tool is then developed. It is consisted of the “Client” layer with interfaces for users to make life cycle data requests; the “Meta-model builder” layer to configure and parse the meta model for data source connection and data model instantiation; the “Data source access” layer which builds connections between data sources and the meta-model and realizes heterogeneous data retrieval and integration from different sources. The proposed approach is expected to ease the difficulties in performing LCA, especially in sorting, retrieval and integration of valuable data from exiting product and process models for life cycle modelling, and thus to better facilitate environment-friendly product design and manufacturing."

As INGENIAS follows a model-driven approach, these activities are largely focused on obtaining a specification of the MAS, conforming to the INGENIAS metamodel. The case study of the conference management system illustrates the application of this process to get a description of the environment and users of the system and the workflows where it will act."

With this transformation, UML models could be verified by verifying derived event B models. The design is initially expressed graphically with UML and translated into Event B. The resulting model is then enriched with invariants describing dynamic properties such as deadlock freeness, livelock freeness and reachability. The approach uses activity diagrams meta-model."

pub.1085268031,OBJECT-PROCESS DATA MODEL IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"We have studied the question of data models creation with respect to the process-based management of industrial enterprise. It is proposed to use an object data model for management and operational management decision making systems at the process organization of industrial enterprise. We consider the basic concepts and definitions used in object-process data model, suggest its mathematical description, that includes tree representation of the system goals, object meta-models of production system, business process, the center responsible for resource. We have defined four phases of information system creation based on the object-process data model: goal tree description, metamodeling of objects and processes, data structure representation, data warehouse modeling of the production system. The goal tree is a hierarchical scorecard of the enterprise. Production objects are described by hierarchical structures and should meet requirements of the specified system of quality indicators for goods or services. The most important stage of material system metamodeling is to establish connections between objects, processes passing in it and indicators of the goals tree. The ultimate objective for metamodeling of the material system objects and processes should lie in the repository creation where one can get the structures of objects, processes, indicators and links on the basis of their unique identifiers. We have proposed a variant of object-process model application in integrated information systems based on the service-oriented architecture with the ability to take into account the goals of business, collect data on the current state of processes and organize data storage for retrospective data analysis tasks. The usage of object-process model during information system creation enables to combine two types of control: deviation control and management-by-objectives."

We particularly demonstrate how traditional RDBMS technology can be easily deployed to support several common digital library services. Configuration and customization of the framework to build specialized systems is supported by a wizard-like tool which is based on a generic metamodel for DLs. Such a tool implements a workflow process that segments the DL design tasks into well-defined steps and drives the designer along these steps. Both the framework and the configuration tool are evaluated in terms of several performance and usability criteria. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and superior performance of our framework, as well as the effectiveness of the wizard tool for setting up DLs."

pub.1094156760,An Information Model for Service and Network Management Integration: from Needs Towards Solutions,"This paper proposes enhancements for information modeling to support service and network management integration. Despite the existence of management standard models (TMN, TMF, DMTF…), it seems that operators are facing difficulties choosing the appropriate model, defining its instances and achieving its implementations. The analysis of this situation stresses the need for an information model able to represent the real world objects independently of their management. To respond to this key requirement, we propose solutions, based on a metamodel, that guarantee information coherence, self-management capability and management integration. These propositions allow the operators to support new workflows and to handle new services efficiently. Furthermore, the M3100 model, the MTNM model and the ENST model are applied to model an ADSL network example."
pub.1094156688,Component-based Collaborative Virtual Environment,"Processes in knowledge intensive environments often emerge rather than following predefined steps, especially in collaborative virtual space. Such emergence can induce disconnected activities, which results in complex interaction structures that require ways to maintain awareness across the activities and to coordinate the activities to a common goal. The paper suggests that new ways are needed to both model emergent processes and support and manage tbem using information technologies. A metamodel using the abstracted construction components to create initial processes and to realize emergence in collaborative virtual environment, is proposed in this paper” A prototype system named “LiveNet” that implements these semantics as a foundation is outlined. The foundation provides the infrastructure for customizing inte rfaces for collaborative portals and some applications in teaching and extension to agent based workflows are also outlined."

Gas transport is modeled by unsteady Eulerian flow of compressible, natural gas in pipeline distribution networks together with a gas law and equations describing temperature effects. Such problems can lead to large systems of nonlinear equations with constraints that are computationally expensive to solve by themselves, more so if parameter studies are conducted and the system has to be solved repeatedly. Metamodels will thus play a decisive role in the general workflows and practical examples discussed here."

pub.1155699693,"BPMNE4IoT: A Framework for Modeling, Executing and Monitoring IoT-Driven Processes †","The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a variety of smart applications, including smart home, smart manufacturing, and smart city. By enhancing Business Process Management Systems with IoT capabilities, the execution and monitoring of business processes can be significantly improved. Providing a holistic support for modeling, executing and monitoring IoT-driven processes, however, constitutes a challenge. Existing process modeling and process execution languages, such as BPMN 2.0, are unable to fully meet the IoT characteristics (e.g., asynchronicity and parallelism) of IoT-driven processes. In this article, we present BPMNE4IoT—A holistic framework for modeling, executing and monitoring IoT-driven processes. We introduce various artifacts and events based on the BPMN 2.0 metamodel that allow realizing the desired IoT awareness of business processes. The framework is evaluated along two real-world scenarios from two different domains. Moreover, we present a user study for comparing BPMNE4IoT and BPMN 2.0. In particular, this study has confirmed that the BPMNE4IoT framework facilitates the support of IoT-driven processes."
pub.1048199685,Extending WS-Agreement to Support Automated Conformity Check on Transport and Logistics Service Agreements,"Checking whether the agreed service quality attributes are fulfilled or maintained during the service life-cycle is a very important task for SLA (Service Level Agreement) enforcement. In this paper, we leverage conformance checking techniques developed for computational services to automate the conformity checking of transport & logistics services. Our solution extends the WS-Agreement metamodel to support the definition of frame and specific SLAs. With this extension, we define a new validation operation for the conformity check of transport & logistics SLAs based on CSPs solvers. The key contribution of our work is that, as far as we know, it is the first definition of an automated conformity check solution for long term agreements in the transport & logistics domain. Nonetheless, other domains in which similar SLAs are defined can also benefit from our solution."
pub.1006922822,Requirements Engineering and Process Modelling in Software Quality Management— Towards a Generic Process Metamodel,"This paper examines the concept of Quality in Software Engineering, its different contexts and its different meanings to various people. It begins with a commentary on quality issues for systems development and various stakeholders' involvement. It revisits aspects and concepts of systems development methods and highlights the relevance of quality issues to the choice of a process model. A summarised review of some families of methods is presented, where their application domain, lifecycle coverage, strengths and weaknesses are considered. Under the new development era the requirements of software development change; the role of methods and stakeholders change, too. The paper refers to the latest developments in the area of software engineering and emphasises the shift from traditional conceptual modelling to requirements engineering and process metamodelling principles. We provide support for an emerging discipline in the form of a software process metamodel to cover new issues for software quality and process improvement. The widening of the horizons of software engineering both as a ‘communication tool’ and as a ‘scientific discipline’ (and not as a ‘craft’) is needed in order to support both communicative and scientific quality systems properties. In general, we can consider such a discipline as a thinking tool for understanding the generic process and as the origin of combining intuition and quality engineering to transform requirements to adequate human-centred information systems. We conclude with a schematic representation of a Generic Process Metamodel (GPM) indicating facets contributed by Software Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Mathematics, Linguistics, Sociology and Anthropology. Ongoing research and development issues have provided evidence for influence from even more diverse disciplines."
pub.1094312784,Automated Refinement of Business Processes through Model Transformations Specifying Business Rules,"Business processes are changing over time, e.g., due to new or changed legal regulations. Complex processes are susceptible to change, since they capture much detail and/or deal with variability according to context. Manual adaptation of process models according to such changes takes time and is error-prone. In order to address these issues, primarily complexity, we propose to model high-level reference processes with less detail than the fully-fledged processes. The missing details are captured in additional business rules that operationalize how an organization performs miscellaneous tasks. Their application to a high-level reference process leads to its refinement. Technically, we propose explicit separation of process models (represented in BPMN) and specifications of business rules (represented as model-transformation rules based on the BPMN 2.0 metamodel). Applying such rules as model transformations to process models (at design-time) leads to models of either refined or adjusted models of business processes. In this way, even without any extension of the BPMN 2.0 standard, these model adaptations can handle the required changes of business processes."

In fact, the nature of those artifacts has deeply changed (i.e. they are essentially models) and relationships between them are numerous (e.g. transformation, matching, overlap and so on). We highlight that they are under-considered by the software process community and propose an approach, which takes into account all the details related to them while modeling a software process. Our approach also gives the possibility to ensure an optimized management for the artifacts at process runtime."
pub.1071879972,Mining Users' Intents from Logs,"<p>Intentions play a key role in information systems engineering. Research on process modeling has highlighted that specifying intentions can expressly mitigate many problems encountered in process modeling as lack of flexibility or adaptation. Process mining approaches mine processes in terms of tasks and branching. To identify and formalize intentions from event logs, this work presents a novel approach of process mining, called Map Miner Method (MMM). This method automates the construction of intentional process models from event logs. First, MMM estimates users' strategies (i.e., the different ways to fulfill the intentions) in terms of their activities. These estimated strategies are then used to infer users' intentions at different levels of abstraction using two tailored algorithms. MMM constructs intentional process models with respect to the Map metamodel formalism. MMM is applied on a real-world dataset, i.e. event logs of developers of Eclipse UDC (Usage Data Collector). The resulting Map process model provides a precious understanding of the processes followed by the developers, and also provide feedback on the effectiveness and demonstrate scalability of MMM.</p>"
pub.1145290306,A Deep-Learning-Based Meta-Modeling Workflow for Thermal Load Forecasting in Buildings: Method and a Case Study,"This paper proposes a meta-modeling workflow to forecast the cooling and heating loads of buildings at individual and district levels in the early design stage. Seven input variables, with large impacts on building loads, are selected for designing meta-models to establish the MySQL database. The load profiles of office, commercial, and hotel models are simulated with EnergyPlus in batches. A sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model based on the deep-learning method of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is introduced to achieve rapid forecasting of all-year hourly building loads. The method performs well with the load effective hour rate (LEHR) of around 90% and MAPE less than 10%. Finally, this meta-modeling workflow is applied to a district as a case study in Shanghai, China. The forecasting results well match the actual loads with R2 of 0.9978 and 0.9975, respectively, for the heating and cooling load. The LEHR value of all-year hourly forecasting loads is 98.4%, as well as an MAPE of 4.4%. This meta-modeling workflow expands the applicability of building-physics-based methods and improves the time resolution of conventional data-driven methods. It shows small forecasting errors and fast computing speed while meeting the required precision and convenience of engineering in the building early design stage."

This implies a need for application of an approximation techniques enabling for fast responses generation with maintained level of results quality. This study focuses on an advancement of aerodynamic shape optimization process of a small aircraft engine intake system by introduction of a surrogate modelling step into the design loop. The multi-objective metamodel assisted optimization is carried out in order to reduce pressure losses along the engine intake duct and increase flow homogeneity at the engine compressor intake plane. Latin Hypercube Design method is utilized in order to sample the design space. A set of initial objective function evaluations is generated with application of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver. The ensemble of samples is further used to train a Kriging-based surrogate model. The Efficient Global Optimization algorithm basing on the Expected Improvement function is employed to gradually increase the metamodel prediction quality by usage of sequential sampling technique. Finally, the optimal point predicted by the Kriging surrogate is validated against the high-fidelity model with usage of the Computational Fluid Dynamics code. The paper presents an application of the abovementioned methodology to the design process of the I-31T aircraft turboprop engine intake system. Proposed Kriging-based optimization workflow is utilized in order to reduce pressure losses and improve flow homogeneity in the engine air-intake duct."
pub.1016755420,An approach for defining ways-of-working,"Process modelling is considered today as a key issue by both, the Software Engineering (SE) and the Information Systems Engineering (ISE) community. However, most recent process models are descriptions of software development activities written in an executable form that computer systems can enforce. There is a need for process models which take into account heuristic knowledge to guide humans performing systems development. We refer to such guidance centred process models as ‘ways-of-working’. So far, most work has concentrated on developing and experimenting with process modelling approaches and little attention has been paid to the problem of developing a method for defining a new process model. We propose in this paper, an approach for defining ways-of-working in a systematic manner. It is a meta-modelling approach in which a given way-of-working is constructed by instantiation of a process meta-model allowing to deal with a large variety of situations in a flexible, decision-oriented manner. Based on the properties of the meta-model, ways-of-working are formally defined, with an appropriate level of genericity, and in a modular way to facilitate their evolution and improvement. They are designed for providing automated and flexible guidance in decision making during the process. The paper presents the approach, exemplifies it with the way-of-working defined within the Esprit project F3 and illustrates how the process is guided on an F3 case study."
pub.1174047874,Predicting viscosity for steelmaking slag: A stacking regression approach,"The viscosity of steel slag plays a pivotal role in steelmaking, impacting various aspects of the steelmaking operation and product quality. This paper introduces a novel approach for predicting the viscosity of turndown slag from a basic oxygen furnace using a stacking regression model. The stacking model in this approach incorporates four base models: multiple linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and AdaBoost (ADB), while random forest is selected as a meta-model. The selection of meta-models is done through a systematic framework provided for identifying suitable meta-models in a stacking model. Similarly, the framework also demonstrated the workflow for constructing and evaluating a series of stacking models with different configurations. On the evaluation of 20 stacking models (including two and three-layers), the optimal configuration is found to be LR + KNN with R2 value of 0.993 and the shortest training time. Additionally, a correlation analysis of slag viscosity with composition and temperature is done, which will help the operators of steel melting shops in optimize the steelmaking process based on the required slag viscosity. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the efficacy of optimal-configured stacking regression models in industrial applications, achieving both maximum accuracy and minimal computational time."
pub.1158398992,A New Action Meta-model and Grammar for a DEMO Based Low-Code Platform Rules Processing Engine,"We consider current Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) Action Rules Specification to be unnecessarily complex and ambiguous. Even while using a “structured English” syntax similar to the one used in Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), such specifications are: incomplete while not containing enough ontological information to derive a functional implementation; and complex by containing mostly unneeded specifications. We propose a new meta-model for DEMO’s Action Model in the form of an Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF) syntax which is being implemented in a prototype that directly executes DEMO models as an Information and Workflow System. This prototype includes an action engine that runs DEMO transactions and the enclosed actions specified in our approach. We are currently integrating Blockly in our solution to allow syntactically correct visual programming of our proposed new Action Rule language that includes constructs to evaluate logical conditions, update the state of internal or external information systems, obtain input and provide output (formatted with a ‘What You See Is What You Get’ (WYSIWYG) template editor) to users, among others."

An increasing amount of research effort is being dedicated to MSP. These studies differ in various aspects (e.g., topics, data, and techniques) of MSP. Objective: We aim to study the state of the art on MSP from following aspects, i.e., research topics, data sources, data types, mining techniques, and mining tools. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study on the research relevant to MSP at both microprocess and macroprocess levels. Results: Our mapping study identified 40 relevant studies that can be grouped into microprocess and macroprocess levels. The identified mining techniques have been mapped onto the associated mining tools that fall into four types. Driven by the three research questions which represented in a meta-model, the findings revealed the correlations among the research topics, data sources, data types, mining techniques, and mining tools. Conclusion: It is observed that in order to discover the software process model or map, the main data source is from industrial project. Current mining techniques for microprocess research are mostly business process mining or sequence mining techniques used to recover descriptive software process. In addition, various machine learning algorithms and novel proposed methods are used to improve the accuracy of macroprocess level factors (e.g., software effort estimation)."
pub.1023758940,Presentation and exchange of business models with CIMOSA-XML,"In the modern competitive business world there is a frequent need for enterprises to modify their structure of business processes to become more effective in the market place. The solution to this management demand is an improved business integration which is only successful when it is supported by effective IT systems. The Esprit project PRIMA aims to create a competitive advantage for European companies in the process sector by providing a route to `smarter' IT investments that are effective across the whole enterprise. A process repository which will store business process models in suitable formats would provide users with appropriate views of the models, focusing only on their information needs. However, the existence of many incompatible modelling methodologies and tools makes it impossible to unify the modelling approach. Therefore it would be desirable to have a high level common modelling language. The PRIMA project has identified CIMOSA as the basis for common semantics of the business model language and the XML format, as a suitable format for the transfer of the model structure and content. The PRIMA working group, in an effort to elaborate these concepts, has developed the Document Type Definition concept (DTD) of the CIMOSA-XML meta-model, which can be used to build the partial enterprise models related to the Business Functional Requirements (BFR) of the PRIMA Process Methodology."
pub.1105214449,An application meta-model to support the execution and benchmarking of scientific applications in multi-cloud environments,"Cloud computing has proven its importance to scientists around the globe on many occasions already. However, as it is still a rather new technology for many users, the cloud represents another layer of complexity in any workflow. As a lot of research confirms, especially the efficient provision and management of resources in the cloud is a very complex but also very rewarding task. Upon surveying the research in this area we observed many differences in applied methodologies and application cases which impede not only the comparison of these approaches but also the collective usage of the obtained results, e.g. for more accurate resource estimation algorithms that require less additional benchmarks. We propose a novel application and resource meta-model to model not only applications but also the underlying resource infrastructure for application benchmarks in a generic manner. We show how the meta-model is defined and how it can be used to model an application, using a simple web application as an example. We conclude with highlighting the potential benefits of applying this model in different scenarios but also its limits and how it could be expanded in the future."

pub.1092783896,Optimization of the Operation Characteristic of a Highly Stressed Centrifugal Compressor Impeller Using Automated Optimization and Metamodeling Methods,"The continuously rising global demand for energy together with simultaneously decreasing resources has made the topic of energy efficiency — and therefore optimization — one of the fundamental questions of our time. Turbomachinery is one of the most important parts of the process chain in nearly every case of energy conversion. This makes the turbomachine a promising approach point for optimizations. The special relevance of this topic in regard to the global challenge of climate change can be illustrated by a simple calculation: If the efficiency of a turbo compressor with a power consumption of 15MW is improved by one percent, approximately 2t CO2 per day or over 760t CO2 per year can be saved. This work describes the optimization of the operation characteristic of a highly stressed centrifugal compressor impeller with regard to the size of the operation range and the efficiency in the operation point. The base impeller used for this optimization has already been pre-optimized by classical engineering methods utilizing analytical and empirical models. Due to the high mechanical stress in these kind of turbo impellers, each design has to be checked for compliance with the structural constraints in addition to the fluid dynamic computations. This context results in a highly complex, multicriterial, high dimensional optimization problem. The main subjects of the presented work are a robust geometry generation and grid generation, a highly automated workflow for the computation of the operation characteristic and the mechanical results and the representation of the operation characteristic by scalar parameters. Utilizing these tools a DOE is performed and based on its results a metamodel is created. The optimization is carried out on the metamodel using a Particle Swarm algorithm. The workflow presented in this work utilizes in-house preprocessing tools as well as the tools of the ANSYS Workbench. The operation characteristics are computed using an in-house tool to control the ANSYS CFX-Solver. The statistical and stochastic pre- and post-processing as well as the metamodeling are carried out in optiSLang.Copyright © 2017 by ASME"

Our approach combines a set of meta-models and transformation rules based on the domain knowledge of manufacturing engineers and data scientists. Our approach uses a model of a manufacturing process and its associated data as inputs, and generates a trained neural network model as an output to predict a quantity of interest.

pub.1093273278,Using the UML testing profile for enterprise service choreographies,"In this paper we present an approach of using model-driven technologies for testing of service component interactions. We report on an industrial experiment with a novel combination of existing UML standards, i.e., the UML Testing Profile (U2TP), in conjunction with proprietary domain specific languages (DSLs). Many model-based testing (MBT) approaches use the UML 2 standard, but very few of them use also U2TP. Moreover, in practice UML coexists with DSLs which makes the overall integration not easy. We present our experiences and challenges of a U2TP-enabled MBT approach for a DSL for enterprise service choreographies, which describe the communication protocols between service components. The proposed workflow directly translates choreographies into UML models augmented with U2TP stereotypes, which are further loaded into our FOKUS!MBT tool chain. The tool provides an implementation of the U2TP standalone meta-model along with test case and test data generators to describe a holistic test process within one dedicated meta-model for testing concerns."

It suggests that C4ISR requirements elicitation be initiated with capability meta concept framework (CMCF) construction according to the Meta-Model of DoDAF. With the semantic confinement of CMCF, the approach extends the Fuzzy-UML and declares a C4ISR domain-specific modeling language (C4ISR DSL). Compared with classic UML and Fuzzy-UML, the C4ISR DSL is more specialized in C4ISR domain knowledge elicitation and reuse. The experiment shows the modeling language can better express both precise and vague concepts of the C4ISR capability model."

pub.1084457442,A Corrected Surrogate Model Based Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Method under Uncertainty,"Vehicle weight reduction has become one of the most crucial problems in the automotive industry because that increasingly stringent regulatory requirements, such as fuel economy and environmental protection, must be met. The lightweight design needs to consider various vehicle attributes, including crashworthiness and stiffness. Therefore, in essence, the vehicle weight reduction is a typical Multidisciplinary Design Optimization problem. To improve the computational efficiency, meta-models have been widely used as the surrogate of FE model in the multidisciplinary optimization of large structures. However, these surrogate models introduce additional sources of uncertainties, such as model uncertainty, which may lead to the poor accuracy in prediction. In this paper, a method of corrected surrogate model based multidisciplinary design optimization under uncertainty is proposed to incorporate the uncertainties introduced by both meta-models and design variables. Firstly, various meta-models are constructed and the meta-models with the highest accuracy are selected to serve as the surrogates of FE model. Followed by the evaluation of corresponding model bias of the selected models. Then the Gaussian Process model for the bias function is built and employed to correct the previously built low fidelity meta-model for the reason that Gaussian Process Regression, a kind of nonparametric probabilistic model, can quantify the uncertainties introduced by the usage of the meta-model. Finally, based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), robust solution which can meet the performance requirements of different subjects is found efficiently. The proposed method is demonstrated through a vehicle weight reduction problem while satisfying the safety and NVH performance requirements."

Currently, since the model is in its preliminary stage, only the classification of critical business functions is present in the conceptual schema. Apart from the conceptual model, the specific business impact analysis activity is illustrated using the Business Object Relation Modelling approach, which is ideal for business process requirement analysis. The current conceptual schema will be used as a guide for constructing the future complete meta-model, as well as a logical schema regarding the specific business intelligence solution."

The current lack of methodologies suitable for the design and development of such applications is usually attributed to significant differences between service-oriented applications and more traditional ones: monolithic, component-based, and web-based ones. While some differences indeed exist, they are not substantial, and many among the old tricks—i.e., existing enterprise modeling and development techniques—can effectively be reused in the service-oriented context."
pub.1095337731,Introducing Software Process Tailoring to BPMN: BPMNt,"BPMN 2.0 is a widely used notation to model business process that has associated tools and techniques to facilitate process management, execution and monitoring. As a result using BPMN to model Software Development Process (SDP) can leverage on the BPMN's infrastructure to improve SDP quality. Nevertheless, when using BPMN to model Software Processes one can observe the lack of an important feature: means to represent process tailoring. This article introduces the BPMNt, a conservative extension to BPMN that aims at aggregating a tailoring representation mechanism as the one found at SPEM 2.0. BPMNt uses the extensibility classes already present in the BPMN meta-model. Our work also presents an example to illustrate the approach."
pub.1052885041,Preface for OIS 2006,"A major bottleneck in business applications of Semantic Web technology is the lack of industry-strength ontologies that go beyond academic prototypes. The design of such ontologies from scratch in a textbook-style ontology engineering process is in many cases unattractive, for it would require significant effort and because the resulting ontologies could not build on top of existing community commitment. Also, real-world problems of data and systems interoperability can only be overcome using Semantic Web technology if ontologies exist that represent the very standards currently in use in systems and databases."

pub.1144208065,An efficient and scalable search engine for models,"Search engines extract data from relevant sources and make them available to users via queries. A search engine typically crawls the web to gather data, analyses and indexes it and provides some query mechanism to obtain ranked results. There exist search engines for websites, images, code, etc., but the specific properties required to build a search engine for models have not been explored much. In the previous work, we presented MAR, a search engine for models which has been designed to support a query-by-example mechanism with fast response times and improved precision over simple text search engines. The goal of MAR is to assist developers in the task of finding relevant models. In this paper, we report new developments of MAR which are aimed at making it a useful and stable resource for the community. We present the crawling and analysis architecture with which we have processed about 600,000 models. The indexing process is now incremental and a new index for keyword-based search has been added. We have also added a web user interface intended to facilitate writing queries and exploring the results. Finally, we have evaluated the indexing times, the response time and search precision using different configurations. MAR has currently indexed over 500,000 valid models of different kinds, including Ecore meta-models, BPMN diagrams, UML models and Petri nets. MAR is available at http://mar-search.org."
pub.1092819527,Toward Metamodels for Composable and Reusable Additive Manufacturing Process Models,"Though the advanced manufacturing capabilities offered by additive manufacturing (AM) have been known for several decades, industry adoption of AM technologies has been relatively slow. Recent advances in modeling and simulation of AM processes and materials are providing new insights to help overcome some of the barriers that have hindered adoption. However, these models and simulations are often application specific, and few are developed in an easily reusable manner. Variations are compounded because many models are developed as independent or proprietary efforts, and input and output definitions have not been standardized. To further realize the potential benefits of modeling and simulation advancements, including predictive modeling and closed-loop control, more coordinated efforts must be undertaken. In this paper, we advocate a more harmonized approach to model development, through classification and metamodeling that will support model composability, reusability, and integration. We review several types of AM models and use direct metal powder bed fusion characteristics to provide illustrative examples of the proposed classification and metamodel approach. We describe how a coordinated approach can be used to extend modeling capabilities by promoting model composability. As part of future work, a framework is envisioned to realize a more coherent strategy for model development and deployment.Copyright © 2014 by ASME"
pub.1084897077,A Capability-Driven Development Approach for Requirements and Business Process Modeling,"Requirements modeling and business process modeling are two essential activities in the earliest steps of any sound software production process. A precise conceptual alignment between them is required in order to assess that requirements are “operationalized” through an adequate set of processes. Complementary, the trip from requirements to code should benefit from using a precise model driven development connection, intended to characterize not only the involved conceptual models, but also their corresponding model transformations. Selecting the most appropriate conceptual models for specifying the different system perspective becomes a crucial task. This conceptual modeling-based solution requires to use a holistic conceptual framework to determine those modeling elements to be taken into account. Surprisingly, the link with MDD approaches to provide a rigorous link with the software components of a final software application has not been analyzed in a clear and convincing way. Exploring the notion of capability, this keynote will present a capability driven development approach together with its associated meta-model as the selected conceptual framework. Additionally, it will be shown how this framework facilitates the selection of the most appropriate method components in order to design an effective software process and in order to make feasible a sound MDD connection."
pub.1051671165,First Experiment on Modeling Safety LifeCycle Process in Railway Systems,"<p>The conception and design of Resource Constrained Embedded Systems (RCES) is an inherently complex endeavor. Non-functional requirements from security and dependability are exacerbate this complexity. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a promising approach for the design of trusted systems, as it bridges the gap between design issues and implementation concerns. The purpose of process models is to document and communicate processes, as well as reuse them. Thus, processes can be better taught and executed. However, most useful metamodels are activity-oriented, and the required concepts of safety lifecycle, such as validation, cannot be easily modeled. In this paper, the authors propose a safety-oriented process metamodel that extends exiting framework to support all safety control requirements. A new safety lifecycle development processes technique has been built to ease its use in a building process of system/ software applications with safety support. As a proof of concept, the feasibility of the approach has been evaluated with an example. The example is an engineering process for building industry control systems with safety requirements for software and hardware resources. A prototype implementation of the approach is provided and applied to the example of industry control systems in the railway domain.</p>"
pub.1049924665,Modelling mobile app requirements for semantic traceability,"The paper presents a modelling method aimed to support the definition and elicitation of requirements for mobile apps through an approach that enables semantic traceability for the requirements representation. Business process-centricity is employed in order to capture requirements in a knowledge structure that retains procedural knowledge from stakeholders and can be traversed by semantic queries in order to trace domain-specific contextual information for the modelled requirements. Consequently, instead of having requirements represented as natural language items that are documented by diagrammatic models, the communication channels are switched: semantically interlinked conceptual models become the requirements representation, while free text can be used for requirements annotations/metadata. Thus, the method establishes a knowledge externalization channel between business stakeholders and app developers, also tackling the Twin Peaks bridging challenge (between requirements and early designs). The method is presented using its modelling procedure as a guiding thread, with each step illustrated by case-based samples of the modelling language and auxiliary functionality. The design work is encompassed by an existing metamodelling framework and introduces a taxonomy for modelling relations, since the metamodel is the key enabler for the goal of semantic traceability. The research was driven by the ComVantage EU research project, concerned with mobile app support for collaborative business process execution. Therefore, the project provides context for the illustrating examples; however, generalization possibilities beyond the project scope will also be discussed, with respect to both motivation and outcome."

This paper summarizes the efforts to design a new radial turbine aiming at high efficiency and low inertia by applying two different optimization techniques to a parametrized CAD model. The first workflow wraps 3D fluid and solid simulations within a meta-model assisted genetic algorithm to find an efficient turbine subjected to several constraints. In the next step, the chosen turbine is re-parametrized and fed into the second workflow which makes use of a gradient projection algorithm to further fine-tune the design. This requires the computation of gradients with respect to the CAD parametrization, which is done by calculating and combining surface sensitivities and design velocities. Both methods are applied successfully, i.e., the first delivers a well-performing turbine, which, by the second method, is further improved by 0.34% in efficiency."

To find out a methodology for facilitating the modeling and management of ETL processes, aimed at Alkis Simitsis and Panos Vassiliadis' models, based on the formal definition of objects in meta-models, an improved design model and an optimization algorithm in mapping conceptual to logical models were proposed.

pub.1152717724,Standardized and extensible reference data model for clinical research in Living Labs,"Over the last few years, Living Labs (LL) have emerged as resilient research and innovation infrastructures to facilitate and promote activities, which can deal with the complexity of health and wellbeing research. Such systems integrate multiple types of data, including personal info or generated by ICT tools and devices (i.e., wearable sensors). Healthcare data models have the ability to integrate such data and focus on relevant content that will follow a specific data representation template that can be extended based on the needs of each LL. In this study, we propose a reference metamodel based on existing schemas to improve the efficiency of the LL research by pursuing a labor-intensive workflow with a hierarchical structure that simplifies the transformation process and minimizes data variation. OmH library has been used as the basis of the metamodel along with other standards in healthcare to design a complete and straightforward data reference model for LL. The presented data model has been designed within the Vitalise (H2020-INFRAIA 2021-2024) project and visualizes representations of the collected data elements and their relations. The main purpose is to provide an extensible data model that: 1) harmonizes representation formats of the information exchanged that will be used from the LL, 2) empowers other LL to develop solutions that adhere to this common definition and 3) provides a shared, common schema. The designed model will precisely represent and handle data from different devices or platforms (i.e., heart rate, BMI) and efficiently describe the collected dataset to produce meaningful metadata."
pub.1004938673,Supporting collaborative development using process models: a tooled integration‐focused approach,"ABSTRACT Collaboration in software engineering projects is usually intensive and requires adequate support by well‐integrated tools. However, process‐centered software engineering environments (PSEE) have traditionally been designed to exploit integration facilities in other tools, while offering themselves little to no such facilities. This is in line with the vision of the PSEE as the central orchestrator of project support tools. We argue that this view has hindered the widespread adoption of process‐based collaboration support tools by incurring too much adoption and switching costs. We propose a new process‐based collaboration support architecture, backed by a process metamodel, that can easily be integrated with existing tools. The proposed architecture revolves around the central concepts of ‘deep links’ and ‘hooks’. Our approach is validated by analyzing a collection of open‐source projects, and integration utilities based on the implemented process model server have been developed.

Then, we apply our transformation to a small portion of the design phase recommended in the rail sector. Finally, we discuss our findings, and present conclusions and future work."
pub.1013165734,Geo-Distribution of Flexible Business Processes over Publish/Subscribe Paradigm,"An increasing amount of business processes are inherently knowledge-intense and require ad-hoc decision making. Flexible modeling approaches such as the Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) were designed to support such scenarios. At the same time, many processes involve participants and data from different organizations across the globe. Often, legal regulations such as data privacy render centralized execution engines impractical because data must be processed where it is collected. Instead, distributed approaches to coordinate process and data are necessary for supporting geo-scale execution. In this paper, we present a fully geo-distributed workflow engine that implements the core execution semantics of CMMN, the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model, and supports locality of process data by distributing data and control-flow management over a loosely-coupled publish/subscribe infrastructure. We present a novel context-aware mapping (CAM) of GSM into Workflow Units (WFUs), representing the unit of distribution in our system. We have developed our distributed workflow execution engine over PADRES, an enterprise-grade event management system. Evaluation results show that our approach scales well with process size and degree of distribution and that CAM improves throughput and latency by up to 5X compared to the baseline mapping (BLM)."

PIROL integrates the taste of software development with respect to the categories set up by the ECMA reference model. PIROL's architecture covers aspects of CSCW, such as distribution and notification. The central concept of PIROL is the idea of different views on common information. Views can be configurations, aggregated documents or presentation modes. All these views can be editable and are based upon a fine grained meta model. The meta model consists of a product- and a process-oriented part. The latter is a basis for close integration of process support in terms of a generic process model which can be customized, instantiated and finally enacted. The product side of the meta model is confined to the object-oriented paradigm but is open for any concrete method and OOPL. A current prototype of PIROL proves these concepts realizable and gives an impression of its operability.<>"

pub.1009447982,A Meta Model for Artefact-Orientation: Fundamentals and Lessons Learned in Requirements Engineering,"Requirements Engineering (RE) processes are highly volatile due to dependencies on customers’ capabilities or used process models, both complicating a standardised RE process. A promising solution is given by artefact-orientation that emphasises the results rather than dictating a strict development process. At such a basis one is able to incorporate domain-specific methods for producing artefacts without having to take into account the variability of process definitions. Although artefacts are known to support customisable development processes, there still is no common agreement about the structure and semantics of artefact-based methodologies. In this paper we discuss different interpretations of the term artefact considering aspects like process integration capabilities and necessities within individual project environments. We contribute a meta model for artefact-orientation that is inferred from two RE models elaborated within industrial cooperation projects of our research group. We conclude with a discussion of performed case studies and ongoing work."

pub.1092291562,TraDE - A Transparent Data Exchange Middleware for Service Choreographies,"Due to recent advances in data science the importance of data is increasing also in the domain of business process management. To reflect the paradigm shift towards data-awareness in service compositions, in previous work, we introduced the notion of data-aware choreographies through cross-partner data objects and cross-partner data flows as means to increase run time flexibility while reducing the complexity of modeling data flows in service choreographies. In this paper, we focus on the required run time environment to execute such data-aware choreographies through a new Transparent Data Exchange (TraDE) Middleware. The contributions of this paper are a choreography language-independent metamodel and an architecture for such a middleware. Furthermore, we evaluated our concepts and TraDE Middleware prototype by conducting a performance evaluation that compares our approach for cross-partner data flows with the classical exchange of data within service choreographies through messages. The evaluation results already show some valuable performance improvements when applying our TraDE concepts."

One standard architecture, that of the Object Management Group, utilizes so-called strict metamodelling, which can readily be shown to lead to several concerns, paradoxes and challenges within modelling approaches, including MDE, currently in use. Utilizing an analogy in the paradigm shift from a Ptolemaic model of the solar system to a Copernican understanding, I will argue that the current state of affairs in conceptual modelling, as used in developing information systems and modelling business processes, is ‘Ptolemaic’ and, using ideas from language use, ontology engineering and philosophy, suggest a framework for ‘Copernican’ modelling that will provide both a paradigm shift in multilevel modelling and also a new orthodoxy for the future that will ensure simpler and more satisfying modelling solutions for both business processes and software development in the years to come."
pub.1096961789,Metamodeling via Hybridized Particle Swarm with Polynomial and Splines Regression for Optimization of CO2-EOR in Unconventional Oil Reservoirs,"Abstract Various studies have been conducted to optimize oil production in unconventional reservoirs using gas injection processes. Some studies determined the optimal design of hydraulic fractures through horizontal wells while others optimized the placement of horizontal wells to maximize oil recovery. In this study, an integrated optimization workflow combining Particle Swarm and Non-parametric Proxy Metamodels was adopted to optimize oil production using CO2-EOR in shale oil reservoirs. A pseudo-component black oil reservoir model was considered to simulate CO2 flooding in shale oil reservoirs and to predict future reservoir performance over a 30-year prediction period. The cyclic CO2 flooding optimization procedure consisted of 3 cyclic operational decision factors and 5 well constraints for 5 pairs of horizontal injector and producer wells with 8 fractures each. The cyclic injection factors included injection, soaking, and production durations over the prediction period. Minimum bottom hole pressure, maximum oil production rate, and water cut were optimized for the production wells, and maximum bottom hole injection pressure and maximum gas injection rate were optimized for the injection wells. An integrated optimization approach conducted using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Proxy Metamodeling was integrated to find the optimal level for each of the 8 factors. PSO was adopted to create a search-space swarm of candidate solutions (particles) considering the range of each operational factor. These particles were then evaluated by the reservoir simulator to calculate the cumulative oil production by the end of the prediction period. To reach the optimal solution, 100 candidate solutions were created as training experiments with 4 successive iterations of approximately 20 experiments each. The optimal solution increased oil production by 322,675 surface barrels. Next, a 2nd order polynomial regression proxy model was constructed to metamodel the large reservoir simulator. The performance of the polynomial proxy model was validated via a comparison to non-parametric algorithms of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. A cross-validation was considered prior to building the proxy models by sampling and subdividing the entire dataset into two subsets: 70% training for modeling and 30% testing for prediction. The testing subset and the entire dataset were compared to the three proxy models by computing the Root Mean Square Prediction Error and the Adjusted R-square for each. It was concluded that polynomial regression is the best metamodel, followed by the MARS algorithm, to produce a simplified alternative metamodel for the reservoir simulator to evaluate the cyclic CO2 flooding in shale oil reservoirs. The most influential operational factors were also identified for their effects on the CO2-EOR process performance in shale reservoirs."
pub.1100342572,A Semantic Approach to Deploying Product-Service Systems,"Conceptual modeling is commonly employed for two classes of goals: (1) as input for run-time functionality (e.g., code generation) and (2) as support for design-time analysis (e.g., in business process management). An inherent trade-off manifests between such goals, as different levels of abstraction and semantic detail is needed. This has led to a multitude of modeling languages that are conceptually redundant (i.e., they share significant parts of their metamodels) and a dilemma of selecting the most adequate language for each goal. This article advocates the substitution of the selection dilemma with an approach where the modeling method is agilely tailored for the semantic variability required to cover both run-time and design-time concerns. The semantic space enabled by such a method is exposed to model-driven systems as RDF knowledge graphs, whereas the method evolution is managed with the Agile Modeling Method Engineering framework. The argument is grounded in the application area of Product-Service Systems, illustrated by a project-based modeling method."
pub.1061786675,A Methodology for Evolving E-Contracts Using Templates,"E-contract evolves over a period of time due to changes in e-contract environment. E-contract evolution adversely affects the execution of e-contracts. An e-contract is specified by a model at conceptual level, supported by a database management system (DBMS) at logical level and by both DBMS and workflow management system (WFMS) at implementation level. Any changes in the design as well as runtime environment during e-contract enactment must be reflected at all levels. Conventional modeling approaches simply model the e-contracts as specified workflows and execute them. Since, e-contracts are complex in nature, such models have to undergo large number of transformations during e-contract enactment. Metamodeling approach guides the correctness of transformed models by generating appropriate model instances according to e-contract constraints to support evolution. A metamodel has structural artifacts to capture the relationships among contract elements and model the required specifications and semantics present in an e-contract as a template. In this paper, we develop 1) an active metamodeling approach by a) introducing the taxonomy of evolution operations and b) handling metaevents to facilitate the structural and behavioral conformance during e-contracts evolution, and 2) an ER*EC architecture for enacting evolving e-contracts. Our methodology actively capture behavior features from e-contract executions to drive e-contract evolution."
pub.1034605315,Semantic process benchmarking to improve process performance," Purpose The purpose of this paper is to illustrate and evaluate the semantic process benchmarking concept.   Design/methodology/approach The authors' approach includes the use of metamodels and ontologies, which make the process models syntactically and semantically comparable. Furthermore, a software prototype is presented to analyze and compare individual process models and their performance information. Thereafter, the technical, conceptual, and economic perspectives of the approach's evaluation are aligned with their respective outcomes.   Findings The evaluation proves that this approach is generally suitable to generate novel and useful information on different process models and their performance within the same problem domain. However, the initial set‐up costs are high and will only pay off once process models are used regularly.   Practical implications The proposed approach depends strongly on the availability of appropriate metrics and ontologies, as well as on the annotation of these ontologies to process models, which is a time‐consuming task. If large benchmarking clearing centers are established, the approach will be more cost‐effective. The developed SEMAT prototype, that demonstrates and proves the proposed approach's general viability, supports cost‐effective ontology engineering and annotation in the context of semantic process benchmarking initiatives.   Originality/value To date, process benchmarking has primarily been a manual process. In this article, the authors suggest an approach that allows time‐consuming and costly process analysis to be partially automated, which makes the performance indicators, as well as qualitative differences between processes, apparent.

Reflection is a design principle that allows a system to have a representation of itself in the manner that makes it easy to adapt the system to a changing environment. It has matured to the point where it is used to address real-world problems in various areas. We describe how to document reflective components in the framework of UML. Our work allows for recognizing and understanding reflective components in the upper levels of abstraction at an earlier stage of the development process. It leverages the documentation, learning, visual modeling, reuse and roundtrip development of metalevel designs. We also demonstrate the seamless model exchange between different development tools and model continuity across development phases with application-neutral interchange formats."
pub.1140783721,Statistical Tests for Cross-Validation of Kriging Models,"Kriging or Gaussian process models are popular metamodels (surrogate models or emulators) of simulation models; these metamodels give predictors for input combinations that are not simulated. To validate these metamodels for computationally expensive simulation models, the analysts often apply computationally efficient cross-validation. In this paper, we derive new statistical tests for so-called leave-one-out cross-validation. Graphically, we present these tests as scatterplots augmented with confidence intervals that use the estimated variances of the Kriging predictors. To estimate the true variances of these predictors, we might use bootstrapping. Like other statistical tests, our tests—with or without bootstrapping—have type I and type II error probabilities; to estimate these probabilities, we use Monte Carlo experiments. We also use such experiments to investigate statistical convergence. To illustrate the application of our tests, we use (i) an example with two inputs and (ii) the popular borehole example with eight inputs.
                  Summary of Contribution: Simulation models are very popular in operations research (OR) and are also known as computer simulations or computer experiments. A popular topic is design and analysis of computer experiments. This paper focuses on Kriging methods and cross-validation methods applied to simulation models; these methods and models are often applied in OR. More specifically, the paper provides the following; (1) the basic variant of a new statistical test for leave-one–out cross-validation; (2) a bootstrap method for the estimation of the true variance of the Kriging predictor; and (3) Monte Carlo experiments for the evaluation of the consistency of the Kriging predictor, the convergence of the Studentized prediction error to the standard normal variable, and the convergence of the expected experimentwise type I error rate to the prespecified nominal value. The new statistical test is illustrated through examples, including the popular borehole model."

pub.1120508160,A Traceability and Synchronization Approach of the Computational Models of an Enterprise Architecture,"An Enterprise Architecture (EA) represents the fundamental organization of the business process and Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, serving to capture the essentials of business, IT and its evolution, being relevant to protecting the business and maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of the organization. In the context of the enterprise architecture modeling, some problems were identified: (i) the lack of traceability of the elements present in the computational models or the visualization, in an understandable way, of the chain of elements that are related; and (ii) the absence of synchronization between the computational models of the strategic (strategic model), tactical (business process model) and operational IT levels, focusing on information systems (system requirements model). Among the negative impacts related to these problems are, for example, the obsolescence of models, the difficulty of carrying out impact analysis and decision making, in scenarios of organizational changes. Thus, in order to provide a reduction or elimination of the negative impacts caused by these problems, an approach is proposed to promote the traceability and synchronization of the computational models of an AE. The approach proposed in this work is composed of three layers that together provide: (i) a set of meta-models, representing the strategic, tactical and operational levels of the EA; (ii) a model traceability structure that supports change and configuration management through the use of COBIT, ITIL and ISO 20.000 recommendations and good practices; and (iii) a model synchronization structure that uses the techniques of model driven development (DDM) and allows automated (or semi) automated support to synchronize between the models produced. The purpose of this approach is to keep the computer models traceable and up-to-date, allowing: (i) the support for visualization and understanding of how a set of models (strategic, tactical and operational IT) and their elements relate; (ii) the support for impact analysis and decision-making in change scenarios; (iii) the necessary support to avoid the obsolescence of the models; and (iv) the creation and maintenance of the strategic alignment of the business with IT."
pub.1024459876,A Comparison of Standard Compliant Ways to Define Domain Specific Languages,"Domain specific languages are of increasing importance for today’s software development processes. Their area of application ranges from process modeling over architecture description and system design to behavioral specification and simulation. There are numerous approaches for the definition and implementation of DSLs. Among others, the OMG offers UML profiles as a lightweight extension of a predefined multi-purpose language and MOF as a metamodeling language, which can be used to define DSLs from scratch. This contribution investigates various approaches to define DSLs, focusing on architectural description languages as an example. Besides the usage of UML profiles and the definition of an entirely new language with MOF, the adaption of the UML based on a metamodel extension is also considered. As a consequence of the shortcomings depicted for the different approaches, we suggest to combine UML profiles and metamodeling in order to compensate their weaknesses and take advantage of their benefits."
pub.1094901744,Proposal of an Extension of the IMS-LD Meta-model to Support Assessment of Collaborative Learning Activities A solution based on the LMS and WfMS,"In this article we focus on the problem of assessing individuals in the group or team of learning and therefore this should lead to the evaluation of the group or the team itself as a learning entity. We distinguish between the concepts of group and team in function of parameters such as membership (sense of belonging that is strong in teams) and cohesion (harmony sought to carry out work). Lots of problems at the level the device of distant learning is the absence of possibilities for structuring and planning of the evaluation activity. Hence the lack of consideration of susceptible scenarios to be exploited in testing situations to reap the maximum of indicators that will help a more objective assessment knowing that any evaluation system is afraid of being subjecttive. To do so, we propose an extension of the IMS-LD meta-model to better support assessment activities thanks to workflow management systems considering four aspects: organizational, functional, behavioral and informational."
pub.1108010157,An Ensemble-based p2p Framework for the Detection of Deviant Business Process Instances,"The problem of discriminating “deviant” traces (i.e. traces diverging from normal/desired outcomes, such as frauds, faults) in the execution log of a business process can be faced by extracting a classification model for the traces, after mapping them onto some suitable feature space. An ensemble-learning approach was recently proposed that trains multiple base learners on different vector-space views of the given log, and a probabilistic meta-model that combines the predictions of the discovered base classifiers. However, the sequential centralised implementation of this learning approach makes it unsuitable for real applications, where large volumes of traces are produced continuously, while both deviant and normal behaviours tend to change over the time. We here propose an online deviance detection framework that leverages a novel incremental learning scheme, which extracts different base models from different chunks of a trace stream, and dynamically combines them in an ensemble model. Notably, the system is based on a p2p architecture that allows it to distribute the entire learning procedure among multiple nodes and to exploit the power of HPC resources (e.g. cloud computing environments). Preliminary tests on a real-life log confirmed the validity of the approach, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency."
pub.1122032555,A Comparative Analysis of Task Modeling Notations,"Task Models describe how to perform activities to reach users' goals. Task models represent the intersection between user interface design and more systematic approaches. Task models can be represented at various abstraction levels. When designers want to specify only requirements regarding how activities should be performed, they consider only the main high-level tasks. On the other hand, when designers aim to provide precise design indications then the activities are represented at a small granularity, thus including aspects related to the dialogue model of a user interface (which defines how system and user actions can be sequenced). In this paper a comparative analysis of selected models involving multiple users in an interaction is provided in order to identify concepts which are underexplored in today's multi-user interaction task modeling. This comparative analysis is based on three families of criteria: information criteria, conceptual coverage, and expressiveness. Merging the meta-models of the selected models enables to come up with a broader meta-model that could be instantiated in most situations involving multi-user interaction, like workflow information systems, CSCW."

According to BMKG, Pekanbaru meteorological station declared a forest fire had struck 11 regencies in Riau Province on July 2019. Indications of the fire were detected from the existence of 38 hot spots in the area. Previous research has been conducted to develop the SI/TI framework for the mitigation of forest fire disaster using TOGAF, which result is a reference in business development to technology design for disaster management. This paper proposes a recommendation for business process development and the design of disaster management technology. BPTrends Redesign method outlines activity and improvement in business process consisting of activity, role, result, technique, and meta-model in the development of disaster management prevention information system, thus obtained a more comprehensive recommendation in its application development. The results of the discussion obtained technology architecture from the Organization Database to Emergency Management information System and overview of the business model in the form of Disaster integration and Safety Information system which explains about internal and external access."
pub.1027623191,Supporting Communication and Cooperation in Global Software Development with Agile Service Networks,"Current IT markets exhibit many constraints (e.g. budget, staff shortage, etc.). These constraints force IT companies to increase productivity using globally distributed manpower. Literature shows that global software development (GSD) indeed raises productivity but reduces communication and collaboration between teams. Consequently, the risk of failure increases. To ease communication and collaboration among teams, novel engineering methods must be provided. To address this problem, we propose using Agile Service Networks (ASNs). ASNs are an emergent paradigm in which service oriented applications (network nodes) collaborate through agile and dynamic service interactions (network edges). Agile interaction among ASN nodes, allow mitigating distance (typical of GSD) by dynamically adapting communication and collaboration as needed. Through ASNs, GSD can be seen as a global network of resources (teams, documentation, knowledge, etc.) among which agile interactions allow flexible knowledge exchange and team collaboration. To establish feasibility of our proposal, we investigated how ASNs can support GSD. Based on existing works in the fields of both ASNs and GSD, we mapped GSD challenges on ASNs key features and devised a meta-model showing how ASNs are used to support GSD requirements."

This means that development process models must be defined. Definition leads to better process understanding, facilitates process measurement and improvement, and constitutes the basis for automating the process itself. The main goal of this paper is the definition of a process for agent-based development. This definition is based on the Software Process Engineering Metamodel(SPEM) and applied in the definition of the software engineering process of INGENIAS MAS methodology following a SCRUM approach."
pub.1095770901,Process Viewing Patterns,Business processes represent a fundamental asset of a company as they describe the core knowledge underlying its competitive advantage. Tools for modeling and analysis of business processes have to cope with the increasing complexity of these processes. A view on a process intends to abstract from details and make complex processes easier to understand. A process view results from specific transformations applied to a process model. In this paper we introduce a metamodel for process views as well as process viewing patterns which specify elementary transformations to alter an existing process. The patterns are presented in a technology independent manner and can be applied to any process language that can be represented by a process graph.
pub.1093734811,An Additive Global and Local Gaussian Process Model for Large Data Sets,"Many computer models of large complex systems are time consuming to experiment on. Even when surrogate models are developed to approximate the computer models, estimating an appropriate surrogate model can still be computationally challenging. In this article, we propose an Additive Global and Local Gaussian Process (AGLGP) model as a flexible surrogate for stochastic computer models. This model attempts to capture the overall global spatial trend and the local trends of the responses separately. The proposed additive structure reduces the computational complexity in model fitting, and allows for more efficient predictions with large data sets. We show that this metamodel form is effective in modelling various complicated stochastic model forms."
pub.1010610534,Directions Toward a Meta-Process Model of Decision Making: Cognitive and Behavioral Models of Change,"Hundreds of partially unique decision-making models, primarily differing by context, currently coexist in the decision-making literature. Yet we have 1 brain that makes decisions in all these contexts. The study of decision making needs integrative metatheory to advance and test the research questions of tomorrow. Existing descriptive, behavioral, information processing, dual process, fuzzy trace, and motivational and contextual models are examined to find commonalities that may inform future attempts at building a holistic, dynamic, integrative metatheoretical model of everyday decision making. Features of such a future metamodel are described and related to the study of behavioral development, such as the value of reinforcement as a mechanism of change."
pub.1156329833,Runtime Model-Based Assurance of Open and Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in domains such as automotive and autonomous vehicles that perform safety-critical functions require the justification and demonstration of system dependability. Assurance cases provide an explicit means for assessing confidence in system safety, security, and other properties of interest. The Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM) issued by the Object Management Group (OMG) defines a standardized metamodel for representing structured assurance cases. SACM provides the foundations for model-based system assurance with great potential to be applied in emergent open and adaptive CPS domains. Thus, assurance cases are expected to be exchanged, integrated, and verified at runtime to ensure the dependability of CPSs. However, existing design-time system assurance activities are insufficient to enable dynamic safety and security assurance of CPSs at runtime. In this paper, we introduce extensions to SACM to support the specification and synthesis of executable assurance cases from design, analysis, and process models to demonstrate CPS safety and security at runtime. We evaluate the feasibility of our approach in an illustrative study in the automotive domain."
pub.1049618321,A non‐stationary covariance‐based Kriging method for metamodelling in engineering design,"Abstract Metamodels are widely used to facilitate the analysis and optimization of engineering systems that involve computationally expensive simulations. Kriging is a metamodelling technique that is well known for its ability to build surrogate models of responses with non‐linear behaviour. However, the assumption of a stationary covariance structure underlying Kriging does not hold in situations where the level of smoothness of a response varies significantly. Although non‐stationary Gaussian process models have been studied for years in statistics and geostatistics communities, this has largely been for physical experimental data in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, the non‐stationary covariance structure is incorporated into Kriging modelling for computer simulations. To represent the non‐stationary covariance structure, we adopt a non‐linear mapping approach based on parameterized density functions. To avoid over‐parameterizing for the high dimension problems typical of engineering design, we propose a modified version of the non‐linear map approach, with a sparser, yet flexible, parameterization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both mathematical and engineering examples. The robustness of the method is verified by testing multiple functions under various sampling settings. We also demonstrate that our method is effective in quantifying prediction uncertainty associated with the use of metamodels. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
pub.1137208650,Development of General data-based Process Models for Self-Pierce Riveting,"The determination of ideal process parameters for mechanical joining processes such as self-pierce riveting currently requires a comprehensive understanding of the process, the availability of the materials to be joined and the corresponding system technology. General process models can simplify the use of these joining technologies, accelerate development cycles and thereby reduce the effort for implementation into production. In this paper, the development of general data-based process models for the mechanical joining method self-pierce riveting with semi-tubular rivet is described. Extensive experimental and numerical investigations with more than 2300 joint combinations for steel and aluminum sheets with tensile strengths between 240 - 1020 MPa were generated for the building of the models. Based on these results, different meta-models are fused into general data-based process models for the self-pierce riveting process in order to show the general relationships between material properties, process parameters and joining results. The paper discusses the acquisition of the experimental and numerical data, the statistical methods for evaluation and the application of the data-based process models."
pub.1048829336,Using ontologies to capture the semantics of a (business) process for digital preservation,"IT-supported business processes and computationally intensive science (called e-science) have become increasingly ubiquitous in the last decades. Along with this trend comes the need to make at least the most important of these processes available for the long term, to allow later analysis of their execution, or even a re-execution. As such, the preservation of scientific experiments and their results enables others to reproduce and verify the results as well as build on the result of earlier work. All but the simplest processes require to be described by a multitude of information objects, as well as their interconnections and relations, to be successfully preserved. To enable a semantic description of these objects in a structured manner, we developed a formal meta-model that can be utilised in the digital preservation of a process. The meta-model describes classes of elements and their relations, in the form of ontologies, with a core ontology describing the generic concepts, and extension mechanisms to map supplementary ontologies describing more specific aspects. In this paper, we present the overall architecture and individual ontologies, and motivate their usefulness via the application to use cases from different domains."

This discussion is influenced by the recent work on Process Reuse field presented by literature and the experience of authors in the definition of a meta-model for process modeling, enaction and simulation in an integrated environment (APSEE). This model proposes templates and policies as basic constructs to store generic and reusable knowledge about process models, which are integrated with a search engine based on similarity measurement. The basic set of data types used in the definition of the meta-model is presented. The paper concludes by presenting the proposed functionality to retrieve and adapt reusable process descriptions to a specific context."
pub.1131863821,Wodel-Test: a model-based framework for language-independent mutation testing,"Mutation testing (MT) targets the assessment of test cases by measuring their efficiency to detect faults. This technique involves modifying the program under test to emulate programming faults, and assessing whether the existing test cases detect such mutations. MT has been extensively studied since the 70’s, and many tools have been proposed for widely used languages like C, Java, Fortran, Ada and SQL; and for notations like Petri-nets. However, building MT tools is costly and error-prone, which may prevent their development for new programming and domain-specific (modelling) languages. In this paper, we propose a framework called Wodel-Test to reduce the effort to create MT tools. For this purpose, it follows a model-driven approach by which MT tools are synthesized from a high-level description. This description makes use of the domain-specific language Wodel to define and execute model mutations. Wodel is language-independent, as it allows the creation of mutation operators for any language defined by a meta-model. Starting from the definition of the mutation operators, Wodel-Test generates a MT environment which parses the program under test into a model, applies the mutation operators, and evaluates the test-suite against the generated mutants, offering a rich collection of MT metrics. We report on an evaluation of the approach based on the creation of MT tools for Java and the Atlas transformation language."
pub.1100749399,Metamodeling-based approach for risk assessment and cost estimation: Application to geological carbon sequestration planning," Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is being evaluated globally as a geoengineering measure for significantly reducing greenhouse emission. However, long-term liability associated with potential leakage from these geologic repositories is perceived as a main barrier of entry to site operators. Risk quantification and impact assessment help CCS operators to screen candidate sites for suitability of CO2 storage. Leakage risks are highly site dependent, and a quantitative understanding and categorization of these risks can only be made possible through broad participation and deliberation of stakeholders, with the use of site-specific, process-based models as the decision basis. Online decision making, however, requires that scenarios be run in real time. In this work, a Python based, Leakage Assessment and Cost Estimation (PyLACE) web application was developed for quantifying financial risks associated with potential leakage from geologic carbon sequestration sites. PyLACE aims to assist a collaborative, analytic-deliberative decision making processes by automating metamodel creation, knowledge sharing, and online collaboration. In PyLACE, metamodeling, which is a process of developing faster-to-run surrogates of process-level models, is enabled using a special stochastic response surface method and the Gaussian process regression. Both methods allow consideration of model parameter uncertainties and the use of that information to generate confidence intervals on model outputs. Training of the metamodels is delegated to a high performance computing cluster and is orchestrated by a set of asynchronous job scheduling tools for job submission and result retrieval. As a case study, workflow and main features of PyLACE are demonstrated using a multilayer, carbon storage model."
pub.1094788919,A Descriptive/Comparative Study of the Evolution of Process Models of Software Development Life Cycles (PM-SDLCs),"A relevant knowledge [24] (and consequently research area) is the study of software lifecycle process models (PM-SDLCs). Such process models have been defined in three abstraction levels: (i) full organizational software lifecycles process models (e.g. ISO 12207, ISO 15504, CMMI/SW); (ii) lifecycles frameworks models (e.g. waterfall, spiral, RAD, and others) and (iii) detailed software development life cycles process (e.g. unified process, TSP, MBASE, and others). This paper focuses on (ii) and (iii) levels and reports the results of a descriptive/comparative study of 13 PM-SDLCs that permits a plausible explanation of their evolution in terms of common, distinctive, and unique elements as well as of the specification rigor and agility attributes. For it, a conceptual research approach and a software process lifecycle meta-model are used. Findings from the conceptual analysis are reported. Paper ends with the description of research limitations and recommendations for further research."

pub.1151375458,Aster: A DSL for Engineering Self-Adaptive Systems,"Software systems are now expected to operate in uncertain and dynamic contexts with constantly changing operational conditions. In order to maintain the requisite Quality of Service (QoS), self-adaptation has been proposed as a realistic and effective way to deal with the rising complexity, unpredictability, and dynamics of these systems. Therefore, self-adaptive systems (SASs) engineering requires innovative modeling and development approaches as model-driven development concepts. Moreover, designing SAS using formal methods is very beneficial since it provides a foundation for ensuring that the specification and implementation are consistent. They represent a promising and effective method for rigorously specifying mathematical models of software systems and analyzing their behavior. However, adopting and applying formal models is a hard task because they require great expertise and face some reticence from designers. An easiest and more comprehensible domain-specific language (DSL) will contribute considerably to remediate these difficulties by automatically generating the underlying formal specifications. This paper presents a DSL for SASs modelling, called Aster. The language is used to define the architectural pieces of a SAS and their interrelationships. It mainly offers the necessary concepts to define the SLA to be maintained by a SAS and additional artifacts to manage the intended qualities. Aster also includes principles for defining SAS’s behavioral components, such as identifying and applying adaptive actions. Furthermore, the precise definition of the modeling concepts via corresponding meta-models enables the system specification to be correct by construction."
pub.1009627122,Experimentally Motivated Transformations for Intermodel Links Between Conceptual Models,"Complex system development and information integration at the conceptual layer raises the requirement to be able to declare intermodel assertions between entities in models that may, or may not, be represented in the same modelling language. This is compounded by the fact that semantically equivalent notions may have been represented with a different element, such as an attribute or class. We first investigate such occurrences in six ICOM projects and 40 models with 33 schema matchings. While equivalence and subsumption are in the overwhelming majority, this extends mainly to different types of attributes, and therewith requiring non-1:1 mappings. We present a solution that bridges these semantic gaps. To facilitate implementation, the mappings and transformations are declared in ATL. This avails of a common, and logic-based, metamodel to aid verification of the links. This is currently being implemented as proof-of-concept in the ICOM tool."
pub.1159993404,An automatic workflow for risk analysis on spatial output properties using kriging‐based surrogate models—Application to stratigraphic forward modelling,"Abstract Stratigraphic numerical forward process‐based models represent the formation and evolution of sedimentary basins through time. Their main deliverable is a 3D digital grid which can help to better understand the sedimentary basin infill. These models depend on several input parameters that need to be characterized for the studied basin. However, available data such as well logs and seismic data may not provide enough information to identify a unique possible value for these parameters. It is then crucial to take the uncertainty induced by this non‐uniqueness into account in the decision‐making process. As a single numerical stratigraphic forward simulation can be very time consuming, solutions are needed to limit the computational cost required to estimate such uncertainties. In particular, machine learning techniques can be used to build meta‐models that mimic the simulator and provide fast estimations of its outputs for any values of the input parameters. The key step for the efficiency of such an approach stands in the choice of the set of simulations (or training set) used to build the meta‐models: it should be informative enough to obtain accurate predictions for the output properties of interest, but also of reasonable size to limit simulation time. Then, meta‐models can be used to investigate a large number of models and make uncertainty quantification easier. Here, we focus on the prediction of spatial outputs of interest approximated from the joint use of several kriging‐based meta‐models combined to reduced basis decomposition. Sequential approaches have been proposed in the literature to identify training sets iteratively for a kriging‐based meta‐model, building upon the specific structure of such surrogates. We propose here to extend these approaches to the context of spatial output predictors. The results obtained on two synthetic test cases, representing a carbonate platform and a clastic environment, highlight the potential of the proposed approach for risk analysis to iteratively build training sets with a satisfactory efficiency in terms of simulation time and prediction accuracy."
pub.1111034105,Investigation design: The structural elements of knowledge-seeking efforts,"Knowledge about human systems usually comes from deliberate, organized efforts. These efforts are increasingly collaborative with partnering among diverse teams of experts. This has spawned research in the means for data integration and data lineage, or provenance, to better enable sharing of data and workflows. Such research has focused on specific problems in domain representation, such as ontology domain modeling, provenance standards and methodologies, and automated workflow management. While all these contributions are highly relevant for knowledge seeking efforts, what is missing is a meta model that accounts for all elements of investigation. This work introduces the concept of investigation as a means to formalize knowledge seeking efforts involving collaborative human action. We model the investigation concept as a set of seven elements common to all knowledge-seeking efforts. Incorporated into the proposed investigation design are the concepts from emerging sensor-observation standards and W3C provenance standards. This design differs from other approaches for knowledge acquisition modeling in its focus on reifying the management of effort – here referred to as an initiative, and the abstraction and reification of analytic results – here referred to as judgments. Further, we provide and initial attempt to identify specific workflow and data model design patterns within each of the seven investigation elements. An example illustrates the various aspects of our approach."
pub.1095656738,Service Composition Framework for Big Data Service,"Demand for big data analysis service has been increasing recently. In addition, the related business and market are also growing. However, big data service development requires a substantial amount of time and human resources. In this paper, we suggest a “Service Composition Framework” for the development of a new big data service that easily combines a various big data services. The framework provides an environment with which the user can connect, and thus execute a specific service based on the desired Meta-model. We define the “Workflow” to which the user links each service in the framework. The workflow can be executed after a “Composition Check”. In this paper, we apply the framework to the Transportation domain, i.e., the “Transportation Service Composition Framework”. Users can develop a transportation big data service easily through the transportation service composition framework. Such framework will reduce problems with expenses and increase reusability when developing a transportation big data service. In the future, we can solve problems with expenses and human resources when developing a big data service by applying the service composition framework to various domains."
pub.1085194553,A Posteriori Typing for Model-Driven Engineering,"Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is founded on the ability to create and process models conforming to a meta-model. In this context, classes in a meta-model are used in two ways: as templates to create objects and as (static) classifiers for them. These two aspects are inherently tied in most meta-modelling approaches, which results in unnecessarily rigid systems and hinders reusability of MDE artefacts.
                  
                    In this work, we discuss the benefits of decoupling object creation from typing in MDE. Thus, we rely on standard mechanisms for object creation, and propose
                    a posteriori
                    typing as a means to retype objects and enable multiple, partial, dynamic typings. This approach enhances flexibility; permits unanticipated reuse, as model management operations defined for a meta-model can be reused with other models once they get reclassified; and enables bidirectional model transformation by reclassification. In particular, we propose two mechanisms to realise model retyping and show their underlying theory and analysis methods.

A prototype, developed at Laboratory for Machine Tools (WZL) of RWTH Aachen University, combines mechatronic development with a virtual machine tool.

pub.1115964912,Methodological Framework to Guide the Development of Continual Evolution Methods,"Companies live in a fast-changing environment imposing to constantly evolve in order to stay competitive. Such an evolution is carried out through continuous improvement cycles or radical changes often based on innovation that concern their products, their processes, their internal organization, etc. We refer to this situation as continual evolution. There are two implications of such continual evolution from our viewpoint: (a) the instillation of the “no end point” philosophy in organizations and (b) the use of methods based (1) on continual evolution cycles (by opposition to project-based approaches that have delimited budget and dates) and, (2) on autonomous and collective implication of the organization’s actors. This article presents a methodological framework, called As-Is/As-If framework to support method engineers in handling such continual evolution. The framework offers a process model and a product meta-model that are both reusable instruments, aiming to guide the construction of continual evolution methods. The process model and product meta-model can be seen as prototypical examples to be adapted in each situation at hand using heuristics proposed as part of the framework. The usefulness of the framework is illustrated through two methods adaptations."

In this study, SPO is directly used as an optimization method on different noisy mathematical test functions. SPO includes a broad variety of meta models, which can have significant impact on its performance. Additionally, Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA), which is an enhanced method for handling the computational budget spent for selecting new design points, is presented. The OCBA approach can intelligently determine the most efficient replication numbers. Moreover, we study the of performance of different meta models being integrated in SPO. Our results reveal that the incorporation of OCBA and the selection of Gaussian process models are highly beneficial. SPO outperformed three different alternative optimization algorithms on a set of five noisy mathematical test functions."

Indeed, the model of the design process partly supports every resources involved in decision making activities (i.e. who, what, when, why, where, how). The authors therefore propose the use of a MBE architecture for driving the product modelling based on the design process model. The UML activity diagrams and the IDEFØ meta-model are linked for supporting automatic generation of product models using specific transformation knowledge.

We, however, develop a “robust” methodology that accounts for uncertain environments. Our methodology uses Taguchi's view of the uncertain world but replaces his statistical techniques by design and analysis of simulation experiments based on Kriging (Gaussian process model); moreover, we use bootstrapping to quantify the variability in the estimated Kriging metamodels. In addition, we combine Kriging with nonlinear programming, and we estimate the Pareto frontier. We illustrate the resulting methodology through economic order quantity (EOQ) inventory models. Our results suggest that robust optimization requires order quantities that differ from the classic EOQ.

Hence, finding ways to transmit the necessary information regarding how to handle such incidents to various parties involved in such events is fundamental. As such, the field of crisis management focuses on determining the actions to undertake to quickly respond to the occurrence of a disaster. Ultimately, crisis management systems strive to guide individuals to better prepare themselves for any future encounter of crisis situations. In this paper, we investigate emergency circumstances, mainly natural disasters, to detail the requirements for workflow notations managing them. Taking into account these requirements, we propose a domain-specific software language (DSL) for crisis management based on the Use Case Map (UCM) metamodel. While workflow notations do exist that can model the basic procedures to undergo when a crisis incident occurs, none focuses specifically on crisis management systems or considers the 3D environment in which emergency situations unfold. The proposed DSL provides built-in support for modeling location-based, social media-inspired interactions in the 3D environment of a disaster, allowing crisis experts to author emergency procedures which are subsequently followed by crisis respondents and victims. The long-term goal is to reduce the damages or losses, in terms of property and life, caused by a crisis, benefiting us all as well as the environment we live in."
pub.1048794867,A Metamodeling Approach to Evaluate Agricultural Policy Impact on Soil Degradation in Western Canada,"A novel approach for integrating economic and environmental models is described in the context of evaluating soil degradation impacts of agricultural policy in western Canada. The key element of this approach is the development of metamodels, which are statistical summary functions of simulation data obtained from carefully designed experiments with physical process models. The metamodels are in turn used to predict the soil degradation impacts of farmers'land management responses to policy options. The metamodels provide flexibility to perform repeated policy scenarios without having to rerun the time‐and resource‐consuming physical process simulation models. The estimated wind and water erosion metamodels are very robust, with the majority possessing R‐square values in the range of 0·80 to 0·97. The efficiency of the metamodels in facilitating the integration of a policy modeling system is described and applied to a scenario of increased crop residue management. Using regional aggregates of net farm income, total economic, surplus (consumer plus producer surplus) and total soil loss the economic and environmental tradeoff between the status quo and a no‐till policy scenario is evaluated. The model‐predicted economic welfare and environmental quality interaction suggests a clear win‐win situation for society under this alternative policy scenario.

L'élément clé de cette démarche est la construction de métamodelès, qui sont, en fait, des fonctions récapitulatives statistiques des données de simulation obtenues à partir d'experiences minutieusement conçues sur des modèles de processus physiques. Ces métamodèles sont ensuite utilises pour predire les incidences, sur la degradation des sols, des decisions en matiere de conduite des terres prises par les exploitants agricoles, selon les diverses orientations appliquées par les autorités du pays.

Relaxed functional dependencies (RFDs) can be used for data exploration and profiling in datasets with lower data quality. In this work, we present an approach for RFD discovery in heterogeneous data lakes. More specifically, the goal of this work is to find RFDs from structured, semi-structured, and graph data. Our solution brings novelty to this problem in the following aspects: (1) We introduce a generic metamodel to the problem of RFD discovery, which allows us to define and detect RFDs for data stored in heterogeneous sources in an integrated manner. (2) We apply clustering techniques during RFD discovery for partitioning and pruning. (3) We performed an intensive evaluation with nine datasets, which shows that our approach is effective for discovering meaningful RFDs, reducing redundancy, and detecting inconsistent data."

The amount of data used in these applications has consequently also grown. Managing data with an acceptable level of quality is paramount to success in any organizational business process. In order to raise and maintain the adequate levels of Data Quality (DQ) it is indispensable for Web applications to be able to satisfy specific DQ requirements. In order to achieve this goal, DQ requirements should be captured and introduced into the development process together with the other software requirements needed in the applications. However, in the field of Web application development, and to the best of our knowledge, no proposals exist with regard to the way in which to manage specific DQ software requirements. This paper considers the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) approach and, principally, the benefits provided by Model Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) in order to put forward a proposal for two artifacts. These two artifacts are a metamodel and a UML profile for the management of Data Quality Software Requirements for Web Applications (DQ_WebRE)."

Some parameters of the metamodel are estimated from the data by the maximum likelihood method, and those estimates are then used to obtain the maximum a posterior estimate of theory parameters.

Methods based on Microservices Architecture (MSA) have gained popularity for addressing the functional challenges. On the other hand, cloud-aware, very large scale NoSQL data management systems have also proved their effectiveness in tackling data management’s scalability challenges. Recent work have studied the combined approach for specific methods and systems. However, there has been no work that propose a complete method or study the underlying design principles. In this paper, we present the result of our initial research on this subject. We choose Cassandra as a case study as it is a popular system that supports cloud-aware, very-large-scale NoSQL data management. We propose the CaMSAndra software development method that combines the MSA and Cassandra methods. We define a UML metamodel for CaMSAndra and uses it as the basis for discussing the design principles. We analyse the relationship between bounded context and application workflow and, based on this, define a hierarchical service design that builds a service hierarchy by transforming an application workflow. We also discuss a data-driven cluster design in connection to the microservices. We demonstrate CaMSAndra with a well-known software domain called Hotel Reservation. We contend that our method is promising for developing very large microservice-based, NoSQL-based systems in general."
pub.1165845585,Towards Rapid Autonomous Electron Microscopy with Active Meta-Learning,"We introduce a novel approach, Active Meta-learning, to improve computational control across various scientific experiments. It's particularly valuable for spectral reconstruction in STEM EELS nanoparticle plasmonic images. Traditionally, separate AI models were trained for each experiment via active learning, but this approach could face scalability issues with high-resolution data and the need for complex AI models due to intricate structure-property relationships. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of learning AI structural representations across multiple experiments. We train a meta model from 10 prior experiments carried out such that the model can adapt to new unseen conditions in considerably less time than when trained from scratch. We utilize the Reptile algorithm, a first-order, model-agnostic meta-learning approach. To enhance and expand the meta-training dataset, conventional computer vision methods are applied to augment images from previous experiments. We observe up to ∼30-40% reduction in the number of training epochs for active learning exploration. The approach will be extended to distributed meta-learning workflows; meta-model trained in HPC datacenter using data from different microscopy sites and pushed to individual sites for active learning."
pub.1095117855,ATM: A Framework to Support Application sTate Migration in Multiple Terminals Environment,"Nowadays, users are relying on mobile service ecosystem for their daily life, while there is a lack of support for users to efficiently migrate their tasks across different terminals. Furthermore, the same application running on different terminals may even have different layouts to guarantee the user experience, which makes the migration more difficult. To facilitate the switching among multiple terminals, in this paper, we present a service-based framework to support the service migration in multi-terminal environment. First, we propose the application state migration meta-model to formally describe the application migration between different terminals, including a workflow-based application model to model the application's process and a migration model to support the dynamic migration. Based on the meta-model, we then develop the application framework to support the entire migration process of applications, consisting of the application encapsulation tool and the migration engine to enable the multi-terminal switching for the existing applications. The experiments including two real cases show that our approach can effectively simplify user operation and significantly reduce the switching time. Our ATM can greatly improve the quality of experience (QoE) of users."

With the software architecture evolving into service-oriented architecture, and the adoption of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), event processing can fit well in enterprise information systems in terms of facilitation of event aggregation into high level actionable information, and event response to improve the responsiveness. To make it more applicable, the architecture of event processing in enterprise information systems is proposed; event meta model is put forth, and the rules are defined. To improve the detect efficiency, classification and partition of event instance is utilized. We have implemented the event processing mechanism in enterprise information systems based on RFID, including the data structures, optimization strategies and algorithm that is considered as one of the contributions. The performance evaluations show that the method is effective in terms of scalability and the capability of event processing.

The modelling of SBPs, be they process oriented or knowledge oriented, presents special requirements dictated by several factors: the highly dynamic complexity and flexibility of the processes; the high number of critical activities requiring intensive acquisition, sharing, storage and (re)use of very specific crucial knowledge; the specificity and diversity of information and knowledge sources; and the high degree of collaboration and interaction (intra/inter-organizational) among participants (who apply, create and share a great amount of very important tacit organizational knowledge, in order to achieve collective objectives and create value). As SBP models get more complex, the selection of the appropriate modeling formalism gains in importance to improve the identification of crucial knowledge that is mobilized and created by these processes. Furthermore, the result of the evaluation led us to justify the choice of the better one positioned nowadays, the standard BPMN 2.0. Besides, the authors have illustrated the practical applicability of this specification on a medical process in the context of the organization of protection of the motor disabled people of Sfax-Tunisia."

With the aim of refining moisture estimation accuracy during the drying process and streamlining workflow efficiency and automation, this study investigates machine learning models for predicting moisture levels in bird’s nest products. The proposed model comprises two base models and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) serving as a meta-model. The MLP architecture encompasses an input layer, two hidden layers employing the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, and an output layer. Genetic algorithm and grid search techniques are utilized to optimize the number of neurons in the hidden layers, ensuring the selection of an effective configuration for the meta-model. Through experimental evaluation, the stacking model demonstrates superior performance compared to other models when applied to the bird’s nest drying dataset, achieving notable metrics such as an R2$${R}^{2}$$ value of 0.972 and an MAPE of 6.421%. Hence, this stacking model combined with MLP exhibits the capability to accurately forecast the moisture content of bird’s nest products during the drying process."
pub.1113013715,Localizing Inconsistencies into Software Process Models at a Conceptual Level,"Software process modeling aims to provide an abstract description of roles, activities, and artifacts used to lead the development and maintenance of software projects. The designed process models must be correct syntactically and consistent semantically in order to improve teams’ productivity and enable developers to achieve product quality goals. To address those challenges, we introduce an approach to ensure the correctness and consistency of designed process models at a conceptual level. The proposed approach is based on: (1) a syntactic verification of correctness at the meta-model level and (2) a semantic validation based on a rules’ engine seeking consistency at the operational level. Using this approach, software development teams can define new validation rules to constrain the semantic of their software processes. We implemented the approach and evaluate its effectiveness through two case studies. The results have shown that we are able to support process modelers identifying inconsistencies at a conceptual level. Most importantly, we further discuss the reusability of semantic validation rules produced by experts for an effective analysis of process models."

Semantic interoperability problems arise in various business domains [1]. Exemplary, we take a look at the healthcare domain. Connecting heterogeneous information sources in healthcare usually implies problems of semantic interoperability. A typical problem of semantic interoperability in this domain is that the same terms are often used for different concepts (homonyms) and that the same concepts are denoted by different terms (synonyms). Many standardization efforts aim at solving these problems [2]. Standards play an important role for ensuring a common understanding of transferred data among heterogeneous application systems [3]. To achieve effective communication, not only technical interfaces are required, but also common semantics for exchanged data. This paper focuses on problems of interoperability on the level of the application architecture, viz. Enterprise Application Integration [4]. Various health care standards were analyzed, uniformly structured and put into the context of a metamodel that enables interoperability based on domain-specific standards."
pub.1111652381,Probabilistic assessment of port operation downtimes under climate change,"Disruptions in harbor operations have significant implications for local, regional and global economies due to ports strategic role as part of the supply chain. A probabilistic evaluation of port operations considering the influence of climate change is required in order to secure optimal exploitation during their useful life. Here, we propose a hybrid statistic-dynamical framework combining a weather generator and a metamodel. The stochastic generator is based on weather types to project climate variability on hourly multivariate dependent climate drivers outside ports. The metamodel efficiently transforms hourly sea conditions from the entrance of the harbor towards the inside port adding the advantages of a physical process model. Thousands of hourly synthetic time series based on present climate conditions and future ones were transferred inside the port to perform a probabilistic analysis of port operations. Future forcing conditions were defined adding several sea level rise (SLR) scenarios, sampled from their probability distribution, to the synthetic sea level fluctuation time series. Wave amplification due to non-linear interactions between wave and sea level variations and changes in the reflection coefficients inside the port induced by SLR were modelled. Probabilistic future changes of operation downtimes were quantified considering the uncertainty associated with the historical forcing conditions outside the port and likely SLR scenarios. The methodology was applied to a specific case study on a regional port located in the north coast of Spain, were port operability due to wave agitation was assessed."
pub.1044805269,Optimization of resign transfer molding process by a virtual manufacturing and a genetic algorithms,"An advantage of using fibre-reinforced composites over conventional materials is that they can easily reduce the mass of structures by adapting the stiffness to the requirements of many practical applications. Thus, they are often used in the various fields related to aeronautics, space, or cars manufacturing. Depending on the size of the structure we want to manufacture, different techniques exist. Among those techniques, we have the resign transfer molding (RTM) process which is more suitable for low to medium volume [1]. In the RTM process some parameters have a significant impact on the production. In general, optimization of the RTM process, use an iterative procedure based on the RTM simulation by finite elements method and an optimization tool. This procedure converge when the error between the response of the simulated model and the experimental test is very low. This procedure is easy to implement but, it’s time-consuming and expensive even with a high computing machines. In this article, an hybrid strategy based on the genetic algorithms (GA) and an artificial neural networks (ANN) will be introduced to reduce the time-consuming in the RTM process. This approach starts by a mapped solutions (created by simulation results) using a small niching parameter of the GAPS program (genetic algorithm with parallel selection [2]), then an ANN is trained to create a RTM process model. Once this Meta-model is created (in general nonlinear) we run the GAPS with the objective function evaluated from the Metamodel response in order to locate the global solution that optimize the RTM process design. In some cases, design variables can be continuous or discrete variables. In such case binary and real coding are used simultaneously. The efficiency of the above strategy will be illustrated through a numerical examples."

Software product lines provide systematic reuse only within a product family. Better gains in productivity and high confidentiality can be achieved by large scale reuse across multiple product lines. This paper puts a methodical way, articulated as “Software Factory Automation”, which can manage reusable assets across distinct software product lines based on “domain specific kits” and “software asset meta model”. The approach is validated by analyzing the software asset reuse in two different product lines implemented in banking domain and practically used in real life.

As a result, the provision of trusted processes has become a new design criterion that exceeds the traditional Business Process Management (BPM) goals of time, cost, and quality, and also goes beyond security and privacy concerns. The notion of trust, however, has rarely been studied in the context of BPM. This paper initiates the conceptualization of trust in BPM by providing two new artefacts, i.e. a four-stage model for the design of trusted processes and a related meta model. Both have been derived from relevant theories and existing, general trust conceptualizations. Two exploratory case studies and secondary data have facilitated the identification of an initial set of application scenarios and trust requirements."

Based on this metamodeling architecture, the M-RDFS will be a meta-language for OWL, thus it will not directly define specific ontologies.

This is achieved by the calculation of an accurate and much simpler response surface meta-model (RSM) that is able to provide all the required nonlinear global sensitivity information. To benchmark the efficiency of the proposed methodology, we utilize an unstructured dynamical model that describes hybridoma cell growth and proliferation in batch cultures. [From the work of D. J. Jang and J. P. Barford, Biochem. Eng. J. 2000 4 (2), 153–168.] We show that using the DoE methodology to generate a response surface meta-model approximation of the full model can lead to the same quality of sensitivity information as the established variance-based GSA methods at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we evaluate, through the application of GSA on the estimated RSM meta-model, its ability to capture the nonlinear interaction effects present in the detailed model."

Despite this importance, the design of process maps is still more art than science, essentially because there is no standardized modeling language available for process map design. In this paper, we address the research question of which concepts are currently used in process maps in practice. To this end, we investigate a collection of 67 process maps from industry.

To address this problem, we propose the notion of model scripting which uses introspection to automatically and dynamically expose any kind of model to program control through a compact and high-level notation.

For such complex software architectures, an early evaluation and decision on the best set of performance configuration (e.g. timing vs energy trade-offs) could save costly corrections of potential errors in the design. For example, appropriate performance analysis workflows and frameworks if employed already during early design stages, allow us to understand the performance aspects and behavior of the system depending on software and hardware characteristics. The main input required for such analysis is the performance-analysis model based on the underlying design model. In this context, this chapter presents a workflow for synthesis of energy-aware timing analysis models for AUTOSAR-based embedded software systems developed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML)/Systems Modeling Language (SysML) domains. A prototype of the model transformations for the synthesis of the energy-aware timing models and its evaluation in an automotive use case is presented."

Accordingly, intuitive and flexible computational tools are needed to support the development of such models. We previously developed the platform EPISIM for graphical modeling and simulation of cellular behavior in epithelia. In this work we demonstrate how computationally efficient software components for epithelial tissue simulations can be automatically generated. We introduce a model-driven workflow to generate extendable and exchangeable software components for both the modeling and the simulation of epithelial tissues. We distinguish two levels of abstraction in our workflow and thus two kinds of models: (i) the meta-model of our modeling language and (ii) particular systems biological cell behavioral models. The model-driven component generation allows optimization of the underlying code and the automated integration in our EPISIM platform. We evaluated the computational performance and the correctness of the generated software components. In this work we focus on the evaluation of the computational performance. It could be shown that the execution time increases nearly linearly with the size of the generated component's underlying model."

However, they have in common issues concerning quality assurance and successful project management. Process models can be applied on different levels in process engineering, depending on whether processes are to be executed, defined or improved. Various individual methods and tools have been developed to help process engineers and members who are engineering and performing processes. These methods however do not support continuous integration into a process engineering lifecycle that consists of creating, defining, executing and improving processes. Therefore, we propose a holistic view of artifacts and activities in the process engineering lifecycle in an effort to create a consensus on what constitutes a process engineering lifecycle and take a look at recent research results covering the issues mentioned. We have identified approaches on process descriptions, on meta-models and on support in executing processes in the last years."

Watershed management demands a basic approach, which deals with common statistics and spatial information from digital maps. This causes a range of uncertainties, which are calculated in relation to the data input. A metamodel derived from a process model calculates the most probable value of the ecological indicator, whereas the economic indicators are estimated by the cumulative numbers of primary production. The uncertainties are expressed as the standard deviation of all impacts as percentages. The method described is applied to a rural district in the Elbe river basin."

System engineers or modelers have the choice between tools and system description languages that are either abstract and generic or specifically adapted to their domain. The latter approach is easier and more efficient but restrictive. The success of this approach strongly relies on the support of domain-specific tools. The design or adaptation of such software tools and their underlying conceptual models is a complex task, which can be supported by a model-based approach on the meta model level itself. This paper proposes a workflow for designing complex systems by using domain-specific models which may combine structural and behavioral aspects. It is loosely based on the Object Management Group's Model Driven Architecture approach. For this purpose we use the Eclipse Modeling Framework and Eclipse Sirius Project, which are part of the Eclipse Modeling Project.

We propose an approach to deriving a Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS)-Hybrid simulation model from a Software Process Engineering Meta-model (SPEM)-based software process model. We provide the mapping between the elements of SPEM and the DEVS-Hybrid formalism and the transformation rules for automatically deriving a simulation model from a descriptive process model. Our approach resolves the issues by the transformation rules and the hierarchical and modularized modeling properties of UML and DEVS."
pub.1061788533,Constructing meta-CASE workbenches by exploiting visual language generators,"In this paper, we propose an approach for the construction of meta-CASE workbenches, which suitably integrates the technology of visual language generation systems, UML metamodeling, and interoperability techniques based on the GXL (graph exchange language) format. The proposed system consists of two major components. Environments for single visual languages are generated by using the modeling language environment generator (MEG), which follows a metamodel/grammar-approach. The abstract syntax of a visual language is defined by UML class diagrams, which serve as a base for the grammar specification of the language. The workbench generator (WoG) allows designers to specify the target workbench by means of a process model given in terms of a suitable activity diagram. Starting from the supplied specification WoG generates the customized workbench by integrating the required environments."
pub.1106948409,Reliability based optimization of fiber reinforced elastomeric bearings,"Abstract Seismic isolation achieved by placing a flexible layer between the structure to protect and the foundation has proven to reduce the seismic demand. Recently fiber reinforced elastomeric bearings (FREBs) consisting of alternating layers of elastomeric material and carbon or fiber glass fabric have awakened interest as a replacement for the conventional steel reinforced elastomeric bearings (SREBs). FREBs bring advantages as a reduction of production and transport costs, while maintaining a high bearing capacity. In the current work, an automated workflow for optimizing both the costs and bearing capacity is presented. The methodology includes using design of experiments techniques to reduce computation cost, building metamodels based on the generated data, optimizing the multi‐objective problem, validating the optimal model and finally using reliability based design optimization to find the optimal solution under uncertainty. Design variables and constraints, as well as a composite objective function that minimizes the production and transport costs and maximizes the vertical stiffness have been defined. The presented method can serve as basis for the extension of the problem to assess the horizontal performance of FREBs."
pub.1028441655,MTC Flow,"This paper presents a tool called MTC Flow, which allows model-driven developers to design, develop, test and deploy Model Transformation Chains (MTCs). The tool offers a graphical DSL for defining MTC workflow models independently of the technologies that support the transformations. Using basic concepts such as metamodels, models and transformations (M2M, M2T and T2M) the user defines, executes and tests his MTC easily in the same development environment. MTC Flow has an abstraction layer to implement technology support. It facilitates the interoperability of model transformation and validation using the existing technologies without changes. Additionally, once the MTC is finished, MTC Flow offers an option to deploy it in any environment that support JAVA technology. The tool supports modularity and alternative execution paths of the MTCs. It was built on top of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF). The tool offers a development environment using the extending capabilities of the Eclipse platform. We illustrate how MTC Flow supports MTCs development process using an example."
pub.1035129151,"Realizing a Conceptual Framework to Integrate Model-Driven Engineering, Software Product Line Engineering, and Software Configuration Management","Software engineering is a highly integrative computer science discipline, combining a plethora of different techniques to increase the quality of software development as well as the resulting software. The three sub-disciplines Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE), Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) and Software Configuration Management (SCM) are well-explored, but literature still lacks an integrated solution. In this paper, we present the realization of a conceptual framework that integrates those three sub-disciplines uniformly based on a filtered editing model. The framework combines the check-out/modify/commit workflow known from SCM with the formalism of feature models and feature configurations known from SPLE. The implementation is model-driven and extensible with respect to different product and version space models. Important design decisions are formalized by means of Ecore metamodels. Furthermore, we propose several optimizations that increase the scalability of the conceptual framework."
pub.1052080933,A Model-Driven Software Development Approach Using OMG DDS for Wireless Sensor Networks,"The development of embedded systems challenges software engineers with timely delivery of optimised code that is both safe and resource-aware. Within this context, we focus on distributed systems with small, specialised node hardware, specifically, wireless sensor network (WSN) systems. Model-driven software development (MDSD) promises to reduce errors and efforts needed for complex software projects by automated code generation from abstract software models. We present an approach for MDSD based on the data-centric OMG middleware standard DDS. In this paper, we argue that the combination of DDS features and MDSD can successfully be applied to WSN systems, and we present the design of an appropriate approach, describing an architecture, metamodels and the design workflow. Finally, we present a prototypical implementation of our approach using a WSN-enabled DDS implementation and a set of modelling and transformation tools from the Eclipse Modeling Framework."
pub.1131920408,From digital models to numerical analysis for mechanised tunnelling: A fully automated design-through-analysis workflow,"Large infrastructure projects involving the construction of tunnels in urban areas constitute complex, integrated and multi-disciplinary systems, which require building and construction information modelling as well as computational design assessment tools for decision making during all project phases and during their complete life cycle. Even if the underlying information needed for computational analysis is stored in an information model, the translation to computational models is still cumbersome and requires significant manual work for model generation and set-up as well as excessive computing resources and time. To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a systematic of concepts for integrated information modelling, numerical analysis and visualisation for urban mechanized tunnelling. Our first approach “BIM-to-FEM” is characterised by a fully automated link for error-free data exchange between a standalone Tunnelling Information Model and the process-oriented simulation model for mechanized tunnelling “ekate”. In the second approach “SATBIM”, a fully automated data exchange workflow is established between a parametric multi-level information model for tunnelling and multi-level numerical models based on both Finite Element and Isogeometric Analysis, where meta models are employed for real-time design assessment. We discuss the different applications of these concepts, such as scenario-based exploration of design alternatives, real-time design assessment within a TIM based on meta-models, and the potentials of using these models for the process control during construction. Furthermore, we present two case studies where real project data has been used for the integration of information and numerical modelling. The examples in this paper indicate clear advantages of this approach compared to traditional approaches in terms of efficiency of modelling achieved by reduced user interactions and error-free information exchange, and show the benefits of multi-level model representation and real-time analysis tasks."
pub.1124660306,Scheduling scientific workflows on virtual machines using a Pareto and hypervolume based black hole optimization algorithm,"The problem of workflow scheduling on virtual machines in a cloud environment is to find the near optimal permutation of the assignment of independent computational jobs on a set of machines that satisfies conflicting objectives. This problem is known to be an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary multiobjective algorithms are optimization methods to solve such problems. hypervolume is one of the most important criteria that is used to both as solution evaluation and as a guidance for near-optimal selection of a set of solutions called the Pareto front. In this paper, a new hypervolume-based multiobjective algorithm is proposed for driving the Pareto front. To this end, we extend the single-objective Black hole heuristic algorithm based on the adopted θ$$\theta $$-dominance relation to improving the diversity and convergence to an optimal Pareto front. The conflicting objectives are resource utilization, resource cost, and the workflow makespan (completion time). Also to presenting the appropriate scheduling algorithm, we have proven the correctness of the proposed algorithm by providing the behavioral model of the suggested system using model checking tool. For this purpose, we first introduce the behavioral model of the proposed system using Abstract state machine and extract the properties of the algorithm in the form of linear temporal logic. Then we encode the algorithm using the model checker tool Abstract state Machine Meta-model-based Language and verify the accuracy of the algorithm based on the expected properties, reachability, fairness, and deadlock-free. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method we: (1) extended the WorkflowSim tools, (2) applied it to both balanced and imbalanced workflows and (3) compared results to algorithms, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm-2, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-2, Multi-Swarm MultiObjective Optimization, Intelligent Water Drops algorithm and Genetic Algorithm and Pareto-based Grey Wolf Optimizer. The comparisons show that by increasing the number of users requests and their correlations, the proposed algorithm can find more optimal Pareto front."
pub.1095354350,Supporting Collaborative Development Using Process Models: An Integration-Focused Approach,"Software engineering projects are highly collaborative. Existing tools designed to support collaboration usually provide some specific service, and integration with other tools using data and events. However, Process-Centered Software Engineering Environments have traditionally been designed with different assumptions. The process is usually considered as the central aspect of the software project, and used as a center of control. As a result, great emphasis has been placed on the ability of PSEEs to invoke other tools, or use data generated by other tools. However, the integration in the other direction, that is, the ability of other tools to query the data managed by PSEEs (the process model), and hook into their extensions points, has been largely ignored, as it is not compatible with the vision of the PSEE as the central orchestrator of project support tools. We argue that this view has hindered the widespread adoption of process-based collaboration support tools by incurring too much adoption and switching costs, and propose a new process-based collaboration support architecture, backed by a process metamodel, which can easily be integrated with existing tools."
pub.1000118793,Modelling Capabilities as Attribute-Featured Entities,"The concept of capability is a fundamental element not only for Service Oriented Architecture but also for Enterprise Information Systems. This concepts denotes what an action (i.e., a service, a program, a business process, etc.) can do from a functional perspective. Despite its importance, current approaches do not model it properly: either they confuse it with an annotated invocation interface or do not go beyond the classical IOPE paradigm which, from an end user perspective, does not have an intuitive description of what is the capability being modeled. In this paper, we present a conceptual model as an RDF-schema for describing capabilities as attribute-featured entities which is more user friendly. Actually, we consider a capability as an action verb and a set of domain specific attributes that relates to an exact business meaning. This way, we are able to represent capabilities at several levels of abstraction from the most abstract one with just an action verb to the most concrete one that corresponds to the exact need of an end user which is not possible with current capability modelling approaches. We are also able to interlink capabilities for creating a hierarchical structure that allows for improving the discovery process. Our meta model is based on RDF and makes use of Linked Data to define capability attributes as well as their values."
pub.1045987330,Position paper,"Documented design decisions simplify the evolution of software systems. However, currently design decisions are often either badly documented or are not documented at all. Relations between requirements, decisions, and architectural elements are missing, and architecture alternatives are not preserved. As a consequence it is hard to identify deprecated design solutions when requirements change In this position paper, we present an approach to document software architecture design decisions, together with related requirements and related architectural elements, through the goal-driven elicitation of those requirements needed to make a design decision. Therefore, we propose a process model and supporting meta-models, including a meta-model for a pattern catalogue. The speciality of this pattern catalogue is the inclusion of questions to drive requirements engineering to validate pattern selections, and to guide choosing the most appropriate pattern variant. The paper concludes with a discussion on the assumptions of the approach and possible approaches to empirical validation."
pub.1166084652,Advancing business process management lifecycle implementation through the integration of the design for Six Sigma method," Purpose This research proposes how Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) provides a complementary approach for business process management (BPM) lifecycle implementation in order to address gaps identified in the current literature.   Design/methodology/approach The mandatory elements of a method (MEM) framework is used to illustrate DFSS's maturity as a process redesign method. The use of DFSS in a BPM context is described through several action research case examples.   Findings This research specifies the procedure model (order of development activities), techniques, results, roles and information/meta model (conceptual data model of results) associated with using DFSS to address BPM-related challenges. The action research case examples provided discuss the details of implementing BPM using DFSS to design, implement and test redesigned processes to ensure they fulfill the needs of process participants.   Research limitations/implications While the case examples discussed were performed in only a few settings, which limits the generalizability of their results, they provide evidence regarding the wide range of domains in which the proposed DFSS-BPM approach can be applied and how the tools are used in different contexts.   Practical implications This research offers a road map for addressing the challenges practitioners often face with BPM lifecycle implementation.   Originality/value This research provides the first attempt to integrate DFSS as a complementary method for BPM lifecycle implementation. "
pub.1144088764,EOQ: An Open Source Interface for a More DAMMMMN Domain-specific Model Utilization,"Determinism, automation, multi-element, multi-model, multi-computer, multi-user support and neutrality (DAMMMMN) are in our opinion important qualities of domain-specific modeling, and are enablers for highly automated workflows and collaborative modeling. An improvement in any of these qualities eases the development of software using domain-specific models, and enables the design of more sophisticated Model-based Engineering Environments (MBEE). In the context of current programmatic interfaces for domain-specific models, we see room for improvement, and propose Essential Object Query (EOQ) as a generic interface between domain-specific (meta-)models and their users. This interface integrates ACID transactions, complex commands, model queries, reflection abstractions, mass data manipulation, object serialization, automation, notifications, change tracking, and a model database, such that a programmatic decoupling between models and their usage is achieved. Our interface is agnostic with respect to the programming language(s) and domain-specific modeling framework(s). A prototype is implemented with Python on top of EMF’s meta-model ECORE. An example of a signal routing application in an architecture model of a cyber-physical system is used to demonstrate our interface and to evaluate its impact on the individual DAMMMMN qualities."
pub.1093408690,Conceptual modeling and generator framework for multidisciplinary and collaborative Product Lifecycle Management,"Engineering enterprises today have to cope with various challenges dealing with the management of their multidisciplinary and collaborative engineering contexts. Amongst others, those are: the integration of involved distributed IT systems, the management of changes on the complex collaborative product and process data, and the support of collaborative users. Many solutions have been proposed and implemented in today Product Data and Workflow Management systems. However, they are often restricted to only a specific engineering discipline or were not conceived for collaborative and multidisciplinary issues. Further, the diversity and heterogeneity of the models used to implement them and the lack of a semantic model supporting their consolidation constitute a barrier to an efficient collaborative product lifecycle management. We propose to leverage existing product and process modeling approaches and standards in order to develop a holistic semantic meta-model enabling the modeling of artifacts for collaborative and multidisciplinary product lifecycle management (PLM). The provision of generators and predefined services to enable the operative deployment of the models designed using that meta-model contributes to the reduction of the overall costs for implementing collaborative PLM solutions and facilitate its dissemination in small and medium sized enterprises. This paper presents a concept for such a framework based on the concept of Engineering Networks."
pub.1121647239,Process-Based Quality Management in Care: Adding a Quality Perspective to Pathway Modelling,"Abstract
Care pathways (CPs) are used as a tool to organize complex care processes and to foster the quality management in general. However, the quality management potentials have not been sufficiently exploited yet, since the development, documentation, and controlling of quality indicators (QIs) for quality management purposes are not fully integrated to the process standards defined by CPs. To support the integration of a quality perspective in CPs, the paper addresses the questions which and how quality concepts can be integrated into the process documentation in order to support managers, health service providers, and patients. Therefore, we extended the widely accepted modelling language “Business Process Model and Notation” (BPMN) with a quality perspective. The conceptualization is grounded on a systematic literature review on (quality) indicator modelling. Together with previous work on the conceptualization of QIs in health care, it provided the basis for a comprehensive domain requirements analysis. Following a design-oriented research approach, the requirements were evaluated and used to design a BPMN extension by implementing the quality indicator enhancements as BPMN meta model extension. All design decisions were evaluated in a feedback workshop with a domain expert experienced in quality management and certification of cancer centres on national and international level. The approach is demonstrated with an example from stroke care. The proposed language extension provides a tool to be used for the governance of care processes based on QIs and for the implementation of a more real-time, pathway-based quality management in health care."
pub.1041871786,MENTOR: A Computer Aided Requirements Engineering environment,"In this paper, we present the Computer Aided Requirements Engineering (CARE) environment named MENTOR. This environment offers various viewers, editors and tools and can be customised by a method engineer to any existing requirements engineering methodology. The core component of the environment is the ”Guidance Engine”. It executes — or enacts- in a flexible manner any process model -that we call way-of-working. A way-of-working is defined as an instance of a process meta-model. We illustrate, through a comprehensive example, how MENTOR provides support and guidance based on the execution of process models to both application engineers (who construct system specifications) and to method engineers (who construct ways-of-working) in a flexible and efficient way."
pub.1016175218,Transforming an enterprise model into a use case model in business process systems,"One of the responsibilities of requirements engineering is to transform stakeholder requirements into system and software requirements. For enterprise systems, this transformation must consider the enterprise context where the system will be deployed. Although there are some approaches for detailing stakeholder requirements, some of them even considering the enterprise context, this task is executed manually. Based on model-driven engineering concepts, this study proposes a semi-automatic transformation from an enterprise model to a use case model. The enterprise model is used as a source of information about the stakeholder requirements and domain knowledge, while the use case model is used as software requirements model. This study presents the source and target metamodels, a set of transformation rules, and a tool to support the transformation. An experiment analyzes the use of the proposed transformation to investigate its benefits and if it can be used in practice, from the point of view of students in the context of a requirements refinement. The results indicate that the approach can be used in practice, as it did not influence the quality of the generated use cases. However, the empirical analysis does not indicate benefits of using the transformation, even if the qualitative results were positive."
pub.1100188296,A CPS-Based Intelligence-Awareness Platform for IT Service Management,"In order to solve a series of problems about IT service management in Enterprise, such as lower efficiency and service quality, complexed business processes and communication patterns, huge static management data and dynamic control data, etc., an intelligence-awareness IT service management platform, which is based on the Cyber Physical System (CPS) for constructing smart Industry 4.0, is proposed to optimize the management and service process for IT resources in this paper. The whole IT resources of enterprise mainly include software, hardware and employee resources. How to aware and integrate all kinds of IT resources with intelligence method together for analyzing and providing better service is a big challenges, especially, the physical state-awareness about all hardware and network facilities, the business process-awareness about management software and business data, the knowledge-awareness and service among the employees in Enterprise. Based on these critical IT resources, a new smart ITSM platform is designed and programed, which is not only use CPS meta-model to build the state-awareness smart environment for IT service, but also integrate ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) meta-model as a standard management process to aware the change about the process and knowledge library. The application results show that the new CPS-Awareness ITSM platform promotes the efficiency and qualify of IT service and provides early-alarm in the management process of the whole life cycle of IT resources in enterprise."
pub.1007632183,BORM-II and UML as Accessibility Process in Knowledge and Business Modelling,"This paper presents two systems and knowledge modelling techniques that may be used as a tool to coordinate the communication between researchers and users from the agriculture problem domain. The paper is focused on th eusage of a general approach UML (Unified Modelling Language) and an innovative approach BORM-II (Bussiness Object Relation Modelling, second generation) as communication standards within research projects. The first part of this paper describes the framework, laying out the main aspects of both notations, metamodel and theoretical background as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The paper analyses practical examples from agriculture, rural and organization modelling domains. These innovation processes in both approaches are aplied on the same business process description and evaluates the impact on researchers and users of research. The main part is focused on the transformation model to model based on BORM-II. The transformation is in line with UML and SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules) standards from OMG (Object Management Group). My predecessor worked on model transformation BORM to UML. This work follows Petr Šplíchals work and goes further. This transformation will be composed into a modelling tool and will be based on approach HOT (High Order Transformation). The objective of this research is to achieve documentation output like SBVR, and bridge the gap between business people (users) and designers (researchers) of information systems (IS). The paper concludes that the gap between IS designers (software engineers) and domain experts can be bridged by automated transformation of previously mentioned models. The main goal is to achieve a documentation output similar to SBVR, and ICT Accessibility for business people."
pub.1132093688,LUV is not the answer,"The OutSystems Platform is a visual model-driven development and delivery platform that allows developers to create enterprise-grade cross platform web and mobile applications. The platform consists of several inter-dependent components, most notably Service Studio, the Platform Server, and LifeTime. Service Studio is an integrated development environment used to create applications that are then compiled by the Platform Server. LifeTime is used to stage applications between different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). Our meta-model is versioned using a version number that we call Last Upgrade Version (LUV). Service Studio, the Platform Server, and the models they create/process are associated with a particular LUV. As a general rule, a platform component is only able to process models with the same LUV as the component itself. This approach is not very flexible: a change to the meta-model requires releasing a new set of platform components that our customers then need to install. Although there's low resistance to installing new versions of Service Studio, the same is not true for the Platform Server. Thus, for all practical purposes LUV changes are tied to releases of major versions of the OutSystems Platform. In this paper we share the techniques that allowed us to transition to a Continuous Delivery process in which our meta-model can evolve freely with no impact on our installed base."

It evaluates the FOREST methodologies referenced in part I of this article series in the contexts of system design, system test and evaluation, and training. The Silverfish case study illustrates implementation of the FOREST meta‐process model and the Mission Aware metamodel described in part I. The case study demonstrates how to accomplish the modeling of functional behaviors and associated derivation of requirements for a realistic system.

pub.1119408641,Scalarizing Functions in Bayesian Multiobjective Optimization,"Scalarizing functions have been widely used to convert a multiobjective
optimization problem into a single objective optimization problem. However,
their use in solving (computationally) expensive multi- and many-objective
optimization problems in Bayesian multiobjective optimization is scarce.
Scalarizing functions can play a crucial role on the quality and number of
evaluations required when doing the optimization. In this article, we study and
review 15 different scalarizing functions in the framework of Bayesian
multiobjective optimization and build Gaussian process models (as surrogates,
metamodels or emulators) on them. We use expected improvement as infill
criterion (or acquisition function) to update the models. In particular, we
compare different scalarizing functions and analyze their performance on
several benchmark problems with different number of objectives to be optimized.
The review and experiments on different functions provide useful insights when
using and selecting a scalarizing function when using a Bayesian multiobjective
optimization method."
pub.1006511030,Computer experiments with functional inputs and scalar outputs by a norm-based approach,"A framework for designing and analyzing computer experiments is presented, which is constructed for dealing with functional and scalar inputs and scalar outputs. For designing experiments with both functional and scalar inputs, a two-stage approach is suggested. The first stage consists of constructing a candidate set for each functional input. During the second stage, an optimal combination of the found candidate sets and a Latin hypercube for the scalar inputs is sought. The resulting designs can be considered to be generalizations of Latin hypercubes. Gaussian process models are explored as metamodel. The functional inputs are incorporated into the Kriging model by applying norms in order to define distances between two functional inputs. We propose the use of B-splines to make the calculation of these norms computationally feasible."
pub.1141245438,A Method to Ensure Compliance with Attribute and Role Based Access Control Policy for Executing BPMN Models,"The stringent control of access rights during business processes execution is an important technique to ensure systems security. Business processes are often designed and operated based on models represented by domain-specific languages, such as BPMN. Moreover, access control policies are often studied and specified based on access control models, such as Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC). These security techniques have several challenges that need to be addressed, such as (1) ensuring consistency of RBAC/ABAC policy specifications and (2) ensuring compliance with RBAC/ABAC policies when executing a business process. In this paper, we propose using a metamodeling technique to take advantage of UML and OCL’s expressive power in order to facilitate validation and verification of RBAC/ABAC policies. Within our approach, the RBAC metamodel is extended so that ABAC constraints for complex business rules could be captured and checked. We build a support tool by incorporating Activiti (the support tool for specifying and implementing BPMN models) with USE (UML-based Specification Environment). The proposed method is experimented and evaluated for the process of liquidating the individual teaching contracts of a training management system."
pub.1021790803,Composition of Relations in Enterprise Architecture Models,"Enterprise architecture focuses on modelling different domains relevant for businesses or organisations. A major issue is how to express and maintain the relations between different modelling domains. Current architectural support focuses mainly on modelling techiques and language for single domains. For enterprise architectures it is important to have the flexibility to create cross domain models and views in which inter-relations are made explicit. Therefore, a language for enterprise architecture models should pay particular attention to the relations between domain models. In this paper we present a general approach to derive an operator that allows for the composition of relations in architecture description languages. This general approach opens the door for a number of interesting application areas, two of which are worked out in more detail: the creation of more modelling flexibility, by allowing to leave out certain details, and automated abstraction and complexity reduction of models facilitating stakeholder-specific visualisations. For a specific enterprise architecture modelling language, we explicitly derive this composition operator. Because of the specific properties of this operator, the transitive closure of the metamodel of this language can be determined."
pub.1000675299,Pragmatic applications of the Semantic Web using SemTalk,"The Semantic Web is a new layer of the Internet that enables semantic representation of the contents of existing Web pages. Using common ontologies, human users sketch out the most important facts in models that act as intelligent whiteboards. Once models are broadcasted to the Internet, new and intelligent search engines, “ambient” intelligent devices and agents will be able to exploit this knowledge network.SemTalk is designed to empower end-users to contribute to the Semantic Web by offering an easy-to use MS Visio-based graphical editor to create RDF-like schema and workflows. Since the modeled data is found by Microsoft’s Office XP SmartTags, users benefit from the knowledge captured in such a ‘Semantic Web’ as a natural byproduct of their daily work with other Microsoft Office products such as Word, Excel or Outlook.SemTalk has a graphically configurable meta model. It extends the functionality of the Visio modeling tool because users can easily configure Visio to conform to different modeling worlds such as Business Engineering and CASE methodologies. These diverse modeling views can also be applied to any other Visio drawings.This paper presents the following applied uses of this technology:•Department-wide information modeling at the Credit Suisse Bank. The main emphasis of this project was to linguistically standardize terms. Based on a common central glossary, local knowledge management teams developed specialized models for their decentralized departments. As part of the knowledge management process, local glossaries were continually integrated into a commonly shared model.•Data warehouse modeling for the AOK Berlin, a health insurance company. As part of establishing a data warehouse, there was a need to document the contents of the data warehouse such as cubes and reports. Initially this was done in a MS Word-document but documentation soon became hard to navigate through and staff were reluctant to keep data current. A distributed, decentralized modeling approach was undertaken to implement these cubes and reports locally by local process experts.•Business process management project: distributed process modeling of the Bausparkasse Deutscher Ring, a German financial institution, to create an industry-specific Semantic Web. Several groups of students from the Technical University FH Brandenburg explored how to develop and apply an industry-specific Semantic Web using business process modeling.•Knowledge Representation experiment performed at the ISWC2002 in Sardinia to create a graphical knowledge base of Semantic Web research presented at the conference.

pub.1025540347,Activity Mining by Global Trace Segmentation,"Process Mining is a technology for extracting non-trivial and useful information from execution logs. For example, there are many process mining techniques to automatically discover a process model describing the causal dependencies between activities . Unfortunately, the quality of a discovered process model strongly depends on the quality and suitability of the input data. For example, the logs of many real-life systems do not refer to the activities an analyst would have in mind, but are on a much more detailed level of abstraction. Trace segmentation attempts to group low-level events into clusters, which represent the execution of a higher-level activity in the (available or imagined) process meta-model. As a result, the simplified log can be used to discover better process models. This paper presents a new activity mining approach based on global trace segmentation. We also present an implementation of the approach, and we validate it using a real-life event log from ASML’s test process."
pub.1093969967,Service-Oriented Approach for Implementing an Extensible Content Management System,"Enterprise content management systems deal with the management of business documents and related human workflow between organizations. Many of these systems are built as monolithic, stand-alone applications that lack the dynamicity support and are difficult to scale and interoperate with other enterprise systems. In order to tackle these issues, a service-oriented approach is introduced for the implementation of a distributed enterprise content management system that is composed from a number of common service components. The basic common service components are implemented according to the Service Component Architecture (SCA), and consist of a content repository service, a document workflow service, a document search service, a notification service, a security service, an execution log service, and an integration service. In content repository service, a document meta-model is defined for managing, tracking and storage of business documents. In this paper, we first present the overall system architecture and detailed design of each service. We then illustrate how to assemble these services into higher-level composite services in order to provide document management functions for the enterprise application. Our implementation shows that our design is able to support on-demand document management services and scale-up in a large enterprise, without much development efforts."

A specific UOBPM has to happen within the limits of the meta-model of the business. The ontology of the business works as a gravitational force to sustain the vision and mission of an activity. The design of business objects requires, on the one hand, a constructive process to define them and, on the other hand, a control process to confirm the validity of the solution. At the end there has to be a pilot test and a recycling process following the XD-design method. The design process includes the definition of the functional concepts, the value adding procedures and the quality assurance system. The control system includes the validation using the existent ontological algorithms based on conceptual knowledge, the knowledge of the fundamentals and the systemic knowledge of the activity."
pub.1046582845,Generating Enterprise Applications from Models,"For developing large and complex applications, industrial practice uses a combination of non-formal notations and methods. Different notations are used to specify the properties of different aspects of an application and these specifications are transformed into their corresponding implementations through the steps of a development process. The development process relies heavily on manual verification to ensure the different pieces integrate into a consistent whole. This is an expensive and error prone process. We present a set of notations for specifying the different layers of a software architecture and a method for transforming a specification into an implementation. Models defined using these different notations are instances of a single meta model. This provides a means to unify the specifications of different layers and leads to a simple and elegant implementation method. The method has been used extensively to construct medium and large-scale enterprise applications."
pub.1040640471,Designing for Recombination: Process Design through Template Combination,"Process design remains an important yet difficult concern for postindustrial organizations. We posit that processes ‘become’ processes in these organizations only via their anchoring in concrete artifacts. Consequently, we identify and refine two design principles: processes as anchored in concrete material artifacts (not abstract process representations); and process design through recombination of existing processes (instead of designing anew). Our research starts by building a research artifact, ReKon, that instantiates these two principles. The paper describes this artifact with the meta-model, an implementation and the fine-granular process units, as template chunks created from ~1,200 real-world templates, to populate the tool. We revise and refine the design principles via successive cycles of implementation of the research artifact, formative evaluation with student teams, and insights obtained from an ongoing field study. We conclude by pointing to directions for future research."
pub.1004647607,The Things of the Internet of Things in BPMN,"The component “thing” of the Internet of Things does not yet exist in current business process modeling standards. The “thing” is the essential and central concept of the Internet of Things, and without its consideration we will not be able to model the business processes of the future, which will be able to measure or change states of objects in our real-world environment. The presented approach focuses on integrating the concept of the Internet of Things into the meta-model of the process modeling standard BPMN 2.0 as standard-conform as possible. By a terminological and conceptual delimitation, three components of the standard are examined and compared towards a possible expansion. By implementing the most appropriate solution, the new thing concept becomes usable for modelers, both as a graphical and machine-readable element."
pub.1095376931,Extending BPMN for Business Activity Monitoring,"Real-time access to key performance indicators is necessary to ensure timeliness and effectiveness of operational business processes. The concept of Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) refers to the observation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about business activities across systems and companies' borders. Designing and maintaining BAM applications is challenging, as the involved concepts (e.g., business processes, audit logs, performance measures) though being strongly interrelated— are developed by different communities of practice. Also, they reside on different levels of abstraction, and are handled by different IT systems. Hence, we developed a conceptual modeling language which extends the widely accepted Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) by BAM-relevant concepts. The main results presented in this paper are: (1) a meta-model which formally describes the conceptual aspects of the developed BPMN extension (abstract syntax); (2) graphical symbols as an exemplary representation of this abstract syntax (concrete syntax); (3) a demo scenario that illustrates the application of the language in a fictitious scenario."

In such factories BPR (Business Process Engineering) usually takes place without the support of Modeling & Simulation although such methodologies have proved to be very effective and helpful. Main reasons for that have to be investigated in the high costs usually associated with a simulation study, especially for data collection, model building and model validation. In order to avoid this problem a general-purpose simulation framework was designed enabling self-build according to production process information stored in a relational database. Moreover, the simulation model was used in conjunction with a statistical analysis tool in order to build the relationship among selected parameters and the proposed objective function by mean of Response Surface Methodology and 2nd order regressions meta-models. Authors applied the proposed schema to several industrial applications obtaining interesting results."
pub.1063009017,A PLATFORM FOR SERVICE PROVIDER TO ADVERTISE QUALITY OF SERVICE USING WSDL,"Web services are programs which perform some elementary business process of an application and are distributed over the Internet. These services are described, discovered and executed using standard languages WSDL, SOAP and UDDI. Proliferation of web services has resulted in intense competition between providers, which provide the same service. To survive in such a competitive environment, they need to advertise the quality of their service. Web service description language does not provide support to describe quality attributes. Recently, DAmbrogio proposed QOS model of web services based on a meta model of WSDL. In this paper, we present a platform to advertise QOS as declared by the service provider. This tool generates a WSDL file from Java code along with its quality of service attributes. It accepts Java code and a file containing quality attributes. These attributes include reliability, availability, and operation demand and operation latency. These attributes are included in WSDL file as a content of description element."
pub.1016063362,Schema Change Operations for Versioning Complex Objects Hierarchy in OODBs,"In this paper, we propose a set of schema change operations which allows to restructure complex object hierarchy in object-oriented databases. This model extends a schema version model, called RiBS, which is based on the concept of Rich Base Schema. In the RiBS model, each schema version is in the form of updatable class hierarchy view over one base schema, called the RiBS layer, which has richer schema information than any existing schema version in the database.In this paper, we introduce new operations for restructuring composite object hierarchy in schema versions, and explain their semantics. The originality of this paper lies in that 1) we introduce several new operations to restructure composite object hierarchy, and 2) this extended RiBS model operations raise the concept of data independence in OODBs upto the schema level."

Extracting and selecting the relevant data to enable process mining remains a challenging and time-consuming task. In fact, it is the biggest handicap when applying process mining and other forms of process-centric analysis. This work presents a new query language, DAPOQ-Lang, which overcomes some of the limitations identified in the field of process querying and fits within the Process Querying Framework. The language is based on the OpenSLEX meta model, which combines both data and process perspectives. It provides simple constructs to intuitively formulate questions. The syntax and semantics have been formalized and an implementation of the language is provided, along with examples of queries to be applied to different aspects of the process analysis."
pub.1129683671,Adaptive and Resilient Business Architecture for the Digital Age,"The process of enterprise digitalization has become in recent years unstoppable. In the global competition, enterprises have to use all the means available in order to be able to respond to competitors’ innovations or to be able to implement innovations that would take them ahead of the competition. With the rising complexity of the used business and the information technologies, usage of enterprise architecture becomes inevitable so that the business-IT alignment is maintained. In this chapter we describe a method how to develop a resilient and adaptive minimal business architecture so that business requirements can be clearly defined, their support by the functionality of applications evaluated and the missing support resolved. The method is illustrated with the generally accepted EA standards TOGAF/ArchiMate, UML and BPMN and its benefits are discussed. We also provide the reader with a meta-model that specifies how these standards in the discussed areas match together."
pub.1092105045,A Configurable WoT Application Platform Based on Spatiotemporal Semantic Scenarios,"With the transformation of Internet of Things to Web of Things (WoT), a variety of applications are required to deal with huge volumes of real-time and heterogeneous data. However, in most applications, due to the weak semantics of data itself and the loose combination with specific scenarios, it is sometimes difficult to depict the spatiotemporal feature of the scenario in an application only through the data. In this paper, a spatiotemporal semantic scenario meta-model-based configurable platform is proposed for the development of WoT applications to address this issue, based on the data configuration, event stream configuration, and service encapsulation, the entire WoT scenario can be depicted with an abstract data model and related rules, and the business process can be changed by redefining corresponding rules when requirements change. A case study is given to verify the feasibility of our platform. The result shows that the platform can provide background support for WoT applications in a promising way."
pub.1167165945,Modeling software processes from different domains using SPEM and BPMN notations: An experience report of teaching software processes,"In a current application development scenario in different environments, technologies and contexts, such as IoT, Blockchain, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing, there is a need for particular solutions for domain-specific software development processes. The proper definition of software processes requires the understanding for the involved teams and organization’s particularities and specialized technical knowledge in Software Engineering. Although it is an essential part of Software Engineering, many university curricula do not dedicate as much effort to teaching software processes, focusing more on the basic principles of Software Engineering, such as requirements, architecture and programming languages. Another important aspect of software processes is modeling. The modeling of a software process provides a basis for managing, automating and supporting the software process improvement. In this context, teaching software process modeling becomes challenging, mainly due to the great emphasis on theory and few practices. This work presents an experience report teaching the definition and modeling of software processes in different domains. In the discipline of software processes, we applied a practice for defining and modeling processes in various application domains, such as: IoT, cloud, mobile, critical systems, self-adaptive systems, machine learning, blockchain and games. The processes were modeled in the Software Systems Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) notations based on references from the literature for each domain. We evaluated the process modeling practice with the SPEM and BPMN in two classes of the software processes discipline, and we had discussions about the use of the two notations applied to the different domains. In general, students reported good experiences in defining processes, highlighting the importance of practical modeling applications for professional life. As the main results of the study in teaching process modeling, we have that: (i) students accepted HEFLO tool better than EPF Composer tool; (ii) most students are not aware of specific domains and that anticipating the study of these domains in the discipline is a good strategy; and, (iii) the students also highlighted the need for more support for the two notation tools."

EPM is still abstract at higher abstract level and is general while software process is concrete, so EPM must be instantiated before its enactment. The method to transform any EPM to its execution model based on logic programming is proposed. Since activity contains the imports resource, roles resource, exports resource and tasks, the rules to transform the four parts of activity level of any EPM to its execution model based logic programming are respectively proposed by analyzing the execution semantics of the activities and the tasks in EPM. The converter program is realized and the correct results have presented to prove the correctness of the method."

pub.1095987235,Towards design optimization of high-pressure gasoline injectors using Genetic Algorithm coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD),"The spray pattern of high-pressure multi-hole injectors as well as the atomization process are of uttermost impor-tance regarding efficiency and emissions in gasoline combustion engines. Ensuring optimal homogenization while meeting the engine individual specifications regarding spray targeting and massflow is a crucial development goal. High effort is put on the layout of the nozzle seat to meet the engine requirements. Success is only possible with a deep knowledge of the influencing quantities, considering that many design parameters affect the inner nozzle flow. Based on this knowledge improvement in spray penetration length and atomization can be achieved.In the current investigation a segment model of the injector is considered. A fully automated, highly parallelized workflow enables a systematic examination of the constrained design space with acceptable computational time. The CFD workflow is implemented in the OPtimization Algorithm Library++ (OPAL++) developed at the “Otto von Guericke” University of Magdeburg.First, inner nozzle flow 3D-CFD calculations of two selected nozzle geometries are validated by comparison with shadowgraphy and Long-Distance-Microscope (LDM) measurements. Using these simulations, correlations be- tween nozzle flow parameters and the key spray characteristics, serving as optimization objectives, are analyzed. Second, a Design-of-Experiment (DoE) is created to understand the interdependency between design variables and objectives. Based on the DoE, metamodels are constructed, validated, compared with each other and used for optimization. Afterwards, a direct 3D CFD-optimization is carried out for the nozzle geometry. It relies on a Genetic Algorithm in OPAL++ to identify the Pareto front of the multi-objective problem. Finally, the Pareto front is analyzedand conclusions are drawn for future research.

pub.1112467203,Four algorithms to construct a sparse kriging kernel for dimensionality reduction,"In the context of computer experiments, metamodels are largely used to represent the output of computer codes. Among these models, Gaussian process regression (kriging) is very efficient see e.g Snelson (Flexible and efficient Gaussian process models for machine learning. ProQuest LLC, Ann Arbor, MI. Thesis (Ph.D.)–University of London, University College London, London, 2008). In high dimension that is with a large number of input variables, but with few observations, the estimation of the parameters with a classical anisotropic kriging can be completely inaccurate. Because there are equal numbers of ranges and input variables the optimization space becomes too large compared to available information. One way to overcome this drawback is to use an isotropic kernel that only depends on one parameter. However this model is too restrictive. The aim of this paper is twofold. Our first objective is to propose a smooth kernel with as few parameters as warranted. We introduce a kernel which is a tensor product of few isotropic kernels built on well-chosen subgroup of variables. The main difficulty is to find the number and the composition of the groups. Our second objective is to propose algorithmic strategies to overcome this difficulty. Four forward strategies are proposed. They all start with the simplest isotropic kernel and stop when the best model according to BIC criterion is found. They all show very good accuracy results on simulation test cases. But one of them is more efficient. Tested on a real data set, our kernel shows very good prediction results."
pub.1131387066,Using Global Biodiversity Information Facility Occurrence Data for Automated Invasive Alien Species Risk Mapping,"To support invasive alien species risk assessments, the Tracking Invasive Alien Species (TrIAS) project has developed an automated, open, workflow incorporating state-of-the-art species distribution modelling practices to create risk maps using the open source language R. It is based on Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data and openly published environmental data layers characterizing climate and land cover. Our workflow requires only a species name and generates an ensemble of machine-learning algorithms (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and AdaBoost) stacked together as a meta-model to produce the final risk map at 1 km2 resolution (Fig. 1). Risk maps are generated automatically for standard Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gas emission scenarios and are accompanied by maps illustrating the confidence of each individual prediction across space, thus enabling the intuitive visualization and understanding of how the confidence of the model varies across space and scenario (Fig. 2). The effects of sampling bias are accounted for by providing options to: use the sampling effort of the higher taxon the modelled species belongs to (e.g., vascular plants), and to thin species occurrences. use the sampling effort of the higher taxon the modelled species belongs to (e.g., vascular plants), and to thin species occurrences. The risk maps generated by our workflow are defensible and repeatable and provide forecasts of alien species distributions under further climate change scenarios. They can be used to support risk assessments and guide surveillance efforts on alien species in Europe. The detailied modeling framework and code are available on GitHub: https://github.com/trias-project."
pub.1020635151,Pattern-Based ETL Conceptual Modelling,"In software development, patterns and standards are two important things that contribute strongly to the success of any system implementation. Characteristics like these ones improve a lot systems communication and data interchange across different computational platforms, integrating processes and data flows in an easy way. In ETL systems, the change of business requirements is a very serious problem leading frequently to reengineer existing populating processes implementations in order to receive new data structures or tasks not defined previously. Every time this happens, existing ETL processes must be changed in order to accommodate new business requirements. Furthermore, ETL modelling and planning suffers from a lack of mature methodology and notation to represent ETL processes in a uniform way across all implementation process, providing means to validate, reduce implementation errors, and improve communication among users with different knowledge in the field. In this paper, we used the BPMN modelling language for ETL conceptual modelling, providing formal specifications for workflow orchestration and data process transformations. We provide a new layer of abstraction that is based on a set of patterns expressed in BPMN for ETL conceptual modelling. These patterns or meta-models represent the most common used tasks in real world ETL systems."
pub.1111600991,Artefacts in software engineering: a fundamental positioning,"Artefacts play a vital role in software and systems development processes. Other terms like documents, deliverables, or work products are widely used in software development communities instead of the term artefact. In the following, we use the term ‘artefact’ including all these other terms. Despite its relevance, the exact denotation of the term ‘artefact’ is still not clear due to a variety of different understandings of the term and to a careless negligent usage. This often leads to approaches being grounded in a fuzzy, unclear understanding of the essential concepts involved. In fact, there does not exist a common terminology. Therefore, it is our goal that the term artefact be standardised so that researchers and practitioners have a common understanding for discussions and contributions. In this position paper, we provide a positioning and critical reflection upon the notion of artefacts in software engineering at different levels of perception and how these relate to each other. We further contribute a metamodel that provides a description of an artefact that is independent from any underlying process model. This metamodel defines artefacts at three levels. Abstraction and refinement relations between these levels allow correlating artefacts to each other and defining the notion of related, refined, and equivalent artefacts. Our contribution shall foster the long overdue and too often underestimated terminological discussion on what artefacts are to provide a common ground with clearer concepts and principles for future software engineering contributions, such as the design of artefact-oriented development processes and tools."
pub.1030493792,Supporting model-driven development using a process-centered software engineering environment,"The adoption of Model-Driven Development (MDD) is increasing and it is widely recognized as an important approach for building software systems. In addition to traditional development process models, an MDD process requires the selection of metamodels and mapping rules for the generation of the transformation chain which produces models and application code. In this context, software process tasks should be performed in a specific sequence, with the correct input artifacts to produce the output ones. However, existing support tools and transformation engines for MDD do not have a process-centered focus that addresses different kinds of software process activities, such as application modeling and testing to guide the developers. Furthermore, they do not enable process modeling nor the (semi) automated execution of activities during process enactment. The MoDErNE (Model Driven Process-Centered Software Engineering Environment) uses process-centered software engineering environment concepts to improve MDD process specification and enactment by using a metamodeling foundation. In MoDErNE, a software process model may be enacted several times in different software projects. This paper details the MoDErNE environment, its approach and architecture and also the case studies through which the tool was evaluated."
pub.1152234067,Parametric design optimisation of tree-like support structure for the laser-based powder bed fusion of metals,"Support structure design for Laser Powder Bed Fusion has received little attention in Design for Additive Manufacturing although its importance for a successful and efficient build job. The resulting knowledge insufficiency on support design can lead to in-process failures of the build. Also, parts can crack due to high, unaccounted residual stresses. This, and overestimated support designs, lead to an increased manufacturing time and cost. The presented research contributes to a better understanding of support structure design by developing a workflow for the design of tree-like support structure and its subsequent meta-model based parameter optimisation. The design parameters of resulting support structures for two generic geometries in a cantilever shape with a planar and an arched down-facing surface are compared with each other, showing consistent values for the minimum distance between branches and the branch length. These and other design parameters govern the geometry of the tree-like structure within the design space. An additionally performed sensitivity study revealed high correlations of the stem diameter with the part’s displacements. Based on 500 individual support designs and the meta-model evaluation of 9000 parameter sets, a Pareto frontier emerges for the trade-off between the minimum support structure volume and the part’s displacements."
pub.1112115205,Computationally Efficient Simulation in Urban Mechanized Tunneling Based on Multilevel BIM Models,"The design of complex underground infrastructure projects involves various empirical, analytical, or numerical models with different levels of complexity. The use of simulation models in the current state-of-the-art tunnel design process can be cumbersome when significant manual time-consuming preparation, analysis, and excessive computing resources are required. This paper addresses the challenges connected with minimizing the user workload and computational time, as well as enabling real-time computations during construction. To ensure a seamless workflow during design and to minimize the computation time of the analysis, we propose a novel concept for Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based numerical simulations enabling the modeling of the tunnel advance with different levels of detail in terms of geometrical representation, material modeling, and modeling of the advancement process. To ensure computational efficiency, simulation software was developed with special emphasis on efficient implementation, including parallelization strategies for shared and distributed memory systems. For real-time on-demand calculations, simulation-based metamodels were integrated into the software platform. The components of the BIM-based multilevel simulation concept were described and evaluated in detail by means of representative numerical examples."
pub.1128817026,A knowledge-based process planning framework for wire arc additive manufacturing," Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) provides a rapid and cost-effective solution for fabricating low-to-medium complexity and medium-to-large size metal parts. In WAAM, process settings are well-recognized as fundamental factors that determine the performance of the fabricated parts such as geometry accuracy and microstructure. However, decision-making on process variables for WAAM still heavily relies on knowledge from domain experts. For achieving reliable and automated production, process planning systems that can capture, store, and reuse knowledge are needed. This study proposes a process planning framework by integrating a WAAM knowledge base together with our in-house developed computer-aided tools. The knowledge base is construed with a data-knowledge-service structure to incorporate various data and knowledge including metamodels and planning rules. Process configurations are generated from the knowledge base and then used as inputs to computer-aided tools. Moreover, the process planning system also supports the early-stage design of products in the context of design for additive manufacturing. The proposed framework is demonstrated in a digital workflow of fabricating industrial-grade components with overhang features."

However, in spite of the availability of technological solutions to identify and address different privacy threats these have not seen widespread adoption in the engineering practice, and developers still find difficulties in introducing privacy considerations in their new products and services. In this context, privacy engineering has emerged as an inter-disciplinary field that aims to bridge legal, computer science and engineering worlds, as well as concepts from other disciplines. The goal is to provide engineers with methods and tools that are closer to their mindset, and allow them to systematically address privacy concerns and introduce solutions within the workflow and environment they are accustomed to. This paper provides an introduction to Privacy Engineering, describing a conceptual metamodel useful to organize the increasing knowledge in this emergent field and make it more accessible to engineers. We exemplify some of this knowledge focusing on privacy design patterns, a set of privacy engineering elements that distill best-practices available."
pub.1175178643,A Real Time AI-Based Strategy for the Design of a Low-Pressure Turbine Profile,"Abstract This paper focuses on the implementation of a data-driven, AI-powered design strategy for Low Pressure turbine (LPT) profiles. The objective is to develop an effective LPT profile optimization environment, capable of rapidly generating a CFD calculation database to feed AI-based tools for subsequent phases of design space exploration. To achieve this purpose, an automatic workflow has been developed to create profile geometries, computational meshes, and perform URANS calculations. CFD results are then collected both in terms of overall performance (losses) and detailed flow field. AI-models are then trained over this large database, resulting in an accurate metamodel that can be effectively explored looking for specific design solutions. The paper will present and discuss the AI-based tool, showing how in addition to suggesting optimal geometries, it offers additional outputs to inform the designer. Indeed, the tool can provide optimal geometries that match mechanical and geometrical constraints providing performance at varying Reynolds number. Moreover, the blade-loading and the entire 2D flow field are predicted in real-time for the optimal geometry at a given operating condition."
pub.1090852629,ANN meta-model assisted MOPSO application in an EPA-Tier 4 constrained emission-performance trade-off calibration problem of a hydrogen-diesel-EGR dual fuel operation,"The present study provides a comprehensive perspective on the unique opportunities that present day artificial intelligence based meta-modelling strategies pose in internal combustion engine system identification paradigms, especially in its multi-objective calibration domains. The pertinence of the advantages of such AI based meta-modelling strategies and the potential of swarm optimization strategies have been rationalized with the chronological growth in the contemporary necessities of the diesel engine. The study clearly establishes the pivotal significance of perusing true multi-objective optimization strategies commensurate with the increasing need to address the emission-performance trade-off challenges of the diesel engines of the day. In order to highlight the credibility and scalability of such meta-model based multi-objective optimization opportunities in internal combustion engine domains, the present study presents a unique case study showing the distinct possibility of harnessing the synergistic potential of a computationally cost effective and commendably accurate meta-model based calibration endeavour in an existing diesel engine. The study was first-of-a-kind foray into the complexities of a hydrogen-diesel dual fuel operation under EGR application of varying thermal signatures along with the introduction of a trade-off merit index in the optimization workflow. The architecture was based on an ANN system identification platform wherein the MOPSO algorithm was employed to improve the emission-performance trade-off characteristics of the dual fuel operation. Further, in order to corroborate the contemporary relevance of the multi-objective optimization endeavour, additional constraints of the EPA Tier 4 diesel emission mandates were imposed to the case study. Validation of the optimization results indicated a 10.2%, 30.6%, 25.4% and 9.4% improvement in the performance-emission trade-off footprint when compared with the corresponding experimental dual fuel-EGR operations at 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% full load steps respectively."

Consequently, the amount of data used by these applications has also increased. The larger the number of data used, the greater the chance to make errors is. That being the case, managing data with an acceptable level of quality is paramount to success in any organizational business process. In order to raise and maintain adequate levels of Data Quality (DQ), it is indispensable for Web applications to be able to satisfy specific DQ requirements. To do so, DQ requirements should be captured and introduced into the development process of the Web Application, together with the other software requirements needed in the applications. In the field of Web application development, however, there appears to us to exist a lack of proposals aimed at managing specific DQ software requirements. This paper considers the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) approach and, principally, the benefits provided by Model Driven Web Engineering (MDWE), putting forward a proposal for two artifacts. These consist of a metamodel and a UML profile for the management of Data Quality Software Requirements for Web Applications (DQ_WebRE)."
pub.1094860183,Models and Adaptive Architecture for Smart Data Management,"Organizations, companies and Web platforms hold large amounts of unused data. These data are trapped in separate data sources, locked up in legacy formats and only reachable through several different protocols, making usage difficult. It is therefore necessary to manage this multiplicity of data sources in order to build a solution able to combine this multi-origin data into a coherent smart data set. We define a meta-model and models to describe data source diversity in a flexible way. We therefore propose an adaptive architecture that generates data integration workflows at runtime. We evaluate our approach to offer scalability, responsiveness, and dynamic and transparent data source management. We apply our approach in a live scenario from a French company to show how it adapts to industrial needs and facilitates smart data production and reuse.

pub.1151939688,Meta-Uncertainty in Bayesian Model Comparison,"Bayesian model comparison (BMC) offers a principled probabilistic approach to
study and rank competing models. In standard BMC, we construct a discrete
probability distribution over the set of possible models, conditional on the
observed data of interest. These posterior model probabilities (PMPs) are
measures of uncertainty, but -- when derived from a finite number of
observations -- are also uncertain themselves. In this paper, we conceptualize
distinct levels of uncertainty which arise in BMC. We explore a fully
probabilistic framework for quantifying meta-uncertainty, resulting in an
applied method to enhance any BMC workflow. Drawing on both Bayesian and
frequentist techniques, we represent the uncertainty over the uncertain PMPs
via meta-models which combine simulated and observed data into a predictive
distribution for PMPs on new data. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed
method in the context of conjugate Bayesian regression, likelihood-based
inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo, and simulation-based inference with
neural networks."
pub.1020175394,A model for flexibly editing CSCL scripts,"This article presents a model whose primary concern and design rationale is to offer users (teachers) with basic ICT skills an intuitive, easy, and flexible way of editing scripts. The proposal is based on relating an end-user representation as a table and a machine model as a tree. The table-tree model introduces structural expressiveness and semantics that are limited but straightforward and intuitive. This approach is less expressive and introduces less semantics than approaches based on workflow representations and complex meta-models. However, it may be enhanced to represent complex features such as by-intention grouping mechanisms, constraint checking or configuration of enactment frameworks. A usability test suggests that the model/interface is easy to use and that teachers avail themselves of the flexibility available to model scripts according to their perspectives."

Our focus is on the identification and exploitation of the appropriate (minimal set of) SPEM 2.0-like elements, available in the selected reference implementation, which can be used by Regorous for compliance checking. Then, we illustrate our vision by applying it onto a small excerpt from ISO 26262. Finally, we draw our conclusions."

In this paper we develop a model-based assurance approach, based on a weaving model, which allows integration between assurance case, design and process models and metamodels. In our approach, the assurance case itself is treated as a structured model, with the aim that all entities in the assurance case become linked explicitly to the models that represent them. We show how it is possible to exploit the weaving model for automated generation of assurance cases. Building upon these results, we discuss how a seamless model-driven approach to assurance cases can be achieved and examine the utility of increased formality and automation."
pub.1127407408,DPN -- Dependability Priority Numbers,"This paper proposes a novel model-based approach to combine the quantitative
dependability (safety, reliability, availability, maintainability and IT
security) analysis and trade-off analysis. The proposed approach is called DPN
(Dependability Priority Numbers) and allows the comparison of different actual
dependability characteristics of a systems with its target values and evaluates
them regarding trade-off analysis criteria. Therefore, the target values of
system dependability characteristics are taken as requirements, while the
actual value of a specific system design are provided by quantitative and
qualitative dependability analysis (FHA, FMEA, FMEDA, of CFT-based FTA). The
DPN approach evaluates the fulfillment of individual target requirements and
perform trade-offs between analysis objectives. We present the workflow and
meta-model of the DPN approach, and illustrate our approach using a case study
on a brake warning contact system. Hence, we demonstrate how the model-based
DPNs improve system dependability by selecting the project crucial dependable
design alternatives or measures."
pub.1052895230,KnowledgeScope: managing knowledge in context,"Knowledge repositories have been implemented in many organizations, but they often suffer from non-use. This research considers two key design factors that cause non-use: the extra burden on users to document knowledge in the repository, and the lack of a standard knowledge structure that facilitates knowledge sharing among users with different perspectives. We propose a design of a knowledge management system called KnowledgeScope that addresses these problems through (1) an integrated workflow support capability that captures and retrieves knowledge as an organizational process proceeds, i.e., within the context in which it is created and used, and (2) a process meta-model that organizes that knowledge and context in a knowledge repository. In this paper, we describe this design and report the results from implementing it in a real-life organization."
pub.1037065997,An UML-Based Meta-Language for the QoS-Aware Enterprise Specification of Open Distributed Systems,"We address in this paper the need to develop appropriate notations for the QoS-aware specification of the ODP (Open Distributed Processing) enterprise viewpoint. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is currently emerging as de facto standard for formal object-oriented modelling. Several approaches are being used in the field of the formalization of UML. For several reasons, we use the metamodelling approach in our work. We analyze the QoS concepts defined in QoS foundation modelling concepts part and in the QoS in enterprise specification part. The result is an UML meta-model of the core QoS concepts and their relationships, which is considered as the abstract syntax of a concrete language for QoS-aware ODP enterprise specifications."
pub.1144795373,A Framework for Quantifiable Process Improvement through Method Fragments in Situational Method Engineering,"In the field of Business Process Management (BPM), planning and executing precise process tailoring and optimization can be done through different design strategies. Even though Situational Method Engineering (SME) can provide an additional layer of constitutional knowledge, it hasn’t been explored as deeply as other traditional methods. Strategies that rely on a so-called “situational context” make use of the atomic conceptual entities known as method chunks and/or fragments from the field of Situational Method Engineering (SME). BPM, on the other hand, describes processes through representational tools that have been thoroughly used in industry and established as reliable. All of these designs have advantages and disadvantages. We analyzed several designs and proposed a synthesized framework (metamodel) that combines their strong points, while also providing a way to objectively quantify and restructure the performance of a pre-existing process/product (or optimize the creation of an entirely new one). We provide an analysis with a manufacturing organization using BPM concepts for process management/improvement and our proposed method framework, which incorporates Situational Method Engineering metamodelling and the Critical Path Method as a base for process improvement. We show here how using our proposed framework brings a flexible approach to a structured process management, helping enterprises to define, apply, store and retrieve their processes through methods/fragments, while also providing a guideline for systematic tailoring."
pub.1124621700,Integrating Domain Ontologies in an MDA-Based Development Process of e-Health Management Systems at the CIM Level,"We all know that the development of e-Health management applications goes through several steps, as hence, several stakeholders are involved in the development of these applications. Therefore, it is recommended to define a common vocabulary to facilitate the understanding of the proposed business processes and requirements between these stakeholders in the early stages of this process. On the other hand, the model driven architecture (MDA) is defined by the object management group (OMG) in order to enhance the development process of applications. This architecture is based on three models: CIM, PIM, and PSM; covering all stages of the software development life cycle. The CIM is the first level in this process, which represents a computation independent model. It describes the basic business and requirements analysis, as well as the application domain model. In light of this level, the MDA based approach is presented in this article integrating domain ontologies as CIM model using ODM standard. The process starts with the ODM model representing an eHealth domain ontology, then we transform it into a Class diagram by applying the QVTo transformation engine."

pub.1136754723,Green Simulation Assisted Reinforcement Learning With Model Risk for Biomanufacturing Learning and Control,"Biopharmaceutical manufacturing faces critical challenges, including complexity, high variability, lengthy lead time, and limited historical data and knowledge of the underlying system stochastic process. To address these challenges, we propose a green simulation assisted model-based reinforcement learning to support process online learning and guide dynamic decision making. Basically, the process model risk is quantified by the posterior distribution. At any given policy, we predict the expected system response with prediction risk accounting for both inherent stochastic uncertainty and model risk. Then, we propose green simulation assisted reinforcement learning and derive the mixture proposal distribution of decision process and likelihood ratio based metamodel for the policy gradient, which can selectively reuse process trajectory outputs collected from previous experiments to increase the simulation data-efficiency, improve the policy gradient estimation accuracy, and speed up the search for the optimal policy. Our numerical study indicates that the proposed approach demonstrates the promising performance."

pub.1092293280,Towards an extended BPMS prototype: Open challenges of BPM to flexible and robust orchestrate of uncertain processes," Nowadays, uncertainty is widely discussed as serious a challenge against business decision-making. The current business process management systems (BPMSs) are only able to manage certain processes, where there is practically a huge gap between what is expected and what is realized due to uncertainty. This study developed an extended BPMS prototype to facilitate and improve any business process management subject to uncertainty. This prototype can model, design, control and optimize in uncertainty modes, in addition to classic BPMSs operations. For developing a new prototype, the authors first provided a meta-model for designing new engine functions. Thereafter, by defining the architecture style and abstract model, defining user interfaces and component interfaces, uncertain BPMS prototype with CORBA standards created. Furthermore, flexible components are implemented to deal with uncertainty during run-time. This paper has used three evaluation methods to validate the proposed uncertain BPMS prototype. Firstly, an executable prototype has been built and evaluated with a rating model, which obtains quantitative metrics. The comparison between the proposed uncertain BPMS prototype and other classic BPMSs has effectively demonstrated the ability of an extended BPMS prototype in BP management under uncertainty modes. Secondly, a case study in oil and gas industry was studied with a focus on the industry 4.0. The results have revealed the improvement in planning service time after using the proposed prototype. Thirdly, the efficiency of uncertain BPMS prototype has been investigated through different object-oriented software metrics. These results also show the ability of the extended BPMS prototype to flexibly and robustly orchestrate uncertain processes."
pub.1026217132,SOA+d: a new way to design the decision in SOA—based on the new standard Decision Model and Notation (DMN),"In recent years, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies are emerging as a powerful vehicle for organizations that need to integrate their applications within and across organizational boundaries. In addition, organizations need to make better decisions more quickly. Moreover, they need to change those decisions immediately to adapt to this increasingly dynamic business environment. It is primarily a question in ensuring the decisional aspect by adopting the SOA as a support architecture. In this paper, we describe a new approach called SOA+d$$^\mathrm{+d}$$ based on a certain number of standards. It is going to be studied on three dimensions: The first is related to the definition of the information system implied in the SOA based on the use case model. The second develops the business dimension which is based on the BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). The last dimension addresses the need of decision; we use the new standard decision model and notation (DMN) which is recently approved by Object Management Group (OMG) and considered as a simple notation to specify the decision. Finally, Service Oriented Architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) will be used for design of several services. We also present our meta-model Decisional Model of Service (DMS) to define a new set of concepts necessary for modeling the three levels. Some of them are already known, whereas others are new and are proposed as an element of this work. we illustrate our proposal with a real case study in the Pharmacy Inventory Management."
pub.1131962906,A Surrogate Modeling Approach for the Development of Biorefineries,"Biorefinery processes are challenged to make effective use of commercial flowsheeting software. Challenges include the lack of property data, complexity of raw materials, and emerging non-conventional processes and technologies. Surrogate models could assist by combining data-based models (by means of surrogate models) with conventional models available from flowsheeting vendors. The challenge would be to translate experimental data into property and process parameters compatible with models used by commercial software. The paper introduces an iterative approach for the systematic evaluation of such parameters. Degrees of freedom include options for pseudo-components, thermodynamic methods, and process models. The approach is applied for the modeling of a real-life biorefinery. Three case studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed scheme. The first case study has fixed options for the property and process models, while the second one has them as a degree of freedom. The third case study extrapolates the resulted metamodels to different capacities and six different feedstock types (wheat and rice straw, wood, sugarcane bagasse, banana stem, and miscanthus). Degrees of freedom expand as the cases address limited options for surrogate models, gradually incorporating additional options and, apparently, better regression results. The proposed framework could embed additional levels of sophistication using machine learning and artificial intelligence technology. The emphasis of the paper stands on the methodological framework and its demonstration with real-life examples."
pub.1103961236,Model-Centric Digital Subsea Pipeline Design Process and Framework,"This paper describes a development initiative intended to reduce significantly design cost and duration using digitalization. Subsea pipeline design, and in-place studies in particular, is a complex process that is broken down into a systematic sequence of calculations, all connected to a normalized and serialized meta model. The pipeline digital data model is interpreted by a framework that distributes and collects design data to various algorithms and software, thus automating the entire pipeline design workflow down to production of standardized design reports. The implementation of such an objective requires: Developing a systematic design methodology, covering industry standards as well as the client's special requirements, under a ""one-size-fits-most"" process; Standardizing a data model serving as a meta-model to necessary models and solvers; Standardizing data format and exchange protocol so that all models are served with required inputs and instructions; Coding design procedures as unitary applications collecting inputs from and relaying relevant results to the data model; Integrating applications into a framework that serves inputs and collects outputs from models and calculations to produce final standardized reports.     Design reports with input data, results and methodology are automatically created or updated under various file formats or templates. Engineering productivity is improved drastically and the impact of rework is minimized. The productivity gain is multiplied when the design is still in the early stage and when multiple multi-disciplinary design cycles, including the stakeholder's review, are necessary."
pub.1164482719,The “FOREST” Concept and Meta‐Model for Lifecycle Evaluation of Resilience,"This chapter introduces the Framework for Operational Resilience in Engineering and System Test (FOREST), a comprehensive approach to enhancing cyber resilience as part of system development and testing. This methodology is applicable to any system‐level resilience concerns, not just cybersecurity. Resilience is a critical aspect of a system's functionality and thus requires a systematic evaluation of the system's various components under attack or disruption. This evaluation leads to the development of functional requirements and functional views of cyber resilience processes, expressed in a model‐based systems engineering tool. The methodology consists of two main components: the FOREST meta‐process model and Mission Aware, a reference architecture meta‐model. These elements are used in the decision‐making process for security and related resilience in capability development, utilizing a standard risk‐based approach for cybersecurity requirements development. The chapter provides a detailed explanation of the methodology, while a later chapter in this cluster showcases its application in a case study of a hypothetical weapon system called “Silverfish.” FOREST can help engineers enhance the resilience of their systems and improve their ability to withstand cyberattacks and disruptions."
pub.1145748228,Metalearning for Hyperparameter Optimization,"This chapter describes various approaches for the hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problems (CASH). It starts by presenting some basic hyperparameter optimization methods, including grid search, random search, racing strategies, successive halving and hyperband. Next, it discusses Bayesian optimization, a technique that learns from the observed performance of previously tried hyperparameter settings on the current task. This knowledge is used to build a meta-model (surrogate model) that can be used to predict which unseen configurations may work better on that task. This part includes the description sequential model-based optimization (SMBO). This chapter also covers metalearning techniques that extend the previously discussed optimization techniques with the ability to transfer knowledge across tasks. This includes techniques such as warm-starting the search, or transferring previously learned meta-models that were trained on prior (similar) tasks. A key question here is how to establish how similar prior tasks are to the new task. This can be done on the basis of past experiments, but can also exploit the information gained from recent experiments on the target task. This chapter presents an overview of some recent methods proposed in this area."
pub.1172266101,Graphical Specification of Sensitive Business Processes,"This paper aims at developing a new BPMN extension, called “BPMN4SBP”, supporting the multi-dimensional modeling of Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs) (i.e., the knowledge, functional, organizational, behavioral, informational and intentional dimensions). It aims to explicitly integrate all the relevant issues and aspects relevant at the coupling of the business process modeling (BPM) domain and the knowledge management (KM) domain for improving the identification and management of crucial knowledge which are mobilized and created by these processes. This paper provides the analysis of requirements and relevant concepts for modeling SBP. Based on a core domain ontology, need for extension is identified and the valid BPMN4SBP extension is designed (according to the BPMN extension mechanism) by the construction of a conceptional domain model and the corresponding BPMN extension model. This extended BPMN4SBP meta-model is derived by applying model transformation rules and by adapting, also, the UML profile mechanism to BPMN. The applicability of the proposed BPMN extension is demonstrated by modeling an SBP in a real case study in the healthcare domain."

Specifically the gap between business requirements and the realized Web application should be closed. This paper presents the development of a modeling tool for the automated configuration of Web Content Management Systems (WCM) which aims to reduce the complexity and increase the transparency of implementations. It allows business users to configure the business processes without technical support. We combine fragments of existing Web Engineering methods and specify an abstract and concrete syntax based on a domain model and end user analysis. The resulting WebForm Diagram has been implemented in a prototype and validated by subject matter experts. This research is part of a project to develop the Web Engineering Method (WEM) which provides an overall method towards a full coverage of the specification, design, realization, implementation and maintenance of WCM-based Web applications."
pub.1010063608,AOMD approach for context-adaptable and conflict-free Web services composition,"BPEL or Business Process Execution Language is so far the most important standard language for effective composition of Web services. However, like most available process orchestration engines, BPEL does not provide automated support for reacting according to many changes that are likely to arise in any Web services composition, like downtime services, modifications in the business logic or even new policies to govern the composition. Also low-level specification of these new changes, which would be integrated at runtime in the BPEL process, will be far from being used conveniently. Moreover, the complexity of interaction in composite Web services and the diversity of rules and policies can lead to critical behavioral conflicts. We propose in this paper AOMD, a novel aspect-oriented and model driven approach that defines new grammar to address both adaptability and behavioral conflicts problems, and offers extension for WS-BPEL meta-model for high level specification of aspects. Further, we formally verify our proposition and we present real life case study, examples and experimental results that demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our work."
pub.1134389085,Building adaptive context-aware service-based smart systems,"Existing smart systems tend to be domain specific and developed end-to-end in an ad hoc manner and thus tend to be time and resource consuming, error prone and hard to interoperate and integrate. The objective of this paper is to provide a method through which the method users can follow a general process model and a uniform set of concepts to define the main elements involved in their targeted smart solution while also thinking about how their system could or should improve, adapt and eventually integrate with other systems. We propose an approach to design smart systems based on the principles of service-oriented computing, context-awareness and adaptability to tackle the previously mentioned issues. The proposed approach, called AS3 (adaptive service-based smart systems), consists of two main contributions. To deal with the interoperability, integration and adaptability issues, we first propose a smart system loop to showcase the capabilities of smart systems, the main concepts in play and their interactions. Then, we propose a method to design smart systems that is supported by a product metamodel and a process model. The application of AS3 on a road security-focused intelligent transport system design and simulation shows its relevance and efficiency in designing adaptive smart systems."

This paper presents an approach that achieves these objectives in a simple way. The approach is currently being implemented in a fairly new enterprise architecture function within an aggressively expanding Telco with promising results. The problem is introduced and a solution including meta model and visual representations is discussed. Early findings are made to the effect that the technique is simple to apply as well as being effective in establishing shared understanding between the EA function, project sponsors, project stakeholders and IT personnel. The technique is explicated with an example that should make it easy for others to replicate in their own setting."
pub.1041088141,Goal-Oriented Analysis and Agent-Based Design of Agile Supply Chain,"In dynamic enterprise environment, it is a pressing problem to reconfigure supply chain swiftly with the formation and dissolution of virtual enterprises. Multiagent technology provides a promising solution to this problem. In this paper, we present the approach for developing agent-based agile supply chain from goal-oriented analysis to agent-based design. To begin with, a meta-model used for the analysis and design of agile supply chain is given, which defines the abstract entities identified in the analysis and design phase as well as their relationship, such as goal, role, activity, rule and agents. In the analysis phase, the goal of supply chain is represented in AND-OR goal graph and then activities, roles and business rules are identified accordingly. In the design phase, roles are late binded (assigned) to agents and thus the analysis model can be reused. Finally, the architecture of multiagent supply chain based on CORBA platform is described."

In our work we developed a framework consisting of meta-models, model transformations and tools that address a consistent support of development and maintenance tasks. As contribution of this article, we present an architecture for generated business logic code as part our infrastructure blueprint.

The management of evolution and change and the ability for database, information and knowledge-based systems to deal with change are an essential component in developing and maintaining truly useful systems. Many approaches to handling evolution and change have been proposed in various areas of data management and this forum seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners both from more established areas and those from emerging areas to look at this issue. The fourth ECDM workshop (the first three ECDM workshops were held with ER 1999 in Paris, France, with ER 2002 in Tampere, Finland, and with ER 2004 in Shanghai, China) dealt with the manner in which change can be handled, and the semantics of evolving data and data structure in computer-based systems, including databases, data warehouses and Web-based information systems."
pub.1019888223,Cross-Organizational Business Processes Modeling Using Design-by-Contract Approach,"Reaching agreements between organizations in a collaborative environment is a way to ensure interoperability between these organizations at all levels. For business processes interoperability this agreement can be reached by well defining the cross-organizational process. However most BPM frameworks have used meta-models centered on flows of activities, with the data manipulated by these activities seen as second-class citizens. For business analysts (for example in complex product design collaborative environments) data plays a major role. In this paper, we propose a methodology backed by a conceptual framework to model the cross-organizational process relying on the product model. This framework defines the evolution of the product model through a finite number of states, and then automatically generates executable artifacts to support the collaboration during run-time phase. This approach is being implemented in the living laboratory provided by EADS in the context of the European project IMAGINE."
pub.1001716464,A Conceptual Foundation of Requirements Engineering for Business Information Systems,"Requirements engineering (RE) is a crucial discipline when developing software systems. Applying RE activities successfully in the domain of business information systems (BIS) requires a deep and common understanding on how concepts of RE and business analysis are related. We consider this fact as being a challenge as currently no commonly accepted RE process exits that bridges the gap between these two disciplines. This results in unclear mappings and finally makes it difficult to align methods that exist in both areas. To tackle this challenge, we propose a reference issue model that aims to capture definitions and relations of the issues that are typically relevant in BIS development. In this context, we describe our followed research approach, an underlying meta-model as well as an exemplary instantiation and usage of the reference issue model. This contribution shall serve as a foundation for the integration of RE and business analysis as well as for the development of corresponding analysis approaches."
pub.1128901533,Multiobjective electric machine optimization for highest reliability demands,"This article is about illustrating a workflow for incorporating reliability measures to typical electric machine design optimization scenarios. Such measures facilitate comparing designs not only for rated conditions, but also allow to analyze their performance in the presence of unevitable tolerances. Consequently, by additionally considering reliability or robustness as objectives compared to conventional optimization scenarios, designs featuring low parameter sensitiveness can be obtained. The analysis of the design's reliability as part of solving optimization problems involves a significant increase in required numerical evaluations. To minimize the associated prolongation of the runtime, an approach featuring a design of experiments based reduction of required computations and a consequent surrogate modeling technique is presented here. After successful training, the metamodel can be applied for fast evaluating lots of different parameter combinations. A test problem is defined and analyzed. Based on the observed findings, the necessity of incorporating robustness evaluations to machine design optimization becomes evident. In addition, the derived models allow for studying the impact of any tolerance-affected parameter on the machine performance in detail. This facilitates further beneficial studies, as for instance the analysis of selected changes of tolerance levels rather than a general minimization of the respective ranges which usually is associated with high production cost."
pub.1160363960,Visual Low-Code Language for Orchestrating Large-Scale Distributed Computing,"Distributed, large-scale computing is typically performed using textual general-purpose programming languages. This requires significant programming skills associated with the parallelisation and distribution of computations. In this paper, we present a visual (graphical) programming language called the Computation Application Language (CAL) to raise abstraction in distributed computing. CAL programs define computation workflows by visualising data flowing between computation units. The goal is to reduce the amount of traditional code needed and thus facilitate development even by non-professional programmers. The language follows the low-code paradigm, i.e. its implementation (the editor and the runtime system) is available online. We formalise the language by defining its syntax using a metamodel and specifying its semantics using a two-step approach. We define a translation of CAL into an intermediate language which is then defined using an operational approach. This formalisation was used to develop a programming and execution environment. The environment orchestrates computations by interpreting the intermediate language and managing the instantiation of computation modules using data tokens. We also present an explanatory case-study example that shows a practical application of the language."

The task was divided into three phases: As Is modeling, Analysis, and To Be Planning. As part of this effort, a team has completed the first Phase I of the modeling task and is nearing completion of the second phase. This effort will capture the key elements as requirements, responsibilities, allocations, roles, products, and associated lifecycle elements.

pub.1113643973,A Multi-criteria Evaluation Approach for Selecting a Sensitive Business Process Modeling Language for Knowledge Management,"In an organizational context, the modeling and representation of sensitive business processes (SBPs) have become an effective way of managing and developing organization’s knowledge that needs to be capitalized. These processes are characterized by a high complexity and dynamism in their execution, high number of critical activities with intensive acquisition, sharing, storage and (re)use of very specific crucial knowledge, large diversity of heterogeneous knowledge and information sources, high number of knowledge conversion actions and high degree of collaboration among experts. Thus, the specification of a precise conceptualization for SBPs, and the selection of an appropriate SBP modeling language that adequately characterizes and integrates all their relevant dimensions are of prime importance. We aim at improving the localization and identification of the crucial knowledge that are mobilized by and created by these processes. This paper proposes a multi-criteria-based approach for evaluating and comparing currently widely used modeling languages (process oriented and knowledge oriented) for the representation of SBPs, taking into account their specific modeling requirements. We consider guiding and justifying the choice of the most suitable SBP modeling language for knowledge identification purposes. The different modeling languages are originally assessed according to the ontological completeness of SBP modeling aspects (i.e., the coverage of the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge dimensions) based on the BPM4KI meta-model (as an SBP specification based on core ontologies). Secondly, they are evaluated according to several key requirement indicators (e.g., understandability, expressibility, complexity, level of adoption, tools availability and extendibility). Results show that none of the studied languages, individually, satisfies all the SBP modeling requirements. In this study, we choose the better one positioned nowadays, BPMN 2.0, as the best suited standard for SBP representation. Moreover, we develop a valid extension of BPMN 2.0 «BPMN4SBP» for integrating and implementing all relevant SBP modeling dimensions (the six BPM4KI dimensions), exploring the dynamic, interaction and knowledge aspects. The extension is then used to illustrate the representation of SBPs in a real case study in the healthcare domain."
pub.1129371960,Design and Execution of Integrated Clinical Pathway: A Simplified Meta-Model and Associated Methodology,"Integrated clinical pathways (ICPs) are task-oriented care plans detailing the essential steps of the therapeutic pathway referring to a specific clinical problem with a patient’s expected clinical course. ICPs represent an effective tool for resource management in the public and private health domains. To be automatically executed, the ICP process has to be described by means of complex general purpose description language (GPDL) formalisms. However, GPDLs make the process model difficult to grasp by a human. On the other hand, the adoption of a reduced set of graphical constructs prevents a fully automated process execution due to the lack of information required by a machine. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a balance between modelling language expressiveness and the automated execution of the modelled processes. In this paper, we present a meta-model based on a GPDL to organize the ICP process knowledge. This meta-model allows the management of ICP information in a way that is independent from the graphic representation of the adopted modelling standard. We also propose a general framework and a methodology that aim to guarantee a high degree of automation in process execution. In particular, the corresponding execution engine is implemented as a chatbot (integrated with social media), which plays a two-fold role: during the actual execution of the entire ICP, it acts as a virtual assistant and gathers the patient’s health data. Tests performed on a real ICP showed that, thanks to the proposed solution, the chatbot engine is able to engage in a dialogue with the patient. We provide discussion about how the system could be extended and how it could be seen as an alternative to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based approaches."
pub.1174248141,Fundamentals of Business Architecture Modeling,"This textbook covers business architecture modeling in all its essential aspects. Based on the MMABP Philosophical Framework for Business System Modelling it provides a comprehensive overview of four basic dimensions of the business system model together with their essential relationships. The methods, techniques, and tools are described and explained for every model type with examples. Special attention is paid to integrating all dimensions using the Business System Consistency Framework. The book is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 introduces business architecture and the approaches and tools to model it. MMABP is introduced with its basic principles and put in context with other approaches to business architecture modeling. Chapter 2 then deals with the modeling of a business system in terms of its objectives. The basic principles of process modeling, the distinction between global and detailed views of processes, and an approach to managing the detail of the process model in the form of four levels of process abstraction are introduced. Chapter 3 describes the modeling of a business system in terms of its underlying concepts and the business rules that apply within the modeled system. The basic principles of object modeling, the distinction between global and detailed views of objects, and the approach to capturing the object life cycles are introduced. Chapter 4 presents a simplified metamodel that describes how all models of the business system are related, and consistency rules that guide the analysts to avoid possible inconsistencies. Chapter 5 focuses on the implementation of the business system in an organization. It describes the role and specifics of its information system, explains the comprehensive procedure for building the process-driven organization, and reflects on the organizational maturity and its role in the further development of a process-driven organization. Eventually, Chapter 6 presents a complex example of the application of MMABP, including the functioning prototype of the process system. The prototype is then used to illustrate an essential difference between the conceptual and technology levels of models, and the importance of distinguishing between them. This textbook is written for students in enterprise architecture or business information systems as well as for professionals developing enterprise information systems or process-driven organizations."
pub.1164594930,An AI-Driven Multiwell Placement and Scheduling Method,"Abstract Well placement optimization is important for informed field investment decisions. Numerical simulation models are usually utilized for well placement optimization, as they offer a detailed account of subsurface reservoirs. However, a full loop optimization using numerical simulation models makes this process intractable. Instead, many assets and reservoir engineers follow heuristic or trial-and-error approaches, leading to suboptimal results. This paper introduces a novel method for well placement optimization and scheduling based on AI-proxy models. Our approach relies on generating an Ensemble of simulation runs (100s-1000s), varying field-level and well configuration parameters. We follow a loosely coupled process to solve the field control parameters and well placement optimization problems. Output data from the field, well and completion levels are collected automatically from the simulation models. Thereafter, several Machine Learning (ML) meta-models are trained to predict field-level production, well drilling and abandonment schedules, and the performance of production and injection wells. The outcome is selected well trajectories based on opportunity maps generated using the meta-models. The new workflow was first tested on a synthetic reservoir model. A sensitivity study of 275 simulation cases was performed varying reservoir management and well configuration parameters. It was observed that although the petrophysical properties such as rock quality and hydrocarbon saturations were not part of the ML model training, they were well reflected in the opportunity maps. This provided assurance that the model captures the basic static and dynamic controls on well performance. The model accuracy was improved further by adding features such as the perforation top depth. Additional drilling constraints, such as the presence of large faults, had to be considered to ensure the validity of the optimized well locations. The best simulation case from the sensitivity study was selected based on specific economic factors and adopted as a comparison base case for the new well optimization method. The original wells were replaced with an optimized set of well obtained with our deep learning and optimization workflow. This resulted in a 10% increase in total oil production combined with 50% decrease in the amount of water production. Modern cloud/local computational resources can expedite full-loop optimization processes. However, both computation efficiency and elasticity do not address the iterative nature of classic well optimization methods. The method presented in this paper attempts further speedup by leveraging ML."

                    Purpose
                    The purpose of this paper is to focus on assessing individuals’ problems in learning groups/teams and should lead to the assessment of the group/team itself as a learning entity.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    In this paper, an extension of the IMS-Learning Design (IMS-LD) meta-model is proposed in order to support the assessment of collaborative activities in e-learning. Besides, the software architecture which consists of a set of components forming a web wizard to create, track and assess the collaborative assessment processes is described as to support that extension of the IMS-LD meta-model.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    With the proposed solution we can: make assessment fairer using individual and collective assessment indicators to assign final scores to learners; make an assessment step by step for better individual and collective monitoring activities; and divide the assessment into lighter phases for the correctors. Consequently, the evaluator will have more detailed information about his/her students and the quality of judgment will be better. This could also be useful for the evaluator in order to plan further examinations.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    Further experimentations are necessary to test the effectiveness of the proposed system in order to analyze its performances under a massive usage. In addition, the authors plan to use a survey to collect learners’ opinions to know the effectiveness of the proposal in terms of fairness in the assessment of collaborative activities in an online community.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    This paper addresses important issues in the educational area, especially assessment of collaborative activities. In fact, to reduce subjectivity and increase fairness in assessing learners in collaborative work, for example, using the peer assessment, in order to try reducing subjectivity and fairly assessing learners. However, while assessing group work, the same mark is attributed for all group members and authors have concluded that it is not the right approach to make a fair and more objective assessment.

pub.1014256454,FlexSPMF: A Framework for Modelling and Learning Flexibility in Software Processes,"Software processes are dynamic entities that are often changed and evolved by skillful knowledge workers such as software development team members. Consequently, flexibility is one of the most important features within software process representations and related tools. However, in the everyday practice, team members do not wish for total flexibility. They rather prefer to learn about and follow previously defined advices on which, where and how they can change/adapt process representations. In this paper we present FlexSPMF: a framework for modelling controlled flexibility in software processes. It comprises three main contributions: 1) identifying a core set of flexibility concepts; 2) extending a Process Modelling Language (PML)’s metamodel with these concepts; and 3) providing modelling resources to this extended PML. This enables process engineers to define and publish software process models with additional (textual/graphical) flexibility information. Other team members can then visualise and learn about this information, and change processes accordingly."
pub.1011948336,DOTS: A Generic Infrastructure for Decision-Oriented Collaborative Task Support,"This paper describes a generic infrastructure for supporting decisionoriented collaborative tasks, i..e., structured tasks in which argumentation and decision are important aspects (e.g., brainstorming, document outlining, review/inspection, conceptual map co-design, confrontation/merging of viewpoints). Basically, the system aims at supporting asynchronous work, but can also support “occasionally synchronous” work. The approach is mainly based on fine-grain modeling of decision-oriented collaborative tasks and the use of different assistance techniques: guidance (i.e., task performance assistance), argumentative reasoning, group awareness. The paper describes the project objectives, the conceptual meta model, the task modeling language, and the current java prototype. This work is a first step in a strategy for the “conceptual integration” of different kinds of cooperation support through an extended modeling framework that should merge coarse-grain modeling of workflow management systems and fine-grain modeling as described here."
pub.1009865244,Towards an Architecture for Collaborative Cross–Organizational Security Requirements Management,"Organizations increasingly adopt or consider adopting external services hoping for higher flexibility and reduced costs. However, currently existing deficiencies of processes and tools force service consumers to renounce from the expected advantages and to trade off profitability against security. These security and compliance concerns are predominately due to negligence or manual resolution of security policy and configuration dependencies, caused by distinct terminologies, languages and tools used at both the service provider and service customer. To overcome these kind of problems in the collaborative cross–organizational security management, we have developed CoSeRMaS, a collaborative and semi–automated tool to manage, define and validate inter- and cross–organizational security requirements. This paper introduces the CoSeRMaS prototype and gives an overview of the features that have been developed."
pub.1119365305,GPfit: An R package for Gaussian Process Model Fitting using a New Optimization Algorithm,"Gaussian process (GP) models are commonly used statistical metamodels for
emulating expensive computer simulators. Fitting a GP model can be numerically
unstable if any pair of design points in the input space are close together.
Ranjan, Haynes, and Karsten (2011) proposed a computationally stable approach
for fitting GP models to deterministic computer simulators. They used a genetic
algorithm based approach that is robust but computationally intensive for
maximizing the likelihood. This paper implements a slightly modified version of
the model proposed by Ranjan et al. (2011), as the new R package GPfit. A novel
parameterization of the spatial correlation function and a new multi-start
gradient based optimization algorithm yield optimization that is robust and
typically faster than the genetic algorithm based approach. We present two
examples with R codes to illustrate the usage of the main functions in GPfit.
Several test functions are used for performance comparison with a popular R
package mlegp. GPfit is a free software and distributed under the general
public license, as part of the R software project (R Development Core Team
2012)."

Previous studies have not adequately established the Safety-oriented Process Lines (SoPLs). This paper focuses on the seamless integration between Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) Composer and Base Variability Resolution (BVR) Tool. The former supports the major parts of the OMG's Software & Systems Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) Version 2.0, while the latter is a simplification and enhancement of the OMG's revised submission of Common Variability Language (CVL). The proposed integration is implemented as Eclipse plugin. It provides support for importing backend folders and files within the method library of EPF Composer, resolving problems with the files for variability management with the BVR Tool, and exporting back the resolved process models to the EPF Composer. The applicability of the implemented plugin is demonstrated by engineering an ECSS-E-ST-40C compliant SoPL for the space projects and applications."
pub.1137254212,Interference fit estimation through stress-stiffening effect on dynamics,"This paper proposes a method to estimate applied fitting force and interference between two press-fitted components by exploiting the stress stiffening effect on the dynamics of components before and after press-fit. Differently from specific solutions in literature, the proposed approach is independent of component dimensional characteristics, geometrical complexity and uncertainties, and is based on experimental data only. Moreover, it is non-destructive and easily embeddable in an industrial quality control workflow. The core of the activity is the development of a ranking strategy of the natural frequencies most affected by stress stiffening effect based on modal assurance criterion. To prove the effectiveness of the selection approach, interference polynomial chaos expansion meta-models based on best ranked natural frequencies are developed and compared to established analytical models and finite element solutions. Also, the reliability of the methodology is tested against an industrial case study i.e. press-fitted automotive steel wheel samples."

(1) Background: can rules help to discover hidden connections between data? We propose a separated implementation of decision rules on data about fixed assets for decision support. This will enhance search results. (2) Methods and technical workflow: We used DROOLS (Decision Rules Object Oriented System) to implement decision rules on the subject of accounting decisions on fixed assets; (3) Results: Making the model involves: the existence of a domain ontology and an ontology for the developed application; the possibility of executing specified inferences; the possibility of extracting information from a database; the possibility of simulations, predictions; the possibility of addressing fuzzy questions; and (4) Conclusions: The rules, the plans, and the business models must be implemented to allow specification of control over concepts. The editing of meta models must be directed to the user to ensure adaptation and not implemented at the level of control of the data control."
pub.1094439725,An Avatar-Based Adaptation Workflow for the Web of Things,"The Web of Things (WoT) extends the Internet of Things to provide users with high-level features, involving physical objects connected through Web technologies and standards. Avatar-based infrastructures is one of the most promising solution for the WoT. Avatars are component-based software agents that extend physical objects and are able to reason about contextual information. A major challenge of the WoT is to allow applications to adapt to their environment. In this paper, we propose an approach to process multi-purpose adaptation in an avatar-based WoT infrastructure. Our approach relies on a context meta-model that offers accurate granularity levels of information required for the different types of adaptation involved in WoT applications. We show how avatar components pre-process data from different sources, handle an operational context model, and respond to adaptation requests. We evaluate the performance of our approach and compare the effects of our adaptation process in different experimental conditions."
pub.1043016786,Probabilistic design approach to build the litheness in an integrated process scheme,"Flexibility in manufacturing processes is essential not only to handle a variety of feed stocks or to produce multiple product grades but also to accommodate process or catalyst inventions to improve productivity or quality. While designing in litheness we should ensure the robustness of the process output. In this paper, through a case study of biodiesel manufacturing, we summarize a novel technique which uses a probabilistic design approach using meta-models to evaluate the process intensification/integration scheme in a bio-refinery context.In our methodology first we develop individual process models for a number of processes intensification alternatives where waste or non-edible vegetable oil are converted to biodiesel. These alternatives include the use of reactive distillation and a supercritical process. We integrate these process intensification schemes along with other necessary process steps to establish a plausible manufacturing process. Simultaneously we formulate high fidelity meta-models to describe the various responses of the reactive distillation column w.r.t the changes in the process conditions (or decision variables) in a given design space as an example. This simplification allows us to setup a probabilistic design using commercially available meta-heuristic optimization tools."
pub.1149234282,Framework for Operational Resilience in Engineering and System Test (FOREST) Part I: Methodology – Responding to “Security as a Functional Requirement”,"ABSTRACT An end‐to‐end methodology for addressing cyber resilience as a development and test philosophy in a system is described. Although focused on cybersecurity, the methodology applies to any resilience concerns and features of a system. Resilience is a functional characteristic of a system, requiring a process to evaluate the function of different aspects of a system under attack or disruption. The result of this process is a set of functional requirements and functional views of cyber resilience processes in a model‐based systems engineering tool. The methodology consists of a meta‐process model called the Framework for Operational Resilience in Engineering and System Test (FOREST) and a reference architecture metamodel called Mission Aware. In practice these are used to make security and related resilience decisions in capability development using a standard, risk‐based approach for cybersecurity requirements development. Part I of this article describes the methodology and Part II presents its use in a case study of a fictional weapon system called Silverfish."
pub.1099642223,A space mapping method based on Gaussian process model for variable fidelity metamodeling," Computational simulation models with different fidelities are usually available in the design of engineering products for obtaining the quantity of interest (QOI). To integrate and fully exploit variable fidelity information, a space mapping based variable-fidelity metamodeling (VFM) approach is developed in this work. Firstly, a Gaussian process (GP) model is constructed for the low-fidelity (LF) model. Secondly, a variable-fidelity metamodel is constructed by taking the predicted information from this GP model as a prior-knowledge of the QOI and directly mapped into the outputs space of the high-fidelity (HF) model. This space mapping process is performed by constructing another GP model. A mathematic example is first adopted for illustrating how the proposed approach works under different sample sizes and sample noises. Then, the proposed approach is applied to two real-life cases, modeling of the maximum stress for the structure of a Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) catamaran and predicting weld geometry in fiber laser keyhole welding, to illustrate its ability in support of complex engineering design."
pub.1002079877,UML4SPM,"In the context of Model Driven Development, models play a central role. Since models can nowadays be executed, they are used not only for description but also for production [32][30][24]. In the field of software process modelling, the current version of the OMG SPEM standard (ver1.1) has not yet reached the level required for the specification of executable models. The purpose of SPEM1.1 was limited at providing process descriptions to be read by humans and to be supported by tools, but not to be executed. Therefore, the OMG issued a new RFP in order to improve SPEM1.1 [35]. Since we intend to participate in the next major revision of SPEM, namely SPEM2.0, in this work, we: 1) compare SPEM1.1 both with primary process model elements (i.e. Activity, Product, Role,...) and with basic requirements that any Process Modelling Language should support (i.e. expressiveness, understandability, executability,...); 2) identify its major limitations and advantages and 3) propose a new UML2.0-based metamodel for software process modelling named: UML4SPM. It extends a subset of UML2.0 concepts – with no impact on the standard – in order to fit software process modelling."
pub.1049885533,An Advanced Generation Model for a Security Data Warehouse,"With all the modernistic web based tools available today, it is ironic that managing a security program in an organization is often relegated to a paper-pencil exercise using outdated information, with an on-going guessing game as to the status and inventory of installed controls, equipment configurations etc. Tracking the incessant onslaught of security breach attempts occurring at an ever increasing pace often is a nightmare. A Fact Based model along with a process model is presented here as a candidate for security information to be contained in a BI-style security Data Warehouse, detailing the primary facts and artifacts of an organization’s security program framework and security strategy. The model enables one to draw intelligence from security events, current state of security management and training, risk communication, security architecture and administration controls in place, standards being followed etc., and essentially promotes the concept of availability of security intelligence—data warehouse style."
pub.1033461938,Automatic reuse of process patterns in process modeling,"Process pattern concept was proposed as a promising approach to reuse process knowledge. However, their general and practical use has been handicapped by the lack of formalization and supporting tools. In order to facilitate process patterns reuse, we aim at an (semi)automatic approach that can assure correct patterns' applications and reduce process modeling time. In our previous works, we developed a UML-based meta-model allowing pattern-based process modeling. In this paper, we present a set of reuse operators that enable automatic applications of process patterns for generating and (re)structuring process models. These operators are defined with operational semantics and implemented in a prototype of pattern-based process modeling tool."

pub.1111519298,Alignment of Business Processes and Requirements Through Model Integration,"Business process and requirement specification are crucial phases in the software development process. Yet, business and requirement modeling are often carried out separately by different languages and design teams, leading to misaligned models. The degree of misalignment grows continuously with their independent evolution. Thus, the potential of model-driven software development cannot be fully exploited. There is a considerable agreement among researchers about the integration technique roles to bridge the gap between heterogeneous models. Therefore, this approach is based on this technique to align the business world represented by BPMN and the software requirement world represented by the UML use case. We define an integrated meta-model that incorporates all BPMN and use case elements as well as new others to map traceable elements. Further, we define a new diagram that provides a means to visualize and combines their use within an integrated model. Our approach supplements CASE tools with additional information and relationships to maintain the global system consistency. To illustrate it, we implement an editor for designing the proposed diagram, and we apply it in a topical case study."
pub.1132125307,A Version and Context-Based Approach to Easily Model Flexible Collaborative Processes,"Process flexibility has been investigated for intra-organizational processes, but it is still an open issue for collaborative processes (CP), each of which is defined as a set of intra-organizational processes that interact together. In the literature, the version-based approach is largely used in the field of business process management (BPM) to cope with process flexibility. However, BPM practitioners can face difficulties in a multi-version environment. So, the following questions arise: How can we use the version-based approach to easily model flexible CP? Does an appropriate version exist for a given situation or is it necessary to create a new one? The chapter answers these questions recommending a solution for the modeling of CP versions and the retrieval of the adequate CP version for a given situation. This solution comprises (1) a meta-model to consider the modeling of the CP versions, (2) an ontology-based approach to model and query the context of use of CP versions, and (3) a framework to provide support for both the modeling of CP versions and the context querying."
pub.1062983790,MODEL FOR INTEGRATED MONITORING OF BPEL BUSINESS PROCESSES,"Business process execution language (BPEL) does not provide a native support for defining data and metrics, required to perform business activity monitoring (BAM). Existing industry solutions are vendor-specific while platform-independent scientific approaches separate tightly coupled monitoring definitions from the core BPEL processes into external descriptors, thus increasing the complexity of the development, packaging and deployment processes. Furthermore, existing monitoring solutions reuse platform-specific audit trail events. This requires monitor model developers to be familiar with the details of the process implementation and the custom BPEL engine meta-model. To overcome these issues, this paper presents bpelx4bam — a new approach to defining monitoring data and metrics within BPEL processes, based on BPEL extensions. The bpelx4bam promotes these definitions into the first class citizens of the BPEL specification in order to unify and fully integrate BAM into the BPM lifecycle. It enables a cross-platform migration of BAM-enabled business processes, removes the need for separate models and specifications, eases development, packaging and deployment processes, aligns the separation of concerns with actual process roles and introduces BAM-specific and optimized events. Therefore, it presents a solid ground for a future specification or a standard in this area."

pub.1046124960,Conceptual Modeling Method for Separation of Concerns and Integration of Structure and Behavior,"<p>Identification of discontinuities, separation of concerns, and dealing with the evolutionary changes of requirements is difficult in conceptual modeling. The limited human mind allows focusing on one particular requirement at a time in isolation. One fundamental problem is that all conventional conceptual modeling techniques deal with collections of loosely linked meta-models, which are defined by different types of diagrams. Typically, system development methods project interactive, behavioral, and structural aspects of information systems’ conceptual representations into disparate views. Therefore, the semantic integrity of various architecture dimensions is difficult to achieve. The difficulties stem from the paradigmatic mismatch between static and dynamic constructs. The advantage of the conceptual modeling approach presented in this paper is flexibility. It is demonstrated by case study examples that sequential, underlying, enclosing, overriding, and overlaying interaction loops between actors provide the foundation for the composition of complex scenarios, which span across organizational and technical system boundaries. The presented semantic integration and system decomposition principles target business process modeling experts and information system designers, because they are essential for introducing evolutionary changes and managing complexity of information system conceptualizations.</p>"
pub.1011614242,A Language Oriented Extension to Toulmin’s Argumentation Model for Conceptual Modelling,"The constructive step of modelling must account for the specific requirements of various stakeholders. Further, the quality of a model in terms of goodness-of-fit, completeness or other aspects may vary, because of future, as yet unknown, requirements. Natural language underpins the process of modelling as it is the predominant form through which models are acquired, negotiated and agreed. Whilst a model defines system requirements, it does not capture the assumptions, discussions and negotiations that led to the requirements. The ability to access this information, which is lost by most development processes, may significantly improve the utility of models with respect to changing requirements and system maintenance. This paper proposes a form of ‘literate modelling’ that can be used to capture the steps in model development and is based on Toulmin’s Argumentation model. The paper contributes the design of an argumentation modelling language and a set of rules for integrating multiple languages (or domains) with the Toulmin approach. The language and approach is applied to the domain of business process modelling."
pub.1009135259,IMSF: Infinite Methodology Set Framework,"Software development is usually an integration task in enterprise environment - few software applications work autonomously now. It is usually a collaboration of heterogeneous and unstable teams. One serious problem is lack of resources, a popular result being outsourcing, ‘body shopping’, and indirectly team and team member fluctuation. Outsourced sub-deliveries easily become black boxes with no clear development method used, which has a negative impact on supportability. Such environments then often face the problems of quality assurance and enterprise know-how management. The used methodology is one of the key factors. Each methodology was created as a generalization of a number of solved projects, and each methodology is thus more or less connected with a set of task types. When the task type is not suitable, it causes problems that usually result in an undocumented ad-hoc solution. This was the motivation behind formalizing a simple process for collaborative software engineering. Infinite Methodology Set Framework (IMSF) defines the ICT business process of adaptive use of methods for classified types of tasks. The article introduces IMSF and briefly comments its meta-model."
pub.1041858965,A ONCE-Updating Approach on Moving Objects,"Indexing methods that manage current states of moving objects in a database are confronted with keeping their indexes up to date. Numerous objects that move continuously can invoke many their updates at a time constantly. R-tree based indexing methods promise to be efficient and easy to be implemented and deployed to real applications. Nevertheless, recent updating improvements for R-tree have been not either designed or appropriate to a moving object environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a ONCE-Updating approach applied for indexing methods developed from the R-tree. The idea is that instead of incurring the high cost of updating an indexed data on many new states at a timestamp one by one, an indexing method can easily update the data on all the states just once. In our experiments, in addition to much improving update performance, the approach even increases quality of queries extracted from indexed data. This approach can be used to support methods managing data from traffic surveillance systems."
pub.1175867065,Monte Carlo Workflow Unification for Nuclear Reactor Analysis with Metamodel-Driven Modeling,"Monte Carlo (MC) transport codes are a cornerstone of nuclear reactor analysis frameworks, providing reference solutions and multigroup cross sections, and even as core components in multiphysics couplings. These applications can be seen in toolkits from the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation program and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s BlueCRAB (Comprehensive Reactor Analysis Bundle). Contrary to their ubiquitousness in reactor physics modeling and simulation, popular MC codes, such as MCNP, Serpent, and KENO, are still reliant on antiquated textual input formats. These input languages use a plethora of keywords with terse syntax to specify all facets of a model, including its geometry, materials, physics settings, and tally options. This poses a steep learning curve and a poor user experience. Being tied to unique text-based input formats also significantly complicates programmatic input generation or modification that may be desired and/or required within a multiphysics framework. This work demonstrates how the development of programmatic interfaces for MC codes can support model unification and translation activities. Building on the Python application program interface (API) development of MCNPy, similar capabilities are being implemented for Serpent that are able to support model translation. In future work, the Serpent API capabilities will be made more robust and the work will be further expanded to include translations with KENO."
pub.1167343222,Automotive Software Security Engineering based on the ISO 21434,"The increasing use of software and connectivity in modern vehicles has made cybersecurity an important issue in the automotive industry. ISO 21434 is a standard for automotive cybersecurity engineering that provides guidelines for the development and validation of secure automotive systems. For effective implementation and practical use of ISO 21434, it must be incorporated into existing automotive industry development workflows. In this paper, we investigate the practical applicability of ISO 21434 in the context of the Security Abstraction Model (SAM), a security modeling approach for the domain-specific modeling language EAST-ADL, and provide insights into the benefits and consequences of this approach. In doing so, we describe the methodological opportunities of integrating ISO 21434 into SAM on the one hand and present a case study illustrating the application of this integrated approach in the development of a secure automotive system on the other hand. Our results suggest that the integration of ISO 21434 into SAM better supports automotive system security in the early development phases and makes it transparent to a wide range of stakeholders. At the same time, it becomes clear that a representation of the interrelationships in the form of a metamodel, in contrast to ISO 21434 in which these are only described textually, significantly improves conceptual understanding and ultimately enables pragmatic usability in industrial development."
pub.1142447771,A Proposal for a Software Tool to Perform Business Process Smart Assessment in Enterprises,"The challenges faced by enterprises on a daily basis such as regulatory compliance, novel technology adoption, or cost optimisation, foster them to implement improvement initiatives. As a first step towards the implementation of those initiatives, there is a need to perform assessments to understand the As-Is state of the enterprise considering different aspects such as maturity, agility, performance, or readiness towards digitisation. However, assessments are expensive in terms of time and resources. Specifically when considering qualitative appraisals, such as maturity or capability assessments, since they often demand the participation of one or more human assessors to review documents, perform interviews, etc. Therefore, means to automate or semi-automate the assessment process are essential, since they could reduce the effort to perform it. In this sense, this work introduces a software tool to support assessments in enterprises using text data as assessment evidence. The tool is developed following a conceptual framework named Smart Assessment Framework, which introduces a metamodel with abstract components to be instantiated for the development of systems dedicated to organisational assessments. The elements defined by the framework are grounded on the capabilities of smart systems. The application domain of the tool is focused on Process Capability assessment, in compliance with the ISO/IEC 33020:2015 international standard. The tool uses a Natural Language Processing method to process the assessment evidence and an Ontology as Knowledge Base to support the calculation of capability levels and to provide improvement recommendations."
pub.1145748214,Introduction,"This chapter starts by describing the organization of the book, which consists of three parts. Part I discusses some basic concepts, including, for instance, what metalearning is and how it is related to automatic machine learning (AutoML). This continues with a presentation of the basic architecture of metalearning/AutoML systems, discussion of systems that exploit algorithm selection using prior metadata, methodology used in their evaluation, and different types of meta-level models, while mentioning the respective chapters where more details can be found. This part also includes discussion of methods used for hyperparameter optimization and workflow design. Part II includes the discussion of more advanced techniques and methods. The first chapter discusses the problem of setting up configuration spaces and conducting experiments. Subsequent chapters discuss different types of ensembles, metalearning in ensemble methods, algorithms used for data streams and transfer of meta-models across tasks. One chapter is dedicated to metalearning for deep neural networks. The last two chapters discuss the problem of automating various data science tasks and trying to design systems that are more complex. Part III is relatively short. It discusses repositories of metadata (including experimental results) and exemplifies what can be learned from this metadata by giving illustrative examples. The final chapter presents concluding remarks."
pub.1156453307,Optimization of machine learning approaches for shale gas production forecast,"Successful production from shale gas formations has changed the energy outlook of North America. During such process, a significant amount of data related to production and operations has been accumulated, which can be analyzed with machine learning (ML) techniques for production forecasts and performance optimization. In this study, an optimization workflow is proposed for production forecast in shale gas reservoirs, focusing on mitigating the overfitting problem while maximizing its accuracy. More specifically, a new objective function is developed where a penalty term is added to mitigate the model's overfitting tendency. The kernel density estimate (KDE) method guarantees that a similar distribution is shared between the split training and testing subsets. Four machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Random Forest, are utilized and further optimized by the sparrow search algorithm with the newly developed objective function. A stacking approach is finally established based on the optimized algorithm and selected meta-models. Results show that the R2 of all four models has increased to around 0.9 after the optimization process, where XGBoost and LightGBM perform slightly better than the rest. In addition, R2 of the training dataset for XGBoost was decreased from 0.999 to 0.937, while the R2 for the testing dataset was increased from 0.762 to 0.905. This indicates that the overfitting has been mitigated after the optimization with the gap between the training and testing datasets reduced from 0.237 to 0.032. Moreover, stacking the optimized ML algorithms can not further enhance its accuracy. The best performer with SVM as the meta-model can only increase the R2 to 0.910, yet the model complexity increases significantly."

A large amount of production and operational data have been collected in such an exploitation process, where machine learning approaches can be potentially utilized for production forecast and performance optimization. However, these approaches usually suffer from overfitting of the training dataset. In this study, an optimization workflow is proposed for production forecast in shale gas reservoirs, focusing on mitigating the overfitting problem while maximizing its accuracy. More specifically, a new objective function is developed where a penalty term is added to represent the model’s overfitting tendency. The kernel density estimate (KDE) method guarantees that a similar distribution is shared between the split training and testing subsets. Four machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Random Forest, are utilized and further optimized by the sparrow search algorithm with the newly developed objective function.

Results show that the R 2 of all four models has increased to around 0.9 after the optimization process, where XGBoost and LightGBM perform slightly better than the rest. In addition, the R 2 of the training dataset of XGBoost is as high as 0.999, indicating a solid overfitting issue. Such value is reduced to 0.937 after the optimization, while its testing R 2 is further increased from 0.761 to 0.905. Moreover, stacking the optimized ML algorithms can not further enhance its accuracy.

pub.1094022980,Design of Rules for Transforming UML Sequence Diagrams into Java code,"UML is a modeling language that most developers employed during design phase. UML provides various types of diagrams used for specifying both the structure and the behavior of systems. During the development process, models specified by these diagrams are eventually transformed into corresponding code. Although there are many researches studied about transforming UML models into code, they discussed mainly about class, state and collaboration diagrams. None proposed about rules for transforming UML sequence diagrams into a corresponding code. This paper proposes a transformation approach for transforming UML sequence and class diagrams into Java code. The transformation approach consists of a meta model for sequence diagram and transformation rules. The proposed approach is evaluated by applying to at least 3 applications."
pub.1097223983,Construction Process Simulation of Multiple Interdependent Processes,"The construction of built facilities involves multiple complex and interdependent processes. To improve both the construction process and the performance of the completed facilities, innovative designs and technologies are constantly being developed and introduced into the design and construction industry. However, the uncertainty associated with the implementation and performance of the innovations, particularly with respect to other components, processes, or systems, often creates insurmountable barriers for the effective use and diffusion of these innovations. Current research at MIT by Prof. Slaughter and her research team has developed system and material-specific dynamic process simulation models of specific construction activities as a basis to analyze the impacts of design and technology innovations. As an extension of this research, the ""meta-models"" explicitly link the system-specific process models to represent the interdependent processes required to construct a complete facility, to assess the overall project impacts of innovations. The ""meta-models"" provide a context in which the state of each construction process is tracked and acts as a trigger for the performance of specific tasks in other processes as they are logically related. In this way, the research can provide a powerful tool to quickly, effectively, and accurately assess the alternatives for a specific project, and present the system and project-wide impacts of the alternatives on expected duration, cost, and worker safety."
pub.1053931844,A declarative framework for work process configuration,"Abstract
                  This article describes the technical principles and representation of a constraint-based configuration method for work processes. Methods developed for the configuration of modular systems comprising components have traditionally adopted a representation where the properties and compatibility requirements are expressed as constraints associated with individual components. However, this representation does not accurately capture constraints on paths and subprocesses and is therefore unsuitable for process configuration. This article extends established constraint-based configuration methods with a constraint language for specifying properties of execution paths in work processes. A framework for semiautomated process customization is presented. It integrates the extended constraint language with a metamodel of the work processes in an organization and allows to adapt generic work processes to fit the requirements of specific development projects. Heuristic search methods are applied to build valid process configurations by incrementally resolving constraint violations. The declarative framework facilitates the adaptation of abstract work processes as well as the validation and repair of existing processes. The approach was developed in the context of a real-world system of complex design and development processes where it was shown that significant process improvements and reduction in effort required to edit process models can be achieved."
pub.1151776829,1 A survey of emotion theories and their relevance to language research,"The topics of language and emotion are studied by very different scientific disciplines, of which their respective members rarely interact. At the same time, the everyday use of language, whether colloquial or professional, is richly intertwined with, and dependent on, emotion. This suggests that it will be useful for language researchers to at least have a feel for what is going on in emotion research. This chapter provides an overview of current trends in emotion science for language researchers, so that they will be in a better position to consider, design, interpret, or discuss research at the intersection of these two fields. After explaining why emotion science is relevant to language research, I discuss four currently influential views on emotion: the basic emotions perspective, the motivational perspective, the component process model, and the psychological construction perspective. Next, I define a metamodel of emotion to highlight what these views have in common, as well as where they differ. I end by proposing a research agenda for affective language science. Although having an interface with emotion is not what makes language “special”, understanding emotion may well help language research advance."
pub.1113086003,Uncertainty propagation of frequency response functions using a multi-output Gaussian Process model,"Uncertainty propagation of frequency response functions (FRFs) under parameter variations is crucial for structural design and reliability analysis. However, obtaining sufficiently large samples of FRFs from a high-fidelity finite element (FE) model can easily become unaffordable. To reduce the computational cost, much interest is focused on metamodeling techniques, but how to efficiently create a metamodel over the whole frequency domain still remains challenging. In this work, a novel nonparametric approach based on multi-output Gaussian Process (MOGP) modeling to speedup uncertainty propagation is proposed. First, modal decomposition together with a low-dimensional representation method is used to address the curse of dimensionality of FRF output. Subsequently, a MOGP model is employed to provide a fast vector-output approximation of the random modal parameters, which are needed thereafter for reconstruction of the FRFs at any frequency level. To demonstrate the numerical accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method, both a discrete and continuous numerical example are investigated. It is shown that the proposed approach not only achieves accurate estimation of FRF variability, but also greatly improves computational efficiency."
pub.1144948294,Metamodeling of Numerical Simulations for Optimization of Hairpin Bending Processes,"As a result of the progressive electrification of mobility solutions, manufacturing technologies for distributed stator windings need to be improved in order to meet the automotive demand for productivity and quality. In this context, the hairpin technology already provides advantages regarding the possible level of automation and productivity in comparison to conventional winding technologies, but still shows technological weaknesses concerning process reliability. Against this background, approaches for optimized process control based on physical process models have a high potential to minimize waste in production resulting from variations in wire properties or an inappropriate machine parametrization. However, the accuracy of analytical modeling techniques is limited due to complex interactions of machine kinematics, tooling and material properties in rectangular wire bending processes. Hence, the calculation effort of more precise finite element simulations needs to be reduced in order to enable model-based process control and economic tool design. Therefore, conventional and AI-based methodologies for meta modeling of numerical process simulations are introduced and compared in this paper. Furthermore, opportunities of optimized process control of hairpin shaping processes based on efficient but also accurate metamodels are discussed."
pub.1000397538,A General-Purpose Geosimulation Infrastructure for Spatial Decision Support,"In this paper we present the general-purpose simulation infrastructure MAGI, with features and computational strategies particularly relevant for strongly geo-spatially oriented simulations. Its main characteristics are (1) a comprehensive approach to geosimulation modelling, with a flexible underlying meta-model formally generalising a variety of types of models, both from the cellular automata and from the agent-based family of models, (2) tight interoperability between GIS and the modelling environment, (3) computationally efficiency and (4) user-friendliness. Both raster and vector representation of simulated entities are allowed and managed with efficiency, which is obtained through the integration of a geometry engine implementing a core set of operations on spatial data through robust geometric algorithms, and an efficient spatial indexing strategy for moving agents. We furthermore present three test-case applications to discuss its efficiency, to present a standard operational modelling workflow within the simulation environment and to briefly illustrate its look-and-feel."
pub.1008889393,Model-Driven Architecture for Mobile Applications,"Although significant improvements in the development of business applications for mobile devices have been made in recent years, the software development in this area is still not as mature as it is for desktop computers. Therefore, declarative and code generation approaches should be preferred instead of manually coding. In the BAMOS project an architecture has been designed and implemented for the generic and flexible development of mobile applications. The architecture is based on the declarative description of the available services. In this paper we present a model-driven approach for generating almost the complete source code of mobile services. By applying model-driven development within the proposed approach, a new service can be conveniently modeled with a graphical modeling tool and the graphical models are then used to generate the corresponding XML descriptions of the mobile user interface and the workflow specification. In order to use such a service no specific source code has to be implemented on the mobile device."
pub.1006086797,A Comparison of Frameworks for Enterprise Architecture Modeling,"This presentation compares and contrasts two distinct approaches to the representation and management of models relating to enterprise complexity. The approaches share a common focus on describing the enterprise domain, although in different ways. Each approach has an audience of existing supporters. The first approach organizes models according to the perspectives of model users and is exemplified by the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture, which has gained popularity over the past decade in a wide variety of commercial and government settings. The second approach uses life cycle as its organizing theme and is exemplified by three ISO standards related to industrial automation and systems engineering (15704:2000, 19439:2003, and 15288:2002), all of which build upon decades of practice. The two approaches are seen to use a framework structure with a common meta-meta-model [1] and are found to be complementary. Each approach serves a distinct and essential need in the effort to understand and realize a successful enterprise."
pub.1142217151,StalkCD: A Model-Driven Framework for Interoperability and Analysis of CI/CD Pipelines,"Today, most Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) solutions use infrastructure as code to describe the pipeline-based build and deployment process. Each solution uses its own format to describe the CI/CD pipeline, which hinders the interoperability and the analysis of CI/CD pipelines. In this paper, we propose a model-driven DSL-based framework for CI/CD pipeline definition and analysis. It comprises (i) the analysis of the meta-model of the Jenkins pipeline definition language, (ii) the StalkCD domain-specific language providing a base for interoperability and transformation between different formats, and (iii) an extensible set of transformations between tool-specific CI/CD definitions and analysis tools. We demonstrate the specific support for Jenkins as a CI/CD tool and BPMN for exploiting analyses from the workflow domain and visualizing the results. We evaluate the DSL and the transformations empirically based on more than 1,000 publicly available Jenkinsfiles. The evaluation shows that our framework supports 70% of these files without information loss."
pub.1121654690,DPN – Dependability Priority Numbers,"This paper proposes a novel model-based approach to combine the quantitative dependability (safety, reliability, availability, maintainability and IT security) analysis and trade-off analysis. The proposed approach is called DPN (Dependability Priority Numbers) and allows the comparison of different actual dependability characteristics of a systems with its target values and evaluates them regarding trade-off analysis criteria. Therefore, the target values of system dependability characteristics are taken as requirements, while the actual value of a specific system design are provided by quantitative and qualitative dependability analysis (FHA, FMEA, FMEDA, of CFT-based FTA). The DPN approach evaluates the fulfillment of individual target requirements and perform trade-offs between analysis objectives. We present the workflow and meta-model of the DPN approach, and illustrate our approach using a case study on a brake warning contact system. Hence, we demonstrate how the model-based DPNs improve system dependability by selecting the project crucial dependable design alternatives or measures."
pub.1071981878,Research on Multi-Level Context-Aware Material Data Model within Manufacturing Enterprises,"Context-aware applications can sense and explore the context of production processes to provide proper and useful services to managers in workshop. And materials data integration and control are one of core competences concerning with the development of mass data application in manufacturing enterprises. In this paper, a context-aware materials data integration meta model is presented which is incorporating an advanced materials demand mapping and decomposition mechanism to support fine-grained materials data in the right time for the provision of materials services, based on the analysis of the application context involving the key points and relationships in their manufacturing processes. In this model, materials data integration is controlled by the demand state transitions at different levels including workflow levels, control levels and data levels, which incorporates dynamic context information by checking the context constraint associated with each application task at the time of the specific request submission. Finally, a case is given which is implemented in a complex equipments enterprise."
pub.1016374489,Using templates and linguistic patterns to define process performance indicators,"Process performance management (PPM) aims at measuring, monitoring and analysing the performance of business processes (BPs), in order to check the achievement of strategic and operational goals and to support decision-making for their optimisation. PPM is based on process performance indicators (PPIs), so having an appropriate definition of them is crucial. One of the main problems of PPIs definition is to express them in an unambiguous, complete, understandable, traceable and verifiable manner. In practice, PPIs are defined informally – usually in ad hoc, natural language, with its well-known problems – or they are defined from an implementation perspective, hardly understandable to non-technical people. In order to solve this problem, in this article we propose a novel approach to improve the definition of PPIs using templates and linguistic patterns. This approach promotes reuse, reduces both ambiguities and missing information, is understandable to all stakeholders and maintains traceability with the process model. Furthermore, it enables the automated processing of PPI definitions by its straightforward translation into the PPINOT metamodel, allowing the gathering of the required information for their computation as well as the analysis of the relationships between them and with BP elements."
pub.1053140411,VTPR-Tree: An Efficient Indexing Method for Moving Objects with Frequent Updates,"Moving object databases are required to support queries on a large number of continuous moving objects. Indexes for moving objects must support both query and update operations efficiently. In previous work TPR-tree is the most popular indexing method for the future predicted position, but its frequent updates performance is very poor. In this paper we propose a novel indexing method, called VTPR-tree, for predicted trajectory of moving objects. VTPR-tree takes into account both the velocity and space distribution of moving objects. First the velocity domain is split, and moving objects are classified into different velocity buckets by their velocities, thus objects in one bucket have similar velocities. Then we use an improved TPR-tree structure to index objects in each bucket. VTPR-tree is supplemented by a hash index on IDs of moving objects to support frequent updates. Also an extended bottom-up update algorithm is developed for VTPR-tree, thus having a good dynamic update performance and concurrency. Experimental results show that the update and query performance of VTPR-tree outperforms the TPR*-tree."
pub.1005912511,Map2Share – A System Exploiting Metadata to Share Geographical Information,"A crucial aspect in GIS project development is the high cost that companies face to collect geographical data. On the other hand, GIS data are abundant and readily available on the Internet for either on-line viewing or direct downloading. We present a software tool which exploits emerging P2P technologies in order to retrieve what is already available on the Internet, thus reducing the data collection cost. In the proposed Map2Share system, two aspects are of special interest, namely the platform which manages access and communication over the network and the retrieval methods to discriminate geographical data. Access and communication management is ensured by the JXTA platform, which is a set of protocols allowing to develop interoperable, platform-independent and ubiquitous P2P architectures. As for the retrieval methods, a minimal set of metadata, on which users may perform efficient retrieval tasks, has been identified on the basis of the well-established ISO/FDIS 19115 and Dublin Core standards. The visual environment characterizing Map2Share is described showing some of its advanced search functionality for geographical data retrieval and sharing."
pub.1091230442,Conceptual Modeling,"Understanding and developing complex systems requires collaboration between individuals with widely varying expertise. Communication between these individuals is facilitated by conceptual models. Conceptual models are early stage artifacts that integrate and provide requirements for many kinds of specialized models. They are living documents that grow from informal descriptions to formal specifications, used to detect omissions, inconsistencies, and ambiguities inherent in informal models, as well as guide development of computational models. Conceptual models describe what is to be represented, the assumptions limiting those representations, and other capabilities needed to satisfy modeler requirements. Advances in conceptual modeling are essential for effective collaboration and cost-effective, error-free translation of models to suitable computer representations. Developing an engineering discipline of conceptual modeling will require much better understanding of (1) how to make conceptual models explicit and unambiguous, for both the target system and the target analysis, (2) processes for conceptual modeling, including communication and decision-making involving multiple stakeholders, (3) architectures and services for building conceptual models. This chapter outlines research issues for these three topics in conceptual modeling."

                    Purpose
                    – As reimbursements fall and costs for services climb, organizations are forced to follow the painful motto of doing more with less. A solution could be the adaptation of industrial business process improvement (BPI) methods such as Lean to the hospital setting (HS). The purpose of this paper is to analyze if Lean approaches related in the literature provide sufficient methodological support for other practitioners to reproduce the reported results.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    – The authors analyzed the published Lean literature in the HS using a methodological maturity-level framework and what the authors defined as the 11 characteristic activities of BPI.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    – The literature analysis reveals that a Lean approach with a high-methodological maturity level that includes the 11 characteristic activities of BPI has never been reported. Considering this, the paper suggests a meta model for a high-methodological maturity-level Lean method based on the characteristic activities of BPI.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    – This is the first study on the Lean approach in the HS that evidences the absence of a robust Lean methodology in the literature. For Lean to be adopted and implemented by hospital practitioners a structured robust method should be provided.

pub.1030880086,Decision making models embedded into a web-based tool for assessing pest infestation risk,"Current practices in agricultural management involve the application of rules and techniques to ensure high quality and environmentally friendly production. Based on their experience, agricultural technicians and farmers make critical decisions affecting crop growth while considering several interwoven agricultural, technological, environmental, legal and economic factors. In this context, decision support systems and the knowledge models that support them, enable the incorporation of valuable experience into software systems providing support to agricultural technicians to make rapid and effective decisions for efficient crop growth. Pest control is an important issue in agricultural management due to crop yield reductions caused by pests and it involves expert knowledge. This paper presents a formalisation of the pest control problem and the workflow followed by agricultural technicians and farmers in integrated pest management, the crop production strategy that combines different practices for growing healthy crops whilst minimising pesticide use. A generic decision schema for estimating infestation risk of a given pest on a given crop is defined and it acts as a metamodel for the maintenance and extension of the knowledge embedded in a pest management decision support system which is also presented. This software tool has been implemented by integrating a rule-based tool into web-based architecture. Evaluation from validity and usability perspectives concluded that both agricultural technicians and farmers considered it a useful tool in pest control, particularly for training new technicians and inexperienced farmers."

pub.1091746851,The Best of all Possible Worlds: Applying the Model Driven Architecture Approach to a JC3IEDM OWL Ontology Modeled in UML,"This paper describes how, through the utilization of the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM), a profile for expressing OWL constructs in UML, one can combine the power of semantic modeling done in OWL with the substantive advantages associated with the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) software design approach, namely, the reduction in cost and time required to update and maintain complex information models, and the improved quality of their physical implementations. Taking the Multilateral Interoperability Programme's Joint Consultation, Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (JC3IEDM) as an example of an existing C2 specification written in an Entity Relationship (ER) modeling language, the authors present a detailed workflow that encompasses (a) a methodology for translating existing ER specifications into OWL equivalents, (b) the subsequent conversion of the resulting JC3IEDM OWL ontology into a UML model that uses the ODM profile, (c) the use of the resulting UML model as a Platform Independent Model (PIM), (d) the generation of Platform Specific Models (PSMs) via the application of Query/View/Transformation (QVT) scripts to the JC3IEDM PIM, and (e) the final generation of executable code out of the respective PSMs. The authors also highlight some of the additional benefits of migrating to OWL as the modeling language for information models, namely, the potential for leveraging the inferencing capabilities of ontology languages, as well as for formalizing rule models associated with information models."
pub.1106220917,Operational Optimization of Shale Gas Processing under Feedstock Uncertainties with Updated Back-off Strategy,"Uncertainties have a great influence on the optimal performance of chemical processes. In the industrial operation, the ignorance of uncertainty may result in substandard products. With the prosperous development of shale gas, the processing process of shale gas faces large uncertainties in the feedstock, which will influence industrial operations. Aiming at the maximization of the profit of shale gas processing, this study optimizes the corresponding chance constrained optimization problem. The updated back-off strategy is used to reformulate the stochastic problem into the deterministic problem. To reduce the computational burden, meta-models based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion are developed instead of the computationally expensive rigorous process model. With efficient computation, the optimization result of shale gas processing implements the trade-off between profit and product quality."

In order to support process improvement and process automation, the execution model is represented by logic programming. Activity in EEM (EPM’s execution model) is not implemented until its needing all kinds of resources are satisfied by system execution environment.

pub.1052147576,Modeling Ad-Hoc Collaboration for Automated Process Support,"Understanding and supporting collaboration is a major concern in any collective endeavor. In software engineering, planning collaboration is difficult and often occurs rather ad-hoc. However, many proposals for the description and support of collaboration assume necessary information is readily available and already integrated in process models. We believe practitioners should be given the ability to represent their evolving understanding about collaboration and should be supported by tools using such representation. We developed an extension to the Software & System Process Engineering Meta-Model (SPEM), which introduces concepts needed to represent precise and dynamic ad-hoc collaboration setups. We also describe tool support and present a proof-of-concept based on a fictitious but realistic application example."
pub.1124643467,Specifying the Process Model for Systematic Reviews: An Augmented Proposal,"Context: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a research methodology intended to obtain evidence from scientific articles stored in digital libraries. SLRs can be performed on primary and secondary studies. Although there are guidelines to the SLR process in Software Engineering, the SLR process is not fully and rigorously specified yet. Moreover, it can often be observed a lack of a clear separation of concerns between what to do (process) and how to do it (methods). Objective: To specify the SLR process in a more detailed and rigorous manner by considering different process modeling perspectives, such as functional, behavioral, organizational and informational. The main objective in this work is specifying the SLR activities rather than their methods. Method: The SPEM (Software & Systems Process Engineering Metamodel) language is used to model the SLR process from different perspectives. In addition, we illustrate aspects of the proposed process by using a recently conducted SLR on software testing ontologies. Results: Our SLR process model specifications favor a clear identification of what task/activities should be performed, in which order, by whom, and which are the consumed and produced artifacts as well as their inner structures. Also, we explicitly specify activities related to the SLR pilot test, analyzing the gains. Conclusion: The proposed SLR process considers with higher rigor the principles and benefits of process modeling backing SLRs to be more systematic, repeatable and auditable for researchers and practitioners. In fact, the rigor provided by process modeling, where several perspectives are combined, but can also be independently detached, provides a greater richness of expressiveness in sequences and decision flows, while representing different levels of granularity in the work definitions, such as activity, sub-activity and task."
pub.1155296556,Defining Process Performance Measures in an Object-Centric Context,"The calculation and analysis of process performance indicators (PPIs) and, in particular, the customized performance measures defined to measure a specific process domain, provide insight into whether a business process’s results align with the strategic objectives within an organization. These measures and PPIs can be calculated using process execution data. This data is traditionally structured in such a way that for each process instance (case), there is a case notion (object), for example, the order in a purchasing process. Recently, the object-centric approach introduced the multiple case notion, i.e., the idea that several objects can be associated in the execution of tasks of one or several process instances, which better reflects what happens in reality. However, this approach generates more complex event logs that include data involving interacting instances and complex data dependencies. These changes impact the types of PPIs that can be defined and should therefore be analyzed in detail from a different perspective than the traditional one. In this paper, we focus on the PPI modeling area. In particular, we aim at extending the classical definition of PPIs for an object-centric context. For this purpose, we analyze how different customized performance measures are defined in the traditional context and identify a set of requirements to define those measures in an object-centric context. In addition, we propose to extend the established PPINOT metamodel, focused on the definition of PPIs, to integrate the identified requirements, thus laying the groundwork for the automatic calculation of such PPIs."
pub.1119198279,Artefacts in Software Engineering: A Fundamental Positioning,"Artefacts play a vital role in software and systems development processes.
Other terms like documents, deliverables, or work products are widely used in
software development communities instead of the term artefact. In the
following, we use the term `artefact' including all these other terms. Despite
its relevance, the exact denotation of the term `artefact' is still not clear
due to a variety of different understandings of the term and to a careless
negligent usage. This often leads to approaches being grounded in a fuzzy,
unclear understanding of the essential concepts involved. In fact, there does
not exist a common terminology. Therefore, it is our goal that the term
artefact be standardised so that researchers and practitioners have a common
understanding for discussions and contributions. In this position paper, we
provide a positioning and critical reflection upon the notion of artefact in
software engineering at different levels of perception and how these relate to
each other. We further contribute a meta model that provides a description of
an artefact that is independent from any underlying process model. This meta
model defines artefacts at three levels. Abstraction and refinement relations
between these levels allow correlating artefacts to each other and defining the
notion of related, refined, and equivalent artefacts. Our contribution shall
foster the long overdue and too often underestimated terminological discussion
on what artefacts are to provide a common ground with clearer concepts and

pub.1173662321,iDOCEM: defining a common terminology for object-centric event logging and data-centric process modelling,"In the business process lifecycle, models can be approached from two perspectives: on the one hand, models are used to create systems in the design phase, and on the other hand, systems in use produce (event) logs that are used to discover the models representing the structure of the systems. These discovered models can be the starting point of a new cycle of analysis, redesign, implementation, etc. Therefore, proper logging of implemented processes in line with system design is a critical element for process discovery. Recently, the consideration of the integration of data and process aspects has seen a surge in interest in both the model-for-design domain as in the automated-model-discovery domain. However, it seems that these domains use different conceptualizations of data/object-aware systems. A definition of how the captured event logs are related to the structure of the global system they are extracted from or are trying to discover is still missing. Especially the concept of an event needs to be aligned, as this is the main concept that the domains have in common. This paper investigates the concepts and terminology used in the different phases of the business process lifecycle: the design phase, the implementation phase (including the implementation of logging) and the discovery phase. The paper contains an extensive running example that is used to illustrate five misalignment issues. The main contribution of this paper is a meta-model that presents a unified terminology for modelling both domains and is demonstrated using the running example. The paper also shows how the concepts of iDOCEM relate to the concepts of a conceptual modelling approach and several event logging formats. iDOCEM is validated with the implementation of a log generator for the running case, demonstrating the feasibility of generating DOCEL-compliant logs from an application."
pub.1004284617,Feasibility and flexibility analysis of black-box processes Part 1: Surrogate-based feasibility analysis,"Feasibility analysis is a useful technique for evaluating the operability and ultimately the flexibility of chemical processes. However, it is difficult to solve the feasibility test problem for process models involving black-box constraints. This issue can be addressed through the use of surrogate-based methods for feasibility analysis. These techniques rely on the creation of a reduced-order model that approximates the feasibility function for a process. The feasible region for the process can then be evaluated based on the surrogate model. In this work, a novel method for surrogate-based feasibility analysis based on kriging metamodels will be presented. This algorithm differs from previously published approaches in the way that the expected improvement function is evaluated. In addition, the proposed method explicitly considers surrogate model prediction uncertainty. The algorithm is also extended to problems of dynamic feasibility analysis, where the shape and size of the feasible region may change with time. A series of test problems will be used to demonstrate the surrogate-based feasibility algorithm, including those with nonconvex and disjoint feasible regions. Finally, the algorithm will be used to evaluate the feasible region for a dynamic roller compaction process."
pub.1035485427,Flexibility in Process-Aware Information Systems,"Process-aware information systems (PAIS) must be able to deal with uncertainty, exceptional situations, and environmental changes. Needed business agility is often hindered by the lacking flexibility of existing PAIS. Once a process is implemented, its logic cannot be adapted or refined anymore. This often leads to rigid behavior or gaps between real-world processes and implemented ones. In response to this drawback, adaptive PAIS have emerged, which allow to dynamically adapt or evolve the structure of process models under execution. This paper deals with fundamental challenges related to structural process changes, discusses how existing approaches deal with them, and shows how the various problems have been exterminated in ADEPT2 change framework. We also survey existing approaches fostering flexible process support."

If the goal of the software is to be used in safety-critical systems, compliance to a standard (such as the IEC 61508) might be required. In order to map the current state of safety compliant development, a survey within the RECOMP project was conducted, showing a need for promoting the use of formal process descriptions. To meet this need, the software related parts of the IEC 61508 standard, have been regarded as a process and modeled using the SPEM meta-model. Having the standard available in this format, facilitates reading, communicating and customizing the standard. Moreover, it eases the adaption of any process that is modeled in SPEM to the IEC 61508 standard."

The knowledge has moved from humans to systems and systems has more and more knowledge about the process. This paper presents an approach to the integration of the process mining to the process modeling supported by the formal layer. The process is modeled by framework that allows selection and formal description of the applicable meta-model parts, formally define process prescription and then model the process by graphical language. Process is executed and logs are stored. The presented process mining part of the framework then can discover the de facto process model, can check the differences between de facto and de jure model, can enhance de jure model according to the findings."

The topic ?Notation for Process Definition? references selected notations appropriate for software process definition. However all of them have weakly defined semantics, thus is not possible to use formal techniques for process model creation, validation etc. In this work we present created Software and Systems Process Engineering Meta-Model (SPEM) Ontology that improves the lack of mentioned process notations. The SPEM Ontology constitutes a semantic notation that provides concepts for knowledge based software process engineering. The work also discusses utilization of such semantic notation in other selected SWEBOK topics, the Software Project Planning, the Software Project Enactment, and the Verification and Validation.

pub.1138884418,Robust functional response-based metamodel optimization considering both location and dispersion effects for aeronautical airfoil designs,"Airfoils play significant roles in aerodynamic engineering as they are important devices in designing aircraft and engines. For airfoils, geometric design variables often deviate from nominal values that deteriorate airfoil quality. Thus, the design optimization of airfoils under the noises of design variables is important. However, the existing literature does not consider functional responses that can more adequately describe airfoil performances than univariate and multivariate responses. To fill in this gap and further improve airfoil quality, we develop a surrogate-based robust parameter design methodology for the design optimization of airfoils with functional responses. A new optimization criterion that involves both location and dispersion effects associated with the functional feature of quality losses, noises of design variables, and emulator uncertainty is proposed. A Gaussian process (GP) model with functional responses is employed as a surrogate/emulator. An efficient method for computing the proposed criterion is developed. The proposed methodology is applied to a typical airfoil design optimization problem to demonstrate that better and more robust solutions are obtained with the proposed criterion for airfoils, and the computing time is significantly reduced with the proposed estimation method."
pub.1147350056,"POEML: a Process Orchestration, Execution, and Modeling Language","Abstract  Many software process modeling languages are available today, but the majority do not meet the community's expectations. They are complex, difficult for enactment, and so forth. After studying the state of the art, we asked this research question: Is it possible to have an easy to read and use Software Process Modeling Language (SPML), which is abstract enough but also expressive enough to suit different domains of process modeling and allowing the orchestration and execution of the process models it expressed? Our contribution consists in answering this question by defining Process Orchestration , Execution and Modeling Language (POEML) , an SPML that supports the static process modeling and also the dynamic aspects of orchestration and execution. This language is governed by a metamodel, according to MDE principles, and provides graphic notation and a support tool. Its demonstration involves a benchmark that assesses the applicability of the language. We evaluate our language through a set of SPMLs quality criteria. Our contribution is discussed in terms of adopted choices and is compared with different related works. POEML contributes to software processes practice by linking modelization to execution while compensating some gaps still posed in SPMLs, which is an important improvement in this field. "
pub.1137208714,Further development of a numerical method for analyzing the load capacity of clinched joints in versatile process chains,"In many branches of production, components using large number of joints are combined together to make complex structures. The use of mechanical joining techniques offers the possibility to join structures with a wide range of material/geometry configurations. Due to changing in material properties during the production of formed parts, the robustness of the joint must be guaranteed. In this regard, a numerical method has been developed to predict the geometrical properties of the joint as a function of pre-straining of the metal sheets. In this way, the material combination and the joining tools are to be considered. The resulting metamodels were used to estimate the robustness of the joining process. In this study, the method is extended by a numerical load capacity model, which is generated from the joining process model using an automatic algorithm. The simulation model used for predicting the load capacity is validated by experiments. It is shown that the resulting automatic method is able to completely map a process chain and to predict the load capacity of the mechanical joints under consideration of the pre-strain. Furthermore, the correlation between the pre-strain and the load capacity is presented."
pub.1093948811,Tchebycheff Approximation in Gaussian Process Model Composition for Multi-objective Expensive Black Box,"Black-box expensive function is ubiquitous in real world problems. Much research has been done on scalar objective optimization for such problems with great success. Comparatively, very little work has been done in multi-objective optimization. In many cases, it is not straightforward to convert methods from scalar objective optimization to multi-objective optimization due to the complexities incurred by Pareto domination. In our pervious research, concept of model composition based on Gaussian Process metamodel and the powerful MOEA/D framework proved to be a successful approach for multi-objective optimization with black-box expensive functions. We derived Weighted-Sum and Tchebycheff model composition for bi-objective problems. However, due to the complexity of Tchebycheff decomposition structure, it is very hard, if not impossible, to extend the method to three or more objective problems in a nature way. In this paper, we propose an approximation method for Tchebycheff model composition which greatly simplify the derivation for three or more objective cases. Experiments show the approximation produces very similar performance as the Weighted-Sum and Tchebycheff without approximation. Thus, the new method enables us to tackle multi-objective problems with black-box expensive functions that could not be tackled effectively so far."
pub.1170405804,Probabilistic surrogate modeling by Gaussian process: A new estimation algorithm for more robust prediction,"In reliability engineering studies, computer codes are increasingly used to model physical phenomena which, in many cases, can be very time-consuming to run. A widely accepted approach consists in approximating the CPU-time expensive computer model by a surrogate model. One of the most popular surrogate model is the Gaussian Process regression, as it provides, additionally to a prediction at an unobserved point, an uncertainty around this prediction (a predictive distribution). However, in practice, the quality of this metamodel depends on several choices, as the estimation and validation algorithms. The present work aims at proposing a new algorithm, based on constrained optimization multi-objective techniques, to estimate the Gaussian process hyperparameters in order to ensure robust and accurate (i.e. reliable) predictive distribution of the Gaussian process. An intensive numerical benchmark on various analytical functions, with different input dimensions and learning sample sizes, shows its good performance in comparison with standard estimation algorithms. The new algorithm is also applied to a real test case modeling an aquatic ecosystem. It is compared with a recent robust and sophisticated Bayesian method; it proves to be as efficient while being less sensitive to the specification of the Gaussian process model."

Design/methodology/approach: It involves particularizing a metamodel encompassing the main generic components and relationships into process models and process instances, by incorporating structural data from the real-life system. Existing data on the target user population is fed into a micro-modeling system to generate a matching population of individual “virtual” users, each with its own set of trait values. The micro-simulation of their interaction with the assignment process of both the incumbent and the competitors generates a rich multi-dimensional output, encompassing both “revealed” and non-observable data. This enables a comprehensive multi-criteria evaluation of the foreseeable performance of the designed process/ algorithm, and therefore its iterative improvement. Findings: The research project developed a set of methodologies and associated supporting tools encompassing the modeling, micro-simulation and performance assessment of service infrastructure assignment processes. Originality/value: The proposed approach facilitates, in a multicriteria environment, the flexible modeling/design of situation-specific assignment processes/algorithms and their performance assessment when facing their case-specific user population."
pub.1035259006,Complex event processing in enterprise information systems based on RFID,"Enterprises have to be increasingly agile and responsive to address the challenges posed by the fast moving market. With the software architecture evolving into service-oriented architecture (SOA), and the adoption of radio frequency identification (RFID), event processing can fit well in enterprise information systems in terms of facilitation of event aggregation into high level actionable information, and event response to improve the responsiveness. To make it more applicable, the architecture of event processing in enterprise information systems is proposed; event meta model and context serve as the solid basis for event processing; the rules, operators and keys of complex event processing are defined. Especially, workflow model is firstly used to extract complex event pattern. We have implemented the event processing mechanism in enterprise information systems based on RFID, including the architecture, data structures, optimization strategies and algorithm. The performance evaluations show that the method is effective in terms of scalability and the capability of event processing. Complex event processing can improve operational performance and discover more actionable information, which is justified by application. Finally, lessons learned from the application are presented."

pub.1093505711,Integration of PECOS into MARMOT for Embedded Real Time Software Component-Based Development,"In ERT (Embedded Real Time) software development, software functionality is not the only focus but multi-constraints extra-functionality requirement such as timing, resources constraint, statically predictable, safety-critical, processing power and memory is also important. Besides that, ERT software development involves multidisciplinary knowledge that includes software, mechanical and electronic engineering fields. To meet these two challenges ERT software development must be able to support the multi-constraint and multi-disciplinary challenges. From this perspective, CBD (Component-Based Development) appears to be one of the appropriate approaches to design the ERT software due to the ability of domain experts to interactively compose and adapt sophisticated ERT software which the decrease of development time and improvement of software quality. Existing component infrastructures used in ERT software development are MARMOT (Component-Based Real-Time Object-Oriented Development and Testing) and PECOS (Pervasive Component System). However, these technologies are not enough to support the two challenges in their CBD activities. This paper discusses about the integration of PECOS and MARMOT by mapping the metamodel of the two technologies and proposing a process model. The aim of the integration is to support methodological CBD software to enable systematic development of ERT software with consideration of multi-disciplinary knowledge and multi-constraint."
pub.1173232848,Analysis of Power-to-gas-to-X systems with metal hydride storage based on coupled electrochemical and thermodynamic simulation,"Power-to-gas-to-X systems consisting of photovoltaic cells, proton-exchange membrane electrolysis, hydrogen storage based on metal hydrides, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells and buffer batteries could be used to meet heat and electricity demands of homes, businesses, or small districts. The actual size of the individual components and their interplay have to be optimized for the technical and economic feasibility of the overall system. A simulation-based optimization workflow would be a suitable way to accomplish this task, but there are hardly any tools that can simultaneously simulate power, fluid and heat flows of such systems and efficiently perform their optimization. In this paper, a multiphysical energy system simulation and optimization tool is introduced which models electrochemical and thermodynamic processes simultaneously, including modern equations of state and an own numerical solver for the arising differential–algebraic system of equations, and provides new methods for the calibration of parameters of the metal hydride storage, proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer and fuel cell as well as a metamodel-based approach for sizing optimization. As a demonstrator for the novel tool, a simulation model of a hydrogen lab is successfully set up based on experimental results. The novel tool is able to extract polarization and jump curves of the fuel cell, determine a first temperature and pressure dependency of the efficiency of the electrolysis coupled with the metal hydride storage and speed up sizing optimization through metamodeling by a factor 262.1 at 4.9% and 32.7 at 3.3% accuracy."
pub.1165047761,Verification and validation of software process simulation models: A systematic mapping study,"Abstract Software process simulation models (SPSMs) that are based on descriptive process models offer the executability that can demonstrate dynamic changes of software processes over time. Verification and validation (V&V) is critical in SPSMs for guaranteeing the quality and reliability of models. V&V of dynamic software process models is more complex and challenging than for static software process models. This work systematically summarizes and maps V&V studies in SPSM to provide guidelines for future research and practice. Specifically, this study aims at identifying the focus of research on V&V, the methods used for V&V, and how to implement V&V of SPSMs in software engineering research. We conducted a systematic mapping study on studies of SPSMs that report on their V&V activities. Under the guidance of a V&V meta‐model for SPSMs, we study four research questions about V&V process. We identified 107 primary studies from a pool of 313 papers on SPSMs until 2021. There are two main results of our study. The first one presents the relationship between quality aspects of SPSMs and the V&V methods to assure them. The second result reveals the relationships among the modeling process, three modeling steps, five quality aspects, and 10 V&V methods. Generally, researchers do not pay sufficient attention to V&V, as 65.8% ( ) failed to mention or elaborate on their V&V process. We systematically summarize and map the state‐of‐the‐art V&V research in software process modeling field to support modelers' practice and improve their V&V process."
pub.1107809784,A Catalogue of Bad Smells for Software Process,"Software processes play an important role in the software industry, as they influence the quality of the product and determine the efficiency of the company that develops these software products. To be used systematically in different projects, software processes need to be disseminated in the organization and continuously evaluated when one wants to understand their quality. The evaluation of a software process maintains and promotes its quality and evolution. However, if these evaluations happen from data directly collected from a process that has been applied to a given development project, process quality problems have already influenced the outcome of the process and possibly the software product. Software process models, commonly specified in a process modeling language (PML), specify in a standardized way the elements of a process and the appropriate interactions between them. In addition to assigning to the understanding, communication and execution of a software process in a company, process models offer an opportunity for them to be evaluated before their first execution or even to help identify problems in the process of ongoing projects. This paper presents a proposal to use the concept of bad smells in software process models with the objective of identifying possible disharmonies in the models. Initially bad smells of object-oriented code were analyzed and adapted to SPEM (Software & Systems Process Engineering Meta-Model) to generate a catalog. Subsequently a survey was carried out to validate the definitions, representations and possible impacts of the proposed bad smells, resulting in a validation that presented an overall rate of 86% agreement. It is expected that being possible to characterize bad smells for software processes, to enable their applicability in real software development process."
pub.1011814114,Leadership Process Models: A Review and Synthesis,"In organizational research, studying “processes” is important for uncovering and understanding the underlying causal mechanisms in a predictor-mediator-outcome logic. Processes answer “how” and “why” questions and provide more complete explanations about phenomena. Our focus in this review is on studies of leadership processes, which we systematically analyze to report on the state of the science. In doing so, we present a two-dimensional target-centric taxonomy to integrate previous research: The taxonomy distinguishes the target’s level (i.e., individual follower, team, organizational, and extraorganizational) as well as the type of leadership processes that affect either the target’s development or leverage of resources. Our review indicates that the predominantly studied leadership “meta” process model looks at the effect of leader traits or behaviors on performance-related outcomes through cognitive, affective, or behavioral leveraging factors. This “meta” model points to several important and understudied processes, including a leader’s influence on the target’s development or work context. We also identify two largely overlooked yet critical issues for leadership process research: modeling the role of time and that of multiple processes through which leadership effects manifest themselves in organizations. Using our taxonomy, we provide several reflection points that can guide the development of genuine and thoughtful leadership process theories. We conclude by urging future leadership process research to embrace multiprocess, multilevel, and time-sensitive models."
pub.1034039677,Mockup-Driven Development: Providing agile support for Model-Driven Web Engineering,"ContextAgile software development approaches are currently becoming the industry standard for Web Application development. On the other hand, Model-Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) methodologies are known to improve productivity when building this kind of applications. However, current MDWE methodologies tend to ignore important aspects of Web Applications development supported by agile processes, such as constant customer feedback or early design of user interfaces.ObjectiveIn this paper we analyze the difficulties of supporting agile features in MDWE methodologies. Then, we propose an approach that eases the incorporation of well-known agile practices to MDWE.MethodWe propose using User Interface prototypes (usually known as mockups) as a way to start the modeling process in the context of a mixed agile-MDWE process. To assist this process, we defined a lightweight metamodel that allows modeling features over mockups, interacting with end-users and generating MDWE models. Then, we conducted a statistical evaluation of both approaches (traditional vs. mockup-based modeling).ResultsFirst we comment on how agile features can be added to MDWE processes using mockups. Then, we show by means of a quantitative study that the proposed approach is faster, less error-prone and still as complete as traditional MDWE processes.ConclusionThe use of mockups to guide the MDWE process helps in the reduction of the development cycle as well as in the incorporation of agile practices in the model-driven workflow. Complete MDWE models can be built and generated by using lightweight modeling over User Interface mockups, and this process suggests being more efficient, in terms of errors and effort, than traditional modeling in MDWE."
pub.1151003976,Influence lines-based model updating of suspension bridges considering boundary conditions,"The boundary conditions of the main girder are complicated for suspension bridges. And they have a significant impact on the static and dynamic response of the structure. This study proposes a model updating method based on influence lines considering boundary conditions. First, rotational and translational spring elements are used to simulate the boundary conditions of the main girder. Then, rotational spring stiffness is estimated by constructing a sensitive objective function based on the influence lines. Translational spring stiffness is estimated by constructing a sensitive objective function based on the temperature-induced displacements at both ends of the girder. To improve calculation efficiency, a Gaussian process model is used instead of the finite element model (FEM). The estimation of boundary conditions is expressed as an optimization whose main goal is to iteratively estimate the boundary conditions to minimize the objective functions. After the boundary conditions are determined, the influence lines-based model updating is carried out by using the adaptive metamodel global optimization method. To validate the proposed method, a long-span suspension bridge is taken as a case study. The results show that the boundary conditions of the main girder have been successfully estimated. The accuracy of the model updating is improved after the boundary conditions are considered. The updated FEM with accurate boundary conditions can be a benchmark model for bridge damage identification or condition assessment."
pub.1107373016,Surrogate model of complex non-linear data for preliminary nacelle design,"Most response surface methods typically work on isotropically sampled data to predict a single variable and fitted with the aim of minimizing overall error. This study develops a metamodel for application in preliminary design of aircraft engine nacelles which is fitted to full-factorial data on two of the eight independent variables, and a Latin hypercube sampling on the other six. The specific set of accuracy requirements for the key nacelle aerodynamic performance metrics demand faithful reproduction of parts of the data to allow accurate prediction of gradients of the dependent variable, but permit less accuracy on other parts. The model is used to predict not just the independent variable but also its derivatives, and the Mach number, an independent variable, at which a certain condition is met. A simple Gaussian process model is shown to be unsuitable for this task. The new response surface method meets the requirements by normalizing the input data to exploit self-similarities in the data. It then decomposes the input data to interpolate orthogonal aerodynamic properties of nacelles independently of each other, and uses a set of filters and transformations to focus accuracy on predictions at relevant operating conditions. The new method meets all the requirements and presents a marked improvement over published preliminary nacelle design methods."

Thus many studies have been focusing on capitalizing knowledge and practices of systems engineering processes. We proposed in a former work a complete solution (SysPEM: System Process Engineering Metamodel) to this problem starting from the engineering process models to process orchestration and execution control. One of the main components of this solution is a scheduling engine able to reach balance between time consumption and the respective interest of each resource. But, as we implemented our solution in the context of a real-life case study, we noticed its inability to provide high quality schedules when the available resources are severely reduced, this limitation is due to the fact that the scheduling engine is limited to using the available resources given as input as an absolute constraint. In this paper we will provide a solution to this problem through the proposition of additional resources in a cost optimization context. Our work is strongly linked to our former publications, conveniently cited in this paper, as the completion of the original solution and, as we shall see at the end of the paper, shall be considered in the context of the same case study in order to review execution results."
pub.1061296055,Model-integrated development of embedded software,"The paper describes a model-integrated approach for embedded software development that is based on domain-specific, multiple-view models used in all phases of the development process. Models explicitly represent the embedded software and the environment it operates in, and capture the requirements and the design of the application, simultaneously. Models are descriptive , in the sense that they allow the formal analysis, verification, and validation of the embedded system at design time. Models are also generative, in the sense that they carry enough information for automatically generating embedded systems using the techniques of program generators. Because of the widely varying nature of embedded systems, a single modeling language may not be suitable for all domains; thus, modeling languages are often domain-specific. To decrease the cost of defining and integrating domain-specific modeling languages and corresponding analysis and synthesis tools, the model-integrated approach is applied in a metamodeling architecture, where formal models of domain-specific modeling languages-called metamodels-play a key role in customizing and connecting components of tool chains. This paper discusses the principles and techniques of model-integrated embedded software development in detail, as well as the capabilities of the tools supporting the process. Examples in terms of real systems will be given that illustrate how the model-integrated approach addresses the physical nature, the assurance issues, and the dynamic structure of embedded software."

technical, conceptual work products, such as diagnoses, treatment plans, care
coordination, and case management. We describe an automatic logic reasoner to
verify objective specifications for these highly technical, but abstract, work
products that are essential to care. The conceptual work products
specifications serve as a fundamental output requirement, which must be clearly
stated, correct and solvable. There is strategic importance for such
specifications because, in turn, they enable system model checking to verify
that machine functions taken with user procedures are actually able to achieve
these abstract products. We chose case management of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
outpatients as our use case for its challenging complexity. As a first step, we
illustrate how graphical class and state diagrams from UML can be developed and
critiqued with subject matter experts to serve as specifications of the
conceptual work product of case management. A key feature is that the
specification must be declarative and thus independent of any process or
technology. Our Work Domain Ontology with tools from Semantic Web is needed to
translate UML class and state diagrams for verification of solvability with
automatic reasoning. The solvable model will then be ready for subsequent use
with model checking on the system of human procedures and machine functions. We
used the expressive rule language SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN) to develop
formal representations of the UML class diagram, the state machine, and their
interactions. Using SPIN, we proved the consistency of the interactions of
static and dynamic concepts. We discussed how the new SPIN rule engine could be
incorporated in the Object Management Group (OMG) Ontology Definition Metamodel

Break-glass policies have been introduced as a sophisticated exception handling mechanism to resolve such situations. They enable certain subjects to break or override the standard access control policies of an information system in a controlled manner.ObjectiveIn the context of business process modeling a number of approaches exist that allow for the formal specification and modeling of process-related access control concepts. However, corresponding support for break-glass policies is still missing. In this paper, we aim at specifying a break-glass extension for process-related role-based access control (RBAC) models.MethodWe use model-driven development (MDD) techniques to provide an integrated, tool-supported approach for the definition and enforcement of break-glass policies in process-aware information systems. In particular, we provide modeling support on the computation independent model (CIM) layer as well as on the platform independent model (PIM) and platform specific model (PSM) layers.ResultsOur approach is generic in the sense that it can be used to extend process-aware information systems or process modeling languages with support for process-related RBAC and corresponding break-glass policies. Based on the formal CIM layer metamodel, we present a UML extension on the PIM layer that allows for the integrated modeling of processes and process-related break-glass policies via extended UML Activity diagrams. We evaluated our approach in a case study on real-world processes. Moreover, we implemented our approach at the PSM layer as an extension to the BusinessActivity library and runtime engine.ConclusionOur integrated modeling approach for process-related break-glass policies allows for specifying break-glass rules in process-aware information systems."
pub.1062959517,DEFINING SOFTWARE PROCESS MODEL CONSTRAINTS WITH RULES USING OWL AND SWRL,"The Software & Systems Process Engineering meta-model (SPEM) allows the modelling of software processes using OMG (Object Management Group) standards such as the MOF (Meta-Object Facility) and UML (Unified Modelling Language) making it possible to represent software processes using tools compliant with UML. Process definition encompasses both the static and dynamic structure of roles, tasks and work products together with imposed constraints on those elements. However, the latter requires support for constraint enforcement that is not always directly available in SPEM. Such constraint-checking behaviour could be used to detect possible mismatches between process definitions and the actual processes being carried out in the course of a project. This paper approaches the modelling of such constraints using the SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language), which is a W3C recommendation. To do so, we need to first represent generic processes modelled with SPEM using an underlying ontology based on the OWL (Ontology Web Language) representation together with data derived from actual projects."
pub.1046204203,Prototype to Support Morphism between BPMN Collaborative Process Model and Collaborative SOA Architecture Model,"In a collaborative context, the integration of industrial partners deeply depends of the ability to use a collaborative architecture to interact efficiently. In this paper, we propose to tackle this point according to the fact that partners of the collaboration respect SOA (Service-Oriented Approach) concepts. We propose to design such a collaborative SOA architecture according to MDA (model-Driven Approach) principles. We aim at using business model (the needs) to design a logical model of a solution (logical architecture). The business model is a collaborative business model (in BPMN, at the CIM level), while the logical model is a collaborative architecture model (using UML, at the PIM level). This paper presents the theoretical aspects of this subject, the mechanisms of morphism and the dedicated translation rules. Finally, we show the prototype of a demonstration tool embedding the transformation rules and running those principles."
pub.1044699709,Integration between enterprise process monitoring and controlling system and enterprise application,"The relationships and the features of integration between Enterprise Process Monitoring and Controlling System (EPMCS) and Enterprise Process Related Applications (EPRA) were analyzed. An integration architecture centered on EPMCS was presented, in which there were four layers to connect from EPMCS to EPRA:EPMCS, application integration layer, transport layer and EPRA, and there were four layers used to etstablish integration: presentation layer, function layer, data layer and system layer. The frameworks to connect EPMCS and EPRA were designed, that Enterprise-Independent Model (EIM), Enterprise-Specific Model (ESM) and meta-model to describe these two models were defined. The method to integrate data based on XML was designed to exchange data from EPMCS to EPRA according to the mapping between EIM and ESM. The approches are suitable for integrating EPMCS and systems in Product Data Management (PDM), project management and enterprise business management."
pub.1050977842,A service-oriented travel portal and engineering platform,"A service-oriented travel portal is proposed to realize a classic business model with SOA paradigm. It provides tourists with composite travel packages through dynamic composition among travel-related services from distributed providers and across business domains. Further, a devoted service-oriented engineering platform (SOEP) is reengineered and customized for travel portals based on authors’ previous work and a travel portal project’s use scenario. The platform is driven by four models: service meta-model, process model, business model and global information model. These models support semantic description and rational operations of the application, and facilitate travel service discovery, process execution and business to business integration. The travel portal provides a real SOA application and well-defined business and service cases to improve the platform. The SOEP provides a professional implementation environment for service-oriented travel portals, and it could be customized for the service-oriented systems of other industries using a similar framework and approaches to those presented in this article."

Therefore, MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) and CBSD (Component Based Software Development) methods were introduced. Firstly, the architecture of enterprise information system development process which is driven by CIM (Computational Independent Model) was proposed. It realized the quick development process based on MDA and quick building and implementation process based on software component of enterprise information system. Then, based on this architecture, CIM was studied in details, including the study of meta-models and basic concepts of global model and business model. Global model was composed of global business analysis model and global business model, and business model was composed of function/process model, organization model and information model. Finally, a global model example was built to validate the practicability and feasibility of this modeling method which ensure the quick development process."
pub.1095534739,Conceptual Alignment Between SPEM-Based Processes and CMMI,"In the course of process improvement, software organizations attempt to concurrently implement practices that originate from different models, extracting the best from each. Issues of integration and compliance are raised due to missing conceptual view. This paper presents a new method for an explicit alignment between SPEM-based software process modeling and CMMI corpus of best practices. The alignment of process activities with CMMI goes beyond the maturity assessment; it sustains the conceptualization of introducing new software engineering practices at the process-level and open a new topic of combining conceptually parts of different process models. Our method extends the SPEM Meta-model by introducing new interface to CMMI Meta-data. This extension allows visualization of the practices' intentions within the activity breakdown structure. In addition, it offers a conceptual assessment of process maturity level according to CMMI scales. The method has been fully implemented in a process modeling tool and applied in both academic and industrial contexts to justify improvement opportunities through meaningful dashboards."
pub.1050828977,Caste-Centric Development of Agent-Oriented Information Systems,"Based on the meta-model of information systems presented in Zhu (2006), this chapter presents a caste-centric agent-oriented methodology for evolutionary and collaborative development of information systems. It consists of a process model called growth model, and a set of agent-oriented languages and software tools that support various development activities in the process. At the requirements analysis phase, a modelling language and environment called CAMLE supports the analysis and design of information systems. The semi-formal models in CAMLE can be automatically transformed into formal specifications in SLABS, which is a formal specification language designed for formal engineering of multi-agent systems. At implementation, agent-oriented information systems are implemented directly in an agent-oriented programming language called SLABSp. The features of agent-oriented information systems in general and our methodology in particular are illustrated by an example throughout the chapter."
pub.1042329155,Tailoring Groupware: The Cooperative Hypermedia Approach,"Tailoring groupware has to deal with adapting properties of a shared information space as well as with adapting properties of the cooperation support to the group's needs. In this paper, an approach for tailoring both aspects of groupware in an integrated fashion is proposed. This approach uses cooperative hypermedia as a unifying representation of shared information structures, functionality, and the coordination medium of a shared application. It enables cooperative definition of shared information structures, shared process models and their access models not only before collaboration starts, but also on the fly, when emergent processes evolve. The proposed approach addresses tailoring at all stages of the development and use of a groupware application. A prototype system called CHIPS is presented and different possibilities of tailoring in CHIPS are discussed. Examples of CHIPS demonstrate that the cooperative hypermedia approach to tailoring groupware can support the adaptation to different evolving tasks and processes performed by changing teams."

During the development process, models specified by use of these diagram types have to be transformed into corresponding code. In the past, mainly class diagrams and state diagrams have been considered for an automatic code generation. In this paper, we focus on collaboration diagrams. As an important prerequisite for a consistent transformation into Java code, we first provide methodical guidelines on how to deploy collaboration diagrams to model functional behavior. This understanding yields a refined meta model and forms the base for the definition of a transformation algorithm. The automatically generated Java code fragments build a substantial part of the functionality and prevent the loss of important information during the transition from a model to its implementation."
pub.1094561381,A Model-Driven Safety Certification Method for Process Compliance,"A safety case is a contextualized structured argument constituted of process and product-based sub-arguments to show that a system is acceptably safe. The creation of a safety case is an extremely time-consuming and costly activity needed for certification purposes. To reduce time and cost, reuse as well as automatic generation possibilities represent urgent research directions. In this paper, we focus on safety processes mandated by prescriptive standards and we identify process-related structures from which process-based arguments (those aimed at showing that a required development process has been applied according to the standard) can be generated and more easily reused. Then, we propose a model-driven safety certification method to derive those arguments as goal structures given in Goal Structuring Notation from process models given in compliance with Software Process Engineering Meta-model 2.0. The method is illustrated by generating process-based arguments in the context of ISO 26262."
pub.1052250228,A generic approach to support a way-of-working definition,"Information System Engineering has made the assumption that an Information System is supposed to capture some excerpt of the real world history and hence has concentrated on systems modelling. Very little attention has been paid to the conceptual modelling process. However the emphasis on system modelling is shifting to process modelling. The particular process modelling approach being presented in this paper advocates the definition of a way-of-working (i.e. process models) to control and guide developers. The paper introduces a classification of the various kinds of evolution of objects and presents a decision-oriented process meta model to structure ways-of-working. We also describe some guidelines, related to our classification of object evolutions, to support method engineers in the task to define a way-of-working."

This paper proposes a multi-model driven collaborative development platform for service-oriented e-Business systems. The platform provides three views, i.e., business view, process view, and service view to support service-oriented software engineering, top-down business planning and bottom-up service-oriented application development. Business and technical consultants can collaborate from distributed sites of, e.g., clients and IT vendors to provide their clients' with rapid development and demonstration.

MBASafe is a recently proposed and potentially innovative design and verification process. In the presence of compelling arguments concerning its adequacy as process evidence, MBASafe could support the safety claims within the required safety cases. In this paper, we contribute to partially justify the adequacy of MBASafe to act as process evidence. To do that, we first manually check if MBASafe includes EN 50128-compliant process elements, then we model MBASafe in compliance with Software Process Engineering Meta-model 2.0, then, we derive process-based arguments from the MBASafe process model by using MDSafeCer, the recently introduced Model Driven Safety Certification method. By doing so, we provide a twofold contribution: we further validate MDSafeCer in the rail domain and we strengthen MBASafe."
pub.1046654425,A meta model for access control,"Security policy enforcement is instrumental in preventing the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, protecting the integrity of vital data, mitigating the likelihood of fraud, and ultimately enabling the secure sharing of information. In accessing a given resource, policy may dictate, for example that a user has a need-to-know, is appropriately cleared, is competent, has not already performed a different operation on the same resource, the resource was previously accessed by a different user, is incapable of accessing other enterprise resources, or is capable of accessing an object or any copy of the object while performing a specific task. Currently, there exist a rich set of formal security models that can translate organizational policies. A small sample of well documented policies include, avors of Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ORCON, Chinese wall, and History-Based Separation of Duty. Enterprise policies that are designed to protect resources are also ad-hoc in nature. As a major component of any operating system or application, access control mechanisms come in a wide variety of forms, each with their individual method for authentication, access control data constructs for specifying and managing policy, and functions for making access control decisions and enforcement of policies. Of the numerous recognized access control policies, today's OSs rigidly limit enforcement to a small subset of known policies. Policies are also routinely accommodated through the implementation of access control mechanisms within applications. Prominent among these applications are database management systems, but these applications can also include a number of smaller applications such as enterprise calendars, time and attendance, and workflow management. Essentially, any application that requires a user's authentication, typically also affords an independent access control service. Not only do these applications further aggravate identity and privilege management problems, applications can also undermine policy enforcement objectives. For instance, although a file management system may narrowly restrict user access to a specific file, chances are the content of that file can be copied to an attachment or a message and mailed to anyone in the organization, or for that matter, the world. In consideration of these issues an important question is raised - does a Meta model exist that can serve as a unifying framework for specifying and comprehensively enforcing any access control policy? Some may argue that convergence towards a Meta model is already underway. For example, RBAC, and XACML have been shown effective in their specification and enforcement of access control policies and have been applied in providing interoperable protection. Is RBAC fundamental to access control and can it eventually be extended and tinkered with to accommodate any policy? RBAC has already been shown to be a"
pub.1030557969,Specification of behavioral anti-patterns for the verification of block-structured Collaborative Business Processes,"Context: The verification of the control flow of a Collaborative Business Process (CBP) is important when developing cross-organizational systems, since the control flow defines the behavior of the cross-organizational collaboration. Behavioral anti-patterns have been proposed to improve the performance of formal verification methods. However, a systematic approach for the discovery and specification of behavioral anti-patterns of CBPs has not been proposed so far.Objective: The aim of this work is an approach to systematically discover and specify the behavioral anti-patterns of block-structured CBP models.Method: The approach proposes using the metamodel of a CBP language to discover all possible combinations of constructs leading to a problem in the behavior of block-structured CBPs. Each combination is called minimal CBP. The set of all minimal CBPs with behavioral problems defines the unsoundness profile of a CBP language, from which is possible specifying the behavioral anti-patterns of such language.Results: The approach for specification of behavioral anti-patterns was applied to the UP-ColBPIP language. Twelve behavioral anti-patterns were defined, including support to complex control flow such as advanced synchronization, cancellation and exception management, and multiple instances. Anti-patterns were evaluated on a repository of block-structured CBP models and compared with a formal verification method. Results show that the verification based on anti-patterns is as accurate as the formal method, but it clearly improves the performance of the latter.Conclusion: By using the proposed approach, it is possible to systematically specify behavioral anti-patterns for block-structured CBP languages. During the discovery of anti-patterns different formalisms can be used. With this approach, the specification of anti-patterns provides the exact combination of elements that can cause a problem, making error correction and result interpretation easier. Although the proposed approach was defined for the context of CBPs, it could be applied to the context of intra-organizational processes."
pub.1009271099,A Cellular Automata-Ready GIS Infrastructure for Geosimulation and Territorial Analysis,"This paper presents an integrated GIS and cellular automata (CA) modelling and simulation environment. We hold that several concurrent facts offer the necessary critical mass to foster the development of robust and scalable general-purpose CA-modelling tools that go beyond demonstrative proof-of-concept status, allowing thus fully operational modelling and simulation of real-world territorial systems. Among these facts, we can mention the entering of the CA-based geosimulation modelling in its age of maturity, the growing computational capabilities of nowadays computers, the consolidation of general-purpose as well as specialised GIS-based geo-analysis methodologies and their availability as open-source libraries and applications. The environment hereby described is an example of a way to obtain such robust and general-purpose CA-modelling tool-box. Its main characteristics are (1) tight interoperability between GIS and CAs, (2) a sufficiently generalised and flexible underlying CA meta-model allowing for the implementation of a variety of types of CA models, (3) computationally efficiency and (4) user-friendliness. We furthermore present two test case applications to illustrate a standard operational modelling workflow within this simulation environment and to briefly illustrate its look-and-feel."

pub.1165008400,Scaling of Lean Aeronautical Gas Turbine Combustors,"Abstract A numerical procedure is presented for the scaling of lean aeronautical gas turbine combustors to different thrust classes. The procedure considers multiple operating points and aims for a self-similar flow field with respect to a reference configuration. The developed scaling approach relies on an optimization-based workflow which involves automated geometry and numerical grid generation, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) simulations, and postprocessing of the reacting flow field. Kriging is applied as a metamodel to identify new sets of parameters for combustor geometry generation. A generic lean-burn high-pressure aeronautical combustor has been designed to serve as a first verification test case with reactive flow characteristics comparable to real combustion chambers. The burner geometry is parameterized by 23 free parameters which are altered within the scaling process. The definition of a suitable scaling function is essential for the success of the scaling approach. A scaling function based on pressure loss, axial location of heat release, pilot air split, and the temperature profile at the combustor exit is proposed. The developed procedure is tested and applied for the scaling of an internally-staged lean combustor to a lower thrust class considering multiple operating points simultaneously. In total, 65 different combustor variants have been evaluated by the scaling procedure. Simulations were performed for each of these configurations at takeoff, approach, and idle operating conditions. The final combustor configuration, scaled to a lower thrust class, shows good agreement to the reference configuration in terms of the scaling targets and reasonably resembles the emission indices. Integrating the scaling procedure into the design process of future combustion systems could reduce the required design iterations and thereby contribute to significantly reduced development times and costs."

The object of interest is a real-life industrial model of an elastoviscoplastic high-pressure turbine blade subjected to thermal, centrifugal and pressure loadings. The main contribution of this work is the application of the complete ROM-net workflow to the quantification of the uncertainty of dual quantities on this blade (such as the accumulated plastic strain and the stress tensor), generated by the uncertainty of the temperature loading field. The dictionary-based ROM-net computes predictions of dual quantities of interest for 1008 Monte Carlo draws of the temperature loading field in 2 h and 48 min, which corresponds to a speedup greater than 600 with respect to a reference parallel solver using domain decomposition, with a relative error in the order of 2%. Another contribution of this work consists in the derivation of a meta-model to reconstruct the dual quantities of interest over the complete mesh from their values on the reduced integration points.

pub.1085071272,Visual Simple Transformations,"Empowering end-users to wire Internet of Things (IoT) objects (things and services) together would allow them to more easily conceive and realize interesting IoT solutions. A challenge lies in devising a simple end-user development approach to support the specification of transformations, which can bridge the mismatch in the data being exchanged among IoT objects. To tackle this challenge, we present Visual Simple Transformations (ViSiT) as an approach that allows end-users to use a jigsaw puzzle metaphor for specifying transformations that are automatically converted into underlying executable workflows. ViSiT is explained by presenting meta-models and an architecture for implementing a system of connected IoT objects. A tool is provided for supporting end-users in visually developing and testing transformations. Another tool is also provided for allowing software developers to modify, if they wish, a transformation's underlying implementation. This work was evaluated from a technical perspective by developing transformations and measuring ViSiT's efficiency and scalability and by constructing an example application to show ViSiT's practicality. A study was conducted to evaluate this work from an end-user perspective, and its results showed positive indications of perceived usability, learnability, and the ability to conceive real-life scenarios for ViSiT."
pub.1114025475,Ontology-based Software Capability Container for RESTful APIs,"Software reuse and REST-based Web Applications resulted from open initiatives become an interesting opportunity for companies to save effort, time and cost during the design and development of new business needs. Gather and qualify these services in a container helps to discover, match and reuse them in developing new business applications for companies. Our objective in this work is the design of a software capability container offering a wider view qualification for REST-based services. Moreover, we aim to enrich the designed container with semantic elements to ease the discovery and the selection of the qualified services. In this purpose, we define an ontology based on a proposed Enterprise Architecture Capability Profile offering a qualification covering business, operational and technical aspects for services. Ontologies are widely acknowledged as a means to specify explicitly the meaning of concepts in a domain of interest, and to facilitate consistent sharing of data and knowledge pertaining to them. The qualification profile is based on a proposed meta-model that helps to retrieve and gather initial requirements used to guide the development of existing REST-based Web Applications. Furthermore, a Framework is proposed to exploit the designed container in order to respond to users requirements for developing future business process and efficiently reuse the qualified services. Our contribution aims to upgrade technical components to the level of end-users requirements. This helps to accelerate business application development and improve the reuse and sustainability of existing services."
pub.1049227020,21 Application of Quality Standards to Multiple Artifacts with a Universal Compliance Solution,"For standards compliance achievement in model-based engineering of embedded real-time systems, model analyzers and code checkers are constituted in early development phases to lower error rates and to eliminate time-consuming quality reviews. However, solutions available today only address a single modeling language and examinations are localized to specific development environments. Fulfilling more advanced traceability examinations required by procedural and technical quality standards, compliance checking has to be applicable across different modeling tools and development workflows. Furthermore it should cover correlation analyses that include model-to-model, model-to-file and model-to-database comparisons on multiple artifacts. This chapter introduces a novel compliance solution Assessment Studio that supports universal guideline and traceability checking with automated analyses in multi-domain modeling environments. MESA, our meta-modeling approach for guideline checking, was enhanced to support multiple meta-models with associated artifacts. Therefore, we use a XML-based transformation and proof mechanism by automatically executing rules written in LINQ, adding auto-correction and metrics measurement capabilities. Several case studies demonstrate the feasibility of this approach at Volkswagen."
pub.1169584336,Ensemble forecasts of marine flood maps assisted by probabilistic machine learning techniques: Application at Arcachon Lagoon (France),"Recent advances in high performance computing have enabled numerical weather prediction systems to move from deterministic to probabilistic forecasting using Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPS). While EPS are increasingly used to predict river flows and induced floods in several countries, it is only emerging for marine flooding. Despite ongoing efforts to develop new generations of high performance hydrodynamic models accounting for complex processes, the main challenge still remains the computer power required to run multiple simulations with a chain of models of increasing resolutions (from a hundred meters for water level at the coast, to a few meters for coastal waves and marine flooding). To overcome this limitation, the machine-learning-based metamodelling approach has made great progresses in this field of application. Through a statistical analysis of pre-calculated training databases, metamodels can predict key flooding indicators (surge, discharge, water depth, etc.) at a given spatial locations of interest within reasonable time and computing resources while preserving the accuracy of full process models. Yet, some issues remain to push this approach toward operational applications: (1) the production of spatialized indicators with metamodels such as inland water depth maps, (2) the characterization of the cascading sources of uncertainties throughout the entire chain. To address these difficulties, we use a set of numerical simulation results of about 200 flood maps computed on the Arcachon Lagoon (Gironde, France) for a large variety of randomly-generated metoceanic forcing conditions (surge, tide, wave and wind). On this basis, a metamodeling procedure is developed by combining a non-linear dimension reduction method relying on deep-learning-based autoencoders, denoted AE (to represent the very high-dimensional spatialized output) and on Gaussian process (Gp) regression (to model the link between the metoceanic forcing conditions and the flood response). Cross validation and comparison to historical real cases (such as storms Xynthia and Klaus) show satisfying predictive capability. However, the concern is the model uncertainty that affects the different steps of the whole metamodeling procedure. To quantify it, we rely on a stochastic approach that combines conditional Gp simulations with AE random responses using Monte Carlo Dropout method. In order to discuss predictive uncertainty to support decision-making for real-time forecasts, we compare the impact of metamodelling uncertainty with that induced by the variability of metoceanic forcing conditions which are modelled on the basis of the Meteo-France ensemble named PEARP ""Prévision d'Ensemble ARPege"" for recent storm events, as well as for synthetic marine inundation events."
pub.1026004082,Multi-objective optimal design of online PID controllers using model predictive control based on the group method of data handling-type neural networks,"In this paper, model predictive control (MPC) is used for optimal selection of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller gains. In conventional tuning methods a history of response error of the system under control in the passed time is measured and used to adjust PID parameters in order to improve the performance of the system in proceeding time. But MPC obviates this characteristic of classic PID. In fact MPC tries to tune the controller by predicting the system's behaviour some time steps ahead. In this way, PID parameters are adjusted before any real error occurs in the system's response. For this purpose, polynomial meta-models based on the evolved group method of data handling neural networks are obtained to simply simulate the time response of the dynamic system. Moreover, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm has been used in a multi-objective Pareto optimisation to select the parameters of the MPC which are prediction horizon, control horizon and relation of weight of Δ u and error, to minimise simultaneously two objective functions that are control effort and integral time absolute error of the system response. The results mentioned at the end obviously declare that the proposed method surpasses conventional tuning methods for PID controllers, and Pareto optimal selection of predictive parameters also improves the performance of the introduced method."
pub.1168607554,A Computational Study on Adaptive Multiobjective Optimization of Blowout Preventer Valve System,"Abstract A blowout preventer (BOP) is a large valve that acts as a critical well control unit against oil, gas, and water overflow and well blowout. The BOP valve body assembly contains the main pressure-containing parts. For example, in deepwater or coiled tubing drilling operations for oil and gas, the BOP can be subjected to sustained high pressure cycles. These cycles may cause the concentration of stresses in some regions, which could result in cracks or fatigue damage. Once the BOP fails during the emergency shut-in process, a blowout accident can occur, which may lead to casualties and major economic losses. To ensure the structural integrity under service loads, the BOP valve body should be designed to fulfill the stress requirements as defined by the American Petroleum Institute (API) Specification 16A, 17G and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Division 2. It is necessary to ensure that the BOP valve can safely withstand the working pressure. However, overengineering the BOP design is undesirable as well in terms of value engineering because it wastes both time and money. Therefore, there is a strong need to efficiently explore the full design space and identify the optimal solution that results in a compromise between the competing objectives under the constraints for the BOP valve design. In this paper, a methodology is presented for integrating computer-aided design (CAD) nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA), and optimization package to enable adaptive multiobjective optimization and virtual verification and validation (V&V) for the BOP valve system. The BOP valve assembly is parameterized before being imported into an FEA solver. The FEA workflow is automated such that once a set of geometric parameters are given, the preprocessing, solving, and postprocessing steps can be completed automatically. Based on the automated FEA workflow with advanced optimizer (adaptive metamodel of optimal prognosis (AMOP) in Ansys™ OptiSLang), the BOP valve body design space is efficiently explored. The Pareto-optimal design points with respect to two completing design objectives on structural integrity and weight reduction are discovered. This process had never been done in the past. The optimal design set recommended from the optimization algorithm is finally sent to the three-dimensional nonlinear FEA solver for virtual V&V per the API Spec and ASME code compliance. The automated design optimization approach demonstrated in this paper could considerably enhance the product performance and reliability and, in the meantime, minimize product development cost."
pub.1019748853,Bayesian Metamodeling for Computer Experiments Using the Gaussian Kriging Models,"In the past two decades, more and more quality and reliability activities have been moving into the design of product and process. The design and analysis of computer experiments, as a new frontier of the design of experiments, has become increasingly popular among modern companies for optimizing product and process conditions and producing high‐quality yet low‐cost products and processes. This article mainly focuses on the issue of constructing cheap metamodels as alternatives to the expensive computer simulators and proposes a new metamodeling method on the basis of the Gaussian stochastic process model or Gaussian Kriging. Rather than a constant mean as in ordinary Kriging or a fixed mean function as in universal Kriging, the new method captures the overall trend of the performance characteristics of products and processes through a more accurate mean, by efficiently incorporating a scheme of sparseness prior–based Bayesian inference into Kriging. Meanwhile, the mean model is able to adaptively exclude the unimportant effects that deteriorate the prediction performance. The results of an experiment on empirical applications demonstrate that, compared with several benchmark methods in the literature, the proposed Bayesian method is not only much more effective in approximation but also very efficient in implementation, hence more appropriate than the widely used ordinary Kriging to empirical applications in the real world.

                  This paper investigates the computational behaviors of simple-to-use, relatively fast, and versatile machine learning (ML) methods to predict apparent viscosity, a key rheological property of nanoparticle-surfactant-stabilized CO2 foam in unconventional reservoir fracturing.
                  The first novelty of our study is the investigation of the predictive performance of ML approaches as viable alternatives for predicting the apparent viscosity of NP-Surf-CO2 foams. The predictive and computational performance of five nonlinear ML algorithms were first compared. Support vector regression (SVR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), classification and regression trees (CART), feed-forward multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and multivariate polynomial regression (MPR) algorithms were used to create models. Temperature, foam quality, pressure, salinity, shear rate, nanoparticle size, nanoparticle concentration, and surfactant concentration were identified as relevant input parameters using principal component analysis (PCA). A data set containing 329 experimental data records was used in the study. In building the models, 80% of the data set was used for training and 20% of the data set for testing.
                  Another unique aspect of this research is the examination of diverse ensemble learning techniques for improving computational performance. We developed meta-models of the generated models by implementing various ensemble learning algorithms (bagging, boosting, and stacking). This was done to explore and compare the computational and predictive performance enhancements of the base models (if any).
                  To determine the relative significance of the input parameters on prediction accuracy, we used permutation feature importance (PFI). We also investigated how the SVR model made its predictions by utilizing the SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique to quantify the influence of each input parameter on prediction. This work’s application of the SHAP approach in the interpretation of ML findings in predicting apparent viscosity is also novel.
                  On the test data, the SVR model in this work had the best predictive performance of the single models, with an R2 of 0.979, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.885 cp, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.320 cp. Blending, a variant of the stacking ensemble technique, significantly improved this performance. With an R2 of 1.0, RMSE of 0.094 cp, and MAE of 0.087 cp, an SVR-based meta-model ensembled with blending outperformed all single and ensemble models in predicting apparent viscosity. However, in terms of computational time, the blended SVR-based meta-model did not outperform any of its constituent models. PCA and PFI ranked temperature as the most important factor in predicting the apparent viscosity of NP-Surf-CO2 foams. The ML approach used in this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the nonlinear relationship between "
pub.1093965257,Towards Change Propagating Test Models in Autonomic and Adaptive Systems,"Autonomic and adaptive computing systems can add, remove, and replace their own components in response to a changing environment. Self-adaptation facilitates the performance of automated maintenance and configuration tasks, but makes it possible for faults to be introduced into the software at runtime. To address this issue, researchers have developed approaches for integrating runtime testing into autonomic and adaptive software systems. An important aspect of runtime testing approaches for autonomic software is the provision of a framework for regression testing, which determines whether modifications have introduced faults into previously tested components. However, after adaptation occurs in autonomic software, a predefined test set may no longer be applicable due to changes in the program structure. Investigating techniques for dynamically updating regression tests after adaptation is therefore necessary to ensure such approaches can be applied in practice. In this paper we describe a model-driven approach that maps structural adaptations in autonomic software, to updates for its runtime test model. We provide a workflow and meta-model to support the approach, referred to as Test Information Propagation (TIP). To demonstrate TIP, we have developed a prototype that simulates a reductive change to an autonomic, service-oriented healthcare application. Conducting the simulation has provided us with much insight into this highly challenging research problem."
pub.1092774840,Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of a Mixed Flow Turbine Wheel,"Designing turbine wheels for automotive turbochargers one is faced with a multidisciplinary design problem with many input and output parameters. Especially in the automotive industry short development cycles for high quality products in a competitive environment are daily routine. For meeting these requirements optimization algorithms can be a powerful tool in the design process. This paper presents the multidisciplinary optimization of an automotive mixed flow turbine wheel used in a 4 cylinder 1.6 l spark ignition engine. Before describing the optimization workflow in detail, the requirements for turbines operating in an automotive environment under pulsating flow conditions and during an engine load step are discussed. From there objectives for a multidisciplinary optimization are derived. The turbine wheel is optimized with respect to maximizing efficiency in two design points and minimizing its moment of inertia. For the optimization process, an algorithm based on evolution theory is used. As constraints, the operating points are fixed and the natural frequencies are limited to ensure the mechanical strength of the turbine. To speed up the optimization process meta models based on neural networks are applied. Three designs of the Pareto frontier are chosen and their characteristics are discussed. Using statistical methods, the interaction of the input variables and their impact on turbine performance are presented.Copyright © 2012 by ASME"

Potential for its use also exists in product development (PD) activities due to the amount of data generated and processed. Nevertheless, there are problems in applying the technology. This paper addresses current challenges based on a literature review, considering three disciplines that are necessary for the scope of this paper as a minimum: AI itself, information technology infrastructures (ITI) in context of digital transformation (DT), and PD as an application area. Building on the basic considerations of the state of the art, a link between the domains is established by outlining a possible reference framework towards the utilization of AI applications in PD. This enables an expanded interdisciplinary understanding. Key obstacles appear specifically to be difficult collaboration conditions between the disciplines of PD and AI applications development due to communication problems. Reasons for this include:   – Meta models of PD do not provide a sufficient information base   – Lack of standardized process models for the deployment of AI   "
pub.1044507883,Evidence-Based Usability Engineering,"In this paper we propose an approach for the systematic integration of human-centered design (HCD) methods throughout the whole software development process called evidence-based usability engineering. We derive our approach from six claims that emphasize shortcomings and urgent requirements of current HCD practice. Instead of clinging to a fixed process model of the usability engineering process our approach advocates a paradigm of situated decision making. It enables software development teams to select optimal sets of HCD methods that match the engineering task at hand based on the cumulated experience of the software development organization. Qualitative and quantitative feedback on the efficiency of HCD methods is collected and integrated across project boundaries. Our approach is connected to existing process improvement frameworks such as UMM (Usability Maturity Model) via a meta-model. We present a first prototype of a novel kind of computer-aided usability engineering environment called ProUSE, that supports our evidence-based usability engineering approach."
pub.1036899161,A Study on Geospatial Constrained Process Modeling Using UML Activity Diagrams,"This paper studies an extended process model under geospatial constraints using UML 2.0 activity diagrams. The geometry (i.e. point, line and polygon) models and geospatial relationship (i.e. measurement, sequential, and topology) models used in the paper are tailored from OGC and ISO/TC 211 standards with respect to requirements of process management. On the basis of these models, the paper analyzes how geospatial information restrains activities in process meta-model and how it acts on activities. Further, an UML profile is derived based on UML activity diagrams, and is validated by a case scenario. The contribution of this paper is marked as two points. First, the geometry models and geospatial relationship models proposed in this paper are based on abstract specification of international standards, making them better for understanding, sharing, and exchanging. Second, the geospatial constraints relied on geospatial relationship models adapt to most cases in process modeling, making them more generalizable and extendable."
pub.1029085854,How to choose the simulation model for computer experiments: a local approach,"In many scientific areas, non‐stochastic simulation models such as finite element simulations replace real experiments. A common approach is to fit a meta‐model, for example a Gaussian process model, a radial basis function interpolation, or a kernel interpolation, to computer experiments conducted with the simulation model. This article deals with situations where more than one simulation model is available for the same real experiment, with none being the best over all possible input combinations. From fitted models for a real experiment as well as for computer experiments using the different simulation models, a criterion is derived to identify the locally best one. Applying this criterion to a number of design points allows the design space to be split into areas where the individual simulation models are locally superior. An example from sheet metal forming is analyzed, where three different simulation models are available. In this application and many similar problems, the new approach provides valuable assistance with the choice of the simulation model to be used. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Its benefits are well received in academia and industry. To fully utilize the benefits, there should be effective methodologies to support the development of SaaS services which provide high reusability and applicability. Conventional approaches such as object-oriented methods do not effectively support SaaS-specific engineering activities such as modeling common features, variability, and designing quality services. In this paper, we present a systematic process for developing high quality SaaS and highlight the essentiality of commonality and variability (C&V) modeling to maximize the reusability. We first define criteria for designing the process model and provide a theoretical foundation for SaaS; its meta-model and C&V model. We clarify the notion of commonality and variability in SaaS, and propose a SaaS development process which is accompanied with engineering instructions. Using the proposed process, SaaS services with high quality can be effectively developed."
pub.1045095285,Promoting MBA in the rail sector by deriving process-related evidence via MDSafeCer,"An EN 50129-compliant safety case should include process-related evidence in terms of quality as well as safety management. Potentially innovative engineering methods developed in academic settings could act as process-related evidence. However, to ease their acceptance within the rail industrial settings, the adequacy of these methods need to be justified. In this paper, we extend our previous work and we provide a broader justification including performance aspects aimed at showing that the entire MBA (Model-Based design methodology for Assessing performance and safety requirements of critical systems) is partly compliant with EN 50128. To do that, we tackle safety and performance process-related compliance as follows: we first manually check if MBA includes EN 50128-compliant process elements, then we model MBA in compliance with Software Process Engineering Meta-model 2.0, then, we derive process-based arguments from the MBA process model by using the MDSafeCer (Model Driven Safety Certification) method. By doing so, we provide a twofold contribution: we further validate MDSafeCer in the rail domain and we strengthen MBA."
pub.1124832175,Model-driven degradation modeling approaches: Investigation and review,"The second law of thermodynamics implies that any animate and inanimate systems degrade and inevitably stops functioning. It is irreversible over time that can be labeled as “the degradation arrow of time”. From perspective of products’ reliability design, it is essential to build appropriate models of describing the degradation arrow of time. The current modeling approaches mainly include the model-driven (having assumed forms based on cognitive experience of mankind) and data-driven (using data learning techniques without form hypothesis) approaches. In this paper, we just investigate and review the model-driven degradation approaches, hoping to provide suggestions of the model construction or selection for scholars or engineers. First, for the single mechanism, degradation law models and stochastic process models are classified as separately depicting the tendency and fluctuation of degradation. For the degradation law model, we propose the concept of meta-models as original types for various personal models. For the stochastic process model, two main types including the non-monotonic and monotonical types are presented. Then, four multi-mechanism degradation types are discussed, that are competitive degradation, multi-stage degradation, coexistence of degradation and impact, and coexistence of degradation and failure. Besides, for the multi-performance degradation, independent and coupling models are introduced. The forms, connotations, applicability and insufficiency of these models are described with a series of examples from the literature and our own experiences. The final explicit suggestions about the potential future work are provided for the development of new degradation models."
pub.1158153950,Optimization of the Mixing in a Produced Water Storage Tank with CFD,"In recent years, produced water recycling and reuse has been one of the most discussed topics in water treatment in the oil and gas industry. As with conventional wastewater treatment, some important processes of produced water treatment include filtration, solid content settling, oxidation, disinfection, and storage. As such, mixing efficiency is one of the important aspects when designing a treatment and recycling system. With the help of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods, the design and optimization of such systems becomes feasible by accurately simulating the hydraulic, mixing, and settling characteristics of a flow field. Through CFD analysis and system configuration optimization, the efficiency of the treatment process can be improved, which results in a reduction in operation costs. Artificial neural network (ANN) based metamodel is a mathematical simulation of a complex multi-dimensional system. To train such a model, a properly selected large-scale data set is required. However, these data would be both time and resource consuming to obtain with conventional physical experiments. With the help of CFD simulations, the data for the training process becomes easier to get from the virtual parametric study. As a set of mathematical equations, the developed ANN can provide a relative accurate prediction in a much shorter time, which will be a useful tool for the practical applications. This study explores the use of CFD modeling to simulate the mixing process in one of the most common water containing devices in Permian basins: above-ground storage tanks (AST). The first part of this study details how CFD, coupled with design of experiments methods (DOE) and post-processing automation, can quickly understand the relative importance and cross-correlations of various design elements to the mixing quality. The second part of the study introduces an artificial intelligence algorithm to the workflow to carry out an optimization of the AST tank design."
pub.1006816274,A Bayesian Approach to Sequential Optimization based on Computer Experiments,"Computer experiments are used frequently for the study and improvement of a process under study. Optimizing such process based on a computer model is costly, so an approximation of the computer model, or metamodel, is used. Efficient global optimization (EGO) is a sequential optimization method for computer experiments based on a Gaussian process model approximation to the computer model response. A long‐standing problem in EGO is that it does not consider the uncertainty in the parameter estimates of the Gaussian process. Treating these estimates as if they are the true parameters leads to an improper assessment of the precision of the approximation, a precision that is crucial to assess not only in optimization but in metamodeling in general. One way to account for these uncertainties is to use bootstrapping, studied by previous authors. Alternatively, some other authors have mentioned how a Bayesian approach may be the best way to incorporate the parameter uncertainty in the optimization, but no fully Bayesian approach for EGO has been implemented in practice. In this paper, we present a fully Bayesian implementation of the EGO method. The proposed Bayesian EGO algorithm is validated through simulation of noisy nonlinear functions and compared with the standard EGO method and the bootstrapped EGO. We also apply the Bayesian EGO algorithm to the optimization of a stochastic computer model. It is shown how a Bayesian approach to EGO allows one to optimize any function of the posterior predictive density. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
pub.1029538817,Protection of the information resources of a library based on analysis of business processes,"This paper justifies the relevance of the reliable protection of information and the development of measures to reduce information risks in libraries with comprehensive information resources. A brief description of the objects of protection and the main threats, including those that are related to the processing of personal data, is provided. It is alleged that analysis of models of the business processes of a library makes it possible to track the impacts of changes on many aspects of information security. The position of the information system for security analysis of the business process in the overall system of information security is determined. Steps for the formalization and updating of the rights of access to information resources of a library are illustrated. It is emphasized that the basic document for information-security risk management is a threat model that reflects the data on sources of threats and vulnerabilities of the system, impacted objects, and a number of other parameters. A block diagram that illustrates the process of analyzing the threats and vulnerabilities and a knowledge meta-model for the management of information-security risks are provided. It is concluded that based on the relationship of business processes that are reflected in a formal notation it is possible to automatically obtain the data on the degree of influence of security aspects of information objects of a particular sub-process on the results of business processes of a higher level, and as a result, on the achievability of the purposes of an organization."
pub.1043127963,A Pattern-Based Approach towards the Guided Reuse of Safety Mechanisms in the Automotive Domain,"The reuse of architectural measures or safety mechanisms is widely-spread in practice, especially in well-understood domains, as is reusing the corresponding safety-case to document the fulfillment of the target safety goal(s). This seems to harmonize well with the fact that safety standards recommend (if not dictate) performing many analyses during the concept phase of development as well as the early adoption of multiple measures at the architectural design level. Yet this front-loading is hindered by the fact that safety argumentation is not well-integrated into architectural models in the automotive domain and as such does not support comprehensible and reproducible argumentation nor any evidence for argument correctness. The reuse is neither systematic nor adequate.Using a simplified description of safety mechanisms, we defined a pattern library capturing known solution algorithms and architectural measures/constraints in a seamless holistic model-based approach with corresponding tool support. Based on a meta-model encompassing both development artifacts and safety case elements, the pattern library encapsulates all the information necessary for reuse, which can then be integrated into existing development environments. This paper explores the model and the approach using an illustrative implementation example, along with the supporting workflow for the usage of the approach in both “designer” and “user” roles."

Nowadays, research seems to have dealt with the problem of interoperability in various business domains, however the issue of interoperability in heterogeneous business domains — Enterprises, Governmental and Banking Institutions of different countries (cross-border) or Enterprises of different interests (cross-sector) - remains still a big challenge. This paper presents generic models of the most common business transactions carried out mainly by Small and Medium Enterprises. These models are constructed using state-of-the art notations and methodologies which facilitate the Application-to-Application interconnection and the automated business documents exchange between enterprises, governmental and banking institutions, covering not only national or sector specific business domain transactions but also cross-border and cross-sector processes, which imply different requirements as apart from the differences in the execution way, different legal rules and data entities, are also present."

pub.1119006697,In a Nutshell -- The Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox,"The performance of optimization algorithms relies crucially on their
parameterizations. Finding good parameter settings is called algorithm tuning.
The sequential parameter optimization (SPOT) package for R is a toolbox for
tuning and understanding simulation and optimization algorithms. Model-based
investigations are common approaches in simulation and optimization. Sequential
parameter optimization has been developed, because there is a strong need for
sound statistical analysis of simulation and optimization algorithms. SPOT
includes methods for tuning based on classical regression and analysis of
variance techniques; tree-based models such as CART and random forest; Gaussian
process models (Kriging), and combinations of different meta-modeling
approaches. Using a simple simulated annealing algorithm, we will demonstrate
how optimization algorithms can be tuned using SPOT. The underling concepts of
the SPOT approach are explained. This includes key techniques such as
exploratory fitness landscape analysis and sensititvity analysis. Many examples
illustrate how SPOT can be used for understanding the performance of algorithms
and gaining insight into algorithm's behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
SPOT can be used as an optimizer and how a sophisticated ensemble approach is
able to combine several meta models via stacking. This article exemplifies how
SPOT can be used for automatic and interactive tuning."
pub.1090160256,Statistical Framework for Sensitivity Analysis of Structural Dynamic Characteristics,"The uncertainty involved in the structural parameters inevitably leads to uncertainty in predicting the resulting structural dynamic characteristics, and this relationship is important to quantify. There is a large volume of work dealing with quantifying the overall uncertainty propagated from parameters to the structural dynamic responses, whereas little work has been done in measuring the contributions of the individual parameters and groups of parameters to the overall uncertainty, which is corresponding to the variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The variance-based GSA allows for providing a robust assessment of the relative influences of individual parameters on the structural dynamic characteristics. Although it is a powerful tool, the variance-based GSA suffers from the limitation of high computational cost, especially when applied to the expensive-to-run complex systems such as the long-span cable-stayed bridge in this study. To alleviate the computational burden, a fast-running nonparametric Gaussian process model (GPM), a fully specified statistical model, is used as a surrogate model. The highlights of the developed metamodel-based approach for the variance-based GSA are: (1) adopting the full GPM, rather than the mean of GPM, where the latter drops the valuable uncertainty information of the prediction variance; (2) enabling the full GPM-based method not to be restricted to the calculation of the first-order sensitivity index, and to be applicable for the computation of sensitivity indices of groups of parameters; (3) generalizing this approach to be suitable for the cases with arbitrarily distributed parameter uncertainty. Then, this full GPM-based approach is applied for sensitivity analysis of structural dynamic characteristics of a long-span cable-stayed bridge."
pub.1101368428,A Meta-Modelling Approach for Estimating Long-Term Wave Run-Up and Total Water Level on Beaches,"Gainza, J.; Rueda, A.; Camus, P.; Toms, A.; Mndez, F.J.; Sano, M., and Tomlinson, R., 2018. A meta-modelling approach for estimating long-term wave run-up and total water level on beaches. Wave run-up is defined as the maximum vertical extent of wave up-rush on a beach or structure above the sea water level from wave breaking. Wave run-up is responsible for beach and dune erosion and can be an important component of coastal flooding. Run-up can be estimated using either empirical formulations or sophisticated wave-breaking models with high computational demand. On the other hand, meta-models are efficient approximations of physical-process models that enable researchers to obtain long-term time series of wave dynamics. These hybrid models are developed by combining statistical techniques and numerical models. In this study, a methodology to transform offshore sea conditions to long-term time series of wave run-up is described. The methodology combined the construction of two meta-models of offshore wave propagation to coastal areas and of nearshore wave transformation to run-up. Clustering techniques were then implemented to select a subset of spectral patterns of the offshore conditions for nearshore transfer and a subset of sea states for reconstructing the run-up. Multivariate, radial-basis functions were then fitted to the outputs of the wave propagation and wave run-up simulations to reconstruct the time series of sea-state parameters in shallow water and the time series of run-up. This methodology was applied to Palm Beach on the Gold Coast (QLD, Australia). The nearshore wave climate was validated quantitatively, whereas the reconstructed wave run-up and total water-level time series was validated with a qualitative approximation, confirming that this methodology is capable of accurately transforming the offshore wave conditions into run-up time series. The total water levels were also reconstructed to show the applicability of the results to probabilistic flood-risk analyses."
pub.1128431137,Generating a skin-based meta-model for compliant parts in composite material: numerical and experimental results," Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a skin-based approach able to generate the variability model for a component in composite material due to its manufacturing process. It generates a skin-based model of the manufactured part. The skin model discretizes the part surfaces by points to take into account the geometric deviations, those points are the nodes of finite element analysis used for tolerance analysis of compliant assemblies.   Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a general and systematic simulation model for generating a variability meta-model for a component in composite material due to its manufacturing process. The model is constituted by three steps: definition and pre-processing of the nominal model, generation of the manufacturing process model and evaluation of the part variability.   Findings The advantage of this approach is related to the fact that it is designed as a part of a digital process that establishes a continuous and unambiguous flow of variation information from the part design to manufacturing and assembly and that takes into account the manufacturing signature. This is its uniqueness compared to other simulation approaches focused only on manufacturing.   Research limitations/implications Considering the variability around the nominal value of all the process parameters and parts with more complex geometries are not taken into account now, which will be modelled in practical applications.   Practical implications To properly manage uncertainty since conceptual design of complex product, next generation geometry assurance requires simulation models to realistically consider process signatures due to the manufacturing process. This work focusses on this next generation tool for geometry assurance.   Originality/value The literature is focused on metal sheets joined by welding or riveting. There are other materials widely used and typically compliant: the composite materials that typically used mechanical fixing elements (bolting, riveting) and structural adhesives to joint parts. No software tools exist in the literature to deal with uncertainty from manufacturing to assembly processes in products made by composite. This is the reason of the present work. "
pub.1112145725,Numerical Estimation of Expected Number of Failures for Repairable Systems using a Generalized Renewal Process Model,"The reliability of repairable systems is important for many engineering applications such as warranty forecasting, maintenance strategies, and durability, among others. A generalized renewal process (GRP) approach, considering the effectiveness of repairs, is commonly used, modeling the concepts of minimal repair, perfect repair, and general repair. The effect of the latter is between the effects of a minimal and a perfect repair. The GRP models the sequence of recurrent failure/repair events for repairable systems by solving the so-called g-renewal equation, which has no analytical solution. This paper proposes a data-driven numerical estimation of the expected number of failures (ENF) for the GRP model without solving the complicated g-renewal equation directly. Instead, it uses an empirical relationship among the cumulative intensity function (CIF) of the GRP, ordinary renewal process (ORP), and nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). The ORP and NHPP are limiting cases of the generalized renewal process. For practical reasons, it is common to observe only a few units of a repairable system population for only a short time. Using the observed data, the proposed approach creates a reliability metamodel of a renewal process, which is then used to predict the expected number of failures, and assess the average effectiveness of each repair. This increases the usefulness of the method for many practical reliability problems where the collection of a large amount of data is not possible or economical. The good accuracy of the proposed approach is demonstrated with three examples using simulated data, and a real-life example of locomotive braking grids using actual data."

It is important to find a standard model that meets current needs and incorporates techniques successfully implemented in SE (object- or event-orientation, etc.), which are also of keen interest in KE.In this paper, we present an iterative and incremental solution for developing ES, according to which the system domain is derived naturally from the problem domain, thus surmounting the problems now involved in the transition from the conceptual model of the problem to the formal model of the system.As compared with conventional development models, this solution encompasses five main tools, which are:• Use cases with their respective actor interaction diagrams and activity flow diagrams in order to specify the expert system.• The concept dictionary, which allows knowledge engineers to define, bound and select the meaning of each concept used by experts.• The static conceptual model, which provides an overview (concepts and their relations) of the expert system (ES) modelled.• The control and process model, which models the knowledge and metaknowledge used by the expert to attain a goal.• An object-oriented metamodel, which outputs the formal knowledge model, providing an efficient, reusable, extendible and easy-to-implement ES architecture.To demonstrate the robustness of this solution, we describe how it was applied to an ES that interprets the graphs output by an isokinetics machine for a blind person. An isokinetics machine assesses the strength of the muscles of the leg, arm, etc."

Firstly, we introduce a set of operators with well-defined semantics for defining and changing organizational models. Secondly, we show how to define access rules based on such models. In this context we also define a notion of correctness for access rules. Thirdly, we present a formal framework for the (semi-automated) adaptation of access rules when the underlying organizational model is changed by exploiting the semantics of the applied changes. Altogether the presented approach provides an important contribution for realizing adaptive access control frameworks."
pub.1001848916,A Process-Integrated Conceptual Design Environment for Chemical Engineering,"The process industries (chemicals, food, oil,...) are characterized by — continuous or batch — processes of material transformation. The design of such processes, and their mapping to the available equipment (plants composed of production units in which reactions take place), is a complex process that determines the competitiveness of these industries, as well as their environmental impact. In cooperation with researchers and industry from chemical engineering, we have developed the idea to capture and evaluate the experiences gained about process designs in so-called process data warehouses. The data sources for such process data warehouses are highly heterogeneous tools, e.g. for conceptual design (termed flowsheeting in chemical engineering), for mathematical simulations of large non-linear differential equation systems, for measurements gained with experimental usage of equipment at small scale or in original size, or even from molecular modeling. The clients of a data warehouse are interested in operational data transfer as well as experience analysis (pattern detection, process mining) and reuse.Starting from an empirical analysis of the requirements for a process data warehouse, the paper describes the solution architecture we are pursuing, the models driving the approach, and the status of a prototypical implementation we are undertaking. The prototype links commercial components operationally through advanced wrapping techniques, where the workflow is determined by constraint analysis in a logic-based meta model and executed through a process-integrated modeling environment. In the conclusions, we point out what can be learned from this work for conceptual modeling in general."
pub.1122331409,Connecting domain-specific features to source code: towards the automatization of dashboard generation,"Dashboards are useful tools for generating knowledge and support decision-making processes, but the extended use of technologies and the increasingly available data asks for user-friendly tools that allow any user profile to exploit their data. Building tailored dashboards for any potential user profile would involve several resources and long development times, taking into account that dashboards can be framed in very different contexts that should be studied during the design processes to provide practical tools. This situation leads to the necessity of searching for methodologies that could accelerate these processes. The software product line paradigm is one recurrent method that can decrease the time-to-market of products by reusing generic core assets that can be tuned or configured to meet specific requirements. However, although this paradigm can solve issues regarding development times, the configuration of the dashboard is still a complex challenge; users’ goals, datasets, and context must be thoroughly studied to obtain a dashboard that fulfills the users’ necessities and that fosters insight delivery. This paper outlines the benefits and a potential approach to automatically configuring information dashboards by leveraging domain commonalities and code templates. The main goal is to test the functionality of a workflow that can connect external algorithms, such as artificial intelligence algorithms, to infer dashboard features and feed a generator based on the software product line paradigm."
pub.1128198281,Evolving Adaptation Rules at Runtime for Multi-cloud Applications,"Cloud computing is the most prevailing computing paradigm as it has led to a proliferation of cloud-based applications, either through the migration of existing legacy or the development of novel ones from scratch. In fact, nowadays, there is also a move towards adopting multi-clouds due to the main benefits they introduce, including vendor lock-in avoidance and optimal application design and provisioning via different cloud services. Unfortunately, multi-cloud applications face the challenge that even a single cloud environment exhibits a certain level of dynamicity and uncertainty. As such, a suitable service level cannot be handed over to their customers, which leads to SLA penalty costs and application provider reputation reduction. To address this challenge, we have previously proposed a cross-level and multi-cloud application adaptation architecture. Towards realising such an architecture, this paper focuses on supporting cross-level application adaptation through the modelling of adaptation rules that enact adaptation workflows but also on evolving such an adaptation to address both the application and exploited cloud services evolution as well as the provisioning environment’s dynamicity. The modelling of such rules and their execution history is accommodated through corresponding extensions to a state-of-the-art cloud modelling language called CAMEL. Further, a specific selection algorithm for those alternative adaptation rules able to address the current problematic situation is suggested which takes into account their execution history and especially their performance."
pub.1145748217,Transfer of Knowledge Across Tasks,"This area is often referred to as transfer of knowledge across tasks, or simply transfer learning; it aims at developing learning algorithms that leverage the results of previous learning tasks. This chapter discusses different approaches in transfer learning, such as representational transfer, where transfer takes place after one or more source models have been trained. There is an explicit form of knowledge transferred directly to the target model or to the meta-model. The chapter also discusses functional transfer, where two or more models are trained simultaneously. This situation is sometimes referred to as multi-task learning. In this approach, the models share their internal structure (or possibly some parts) during learning. Other topics include instance-, feature-, and parameter-based transfer learning, often used to initialize the search on the target domain. A distinct topic is transfer learning in neural networks, which includes, for instance, the transfer of a part of the network structure. The chapter also presents the double loop architecture, where the base-learner iterates over the training set in an inner loop, while the metalearner iterates over different tasks to learn metaparameters in an outer loop. Details are given on transfer learning within kernel methods and parametric Bayesian models."
pub.1096462729,Holistic Granular Programming: A Novel Approach for Modeling Aircraft,"Description of work-in-progress design candidates during the pre-concept and conceptual aircraft design stages have traditionally followed protocol compatible with the later, more mature phases of contemporary product development, i.e. preliminary and detailed design. Up to this moment in time there has been a natural, intuitive tendency to approach design description using geometry as the initial basis upon which all analysis and design refinement could proceed. Design and integration, whether kinematic or structural (static) systems, and irrespective of applications, should be treated as a holistic problem with functionality as opposed to geometric description of a physically tangible artifact being the first step in product definition. This paper presents a coherent, logical method of describing an aircraft concept using functionality as a basis. Hereafter known as Holistic Granular Programming (HGP), any collection of assemblies and components can be described mathematically, and, subsequently analyzed as an engineering safety system. Thereafter, a discussion is given detailing how HGP can be integrated within the Conceptual Design Tool (CDT), an open-source, multi-disciplinary framework for aircraft design currently being developed at Bauhaus Luftfahrt. Independent of any particular tool implementation a number of other questions are addressed, such as: how to map the terminology of HGP onto the concepts used in software engineering, how to model the different aspects of HGP as part of a data meta-model, what necessary steps in a potential HGP workflow can be identified, and, what kind of support can be offered to the designer."
pub.1151607064,A Model-Driven Framework for Design and Analysis of Vehicle Suspension Systems,"The design and implementation of vehicle suspension systems is complex and time-consuming process that usually leads to production delays. Although different Model Driven Engineering (MDE) technologies like EAST-ADL/AUTOSAR are frequently applied to expedite vehicle development process, a framework particularly dealing with design and analysis of vehicle suspension is hard to find in literature. This rises the need of a framework that not only supports the analysis of suspension system at higher abstraction level but also complements the existing standards like EAST-ADL. In this article, a Model driven framework for Vehicle Suspension System (MVSS) is proposed. Particularly, a meta-model containing major vehicle suspension aspects is introduced. Subsequently, a modeling editor is developed using Eclipse Sirius platform. This allows the modeling of both simple as well as complex vehicle suspension systems with simplicity. Moreover, Object Constraint Language (OCL) is utilized to perform early system analysis in modeling phase. Furthermore, the target MATLAB-Simulink models are generated from source models, using model-to-text transformations, to perform advanced system analysis. The application of proposed framework is demonstrated through real life Audi A6L Hydraulic active suspension use case. The initial results indicate that proposed framework is highly effective for the design and analysis of vehicle suspension systems. In addition to this, the analysis results could be propagated to EAST-ADL toolchains to support full vehicle development workflow."
pub.1014509336,A Study on a Framework for Persistence Layer Supportable Web Services in Distributed Environments,"The web service was proposed as a standard to assemble service modules without any relation where they exist in distributed environments. The standard web service is declared with XML based language about registration, searching, orchestration and execution, which will be used to represent domain data model and process model. Each model can be mapped between data object and execution object but the mapping process have no standard so it can cause higher coupling between logics for processing domain objects and for business. Therefore, a web service framework should provide a domain model to reduce coupling and it must support features for registration, searching, orchestration and execution which are compatible with the standards. We propose a framework for persistenc layer supportable web services in distributed environments. Proposed framework is implemented for service registry, orchestration engine, execution engine, and a meta model for various domain. In service registration and searching, it shows high performance because it uses hashing based searching. And it shows higher performance than other ORMs such as the Hibernate and iBatis on the MS-SQL which is general DBMS in factor of domain objects’ creation, modification and removal."
pub.1164676048,dFlow: A Domain Specific Language for the Rapid Development of open-source Virtual Assistants,"An increasing number of models and frameworks for Virtual Assistant (VA)
development exist nowadays, following the progress in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) fields. Regardless of
their performance, popularity, and ease of use, these frameworks require at
least basic expertise in NLP and software engineering, even for simple and
repetitive processes, limiting their use only to the domain and programming
experts. However, since the current state of practice of VA development is a
straightforward process, Model-Driven Engineering approaches can be utilized to
achieve automation and rapid development in a more convenient manner. To this
end, we present \textit{dFlow}, a textual Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that
offers a simplified, reusable, and framework-agnostic language for creating
task-specific VAs in a low-code manner. We describe a system-agnostic VA
meta-model, the developed grammar, and all essential processes for developing
and deploying smart VAs. For further convenience, we create a cloud-native
architecture and expose it through the Discord platform. We conducted a
large-scale empirical evaluation with more than 200 junior software developers
and collected positive feedback, indicating that dFlow can accelerate the
entire VA development process, while also enabling citizen and software
developers with minimum experience to participate."
pub.1001270584,"Multi-perspective enterprise modeling: foundational concepts, prospects and future research challenges","The paper presents a method for multi- perspective enterprise modeling (MEMO) and a corresponding (meta-) modeling environment. An extensive analysis of requirements for enterprise modeling serves to motivate and assess the method. The method is based on an elaborate conception of multi-perspective enterprise models and on an extensible language architecture. The language architecture is comprised of a meta modeling language and an extensible set of integrated domain-specific modeling languages (DSML). The DSML are supplemented with process models and with guidelines for their reflective use. The corresponding modeling environment integrates editors for various DSML into multi-language model editors. It includes a meta model editor which enables the convenient use, development and extension of the set of supported DSML and supports the generation of respective graphical model editors. Thus, it also serves as a foundation for method engineering. MEMO covers both software engineering as well as social, managerial and economic aspects of the firm. The presentation of MEMO is supplemented with a comparative overview of other approaches to enterprise modeling. The paper concludes bys summarizing fundamental technical, epistemological and political challenges for enterprise modeling research and discusses potential paths for future research."
pub.1104018773,Empirical study on software process variability modelling with SMartySPEM and vSPEM,"With the continuous improvement of software processes, it is possible to increase quality, to address different application domains and accelerate the development of software products. However, existing process modelling notations like the SPEM meta‐model typically do not have appropriate constructs for expressing process variability. Thus, SPEM‐based approaches such as SMartySPEM and vSPEM provide mechanisms for representing variabilities to address characteristics of different projects. Here, the authors empirically compared SMartySPEM and for variability representation in software processes models, aiming to analyze correction, time, and efficiency. The performed experiment provides preliminary evidence based on 11 participants and sample size N = 44. Participants took longer to comprehend diagrams in SMartySPEM. However, the correctness of SMartySPEM diagrams had a superior result and higher efficiency based on the median values and hypothesis tests. With regard to variability mechanisms, the diagrams modelled with SMartySPEM had a slightly lower efficiency and it took longer for modifying them, thus the correctness of the SMartySPEM diagrams had a superior result. Therefore, an initial body of knowledge indicated a positive efficiency of SMartySPEM for variability representation in process models, as well as potential improvements as the reduction in SMartySPEM diagrams complexity, which may contribute to its evolution."
pub.1096314138,modeFRONTIER for Virtual Design and Optimization of Compact Heat Exchangers,"The main purpose of this study is the development of an innovative methodology for Heat Exchangers (HE) design to replace the conventional design procedures. The new procedure is based on the definition of a software package managed by modeFRONTIER, a multi-objective optimization software produced by ESTECO, able to create HE virtual models by targeting several objectives, like HE performance, optimal use of material, HE minimal weight and size and optimal manufacturability. The proposed methodology consists first in the definition of a workflow for the automatic CFD simulation of a parametric model of a periodic HE cellular element. This is followed by the definition of a Response Surface (meta-model) covering all the possible range of parameters' combination, the definition of a “bridge”, e.g. low-fidelity - standard or macroscopic - models to extend the behavior of the liquid and air HE cellular elements to a real scale HE, and an optimization process to obtain the optimal HE design for any proposed application and requirements. The versatility of the methodology, thanks to the modularity of modeFRONTIER platform, offers the possibility of a large scenario of applications for Fluid Power systems, where Heat Exchangers (for both fixed and mobile applications) are used to cool down the oil or any other working fluid. In this work the main aspects covering the background of the project, the proposed methodology and the expected benefits will be introduced. In addition, validation of the CFD models with experimental data available in the literature will be illustrated, as well as an example of “bridge” optimization with the use of experimental correlations available in the literature."
pub.1164503790,Scaling of Lean Aeronautical Gas Turbine Combustors,"Abstract A numerical procedure is presented for the scaling of lean aeronautical gas turbine combustors to different thrust classes. The procedure considers multiple operating points and aims for a self-similar flow field with respect to a reference configuration. The developed scaling approach relies on an optimization-based workflow which involves automated geometry and numerical grid generation, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations and post-processing of the reacting flow field. Kriging is applied as a meta model to identify new sets of parameters for combustor geometry generation. A generic lean-burn high pressure aeronautical combustor has been designed to serve as a first verification test case with reactive flow characteristics comparable to real combustion chambers. The burner geometry is parameterized by 23 free parameters which are altered within the scaling process. The definition of a suitable scaling function is essential for the success of the scaling approach. A scaling function based on pressure loss, axial location of heat release, pilot air split and the temperature profile at the combustor exit is proposed. The developed procedure is tested and applied for the scaling of an internally-staged lean combustor to a lower thrust class considering multiple operating points simultaneously. In total, 65 different combustor variants have been evaluated by the scaling procedure. Simulations were performed for each of these configurations at take-off, approach and idle operating conditions. The final combustor configuration, scaled to a lower thrust class, shows good agreement to the reference configuration in terms of the scaling targets and reasonably resembles the emission indices. Integrating the scaling procedure into the design process of future combustion systems could reduce the required design iterations and thereby contribute to significantly reduced development times and costs."
pub.1142648195,Pipeline for ontology-based modeling and automated deployment of digital twins for planning and control of manufacturing systems,"The demand for individualized products drives modern manufacturing systems towards greater adaptability and flexibility. This increases the focus on data-driven digital twins enabling swift adaptations. Within the framework of cyber-physical systems, the digital twin is a digital model that is fully connected to the physical and digital assets. A digital model must follow a standardization for interoperable data exchange. Established ontologies and meta-models offer a basis in the definition of a schema, which is the first phase of creating a digital twin. The next phase is the standardized and structured modeling with static use-case specific data. The final phase is the deployment of digital twins into operation with a full connection of the digital model with the remaining cyber-physical system. In this deployment phase communication standards and protocols provide a standardized data exchange. A survey on the state-of-the-art of these three digital twin phases reveals the lack of a consistent workflow from ontology-driven definition to standardized modeling. Therefore, one goal of this paper is the design of an end-to-end digital twin pipeline to lower the threshold of creating and deploying digital twins. As the task of establishing a communication connection is highly repetitive, an automation concept by providing structured protocol data is the second goal. The planning and control of a line-less assembly system with manual stations and a mobile robot as resources and an industrial dog as the product serve as exemplary digital twin applications. Along this use-case the digital twin pipeline is transparently explained."
pub.1163113609,A Polystore Architecture Using Knowledge Graphs to Support Queries on Heterogeneous Data Stores,"Modern applications commonly need to manage dataset types composed of
heterogeneous data and schemas, making it difficult to access them in an
integrated way. A single data store to manage heterogeneous data using a common
data model is not effective in such a scenario, which results in the domain
data being fragmented in the data stores that best fit their storage and access
requirements (e.g., NoSQL, relational DBMS, or HDFS). Besides, organization
workflows independently consume these fragments, and usually, there is no
explicit link among the fragments that would be useful to support an integrated
view. The research challenge tackled by this work is to provide the means to
query heterogeneous data residing on distinct data repositories that are not
explicitly connected. We propose a federated database architecture by providing
a single abstract global conceptual schema to users, allowing them to write
their queries, encapsulating data heterogeneity, location, and linkage by
employing: (i) meta-models to represent the global conceptual schema, the
remote data local conceptual schemas, and mappings among them; (ii) provenance
to create explicit links among the consumed and generated data residing in
separate datasets. We evaluated the architecture through its implementation as
a polystore service, following a microservice architecture approach, in a
scenario that simulates a real case in Oil \& Gas industry. Also, we compared
the proposed architecture to a relational multidatabase system based on foreign
data wrappers, measuring the user's cognitive load to write a query (or query
complexity) and the query processing time. The results demonstrated that the
proposed architecture allows query writing two times less complex than the one
written for the relational multidatabase system, adding an excess of no more
than 30% in query processing time."
pub.1053029673,ICME — A Mere Coupling of Models or a Discipline of Its Own?,"Technically, ICME — Integrated computational materials engineering — is an approach for solving advanced engineering problems related to the design of new materials and processes by combining individual materials and process models. The combination of models by now is mainly achieved by manual transformation of the output of a simulation to form the input to a subsequent one. This subsequent simulation is either performed at a different length scale or constitutes a subsequent step along the process chain. Is ICME thus just a synonym for the coupling of simulations? In fact, most ICME publications up to now are examples of the joint application of selected models and software codes to a specific problem. However, from a systems point of view, the coupling of individual models and/or software codes across length scales and along material processing chains leads to highly complex meta-models. Their viability has to be ensured by joint efforts from science, industry, software developers and independent organizations. This paper identifies some developments that seem necessary to make future ICME simulations viable, sustainable and broadly accessible and accepted. The main conclusion is that ICME is more than a multi-disciplinary subject but a discipline of its own, for which a generic structural framework has to be elaborated and established."
pub.1038839993,On the use of model-based techniques for achieving multi-mode control architectures,"Multi-operation mode processes are often described through a hybrid model using well-known formal descriptions such as hybrid automata. A multi-controller architecture has been proposed in the literature for coping with different dynamics. It is composed by as many control algorithms as operation modes and a supervisor that tracks the system’s operation, switching to the appropriate control algorithm when a new operation mode is reached. This paper explores the advantages of model-based techniques to automate the implementation of the supervisor and its integration into the final real-time control system from the simulation dynamic model. In particular, the Model Driven Engineering approach has been followed in order to provide a framework to support the development cycle of the control system for mode switched processes. It uses information from the model of the process and from the control loops designed and using model transformation techniques the supervisor is automatically generated. In order to provide independency from the particular simulation tools used for defining the process model, meta-models are proposed for both, the process and the supervisor, as well as for the necessary transformations. A proof of concept framework has been designed for the target field of automation applications, generating the supervisor in PLCopen XML format for achieving vendor independency."
pub.1028818521,Meta-modeling Techniques Meet Web Application Design Tools,"Web-based hypermedia systems are becoming more and more sophisticated, new modeling requirements constantly arise, and design models must constantly evolve. Since design tools should complement models to support an efficient design process, model evolution raises a technological issue: Design tools must be modified when their underlying model changes. This is why the paper proposes a general approach to efficiently update design tools in response to model evolutions. The key ideas are: a) the description of a hypermedia model in terms of a general meta-model, powerful enough to express the semantics of current and future design constructs; b) the transformation of a hypermedia design tool into a meta-CASE tool, able to cope with model updates without requiring to be redefined and rebuilt from scratch.The approach is presented by discussing a case study, that is, the feasibility study to transform our design toolkit, Jweb, into a meta-CASE tool (Jweb3). This tool will support the latest version of our model (called W2000), and will easily evolve with the model it supports. We discuss the adoption of the OMG metamodeling standards MOF and XMI as enabling technology, we present a sample of the representation of W2000 in terms of MOF, and we sketch the architecture of the under-implementation Jweb3."
pub.1139657477,Multiobjective optimization of economic and environmental performance of Fischer-Tropsch biofuels production integrated to sugarcane biorefineries,"The mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a subject of high importance at a global level. The expansion of advanced liquid biofuels use can contribute to increase the sustainable bioenergy deployment while reducing GHG emissions in comparison to fossil fuels. In this study, the economic and environmental performance of a biorefinery involving biomass gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) liquid biofuels production associated to sugarcane value chain is explored through a multiobjective optimization approach. The biorefinery configurations investigated include different biomass combinations, and the possibility of integrating the thermochemical processes to a first-generation ethanol distillery or operating it as a stand-alone plant. Different biomass mix considering conventional sugarcane, energy-cane and eucalyptus are considered in the optimization strategy. A Design of Experiments with a second-order polynomial regression technique is used to fit a metamodel from detailed and high-fidelity spreadsheet-based process models. Internal Rate of Return and avoided GHG emissions per agricultural land occupation are used as objective functions. The Pareto-optimal curves show the best performance possibilities and allows to identify the most suitable biorefinery configurations. Results indicate there is an economic benefit from the integration between the thermochemical process and conventional first-generation ethanol mills. An increase in cane and eucalyptus processing capacities tends to improve the economic performance due to the gain of scale. A higher proportion of energy-cane processed leads to better environmental performance as it reduces both the GHG emissions and the demand for agricultural land. In contrast, a greater share of energy-cane present trade-offs on the economic performance in the integrated biorefinery caused by the higher energy demand and lower ethanol production, but a minor effect is observed on the stand-alone configuration."
pub.1091628174,A Model-Driven Process Enactment Approach for Network Service Design,"The development of the Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) paradigm has made way for the rapid deployment and management of network services. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has been actively defining the NFV framework, which includes functional blocks and artifacts at different levels of abstraction. As part of the artifacts, various deployment templates have been defined to drive the deployment and the management of network services (NS) and Virtual Networks Functions (VNFs). The design of an NS is a complex activity that aims at selecting appropriate VNFs, creating the VNF forwarding graph (VNFFG), and all the necessary templates for the NS deployment and management, on the basis of the tenant’s requirements and existing VNFs. Automating the NS design activity as well as the NS management process itself is highly desirable and beneficial for NFV systems. Continuous deployment for NFV with model-driven orchestration means has been recently advocated.In this paper, we propose a model-driven process for the design of network services which covers the automatic generation of the NS deployment template and the associated templates. The core of the process involves the decomposition of the NS requirements with the help of an ontology, and the selection of proper network functions based on a catalogue of existing VNFs. Moreover, we provide support for automated process execution with a model-driven process enactment approach. The process is modelled as a UML activity diagram. All the artifacts are models of defined metamodels. Enactment of the NS design process is carried out by mapping the process model to a model transformation chain, and executing the chain."
pub.1091160198,Incorporating Innovation Management Practices to ISO/IEC 29110,"Studies on Innovation management are often focused on large companies and organizations. On the other side, small companies or VSE (Very Small Entities), constitute a significant part of the entrepreneurial landscape, and contribute – in a great extent – to the economic outputs of society and to the creation of employment. This is also valid for the system and software engineering business areas. Larger systems being built and deployed across Europe are usually built with the participation of small enterprises or research centers whose contributions have a key role in the resulting systems. Although these companies are sensitive to the importance of systematic innovation, most of the innovation models are targeted to large or medium enterprises and do not consider the specific characteristics of the system and software engineering industries. In this particular business area, innovation must consider two separate dimensions: (a) the opportunities to innovate that system and software development companies may offer to their customers and prospects, and (b) the application of techniques to innovate in the software development processes, to achieve better performance and leverage process capabilities and company productivity. Both dimensions require a systematic integration of the innovation management processes with the managerial and engineering processes of the organizations.This paper proposes an extension of the process model described in the ISO/IEC 29110 standard to enable innovation management processes and activities addressed to VSE. The innovation activities and tools incorporated into the resulting model are based on existing innovation models, and on the feedback collected through interviews and surveys with different software development companies. SPEM (System and Software Process Engineering Metamodel) has been used as a process design framework to encode the resulting model and formally integrate innovation, managerial and engineering processes for VSE."
pub.1157615442,A Multiscale Modeling and Updating Framework for Suspension Bridges Based on Modal Frequencies and Influence Lines,"Aiming at obtaining an efficient and accurate multiscale model of suspension bridges, this paper innovatively proposed a multiscale modeling and updating framework based on measured modal frequencies and influence lines. In the first step, a multiscale model was created using the substructure method and the multipoint constraint method. The second step was to use the Gaussian process metamodel to perform multiscale model updating. For a suspension bridge with a flat steel box girder, a global model was created primarily using beam and truss elements, and the flat steel box girder of the critical section was finely modeled using shell elements. However, the refined model of the girder has many degrees of freedom. To reduce the computations, the substructure method was used to condense the refined model into a superelement. According to the multipoint constraint method based on deformation compatibility, the superelement and global model were coupled together to create a multiscale model. In terms of model updating, the theory of objective function construction based on the modal frequencies and influence lines was introduced first. Then, the trained Gaussian process model could replace the multiscale model to fit the relationship between the updated parameters and the objective function. Finally, the optimization algorithm was used to obtain the minimum value of the objective function. A case study of a suspension bridge was considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The measured deflection and strain influence lines of the bridge were obtained via a bridge moving vehicle test, and the modal frequencies of the bridge were obtained using environmental excitation. Using the proposed framework, the updated frequencies and influence lines were closer to the measured frequencies, and the computational efficiency was improved. Therefore, the proposed method could efficiently and accurately build a multiscale model of a suspension bridge."
pub.1160435994,A fault prognosis strategy for an external gear pump using Machine Learning algorithms and synthetic data generation methods,"Fault prognosis is an important area of research that aims to predict and diagnose faults in complex systems. The sudden failure of industrial components can have adverse consequences for an organisation in terms of time, cost and workflow. It is, therefore, critical to ensure the maintenance of equipment components in optimal condition in order to avoid downtime that may cause significant disruption. Due to this reason, in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in creating innovative methods for fault prognosis that can increase system reliability and reduce maintenance costs. Gear pumps are widely utilised in a variety of industrial applications, and their reliability and effectiveness are crucial for achieving optimal system performance. Gear pumps, on the other hand, are prone to malfunctions and failures, which can result in substantial downtime and maintenance costs. The challenge is to develop a fault prognosis approach that is reliable and accurate enough to detect and diagnose defects in a gear pump before they cause system failures. This paper proposes a novel computational strategy for the fault prognosis of an external gear pump using Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Due to the unavailability of sufficient experimental data in the vicinity of failure mechanisms, a novel approach to generating a high-fidelity in-silico dataset via a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model of the gear pump in healthy and faulty working conditions is presented. However, considering the computational demand for rerunning the same CFD simulations, novel synthetic data generation techniques are implemented by perturbing the frequency content of the time series to recreate other working conditions and constructing degradation behaviour using linear and cubic interpolation methods for run-to-failure scenarios. The synthetically created datasets are used to train the underlying ML metamodel for fault prognosis. Two types of ML algorithms are employed for fault prognosis: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. A series of numerical examples are shown, allowing us to infer that the proposed modelling technique is feasible in an industrial setting and that employing the MLP algorithm delivers superior fault prognosis results when compared to SVM. Furthermore, datasets generated using the cubic interpolation method have lower prediction errors than datasets generated using the linear interpolation method due to the smoother degradation behaviour in the data."

pub.1155751680,Estimation of crop fractional cover (FCover) in smallholder farming systems using UAV and Sentinel-2 images : Case study of a Senegalese agroforestry parkland,"Scattered trees in farmer fields, also known as agroforestry parkland, are integrated part of West African smallholder agricultural landscapes. While they are used for centuries by farmers, they are now recognised by the scientific and politic communities as a mean to face climate changes (Skole et al., 2021). Fractional cover (FCover) is an important biophysical parameter allowing to monitor the crop growth. Satellite images has been proven very efficient for crop FCover estimation in various ecosystems (Gräzing et al 2021). However, in agroforestry parklands, the presence of trees inside the fields induced a huge variability that can be hardly captured by traditional approach relying on satellite images and ground information. We propose an original empirical framework relying on the combining use of UAV-based FCover and Sentinel-2 data to estimate the pearl millet FCover at landscape scale in an agroforestry parkland of Senegal. 6 UAV images were acquired during the 2021 cropping season and the millet FCover has been derived from a threshold of UAV images for 95 subplots on a 3-m grid and used as targeted variable. 4 vegetation indices and 8 texture featured calculated from S2 data were used as models’ predictors. 3 machine learning regression algorithms (RF, GBM and SVM) and a multiple linear regression (MLR) model were calibrated over the 3-m grid using a cross-validation approach and different scenarii of modelling were tested: (1) fit the four models date by date dataset, (2) fit the four models on all dates dataset with and without date information as predictor, (3) single models vs a meta-model resulting from the stacking of the different models. Our results evidenced that for each model tested the accuracy is dependent to the millet growth stage, the vegetative period being overall the one allowing to reach the higher accuracy. MLR is not adapted to estimate millet FCover (R² between 0.07 and 0.13) while the machine learning models gave overall good results, RF being the better one (R² between 0.45 and 0.69).We have shown that the use of date information as predictor allowed to improve the FCover estimation (R² increases up to 24%) however, the use of a meta-model didn’t significantly improve the accuracy suggesting that RF, GBM and SVM are robust enough for millet FCover estimation in such kind of landscape.While the original workflow we proposed in this study need to be confirmed by adding data from the 2022 cropping season, the results obtained show promising opportunities for improving the crop monitoring in heterogeneous landscapes. The next step will be to better understand the influence of trees on the millet FCover, at the field scale and at the landscape scale."
pub.1146943169,Model-based data integration along the product & service life cycle supported by digital twinning,"Currently, a mega-trend on digitization and servitization using digital technologies and digital twins to support digital (business) transformation can be observed. In literature, emerging digital technologies are considered as an enabler for the creation of additional value, the strengthening of the customer relationship, and as an accelerator of the servitization process in manufacturing. The introduction of such technologies may result in adaptations of the product & service life cycle as well as the business model. A generic product & service life cycle consisting of four phases – design, simulation, manufacturing, and usage of products and services – serves as a foundation for the integration of digital technologies and related data. It can be observed that there is a gap with respect to data integration between the manufacturing and the usage of products and services. A model-based approach including digital twinning is applied to bridge this gap and to show how data can be integrated along the product & service life cycle. The conceptual approach of such a model-based digital twin environment is presented in form of a meta model. To depict how the integration could be eased and guided in manufacturing, findings of the European project Change2Twin, where a digital twin is established for a paint production pilot, are introduced. This industrial manufacturing pilot was supported by production process models. Additionally, a physical experiment was created to raise awareness for the challenges of digitization and servitization."

Of great importance is the boosting system enabling down-sizing and down-speeding. However, the thermodynamic coupling of a reciprocating internal combustion engine and a turbocharger poses a great challenge to the turbine as pulsating admission conditions are imposed onto the turbocharger turbine. This paper presents a novel approach to a turbocharger turbine development process and outlines this process using the example of an asymmetric twin scroll turbocharger applied to a heavy duty truck engine application. In a first step, relevant operating points are defined taking into account fuel consumption on reference routes for the target application. These operation points are transferred into transient boundary conditions imposed on the turbine. These pulsating admission conditions to the turbocharger turbine are analyzed and subsequently discretized using the method of quasi-steadiness to avoid numerically very expensive unsteady CFD simulations. Following, an automated in-house developed workflow based on a parameterized model of the entire turbine stage is introduced and described. The parameterization is based on design parameters linked to aerodynamic properties, hence it is not limited to one specific geometry but rather able to represent a large variety of designs with comparatively few input parameters. Concluding, a meta-model based multi-disciplinary and multi-objective numerical optimization is performed to obtain the best geometry possible. The optimization objectives are linked to a perfect turbine-compressor matching with an existing benchmark compressor stage and regards to the engine’s air fuel ratio and exhaust gas recirculation requirements. The entire optimization is based on numerical methods, that is, a CFD study. However, the numerical models used throughout the paper are validated against experimental data to ensure the quality and accuracy of the predictions regarding its behavior in an experimental setup.</div></div>"
pub.1125965759,Consistent management and evaluation of building models in the early design stages,"The early stages of building design involve the consideration of different design variants and their assessment regarding various performance criteria including energy consumption and costs. During the design process, the involved experts from different disciplines frequently exchange building information to develop a design that satisfies the project’s requirements and objectives. In the course of this iterative process, the building design evolves throughout multiple refinement stages. At the same time, different variants are developed. In BIM-based projects, the maturity of the design information provided by the model is expressed by the notion of Level of development (LOD). So far, however, there is no method to formally define the information requirements of a LOD. In particular, there are no means for expressing the uncertainty involved with the provided information. By contrast, despite the insufficient information available in early design stages, a BIM model appears precise and certain. This situation leads to false assumptions and model evaluations, for example, in the case of energy efficiency calculations or structural analysis. Hence, this paper presents an overview of a set of approaches that were developed to alleviate and preserve the consistency of the designed solutions. The approach includes the development of a multi-LOD meta-model, which allows one to explicitly describe the LOD requirements of each building component type incorporating the possible uncertainties, e.g. concerning the building dimensions. On the basis of this multi-LOD model, methods for evaluating a building design’s performance regarding the building’s structure and life cycle energy performance are proposed that take the defined uncertainties into account. To support the management of design variants in one consistent model, a graph-based approach is introduced. Finally, a minimized communication protocol is described to facilitate the workflow and communicate the evaluation results for supporting the decision-making process."

Information technology strategy planning is multistage process and information system development relies on implementation of each stage of IS lifecycle. A knowledge-based IS engineering proposed system modelling and decision-making tools and methods, which helps to expand more precise and comprehensive subject area corresponding to the project. Participants of IS project such as developer or programmer is allowed to use not only the knowledge of the project, which is collected in traditional CASE tool storage, but also the knowledge storage, where subject area knowledge is collected according to formal criteria. There have been made many efforts for the analysis of Unified Modelling Language (UML) models generation of diverse knowledge-based models combining frameworks, workflow patterns, modelling languages and natural language specifications. Knowledge-based subsystem as CASE tool component with Enterprise Meta-Model (EMM) and Enterprise Model (EM) within can significantly help with UML dynamic models generation using transformation algorithms. Application of the knowledge-based transformation algorithms grants the possibility to operate additional models validation methods that EMM determines. The main purpose of the paper is to present how EM can be used in UML models generation process. This paper combines results from previous researches and summarizes part of them. There is described importance of knowledge-based IS engineering in business and IT alignment process. There is also described UML models elements roles variations after generation from EM. The most valuable result of this research is presentation of UML Sequence model generation from EM process, by defining transformation algorithm and illustrating it by a particular example what proves EM sufficiency for whole generation process."
pub.1095353283,A Process Model For Engineering of Complex Systems Architectures with Complex Subsystem Architecture Reuse in Mind,"Development of HUMS architectures involves a variety of engineering disciplines, modeling and analysis. HUMS are complex systems, which needs decomposed into several subsystems in order to simply the designing of the system. Currently, engineering of such complex systems have very little support in theory. The subdivided systems have aspects, parameters and interfaces poorly and vaguely defined in an ad-hoc manner due to ad-hoc way of separating complex systems into subsystems. This has lead to a situation where in the decomposition into subsystems been proved futile due to difficulty in reusing them again. Thus, the need of the hour is a design Model for structured decomposition of systems into reusable subsystems. This paper discusses an engineering process meta-model/model whose purpose is to provide detailed descriptions of important properties and the relations between systems and subsystems. The model will contain different strategies for subdivision/decomposition so as to be able to reuse the subsystems effectively. In short the model is aimed at achieving the following goals i) Efficient knowledge management ii) Investigating various decision points iii) Should also recognize various systems/subsystems with similar functionalities and minor requirement variations. These variations should be indicated by decision points. Hence role of decision points in reuse of architectures should be defined In summary, the paper summarizes the result of our research in coming out with a design model for architectural decomposition of system into subsystems with reuse of the system/subsystem architectures in mind."
pub.1011572135,A case study applying process and project alignment methodology,"Software Process Improvement (SPI) is one of the main software development challenges. However, SPI standards and models (CMMI, SPICE) have not been always adopted with success. The current problem is a lack of strategy to implement successfully these standards and models. To undertake this objective is essential observe real life experiences and detect process and project mutual relationships. Without this alignment it will not be possible to find out how process management is really important to achieve organization’s strategic objectives. This paper proposes a methodology that allows the definition, evaluation and improvement of an organization software development process. This proposal, called a Process and Project Alignment Methodology (ProPAM), allows the specification of an organization development process, as well process and project alignment. ProPAM presents the following life cycle: (1) process definition; (2) project definition considering a base process model; (3) project coordination and monitoring and (4) process improvement assessment. This paper also provides an overview of the action plan to be taken within the software organizations that intent to conduct a SPI initiative. This plan includes two distinct phases: (1) specify the development process and (2) analyze projects, starting an SPI effort. In order to evaluate ProPAM, a study case is undertaken. The case study is performed following the action plan and presents all the steps of the ProPAM. Final results show that, when the organization started using ProPAM, process and project alignment reduced project planning time and effort. ProPAM also introduced new organizational practices that result in a SPI program."
pub.1111581118,Performance of ensemble Kalman filter and Markov chain Monte Carlo under uncertainty in forecast model,"Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are popular methods to obtain the posterior distribution of unknown parameters in the reservoir model. However, millions of simulation runs may be required in MCMC for accurate sampling of posterior as subsurface flow problems are highly nonlinear and non-Gaussian. Similarly, EnKF formulated on the basis of linear and Gaussian assumptions may also require a large number of realizations to correctly map the solution space of the unknown model parameters, ultimately resulting in the high computational cost. Data-driven meta/surrogate/proxy models provide an alternative solution to alleviate the issue of high computational cost. Since these models are not as accurate as numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDE), their implementation may add an uncertainty in the forecast model. In literature, the effect of uncertainty in forecast model on data assimilation is not well studied, especially with field-scale reservoir models. In this work, we take the opportunity to evaluate and compare the performance of EnKF and MCMC using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) based forecast model. Proposed forecast model relies on reducing parameter space using Karhunen–Loeve (KL) expansion which preserves the two-point statistics of the field. Random variables from KL expansion and orthogonal polynomials corresponding to the prior probability density function (pdf) form the set of input parameters in PCE. Further, non-intrusive probabilistic collocation method (PCM) is used to compute PCE coefficients. PCE forecast model is then used in EnKF and MCMC to calculate the likelihood of the samples in place of high fidelity full physics simulation runs. A case study is performed using a 3D field scale model of a reservoir located near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada. Performance of EnKF and MCMC are assessed under forecast model uncertainty using rigorous qualitative and quantitative analysis and posterior distribution characterization. Results clearly depict that, although EnKF provided reliable mean and variance estimates of model parameters, MCMC outperformed the former even under the uncertainty associated with PCE metamodel. Inaccurate initial assumptions of model parameters were successfully handled by MCMC, although, with a longer burn-in period. Furthermore, characterization of posterior demonstrated reduced uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters using MCMC as compared to EnKF. Practical implications of the proposed approach and performance assessment under forecast model uncertainty will be consequential in designing accurate and computationally efficient reservoir characterization workflows and hence, improved decision-making in reservoir management."
pub.1131261392,Task-centric method for shipyard hoisting process modelling and its application in CAPP,"Shipyard hoisting process is a project type manufacturing process which entails more sophisticated elements and relationships than other kinds of processes, this feature brings particular challenges when constructing a structured description of the process, called enterprise model, to introduce various Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) technologies. However, most of the modelling methods devised so far do not consider the individual demand of project type manufacturing process. Therefore, we envisage the necessity to expand, extend, and refactor current methodologies in order to exploit this remaining dimension. In this line, we present a dedicated method aiming at appropriately modelling the project type manufacturing process, it employs seven collaborative views and task-centric idea to emphasize work flow abstraction without sticking to the material flow abstraction as current methods do, which is the key factor to successfully achieve horizontal functions/organizations integration and vertical management hierarchies integration for this special process. The proposed method adopts semi-formal meta model to interpret its framework, building blocks and constraints graphically and rigorously. All these works are performed taking shipyard hoisting process as example. According to the modelling method, a two-stage Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) method is also initiated to demonstrate how the process model can serve as the bridge to converge manufacturing technology and information technology. Furthermore, a CAPP prototype is developed to carry out case study with an actual shipyard hoisting process. The study reveals promising contributions to not only enhancing the industrial competitiveness but also enriching the enterprise modelling research on project type manufacturing process."
pub.1040713352,The Dangers of Sparse Sampling for Uncertainty Propagation and Model Calibration,"Activities such as sensitivity analysis, statistical effect screening, uncertainty propagation, or model calibration have become integral to the Verification and Validation (V&V) of numerical models and computer simulations. Because these analyses involve performing multiple runs of a computer code, they can rapidly become computationally expensive. For example, propagating uncertainty with a 1,000 Monte Carlo samples wrapped around a finite element calculation that takes only 10 minutes to run requires seven days of single-processor time. An alternative is to combine a design of computer experiments to meta-modeling, and replace the potentially expensive computer simulation by a fast-running surrogate. The surrogate can then be used to estimate sensitivities, propagate uncertainty, and calibrate model parameters at a fraction of the cost it would take to wrap a sampling algorithm or optimization solver around the analysis code. In this publication, we focus on the dangers of using too sparsely populated design-of-experiments to propagate uncertainty or train a fast-running surrogate model. One danger for sensitivity analysis or calibration is to develop meta-models that include erroneous sensitivities. This is illustrated with a high-dimensional, non-linear mathematical function in which several parameter effects are statistically insignificant, therefore, mimicking a situation that is often encountered in practice. It is shown that using a sparse design of computer experiments leads to an incorrect approximation of the function.

pub.1051980140,Design search and optimisation using radial basis functions with regression capabilities,"Modern design search and optimisation (DSO) processes that involve the use of expensive computer simulations commonly use surrogate modelling techniques, where data is collected from planned experiments on the expensive codes and then used to build meta-models. Such models (often termed response surface models or RSMs) can be built using many methods that have a variety of capabilities. For example, simple polynomial (often linear or quadratic) regression curves have been used in this way for many years. These lack the ability to model complex shapes and so are not very useful in constructing global RSM’s for non-linear codes such as the Navier Stokes solvers used in CFD - they are, however, easy to build. By contrast Kriging and Gaussian Process models can be much more sophisticated but are often difficult and time consuming to set up and tune. At an intermediate level radial basis function (RBF) models using simple spline functions offer rapid modelling capabilities with some ability to fit complex data. However, as normally used such RBF RSM’s strictly interpolate the available computational data and while acceptable in some cases, when used with codes that are iteratively converged, they find it difficult to deal with the numerical noise inevitably present. This paper describes a modification to the basic RBF scheme that allows a systematic variation of the degree of regression from a pure linear regression line to a fully interpolating cubic radial basis function model. The ideas presented are illustrated with data from the field of aerospace design."
pub.1093372217,Deriving Verification-Related Means of Compliance for a Model-Based Testing Process,"DO-331 is the supplement of DO-178C for model-based development. DO-331 is an objective-based guidance, which defines a set of objectives that have to be achieved for the model-based development of aeronautical software. The guidance also recommends the evidence in terms of activities and work products that should respectively be carried out and produced to meet the objectives. To explain why the evidence collected supports the claims concerning objectives achievement, manufacturers could adopt a safety case-based approach. Fail-SafeMBT is an academic, recently proposed, and potentially innovative model-based testing process, which needs compelling arguments to be adopted for the development of aeronautical software. To reduce the gap between industrial settings and academic settings, in this paper, we adopt the safety case-based approach and we explain how to semiautomatically derive means for compliance, aimed at arguing Fail-SafeMBT's compliance. Our focus is limited to the Verification Planning Process and we contribute to partially justify the adequacy of Fail-SafeMBT to act as process evidence by creating fragments of compelling arguments. To do that, we first manually check if Fail-SafeMBT includes DO-178C/DO-331-compliant process elements, then we model Fail-SafeMBT in compliance with Software Process Engineering Meta-model 2.0, then, we derive process-based arguments from the Fail-SafeMBT process model by using MDSafeCer, the recently introduced Model Driven Safety Certification method. By doing so, we provide a threefold contribution: we pioneer the interpretation of DO-331 in academic settings, we validate MDSafeCer in the avionics domain and we strengthen Fail-SafeMBT by providing suggestions aimed at increasing its maturity level."

pub.1181629232,"Rapid simulation of wave runup on morphologically diverse, reef-lined coasts with the BEWARE-2 (Broad-range Estimator of Wave Attack in Reef Environments) meta-process model","Abstract. Low-lying, tropical, coral-reef-lined coastlines are becoming increasingly vulnerable to wave-driven flooding due to population growth, coral reef degradation, and sea-level rise. Early-warning systems (EWSs) are needed to enable coastal authorities to issue timely alerts and coordinate preparedness and evacuation measures for their coastal communities. At longer timescales, risk management and adaptation planning require robust assessments of future flooding hazard considering uncertainties. However, due to diversity in reef morphologies and complex reef hydrodynamics compared to sandy shorelines, there have been no robust analytical solutions for wave runup to allow for the development of large-scale coastal wave-driven flooding EWSs and risk assessment frameworks for reef-lined coasts. To address the need for fast, robust predictions of runup that account for the natural variability in coral reef morphologies, we constructed the BEWARE-2 (Broad-range Estimator of Wave Attack in Reef Environments) meta-process modeling system. We developed this meta-process model using a training dataset of hydrodynamics and wave runup computed by the XBeach Non-Hydrostatic process-based hydrodynamic model for 440 combinations of water level, wave height, and wave period with 195 representative reef profiles that encompass the natural diversity in real-world fringing coral reef systems. Through this innovation, BEWARE-2 can be applied in a larger range of coastal settings than meta-models that rely on a parametric description of the coral reef geometry. In the validation stage, the BEWARE-2 modeling system produced runup results that had a relative root mean square error of 13 % and relative bias of 5 % relative to runup simulated by XBeach Non-Hydrostatic for a large range of oceanographic forcing conditions and for diverse reef morphologies (root mean square error and bias 0.63 and 0.26 m, respectively, relative to mean simulated wave runup of 4.85 m). Incorporating parametric modifications in the modeling system to account for variations in reef roughness and beach slope allows for systematic errors (relative bias) in BEWARE-2 predictions to be reduced by a factor of 1.5–6.5 for relatively coarse or smooth reefs and mild or steep beach slopes. This prediction provided by the BEWARE-2 modeling system is faster by 4–5 orders of magnitude than the full, process-based hydrodynamic model and could therefore be integrated into large-scale EWSs for tropical, reef-lined coasts and used for large-scale flood risk assessments."
pub.1042342108,"Chapter Five Uncertainty in Environmental Decision Making: Issues, Challenges and Future Directions","Environmental decision making is complicated by the complexity of natural systems and the generally competing needs of multiple stakeholders. Modelling tools are often used to assist at various stages of the environmental decision-making process. If such models are to provide effective decision support, the uncertainties associated with all aspects of the decision-making process need to be taken into account explicitly, including those associated with data, models and human factors. However, as models become more complex to better represent integrated environmental, social and economic systems, achieving this goal becomes more difficult. Some of the important issues that need to be addressed in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty in environmental decision-making processes include:•The development of appropriate risk-based performance criteria that are understood and accepted by a range of scientific disciplines. Risk-based criteria generally relate to the concept of likelihood, the likely magnitude and the likely duration of failure, where failure is defined as the inability of an environmental system to perform its desired function. However, the terminology used in various disciplines differs. Given the increase in the use of integrated models, and the resulting collaboration between people from different disciplines, there is a need to develop a common lexicon, or at least a shared understanding of the meaning of the terminology used.•The development of methods for quantifying the uncertainty associated with human input (see Chapter 6). This includes the development of uncertainty analysis methods that are able to cater for subjective and non-quantitative factors, human decision-making processes (which may be influenced by political and other external factors), and uncertainties associated with the model development process itself.•The development of approaches and strategies for increasing the computational efficiency of integrated models, optimisation methods, and methods for estimating risk-based performance measures. Examples include the use of efficient Monte Carlo sampling techniques (e.g. Latin hypercube sampling) or first- and second-order approximations (e.g. first- and second-order reliability methods), the use of innovative sensitivity analysis methods to skeletonise complex integrated models and the replacement of computationally expensive process models with data-driven metamodels (e.g. artificial neural networks).•The development of integrated software frameworks that enable all sources of uncertainty to be incorporated in the environmental decision-making process (see Chapter 7)."
pub.1156566606,Adaptation Strategies Strongly Reduce the Future Impacts of Climate Change on Simulated Crop Yields,"Abstract Simulations of crop yield due to climate change vary widely between models, locations, species, management strategies, and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). To understand how climate and adaptation affects yield change, we developed a meta‐model based on 8703 site‐level process‐model simulations of yield with different future adaptation strategies and climate scenarios for maize, rice, wheat and soybean. We tested 10 statistical models, including some machine learning models, to predict the percentage change in projected future yield relative to the baseline period (2000–2010) as a function of explanatory variables related to adaptation strategy and climate change. We used the best model to produce global maps of yield change for the RCP4.5 scenario and identify the most influential variables affecting yield change using Shapley additive explanations. For most locations, adaptation was the most influential factor determining the projected yield change for maize, rice and wheat. Without adaptation under RCP4.5, all crops are expected to experience average global yield losses of 6%–21%. Adaptation alleviates this average projected loss by 1–13 percentage points. Maize was most responsive to adaptive practices with a projected mean yield loss of −21% [range across locations: −63%, +3.7%] without adaptation and −7.5% [range: −46%, +13%] with adaptation. For maize and rice, irrigation method and cultivar choice were the adaptation types predicted to most prevent large yield losses, respectively. When adaptation practices are applied, some areas are predicted to experience yield gains, especially at northern high latitudes. These results reveal the critical importance of implementing adequate adaptation strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change on crop yields.
Plain Language Summary  Computer simulations are commonly used to predict how crop yield may change under future climate conditions and land management practices. For four major crops (maize, rice, wheat and soybean), we tested different statistical methods to synthesize thousands of computer simulations of crop yield change under future climate into one meta‐model which can be used to predict crop yield at any location where that crop is grown. We then predicted the change in crop yield under a likely future climate scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) and identified which variables most explained the crop yield change. Considering both adaptive management status (whether or not adaptation practices were applied) and climate factors (average temperature, change in temperature, average precipitation, change in precipitation, CO 2 concentration), we found that adaptation status was the most influential factor determining the predicted yield change for most crops. Managing cropland adaptively in the future can reduce predicted yield losses by 1–13 percentage points relative to maintaining the same management practices. We discuss which types of manageme"
pub.1021325990,Model-Driven Development of Enterprise Applications,"Modern business systems need to cater to rapidly evolving business requirements in an ever-shrinking window of opportunity. Modern business systems also need to keep pace with rapid advances in technology. For developing large and complex applications, industrial practice has traditionally used a combination of non-formal notations and methods. Different notations are used to specify the properties of different aspects of an application and these specifications are transformed into their corresponding implementations through the steps of a development process. The development process relies heavily on manual verification to ensure the different pieces integrate into a consistent whole. This is an expensive and error-prone process demanding large teams with broad-ranging expertise in business domain, architecture and technology platforms. We present a model-driven development approach that addresses this problem by providing a set of modeling notations for specifying different layers of a system namely user interface, application functionality and database; a set of code generators that transform these models into platform-specific implementations; an abstraction for organizing application specification into work-units and an associated tool-assisted development process. Models, being at a higher level of abstraction, are easier to understand and verify for properties of interest. Model based code generation incorporating proven design and architectural patterns results in significant gains in productivity and uniformly high quality. Models defined using these different notations are instances of a single meta model. This enables well-formedness constraints to be specified between different models ensuring their consistency leading to smooth integration of implementations of these models. The approach has been used extensively to construct medium and large-scale enterprise applications resulting in improved productivity, better quality and platform independence. We also discuss issues that need to be addressed for the approach to gain wider acceptance in the industry."

Der Aufwand und die daraus resultierende Komplexität, die Einzelkomponenten aufeinander abzustimmen, wird in der betrieblichen Praxis oft unterschätzt. Unter Berücksichtigung der konzeptionellen und technischen Aspekte des Data Warehousing sowie der organisatorischen Rahmenbedingungen sind für ein integriertes Metadatenmanagement-Konzept Massnahmen zu ergreifen, die eine effektive Kontrolle des Data Warehousing ermöglichen. Dazu zählt beispielsweise der Aufbau eines zentralen Repositories, das auf der Basis eines die fachlichen und technischen Metadaten integrierenden Datenmodells realisiert ist. Auf diesem Gebiet hat man bei den Winterthur Versicherungen bereits positive Erfahrungen im Rahmen des Vorgehens bei der evolutionären Entwicklung des Unternehmensdatenmodells gesammelt. Ähnlich dieser Vorgehensweise sollte projektgetrieben der Aufbau des Metadatenmodells erfolgenGeht man von der Annahme der vorgeschlagenen Data-Warehouse-Lösung „Enterprise Data Warehouse“ aus (vgl. Joseph et al. (Mig) 2000, S. 86 ff.), das als zentrales Data Warehouse konzipiert ist, so liegt es nahe, das Metadatenmanagement ebenfalls zu zentralisieren. Die Vorteile für die Wahl dieses Lösungsszenarios ergeben sich unmittelbar aus betriebswirtschaftlichen und wirtschaftlichen Überlegungen, der Organisation und Bereitstellung einer zentralen Informationsarchitektur und -logistik. Ein dezentrales Metadatenmanagement widerspräche dem aktuellen Trend und der Entwicklung der betrieblichen Informatikstrategie. Im Vordergrund steht die Bereitstellung einer unternehmensweiten einheitlichen System-und Informationsintegration. Ausgehend von drei alternativen Architekturformen für ein Metadatenmanagement-System (zentrale Architektur, dezentraleArchitektur und verteilte Architektur, vgl. Do, Rahm 2000, S. 8 ff.) wird daher eine konzeptionelle idealtypische Architektur für ein Metadatenmanagement-Systetn bei der Winterthur vorgeschlagen, welche auf dem Ansatz einer verteilten Repository-Architektur basiert. Hierbei werden die Metadaten zwar in einem zentralen Repository integriert, die einzelnen DWH-Komponenten behalten aber nach wie vor die Kontrolle über ihre spezifischen Metadaten. Das zentrale Repository dient als Basis fir den Metadatenaustausch sowie zur Belieferung von speziellen Metadaten-Anwendungen wie dem Warehouse Information Catalog.

pub.1002488355,Panel on granularity in access control,"This panel will address the following question. Does an increase in the granularity of access control systems produce a measurable reduction in risk and help meet the goals of the organization, or is the cost prohibitively high? After decades of access control research, products, and practice, there has been a trend towards more complex access control policies and models that more finely restrict (or allow) access to resources. This allows policy administrators to more closely specify any high level abstract policy they may have in mind, or accurately enforce regulations such as HIPPA, SOX, or PCI. The end goal is to allow only those actions that are desirable in hindsight, or via an approach to which Bishop et al. refer as the Oracle Policy. As the expressive power of access control models can vary, an administrator may need a more powerful model to specify the high level policy they need for their particular application. It is not uncommon for new models to add new key-attributes, data-sources, features, or relations to provide a richer set of tools. This has resulted in an explosion of new one-off models in the literature, few of which make their way to real products or deployment. To increase the expressive power of a model, increase its granularity, reduce the complexity of administration and to answer desirable security queries such as safety, a plethora of new concepts have been added to access control models. To name a few: groups and roles; hierarchies and constraints; parameterized permissions; exceptions; time and location of users and resources; relationships between subjects; attributes of subjects, objects, and actions; information flow; conflict of interest classes; obligations; trust, benefit, and risk; workflows; delegation; situational awareness and context; and so on. All of these constructs build to a meta-model, as Barker observes. This granularity has resulted in many novel and useful findings, new algorithms, and challenging open research issues, but poses potential problems as well. With granularity often comes complexity which manifests itself in specifying policies, managing and maintaining policies over time, and auditing logs to ensure compliance. This panel will discuss issues surrounding the problem of complexity in access control. From designing and specifying new models, designing enforcement mechanisms on real-world systems, policy lifecycle, and the role of analytics from automatically generating policies to auditing logs. So, is this complexity worth it? Does increasing the granularity produce a measurable reduction in the risk to sensitive resources and protect the goals of the organization or is the cost prohibitively high? Can we ever truly specify a ""correct"" and ""complete"" policy, which may be too dynamic and require the interpretation of the courts to decide, especially when policies are intended to enforce ambiguous regulations. Finally, at what cost should we strive for a perfect, fine-grained policy? Sh"
pub.1004080483,From system requirements documents to integrated system modeling artifacts,"In the development of embedded systems starting from high-level requirements and going over to system specification and further to architecture various aspects and issues have to be elicited, collected, analyzed and documented. These start from early phase contents like goals and high level requirements and go on to more concrete requirements and finally to system specifications, architecture design documents on which the final implementation of the system is based. Traditionally these contents have to be captured in documents such as product specification documents (in German: Lastenheft) and system specification documents (in German: Pflichtenheft). Typically in the early phases of system development a high number of different documents are produced that all talk about different issues and aspects of the system and also the development. Unavoidably a lot of these documents carry similar information and sometimes contain the same information in many different copies. Typically these documents are under a continuous change due to new insights and changing constraints. As a result configuration and version management and, in particular, change management of these documents becomes a nightmare. Every time an individual requirement, a goal or an aspect is modified, this modification has to be carried out consistently in all the documents. The changes produce new versions of the documents. A configuration management of such documents is nearly impossible. As a result information sometimes contained in more than 20 documents tends to become inconsistent. After a while there is a tendency not to update existing documents anymore and just to accept that at the end of the project a lot of the documents are no longer up-to-date and no more consistent. In the best case finally at the end of the project an updated documentation is produced in a step of reverse engineering. In the worst case a final consistent actual documentation is not produced at all such that the documentation of the system is completely lost and later a complicated and time consuming reconstruction of the documentation in a step of reengineering has to be carried out by the team that has to maintain the system -- by engineers who are often not involved in the development and therefore not familiar with the contents of the projects. A different approach aims at the use of content models, called artifact models, where the information about systems are captured in a structured way using modeling techniques such that all this information is structured in terms of comprehensive product models, sometimes called artifact models (or also meta-models) that describe all the relevant contents of a system in a structured way and trace the relationship between these contents in a way that there is no redundancy in the model but just relationships between the different parts of the models. To do that a model-based development technique is most appropriate where substantial parts of the content is not"

pub.1128157580,Digging into Business Process Meta-models: A First Ontological Analysis,"Abstract
While modern definitions of business processes exist and are shared in the Business Process Management community, a commonly agreed meta-model is still missing. Nonetheless, several different business process meta-models have been recently proposed and discussed in the literature, which look at business process models from different perspectives, focusing on different aspects and often using different labels for denoting the same element or element relation.In this paper, we start from elements and relations discovered inspecting the literature on business process meta-models through a systematic literature review. We then combine these elements and relations to build a business process meta-model. The obtained literature-based business process meta-model, which is on purpose built to disclose criticalities, is then inspected and discussed. The analysis reveals, besides the lack of attention to some crucial business process elements, issues and inconsistencies in the literature meta-models. An ontological analysis is finally carried out and possible solutions to the discovered issues are proposed."

In our Department of Trauma Surgery a specific guideline is available paper-based as a set of flowcharts. This format is appropriate for the use by experienced physicians but insufficient for electronic support of learning, workflow and process optimization. A formal and logically consistent version represented with a standardized meta-model is necessary for automatic processing. In our project we transferred the paper-based into an electronic format and analyzed the structure with respect to formal errors. Several errors were detected in 7 error categories. The errors were corrected to reach a formal and logically consistent process model. In a second step the clinical content of the guideline was revised interactively using a process modeling tool. Our study reveals that guideline development should be assisted by process modeling tools, which check the content in comparison to a meta-model. The meta-model itself could support the domain experts in formulating their knowledge systematically. To assure sustainability of guideline development a representation independent of specific applications or specific provider is necessary. Then clinical guidelines could be used for training, process optimization and workflow management additionally."

Cloud computing emerged not as new form of computing or network technology but a mere remoulding of existing technologies to suit a new business model. Cloud robotics is understood as adaptation of cloud computing ideas for robotic applications. Current efforts in cloud robotics stress upon developing robots that utilize computing and service infrastructure of the cloud, without debating on the underlying business model. HTM5 is an OMG’s MDA based Meta-model for agent oriented development of cloud robotic systems. The trade-view of HTM5 promotes peer-to-peer trade amongst software agents. HTM5 agents represent various cloud entities and implement their business logic on cloud interactions. Trade in a peer-to-peer cloud robotic system is based on relationships and contracts amongst several agent subsets. Electronic Institutions are associations of heterogeneous intelligent agents which interact with each other following predefined norms. In Dynamic Electronic Institutions, the process of formation, reformation and dissolution of institutions is automated leading to run time adaptations in groups of agents. DEIs in agent oriented cloud robotic ecosystems bring order and group intellect. This article presents DEI implementations through HTM5 methodology."

ApproachA generic record linkage process model was mapped to reflect the general practices and activities involved in record linkage at Statistics Canada. The model was developed with a view for more general use by other statistical agencies involved in record linkage. It was built on the Generic Statistical Business Process Model v5.0 developed by the Joint UNECE/Eurostat/OECD Work Session on Statistical Metadata (METIS) for survey purposes. It also builds on international models of record linkage from Australia and the United States as well as record linkage methodology used at Statistics Canada. In addition, it was informed by the relevant legal and policy frameworks that govern all of Statistics Canada statistical activities. Over one hundred people involved in all aspects of record linkage at Statistics Canada were consulted during this process.ResultsAn activity-oriented Record Linkage Project Process Model was drafted and proposed as a standard for the agency. It breaks down the record linkage process into three meta-phases: project planning, record linkage, post-linkage activities. Each meta-phase is further divided into phases and sub-phases that describe the activities of the record linkage project from specification of needs to project close-out and evaluation. An additional feature of the model is a description of the outcome of each phase that can be used as a milestone marker or as a gateway to the next phase. ConclusionAs a descriptive model, the Record Linkage Project Process Model will inform management on the range of activities related to a record linkage project that go well beyond the function of matching records between two data files. It can also be used as a prescriptive model that will provide guidance to individuals engaging in a record linkage project."
pub.1077203329,Modeling Interdependencies between Information Processes and Communication Paths in Hospitals,"OBJECTIVES: For planning hospital information systems it is important to recognize the interrelation between business processes and the communication needs between supporting application systems. We therefore present an approach to model, visualize and analyze those interdependencies.
METHODS: The approach is based on the concepts defined in 3LGM2, a meta-model to describe health information systems (HIS). An information process is defined as a sequence of functions using or updating information; a communication path as a sequence of communication links between interfaces belonging to application systems. The search for communication paths belonging to an information process is interpreted as an all-pairs shortest-paths problem. To solve this problem the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is applied.
RESULTS: The resulting algorithm has been implemented as function of the 3LGM2 tool, a tool to create 3LGM2 compliant models. With it, it is possible to interactively define information processes at the domain layer and to analyze step by step whether the infrastructure at the logical tool layer is sufficient to communicate necessary data between application systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach enables the representation and analysis of dependencies between information processes and communication paths. With it, the HIS architecture is directly associated with the business needs. This is an important condition for the systematic planning of hospital information systems."
pub.1113598827,A Learning Loop Model of Collaborative Decision-Making in Chronic Illness,"Shared decision-making is a core attribute of quality health care that has proved challenging to implement and assess in pediatric practice. Current models of shared decision-making are limited, including their capacity to incorporate multiple stakeholders; to integrate downstream effects of subacute or minor decisions; and to account for the context(s) in which such decisions are being made and enacted. Based on a review of literature from organizational psychology, cognitive sciences, business, and medicine, we propose an iterative decision-making model of care planning and identify targets at several levels of influence warranting measurement in future studies. Our learning loop model posits the relationship between pediatric patients, their parents, and their clinicians as central to the collaborative decision-making process in the setting of chronic illness. The model incorporates the evolution of both context and developmental capacity over time. It suggests that ""meta-learning"" from the experience of and outcomes from iterative decision is a key factor that may influence relationships and thus continued engagement in collaboration by patients, their parents, and their clinicians. We consider the model in light of the needs of children with special health care needs, for whom understanding the ongoing iterative effects of decision making and clinician-parent-child dynamics are likely to be particularly important in influencing outcomes."
pub.1035740658,Towards a framework for the elicitation of dilemmas,"This paper covers the main findings of the doctoral research that was concerned with seeking to extend aspects of dilemma theory. In professional practice, the Trompenaars Hampden-Turner Dilemma Reconciliation ProcessTM is a vehicle delivering dilemma theory in application. It informs a manager or leader on how to explore the dilemmas they face, how to reconcile the tensions that result, and how to structure the action steps for implementing the reconciled solutions. This vehicle forms the professional practice of the author who seeks to bring more rigor to consulting practice and thereby also contribute to theory development in the domain. The critical review of dilemma theory reveals that previous authors are inconsistent and variously invalid in their use of the terms ‘dilemma theory,’ ‘dilemma methodology,’ ‘dilemma process,’ ‘dilemma reconciliation,’ etc., and therefore an attempt is made to resolve these inconsistencies by considering whether ‘dilemmaism’ at the meta-level might be positioned as a new paradigm of inquiry for (management) research that embodies ontological, epistemological, and methodical premises that frame an approach to the resolution of real world business problems in (multi) disciplinary; (multi) functional and (multi) cultural business environments. This research offers contributions to knowledge, professional practice and theory development from the exploration of the SPID model as a way to make the elicitation of dilemmas more rigorous and structured and in the broader context of exploring ‘dilemmaism’ as a new paradigm of inquiry."
pub.1099999891,Standardized languages and notations for graphical modelling of patient care processes: a systematic review,"PURPOSE: The importance of working toward quality improvement in healthcare implies an increasing interest in analysing, understanding and optimizing process logic and sequences of activities embedded in healthcare processes. Their graphical representation promotes faster learning, higher retention and better compliance. The study identifies standardized graphical languages and notations applied to patient care processes and investigates their usefulness in the healthcare setting.
DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed literature up to 19 May 2016. Information complemented by a questionnaire sent to the authors of selected studies.
STUDY SELECTION: Systematic review conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
DATA EXTRACTION: Five authors extracted results of selected studies.
RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Ten articles met the inclusion criteria. One notation and language for healthcare process modelling were identified with an application to patient care processes: Business Process Model and Notation and Unified Modeling Language™. One of the authors of every selected study completed the questionnaire. Users' comprehensibility and facilitation of inter-professional analysis of processes have been recognized, in the filled in questionnaires, as major strengths for process modelling in healthcare.
CONCLUSION: Both the notation and the language could increase the clarity of presentation thanks to their visual properties, the capacity of easily managing macro and micro scenarios, the possibility of clearly and precisely representing the process logic. Both could increase guidelines/pathways applicability by representing complex scenarios through charts and algorithms hence contributing to reduce unjustified practice variations which negatively impact on quality of care and patient safety."
pub.1160730748,Data Quality in Health Research: Integrative Literature Review,"BACKGROUND: Decision-making and strategies to improve service delivery must be supported by reliable health data to generate consistent evidence on health status. The data quality management process must ensure the reliability of collected data. Consequently, various methodologies to improve the quality of services are applied in the health field. At the same time, scientific research is constantly evolving to improve data quality through better reproducibility and empowerment of researchers and offers patient groups tools for secured data sharing and privacy compliance.
OBJECTIVE: Through an integrative literature review, the aim of this work was to identify and evaluate digital health technology interventions designed to support the conducting of health research based on data quality.
METHODS: A search was conducted in 6 electronic scientific databases in January 2022: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Digital Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and flowchart were used to visualize the search strategy results in the databases.
RESULTS: After analyzing and extracting the outcomes of interest, 33 papers were included in the review. The studies covered the period of 2017-2021 and were conducted in 22 countries. Key findings revealed variability and a lack of consensus in assessing data quality domains and metrics. Data quality factors included the research environment, application time, and development steps. Strategies for improving data quality involved using business intelligence models, statistical analyses, data mining techniques, and qualitative approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: The main barriers to health data quality are technical, motivational, economical, political, legal, ethical, organizational, human resources, and methodological. The data quality process and techniques, from precollection to gathering, postcollection, and analysis, are critical for the final result of a study or the quality of processes and decision-making in a health care organization. The findings highlight the need for standardized practices and collaborative efforts to enhance data quality in health research. Finally, context guides decisions regarding data quality strategies and techniques.

pub.1048095936,Convergent innovation for sustainable economic growth and affordable universal health care: innovating the way we innovate,"This paper introduces convergent innovation (CI) as a form of meta-innovation-an innovation in the way we innovate. CI integrates human and economic development outcomes, through behavioral and ecosystem transformation at scale, for sustainable prosperity and affordable universal health care within a whole-of-society paradigm. To this end, CI combines technological and social innovation (including organizational, social process, financial, and institutional), with a special focus on the most underserved populations. CI takes a modular approach that convenes around roadmaps for real world change-a portfolio of loosely coupled complementary partners from the business community, civil society, and the public sector. Roadmaps serve as collaborative platforms for focused, achievable, and time-bound projects to provide scalable, sustainable, and resilient solutions to complex challenges, with benefits both to participating partners and to society. In this paper, we first briefly review the literature on technological innovation that sets the foundations of CI and motivates its feasibility. We then describe CI, its building blocks, and enabling conditions for deployment and scaling up, illustrating its operational forms through examples of existing CI-sensitive innovation. "
pub.1069285850,The SGML Standardization Framework and the Introduction of XML,"Extensible Markup Language (XML) is on its way to becoming a global standard for the representation, exchange, and presentation of information on the World Wide Web (WWW). More than that, XML is creating a standardization framework, in terms of an open network of meta-standards and mediators that allows for the definition of further conventions and agreements in specific business domains. Such an approach is particularly needed in the healthcare domain; XML promises to especially suit the particularities of patient records and their lifelong storage, retrieval, and exchange. At a time when change rather than steadiness is becoming the faithful feature of our society, standardization frameworks which support a diversified growth of specifications that are appropriate to the actual needs of the users are becoming more and more important; and efforts should be made to encourage this new attempt at standardization to grow in a fruitful direction. Thus, the introduction of XML reflects a standardization process which is neither exclusively based on an acknowledged standardization authority, nor a pure market standard. Instead, a consortium of companies, academic institutions, and public bodies has agreed on a common recommendation based on an existing standardization framework. The consortium's process of agreeing to a standardization framework will doubtlessly be successful in the case of XML, and it is suggested that it should be considered as a generic model for standardization processes in the future."
pub.1021293944,Reflecting onreflection: a personal encounter,"This paper reports a retrospective study of a Senior Lecturer in Nursing Studies experience of supervising a student teacher who, as part of her teaching placement experience, utilised 'Critically Reflective Analysis of an Educational Event' as a means to assess her teaching in the practice setting. The Senior Lecturer and student nurse teacher used an external 'advisor' to facilitate their meta-reflection on the theoretical perspectives that informed the process in which they were engaged. The paper raises the following questions for consideration--What is the link between ability to reflect and quality of practice? Is it possible to utilise reflective tutorials as a means of assessing professional competence whilst at the same time encouraging personal and professional development? Is the ability to reflect on practice dependent on the context? Should we assume that all practitioners have the necessary skills to supervise students in practice and what preparation and support is needed? The paper demonstrates that by introducing 'Critically Reflective Analysis of an Education Event' into the student teachers' curriculum the role of both supervisor and student teacher was challenged and changed. The paper also demonstrates that reflective tutorials are not wholly a retrospective business. They are creative, or recreative of a teaching experience, as well as to some extent representing it. Finally, even if one cannot speak in Kuhnian parlance, of a conceptual revolution, it would seem legitimate to say, in Schon's terms, that the contextual frame in which professional problems are addressed has undergone significant change."
pub.1032561519,Business Process and Practice Alignment Meta-model,"Business Process Modelling (BPM) is one of the most important phases of information system design. Business Process meta-models allow capturing informational and behavioural aspects of business processes. Unfortunately, standard business process meta-modelling approaches, such as the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Meta-model, Quality-Oriented Business Process Meta-Model (QOBPM) and Transactional Meta-Model for Business Process (TMBP) focus just on process description, providing different business process models. According to these meta-modelling approaches, it is not possible to compare and identify related daily practices in order to improve business process models. This lack of information recognizes that further research in Business Process (BP) meta-model is needed to reflect the evolution/change on software processes. Considering this limitation in BP meta-modelling, this paper presents a comparative study of the most recognized business process meta-models approaches and introduces a new BP meta-model designed by Business Process and Practice Alignment Meta-model (BPPAMeta-model). Our intention is to present observed problems in existing approaches and propose a business process meta-model that addresses features related to the alignment between daily work practices and business process descriptions."

The defined meta-model, mainly capturing the syntax and semantics of the business process charactrizing model, is intended to guide the development of business process support systems. In addition, the relation between the SCOR model and the class process in the BPCM meta-model is addressed. Furthermore, the mapping from the BPCM meta-model to BPMN meta-model in a combined framework for developing business process support systems is depicted."
pub.1099670994,An Agile Business Process and Practice Meta-model," Business Process Management (BPM) encompasses the discovery, modelling, monitoring, analysis and improvement of business processes. Limitations of traditional BPM approaches in addressing changes in business requirements have resulted in a number of agile BPM approaches that seek to accelerate the redesign of business process models. Meta-models are a key BPM feature that reduce the ambiguity of business process models. This paper describes a meta-model supporting the agile version of the Business Process and Practice Alignment Methodology (BPPAM) for business process improvement, which captures process information from actual work practices. The ability of the meta-model to achieve business process agility is discussed and compared with other agile meta-models, based on definitions of business process flexibility and agility found in the literature."
pub.1004918729,A Quality-Oriented Business Process Meta-Model,"Business process modeling is an important part of information systems design. Business process modeling techniques provide a standard way of presentation and communication of business processes. One important problem in this context is to assess the quality of business processes as well as their ontological constructs, which raises several issues, such as the identification of business process constructs as well as the quality dimensions and factors relevant to these constructs. In this paper, our goal is twofold. First, we present a business process meta-model containing all possible constructs of a business process. Second, after discussing a set of quality factors suitable for business processes constructs, we present a quality oriented meta-model resulting from the enrichment of the business process meta-model with quality related information."

Business process modeling is typically performed by business analysts and managers from the purpose of transformation of business prospective of Enterprises to the IT prospective. To model business perspective, need of high level Process Model has been raised as Business Process Modeling Notation, BPMN, is considered at low level. Our belief is that the sequencing and alignment of business rule can lay down the construction of High level process model. We have explored the nature of business rule in business and developed a Business rule meta-model to represent them. Thereafter, A Process Template is derived from Business rule meta-model and then Process Template is mapped to High level process model. In this paper we have focused on Business rule meta-model and construction of Process Template. From Process Template to High level process model will be the future work."

However, current modeling methods always fall short in describing complex collaboration relationship existing in business process integration in SOA-based collaborative environment. On the basis of existing multi-views business process model, a collaborative business process modeling method is presented to meet the above requirement in this paper. According to the analysis of inter-enterprise collaborative behavior, multi-enterprises collaborative meta-model integrating process, role, service and data is put forward. Then, on the foundation of collaborative meta-model, adopting model mapping method, existing business process model is transformed into multi-views collaborative business process model. The proposed method lays a solid foundation for cross-organizational business process integration."

                  Background: Business Process Modelling (BPM) is one of the most important phases of information system design. Business Process (BP) meta-models allow capturing informational and behavioural aspects of business processes. Unfortunately, standard BP meta-modelling approaches focus just on process description, providing different BP models. It is not possible to compare and identify related daily practices in order to improve BP models. This lack of information implies that further research in BP meta-models is needed to reflect the evolution/change in BP. Considering this limitation, this paper introduces a new BP meta-model designed by Business Process and Practice Alignment Meta-model (BPPAMeta-model). Our intention is to present a meta-model that addresses features related to the alignment between daily work practices and BP descriptions. Objectives: This paper intends to present a metamodel which is going to integrate daily work information into coherent and sound process definitions. Methods/Approach: The methodology employed in the research follows a design-science approach. Results: The results of the case study are related to the application of the proposed meta-model to align the specification of a BP model with work practices models. Conclusions: This meta-model can be used within the BPPAM methodology to specify or improve business processes models based on work practice descriptions."
pub.1009335848,Fabric-Process Patterns,"Fabric-processes are processes acting upon a fabric. A fabric is a set of virtualized resources and services supporting business processes. Fabric processes do not directly pursue a business goal, but IT-related goals such as the creation of a cloud-service or its configuration. Fabric-processes differ from business processes in their meta-model. Fabric processes include resources and operations not found in business processes. The meta-model developed enables the proper specification of fabric-processes. We address requirements for specifying fabric-processes by so-called Fabric-Process Patterns. We develop a Fabric-Resource-Meta-Model which implements the Fabric-Process Patterns. The Fabric-Resource-Meta-Model extends existing resource meta-models."
pub.1095059044,Business Process Composition Based on Meta Models,"Nowadays, Business Process Management (BPM) technology has been developed and widely applied in small and large scale. There are many companies and organizations implemented business process oriented information systems. Therefore, the flexibility issues become very important in managing large quantity of business processes because business processes are always changing overtime. There is a need of flexible business process models so that every possible changes can be done easily every time. Flexible business process models are represented by a reconfigurable model. In this paper, we proposed a method to manage business process model variations in order to efficiently develop the business process repository. The variation management is done by storing the common business processes and its variation in the repository. Then, we also propose meta models which contain information about the models stored in the repository. The results show that the meta models support the composition process of a new business process based on the common business process. The variation management has achieved to reduce storage redundancy up to 82%."
pub.1043468336,A New Process Meta-model for Convenient Process Reconfiguration,"With the analysis of WFMC (Workflow Management Coalition) process meta-model, it’s indicated that the limitations of that model cause the difficulty for convenient reconfiguration of business process. So, a new process meta-model, ESR (Event-State-Rule) meta-model, is presented in this paper as the substitution to WFMC’s. Some elements are added in the new model, such as the event, the state and the rule with which dynamic relevance between the process and the business can be normalized expressed in process definition. Also, the boundary between process logic and business logic becomes much more explicit with the benefit from that model, which means that process logic can be separated from business logic quite effectively. Now, it becomes possible that rigid process and flexible process are modeled in a unified process framework. When process logic varies, the reconfiguration of the process may be fulfilled only with the corresponding variation of process definition so that convenient process reconfiguration is implemented."

This solution advocates a driven engineering approach considering at the CIM level, a specific meta-model, the Version Business Process (VBP) meta-model for modelling versions of Business Processes (BP), and at the PIM level, an extension of the BPMN meta-model for visualizing and user validating the modelled BP versions. This paper introduces the VBP meta-model, presents the extension of BPMN we propose to specify versions of BPs, and illustrates how we automatically map, using QVT rules, BP versions modelled using the VBP meta-model onto corresponding extended BPMN ones. This solution is intended to business process designers: it supports them for modelling and specifying flexible business processes using the version concept."
pub.1014529682,An Extension of BPMN Meta-model for Evaluation of Business Processes,"Business process modeling is used for better understanding and communication of company's processes. Mostly, business process modeling is discussed from the information system development perspective. Execution of a business process involves various factors (costs and time) which are important and should be represented in business process models. Controlling of business units uses post execution analysis for detection of failures for improvement. The process models conceived for information system development are not sufficient for post execution analysis. This paper focuses on the challenges of business process modeling in the post execution context. We provide a meta model for evaluation of a business process and discuss BPMN in this context. We also extend existing BPMN meta model for performance analysis of business processes. The proposed extensions are presented with the help of an example."

To be more efficient, organizations look for a good business process modeling. In this way, to model a business process, the are a lot of knowledge which are responsible to present a part of the process in a good level of understanding. However, the issue to be addressed in this paper is how to formalize implicit pieces of knowledge figured in the business process so as to construct a business knowledge model which will be treat in a high understanding level. This paper contributes with a meta-modeling approach that the principle is to transform a business process model to a business knowledge model. The purpose of such an approach is to provide a way to automatically build a business ontology based on easy processing of business knowledge dimensions."
pub.1012988851,Semantics of business process vocabulary and process rules,"Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), an OMG standard, provides a meta-model for the semantic and declarative models of business vocabulary and business rules. Logical formulation of SBVR facilitates IT people to interpret these models generated by business people. However, an important aspect of a business is process model, and it is outside the scope of SBVR. Knowledge intensive and dynamic nature of business processes require such a declarative meta-model for process modeling in order to provide flexibility and adaptability. In this work, an approach for process modeling using SBVR's methodology is proposed. We have made an initial attempt to define a declarative meta-model, Semantics of Business Process Vocabulary and Process Rules (SBPVR). SBPVR divides knowledge of business processes into three parts; process concept types, process fact types and process rules. Process concept types and fact types represent structure of processes and process rules provide guidance over the structure and flow of processes at execution time. In the paper, these types are further categorized to represent the various elements of process models. SBPVR provides flexibility and adaptability to the process model through its declarative nature and fact oriented approach."
pub.1134463877,What is a process model composed of?,"Business process modelling languages typically enable the representation of business process models by employing (graphical) symbols. These symbols can vary depending upon the verbosity of the language, the modelling paradigm, the focus of the language and so on. To make explicit different constructs and rules employed by a specific language, as well as bridge the gap across different languages, meta-models have been proposed in the literature. These meta-models are a crucial source of knowledge on what state-of-the-art literature considers relevant to describe business processes. The goal of this work is to provide the first extensive systematic literature review (SLR) of business process meta-models. This SLR aims to answer research questions concerning: (1) the kind of meta-models proposed in the literature, (2) the recurring constructs they contain, (3) their purposes and (4) their evaluations. The SRL was performed manually considering papers automatically retrieved from reference paper repositories as well as proceedings of the main conferences in the Business Process Management research area. Sixty-five papers were selected and evaluated against four research questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of work conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular, in answering the research questions several challenges have (re-)emerged for the Business Process Community, concerning: (1) the type of elements that constitute a Business Process and their meaning, (2) the absence of a (or several) reference meta-model(s) for the community, (3) the purpose for which meta-models are introduced in the literature and (4) a framework for the evaluation of the meta-models themselves. Moreover, the classification framework devised to answer the four research questions can provide a reference structure for future descriptive categorizations."
pub.1047039542,Exchange of Business Process Models Using the POP* Meta-model,"Enterprise Modelling, in general, and Business Process Modelling, in particular, have been used for decades for different purposes and with interesting results. However, a variety of problems can be identified in this context and many enterprises find it difficult to leverage the full potential and benefits of these technologies. One of the most important problems in this sense is the lack of interoperability among enterprises at the modelling level. Quite a lot of efforts has been carried out in this domain to improve enterprise interoperability at this level. The development of the POP* meta-model is one of these initiatives, which aim to establish a meta-model and a corresponding methodology that enable enterprises to exchange their enterprise models, despite the fact that they use different Enterprise Modelling Tools.In this paper, we present a ‘proof of concept’ of the POP* meta-model focused on the process dimension, which is expected to further our understanding of how this meta-model can be used to exchange different business process models among the partners in networks of collaborative enterprises. Moreover, the work performed in this ‘proof of concept’ has been a valuable aid to validate and improve the development of the POP* meta-model."

vary depending upon the verbosity of the language, the modelling paradigm, the
focus of the language, and so on. To make explicit the different constructs and
rules employed by a specific language, as well as bridge the gap across
different languages, meta-models have been proposed in literature. These
meta-models are a crucial source of knowledge on what state-of-the-art
literature considers relevant to describe business processes. The goal of this
work is to provide an extensive systematic literature review (SLR) of business
process meta-models. This SLR aims at answering research questions concerning:
(i) the kind of meta-models proposed in literature; (ii) the recurring
constructs they contain; (iii) their purposes; and (iv) their evaluations."
pub.1104378469,Towards a Risk-Aware Business Process Modelling Tool Using the ADOxx Platform,"Abstract
Business Process modelling is a key element in the management of organizations. It allows to build an analytical representation of ‘as-is’ processes in an organization and compared it with ‘to-be’ processes for improving their efficiency. Besides, although, risk is an element that can affect business process negatively, it is still managed independently. A necessary link is missing between business process and risk models. To better manage risk related to business process, it should be integrated and evaluated dynamically within the business process models. Currently, there are different meta-models allowing business process modelling. Nevertheless, there are few meta-models allowing risk modelling and even fewer ones that integrate both concepts related to risks and business processes. Based on this need and these observations, we propose, in this work, a risk-aware business process modelling tool using the ADOxx meta-modelling platform."
pub.1071898608,Research on the Business Process Modeling Based on Domain-Specific Modeling Meta-Model Driven,"To decrease the difficulty of business process modeling, the domain-specific modeling (DSM) method and the frame of model driven architecture (MDA) were discussed in this paper. By applying DSM and MDA, the meta-model consisting of domain schema and domain template was established to simplify the business process. Then the character property, relationship property and operation of business-process-oriented DSM (BP-DSM) meta-model were described. The meta-model and application template would be consummated by continuous instantiation and abstraction of the domain concepts. By extracting and accumulating a large number of enterprises' templates within the same industry, the industry-oriented model template would be ultimately established."
pub.1023723338,Modeling functional requirements for configurable content- and context-aware dynamic service selection in business process models,"In this article, we propose a meta-model for formal specification of functional requirements for configurable content- and context-aware dynamic service selection in business process models with the objective to enable greater flexibility of the modeled processes. The dynamic service selection can cope with highly dynamic business environments that today's business processes must handle. Modeling functional requirements for dynamic service selection in business process models is not well covered in literature. Some partial solutions exist but none of them allows modeling a complete set of functional requirements for the selection similar to the one we are addressing in this article. Our meta-model enables formal specification of service selection relevant data extracted from service request message, custom configuration data (e.g., thresholds), process and task definition/instance metadata, and service selection rules. The meta-model is configurable and content- and context-aware. Processes leveraging our meta-model can adapt to changing requirements without redesign of the process flow. Proposed meta-model allows users to additionally configure the models at run time (e.g., raising a threshold). Modeling can be divided into roles with different required competences. We implement our meta-model in BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) through specific extensions to the BPMN semantic and diagram elements. By measuring complexity of real-world sample process models we show that using our solution modelers can efficiently model business processes that need to address frequent changing demands. Compared to available alternatives, models using our solution have on average ∼13% fewer activities, ∼16% fewer control-flow elements and ∼22% fewer control paths. By reading ∼10% smaller models (by volume) model readers get more flexible process models that capture all functional requirements for the dynamic selection."
pub.1158575350,An MDA Approach for Extending Functional Dimension for Sensitive Business Processes Execution,"In this research paper, we have proposed a rigorous scientific approach to ensure the transformation of the extended BPMN2.0 meta-model into an executable business process model. We are particularly interested in the extension of the functional dimension of BPMN2.0. Subsequently, we based ourselves on the MDA model-driven architecture to ensure the transformation of models to an executable business process. Indeed, the CIM level (Computaional Independant Model) of MDA, corresponds to the BPM4KI model, the PIM level (Plateform Independant Model) corresponds to the extended BPMN2.0 meta-model and the PSM level (Plateform Specific Model) corresponds to the execution of sensitive business processes. Thus, the modeling and deployment of such sensitive processes requires the development and implementation of a specific business process management system that supports the defined extensions."
pub.1026479423,Meta-model for Data Harmonization and Business Process Compliance in Service Procurement,"Diminished transaction costs, increased transparency and shortened procurement times entail increased importance of service e-procurement compared to traditional service procurement. Due to proprietary data exchange formats and individual business processes, data harmonization and business process compliance are shortcoming. In this paper a meta-model to formulate requirements of service procurement collaborations with a combined view on information and control flow is presented. Our focus is on two constituent elements of the model: collaborative business processes and service objects. Both elements define features which are characteristic for investigated value constellations. Challenge at hand is to implement standardized interfaces easing seamless exchange of information between business partners. Existing procurement systems need enhanced process-awareness and compliance with service-dominant-logic. The meta-model also serves as reference framework which identifies and correlates typical entities of service procurement collaborations. Furthermore a domain specific meta-model extension for industrial service procurement is derived. This extension serves as basis for data harmonization of service procurement data and enacts compliance of business processes in industrial service procurement collaborations."
pub.1094006750,Application and Research of Ontology in Workflow Knowledge Meta-model,"Workflow management is the key technology in implementing the control of business process. The current workflow meta-model depends on specific parameters and implementation process, and lacks the exhibition of semantics understanding and knowledge involved. So, this paper proposes a workflow knowledge meta-model based on ontology, in order to support the combination of business modeling process and knowledge in the process. With the definition of exact grains meta knowledge object in workflow ontology, it can implement the separation of basic application's objects and meta objects and customization of work flow workflow process. Moreover, the paper proposes related definition, which will be of great help for the transition from process meta-model to workflow knowledge meta-model."

This meta-model, in which both business process reengineering and software reengineering are considered, is accompanied by an approach to analyze and diagnose processes and software components. A prototype has been developed supporting this approach and has been designed on the basis of the proposed reengineering meta-model. These ideas are validated by a case study which is presented in this paper, related to a process in the high education field. The context of this case study is described, then the corresponding instances of the meta-model are presented and some improvement results are exposed."
pub.1165183095,Towards a Meta-Modeling Approach for Business Process Models Improvement Based on Ontological Analysis,"Business process modeling enable smoother and more efficient decision making in the organizations as it achieve consistency and standardization of their operations, facilitate communication and collaboration between different stakeholders. Therefore, it is important to be able to model real world aspects. To this end, we have carried out a thorough review of the relevant literature which focuses on real-world aspects that Business process modeling languages BPMLs are not able to model. These aspects are based on ontological analysis and characterization of process modeling constructs. Our research aims to propose an approach for business process model modeling improvement by defining Object Constraint Language OCL rules written at the meta-model level making them independent from specific notations. We exploited IS domain knowledge, defined a meta-model, and added semantics to the meta-model by the mean of OCL constraints. As formalism we use the (OCL) with Ecore from the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)."
pub.1005005891,A Business Process Meta-Model for Knowledge Identification Based on a Core Ontology,"Business process modeling (BPM) has become primary concern for any successful organization to improve the management of their individual and collective crucial knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new multi-perspective meta-model of business processes modeling for knowledge management (KM), called BPM4KI (Business Process Meta-Model for Knowledge Identification). This meta-model is semantically rich and well founded on COOP, a core ontology of organization’s processes. It covers all aspects of BPM and KM: the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. The aim of BPM4KI is to develop a rich and expressive graphical representation of BPs, especially, the sensitive business processes (SBPs) in order to identify and localize the crucial knowledge that is mobilized and created by these processes. Besides, it is evaluated through a real SBP scenario from medical domain in the context of the organization of protection of the motor disabled people of Sfax-Tunisia (ASHMS)."
pub.1095792619,A Meta-Meta-Model For Seven Business Process Modeling Languages,"Many different business process modelling languages (BPMLs) have been designed in recent years. In cross-organizational business processes and heterogeneous organizations where multiple BPMLs are deployed there is a need for a unified view to ease communication and foster understandability. This paper proposes a language independent abstraction of seven mainstream BPMLs' concepts, in a unified meta-meta model based on an analysis of these modelling languages. Generic concepts are identified and a unified meta-model is developed. An ontological analysis of the representational capability of this meta-model is examined in relation to the Bunge-Wand-Weber ontology and applicability of the approach is demonstrated via an Example."
pub.1158575289,Towards Business Process Model Extension with Quality Perspective,"Organizations are always looking for enhancing the quality of their products/services in order to improve their competitiveness. The quality of products/services are closely related to the quality of the business process of the organization. Therefore, it is crucial for decision makers to gain insight of the quality perspective of their business process at the model level. Several studies aimed to measure and/or model the quality of a business process. Some of them provide these measures and/or models separately from the business model. Some others integrate quality information into the business process model for a specific modeling notation. This makes the integration of quality information dependent on the modeling notation. However, different notations are used by organizations to model their business processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic approach for business process model extension with quality perspective, at the activity level as a first stage. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) the adaptation of the business process quality meta-model and (2) the proposal of a generic business process meta-model extended with quality perspective at the activity level."
pub.1015412891,Business Process Modelling Notation from the Methodical Perspective,This paper evaluates some characteristics of the BPMN language from the perspective of the business system modelling methodology. Firstly the context of the business process management and the importance of standards are discussed. Then the Business System Modelling Methodology is introduced with special attention paid to the Business Process Meta-model as a basis for the evaluation of the language. In the special section particular basic concepts from the Business Process Meta-model are mapped to the usable constructs of the BPMN and related issues are analysed. Finally the basic conclusions are made and the general context is discussed.

First, the business analyst establishes the Business Process (BP) of the new SaaS. Then, the SaaS composer, based on functional and non-functional requirements, discovers and selects the potential SaaS components that can fill into each of the defined tasks in the BP. Currently, enterprises need more and more flexible SaaS business process as an adaptive composite SaaS from process vendors, which interest on context changes and needs evolutions. A meta-model is proposed in this paper dealing with different concepts involved in business cloud layer. This meta-model, in which both business process and service composition are considered, is accompanied by a case study. Then, an ontology has been developed and an extract of instances has been presented to demonstrate the adaptation process."

questions concerning: (i) the kind of meta-models proposed in literature; (ii)
the recurring constructs they contain; (iii) their purposes; and (iv) their

research questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of
work conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular,
while traditional paradigms towards business process modelling, and aspects

processes. While used for many years in different shapes and forms, there is
little shared understanding of the concept and its relationship to enterprise
architecture. In this report we position the concept of business process map
within the domain of enterprise architecture. Based on literature, we provide a
conceptualisation of the process map as a business process architecture model
that can be integrated with the broader enterprise architecture model. From our
conceptualisation we derive requirements for designing a meta-model of a

pub.1095829631,CuteFlow: A Refined Modeling-Driven Business Process Designer,"Currently in the BPM (Business Process Management) domain, there exist many meta-models which are defined as a set of semantic elements for representing related concepts. Correspondingly, various tools have been developed based on one of those meta-models. However, the more complicated the meta-models are, the more difficult it is to interoperate two heterogeneous models. In the meantime, SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) emerges as a promising solution to the highly efficient integration of enterprises, while MDA (Modeling Driven Architecture) is proceeding rapidly on its way to a high maturity along with the perfection of supporting tools which provides a solid foundation for the implementation. In this paper, we extract a refined meta-model based on the mainstream meta-models. Then, Modeling-Driven roadmap on technology of our modeler is proposed. Finally, we both design and implement a business process modeling tool based on the meta-model following the MDA methodology."
pub.1043678817,Verification of Business Process Integration Options,"We propose a meta framework architecture for supporting the behaviour based integration of two business processes. The meta level provides basic integration operators to the domain engineer to create integration options for specific domains. Based on semantic relationships between nodes of two business processes these integration options are executed and transform parts of the business processes. The outcome of the model transformation is an integrated business process. Because of the arbitrary combination of basic integration operators, a potentially infinite set of integration options may be applicable, and some of these may lead to an incorrect business process. We analyse our framework according to a set of consistency criteria and propose verification and validation mechanisms to keep the integrated model consistent."
pub.1150149868,Towards a Meta-modeling approach for an IoRT-aware Business Process,"In the context of Industry 4.0, the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) represents an attractive paradigm that aims to supply real-time data and automate tasks via human imitation. An IoRT is defined as the incorporation of IoT technology within robotic systems. In this setting, the business managers may improve performance and increase the productivity of their process by integrating the IoRT within their Business Processes (BPs). Nonetheless, this integration is not a trivial task due to the diversity of the IoT, robot, and BP concepts. In this paper, we address the incorporation of the IoRT within the BP through a lightweight extension of the Business Process Modeling Language 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) meta-model called IoRT-aware Business Process meta-model (IoRT-aware BP2M). Our proposed IoRT-aware BP2M allows, on the one hand, to represent the main concepts of IoT, robot and BP in a unique meta-model, and on the other hand to specify some practical constraints to select the suitable device. As a proof of concept, we generated an IoRT-aware BP model in the agriculture field with some implementation details. Besides, we used the Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) ontology to prove the proposed meta-model’s completeness and clarity. The obtained results show that the proposed meta-model has an acceptable completeness value and ontological expressiveness."
pub.1018738368,A Constraint-centered Two-layered Meta-model For Enterprise Modeling and Analysis,Enterprise model is a representation of the knowledge an organization has about itself and of what it would like this knowledge to be. The changing business environment makes a big challenge for the continuous improvement from as-is to to-be of the enterprise. Business constraints are defined as relationships maintained or enforced in the business structure and process to form the most volatile part of the business requirements. The proposed meta-model for enterprise modeling introduces the business constraints as the key element to make the model responsive to the business changes. It consists of two layers including conceptual layer and specification layer where the former provides a foundation for better communication and the latter provides business constraint language and constraint flow language to accommodate the changes and decrease the model maintaining effort. The meta-model forms a precise business as-is description based on which an Analytic Hierarchy Process based what-if analysis mechanism is proposed to analyze the business alternatives to give recommendations for the to-be design. Examples are presented to demonstrate the validness of the meta-model and its what-if analysis mechanism.

They are all the more aware of the need to effectively identify, preserve, share and use the knowledge mobilized by their business processes. Thus, in order to improve their performance, business process modeling has become a primary concern for any organization in order to improve the management of its individual and collective knowledge assets. This paper proposes a new meta-model of sensitive business processes modeling for knowledge management, called BPM4KI (Business Process Meta-Model for Knowledge Identification) based on COOP, a core ontology of organization’s processes. The aim of this meta-model is to help identify and localize the crucial knowledge that is mobilized and created by these processes.

pub.1125681294,A Model-driven Engineering Approach for Business Process based SaaS Services Composition,"Nowadays, tremendous number of enterprises are looking to outsource their business processes in order to gain in productivity, reduce cost, and enhance performance. Outsourcing business processes to cloud computing and more specifically to SaaS services, is actually among the most prominent opportunities regarding the benefits that this paradigm offers. However, matching the business process activities with the suitable SaaS services is not a trivial task regarding the diversity of both, functional requirements of business processes and the functionalities offered by SaaS services. Furthermore, once the business process execution is entirely supported by the SaaS services, the process owner, lacking in general the required expertise related to SaaS domain, needs to be aware of how the business process is handled by the SaaS. This is done principally through transforming the business process model to the SaaS model. This paper proposes a model-based approach using SAT-based formal verification to select and validate the most suitable SaaS services to support the business process achievement. Furthermore, a model to model transformation from business process to SaaS is proposed. This transformation is based on (i) a lightweight extension of the business process meta-model of ISO/CEI 19510 and (ii) our proposition of the SaaS meta-model."

In this paper, we address two specific limitations, namely the difficulty of capturing SBP's requirements and the lack of a definition for SBP. Thus, meta-modeling is used to capture requirements from organizational, technological, and management perspectives. In addition, we introduce a definition for SBP by enriching an existing BP meta-model with social concepts. To annotate the SBP model with its requirements, a BPMN extension is proposed.

pub.1124366142,KPI-Based Approach for Business Process Improvement," Business Process Management is a contemporary approach with the main purpose of deploying, executing and continuously optimizing the different types of business processes and thus improving the agility of the organization. In this paper, we propose an approach to business process improvement based on key performance indicators during the Business Process Management lifecycle. We started by highlighting the life cycle of key performance indicators. Then our proposal was at meta-modeling level, adding performance indicators as concepts of the Business Process Model and Notation meta-model. This brought us to a new extension of this meta-model based on key performance indicators. The particular case of the Scrum agile development process is then considered as a case study. In this context, key performance indicators are proposed for this process and are classified according to the elements of the Scrum method. The proposed approach was tested by taking the example of a company using ScrumWise tool for conducting scrum developments. The developed prototype allowed a performance evaluation of the Scrum process through key performance indicators and a set of recommendations were proposed to help managing tasks and improving the adopted process."

Firstly, based on business model analysis, a Multi-View business meta-model is built to act as a referred framework to find out relationships between different business elements. Then the meta-model is served as the basic criterion to check consistency of different business models. Next the integrity and consistency algorithms are proposed to cope with the Multi-View models.

REPC provides a new framework for business process modeling in SOA information system."
pub.1017310008,"Family Business, Identity Conflict, and an Expedited Entrepreneurial Process: A Process of Resolving Identity Conflict","Drawing on Identity Control Theory (ICT) and the literature on social identity, we offer a model of the dynamics associated with competing family and business identities brought into conflict by “family–business” events. We introduce the notion of the family–business role as a distinct identity functioning at the intersection of family and business identities. This meta–level identity “manages” conflict between the family and the business identities, and is formulated and transformed within the family structure. To illustrate the dynamics of the family–business meta–identity, in this article we focus on entrepreneurial opportunities as potentially identity conflict–triggering events and illustrate how and with what impact the meta–identity works to resolve identity conflict at the intersection of family and business so as to expedite the entrepreneurial process. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our model."
pub.1011243479,Improving Business Process Model Quality Using Domain Ontologies,"This paper addresses the issue of improving quality of business process (BP) models by exploiting domain knowledge. Indeed, business process models reflect the business processes of companies. The success of these processes has a direct and undeniable impact on business operations success. Managing them through their underlying models helps improving their effectiveness, consistency, and transparency. BP modeling aims at a better understanding of processes, allowing deciders to achieve strategic goals of the company. However, several studies from the literature showed that in experienced system analysts often produce low-level quality. This situation is partly due to lack of domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to support this modeling effort with an approach that uses domain knowledge to improve the semantic quality of BP models. We suggest to use ontologies as a mean to capture domain knowledge and meta-modeling techniques to deal with BP models independently of languages in which they are expressed. Our contribution is threefold: (1) the meta-models describing both a domain ontology and a BP model are described, (2) the alignment between the concepts of both meta-models is defined and illustrated, (3) a set of Object Constraint Language mapping rules is provided. A simple case study illustrates the process."

pub.1018844394,Towards a Version-Based Approach to Deal with Business Process Evolution,"Competition in which enterprises and organizations are involved nowadays imposes them to often make evolve their business processes in order to meet, as quickly as possible while keeping effectiveness, new business or production requirements. This paper proposes to adopt a version-based approach to support these dynamic evolutions of business processes (BP). Adopting this approach permits to keep chronological BP changes since several instances of a same business process can own different schemas, each one representing a possible schema for the considered business process. Consequently, this approach is very suitable to deal with long-term business process evolution since it does not necessarily impose the adaptation and migration of running BP instances according to a new business process schema. The paper contribution is first a meta-model for designing versions of business processes considering the three dimensions of BP which are the informational, organizational and process dimensions. The paper also introduces a taxonomy of operations for business process version management."
pub.1019863185,Specifying Business Policy Using Agent-Contract Meta-Constructs,"Business policy is a set of rules, regulations, invariants and definitions that govern the behavior of an enterprise. It is typically formulated by business people and formalized by lawyers. Business policy is often written down. However, much policy exists only in the memories of those who work for or with an enterprise. Still other policy is embedded in the code of enterprise software systems.Solution developers have long realized that software is a means of promulgating and enforcing business policy. Without a correct or complete understanding of that policy, software will not function as required by the business. In addition, software that indiscriminately mixes policy and technology is difficult to maintain and reuse. Finally, as the only place where much business policy is documented, software commonly becomes de facto policy.For all of the importance of business policy to behavior in general and software in particular, it is curious that most businesses have no formal business policy management processes. It is ironic that the haphazard business policy management that is done is almost untouched by automation.A new meta-model dubbed the “agent-contract” meta-model was created recently by the IBM Consulting Group in collaboration with several of IBM’s industry solution units. This model was created as a means to integrate of IBM’s existing and future industry models. During the development process, it became clear that this meta-model would also provide direct support for business policy analysis and management. This essay describes the major concepts in the meta-model and connects the work to the growing rules/invariants movement within the object community."
pub.1125981760,Document Business Process Model Extension for Modeling Secure Ubiquitous Documents,"Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the de facto standard for modeling business processes in both academic and industrial fields. It was developed by Object Management Group (OMG) to define and visualize business process models. In business process modeling approaches, although the fundamental role of documents, the control flow perspective dominates the document perspective. Therefore, it’s still not possible to model documents using BPMN due the lack of an adequate notation. Moreover, with the growing usage of Cloud technology, the sensitive documents of business processes outsourced in Cloud may be target of malicious attacks due the lack of security in this paradigm. Thereby, to overcome the inability of BPMN in representing document shared in Cloud and their security, this work presents a new extension of BPMN 2.0 Meta-Object Facility meta-model and notation called DBPM (Document Business Process Model) to support the modeling and visualization of document perspective requirements. Also, a formal definition of the new extension is presented. As a result, the DBPM handles ubiquitous documents (i.e. documents shared in Cloud) and their security at high conceptual level."

The foundation of traditional WfMS is process-based management. In this paper we present a process meta model to support policy based management in WfMS. With the new meta model the system has better flexibility in workflow design time and higher adaptability at run-time. It can also keep the business rules consistent across the whole enterprise and provide a uniform method to deal with business rules, resources and security in workflow system."
pub.1120364862,Architecting business process maps,"Process maps provide a high-level overview of an organization?s business processes. While used for many years in different shapes and forms, there is little shared understanding of the concept and its relationship to business process architecture. In this paper, we position the concept of process map within the domain of architecture description. By ?architecting? the concept of business process map, we identify and clarify diverging views of this concept as found in the literature and set requirements for describing process maps. A meta-model for a process mapping language is produced as a result. The proposed meta-model allows investigating the suitability of EA modelling languages as a basis for defining a domain-specific language for process mapping along with the creation of a better understanding of business process architecture in relation to enterprise architecture, which can be beneficial for both BPM and EA professionals.

In this paper we describe a method for business process model discovery, which uses semantically annotated business processes. We created an RDF vocabulary for business processes that captures functional, non functional and structural properties that is used in the annotations of basic activities. We developed a set of algorithms to automatically generate different representations of the same business process at different granularity levels. We defined a set of rules to extract the RDF meta data in the annotated business process models and to build an RDF knowledge base which then can be interrogated using SPARQL."
pub.1048566685,Model-Driven Strategic Awareness: From a Unified Business Strategy Meta-Model (UBSMM) to Enterprise Architecture,"Business strategy should be well understood in order to support an enterprise to achieve its vision and to define an architecture supporting that vision. While business views are identified in many Enterprise Architecture (EA) proposals, business strategy formulations from the area of Strategic Management are overlooked. Thus, IT solutions cannot be traced back to business strategy in a clear and unambiguous way. Our intended proposal, a Unified Business Strategy Meta-Model (UBSMM), aims at establishing such a link. UBSMM is a formalization of the integration of known business strategy formulations with precise semantics enabling its model-level usage to provide strategic awareness to Enterprise Architecture. In this paper we present the development process of UBSMM, and further, we propose conceptual relationships towards Enterprise Architecture (EA)."

Using labels only prevents stakeholders from easily and quickly understanding what business processes or services achieve. In this paper, we define a business capability meta-model that can be used for modelling business capabilities as entities composed of a set of actions and related properties. This meta-model is implemented as Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies that help experts design their domain-specific high-level business capabilities that can be used for annotating their processes, services, applications, etc. We validate the business capability meta-model by using two evaluation methods: (1) ontological evaluation in order to make sure that there is no semantic ambiguity among its constructs; (2) interviews with domain experts to assess the ability of the model to represent real capabilities and to evaluate their point of view with respect to our approach."

This paper suggests how automatically to develop a whole database schema of business process framework. To do this, we apply with Model- To-Text transformation based on metamodel to automatically build the schema based business process model. This procedure is follows: 1) defining each meta-model of the entire structure and of database schema, and 2) also defining model transformation rules for it. With of model transformation rules of this procedure, we can automatically transform through meta-modeling of an integrated information system to the schema based model information table specification defined of the entire layer."

In this paper we propose the use of an aspect-oriented approach to modularize business process modeling. We propose a meta Aspect Oriented Process Modeling Language (AOPML) that is independent of any specific business process language. In order to show the applicability of the approach we instantiate it using the Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) in a case study that takes advantage of AOPML."

Based on our experience in the industrial context, we proposed a methodological framework to tackle these issues. Among the lessons learned from the experimentation of this framework, the need to formally connect the different models used was identified. The approach presented in this paper advocates the use of a link meta-model to define this connection. Combined with Business Goal modelling and analysis of the gaps between models of the current and future situations, the link meta-model helps guiding the analysis of Business Process change for Information System adaptation. The link meta model is applied with the case study of an evolving Pizzeria company."

It is based on a framework consisting of the layers business plan, business process model, and business application system as well as views on these layers focusing on specific aspects. This contribution presents the SOM language for business process modeling and shows how business application systems can be linked to business process models. The language uses concepts of systems theory and is based on the notions of business object, business transaction, task, event, and service. Business objects are coordinated by feedback control or by negotiation. Decomposition rules allow a stepwise refinement of a business process model.

pub.1094219418,Modelling Flexible Processes with Business Objects,"Mainstream business process modelling techniques promote a design paradigm wherein the activities that may be performed within a case, together with their usual execution order, form the backbone on top of which other aspects are anchored. This Fordist paradigm, while effective in standardised and production-oriented domains, breaks when confronted with processes in which case-by-case variations and exceptions are the norm. We contend that the effective design of flexible processes calls for a substantially different modelling paradigm: one where processes are organized as interacting business objects rather than as chains of activities. This paper presents a meta-model for business process modelling based on business objects. The paper also presents a real-life case study in which a number of human service delivery processes were designed using the presented meta-model. The case study demonstrates that the meta-model addresses three key flexibility requirements encountered in this domain."

pub.1009568182,Identifying knowledge management problems using a process‐based method (a case study of process 137)," Purpose The aim of this paper is to develop, test and improve a method that draws upon business process improvement literature and combines it with knowledge management approaches for modeling and analyzing knowledge‐intensive business processes.   Design/methodology/approach  Analyzing and integrating previous meta models served in knowledge oriented business process researches, a preliminary meta model was developed for modeling knowledge‐intensive business processes. Then an initial version of Proper Arrangement of Knowledge Management Processes (PAKMP) framework was developed according to the knowledge management processes approaches. Third round of interviews with process 137 members were conducted in order to test applicability and completeness of both preliminary meta model and initial version of PAKMP framework in order to improve them. In addition, a five‐steps analysis method achieved through case study which is based on the application of both final Meta model and PAKMP framework. In fact this five‐steps method was applied in Tehran's Municipality which redounded to improve preliminary meta model and initial version of PAKMP framework and endorsed the applicability of the proposed method in real world.    Findings This paper has a contribution in enriching the literature related to integrating KM efforts and BPM efforts by presenting a five‐steps analysis method and testing it in a real case. This method considers both KM and business process management points of view.   Research limitations/implications The general applicability of the method due to the weak generalization of the single case study is a limitation.   Originality/value This paper combines the advantages of the business process improvement and knowledge management approaches and suggests a practical method for modeling and analyzing the knowledge management status in knowledge‐intensive business processes. After analysis, managers should put emphasis on improving the arrangement of KM processes for critical knowledge objects which led to improve the performance of knowledge‐intensive business process trough removing KM problems. The paper concludes by suggesting some topics for future research. "

Aiming at SBPs, a specific framework that helped previously to build a business process meta-model for knowledge identification is applied in a systematic manner in order to evaluate a number of currently available BPM formalisms under six perspectives, namely functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. Furthermore, the result of the evaluation led us to justify the choice of the better one positioned nowadays, the standard BPMN 2.0. Besides, we have illustrated the practical applicability of this notation on a medical process in the context of the organization of protection of the motor disabled people of Sfax-Tunisia."

This paper proposes to extend the well-known Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN 2.0) with the knowledge dimension so that using a common modeling formalism it would be possible to relate the various types of knowledge, information and data to the business process model. This extension, called «BPMN4KM», is designed methodically by application of the extension mechanisms of BPMN 2.0. We aim at incorporating relevant issues at the intersection of knowledge management (KM) and business process modeling (BPM) in order to enrich the graphical representation of sensitive Business processes (SBPs) and improve the localization and identification of crucial knowledge mobilized and created by these processes. Besides, we evaluate the relevance of BPMN4KM concepts through a real SBP scenario from medical domain."

To solve this problem, we suggest automatically to build the schema based business process model with model-to-text conversion technique. This procedure consists of 1) defining each meta-model of the entire structure and of database schema, and 2) also defining model transformation rules for it.

pub.1041591778,Aligning Business Process Models and Domain Knowledge: A Meta-modeling Approach,"In recent years the problems related to modeling and improving business processes have been of growing interest. Indeed, companies are realizing the undeniable impact of a better understanding and management of business processes (BP) on the effectiveness, consistency, and transparency of their business operations. BP modeling aims at a better understanding of processes, allowing deciders to achieve strategic goals of the company. However, inexperienced systems analysts often lack domain knowledge leading and this affects the quality of models they produce. In this paper we propose to support this modeling effort with an approach that uses domain knowledge to improve the semantic quality of BP models. This approach relies on domain ontologies as a mean to capture domain knowledge and on meta-modeling techniques. The main contribution of this paper is threefold: 1) the metamodels describing both a domain ontology and a BP model are described, 2) the alignment between the concepts of both meta-models is defined and illustrated, 3) a set of OCL mapping rules is provided. A simple case study illustrates the process."
pub.1015071467,Uses and applications of Software & Systems Process Engineering Meta‐Model process models. A systematic mapping study,"Software process engineering is a discipline, which aims to study and improve software development and maintenance processes. The explicit definition of software processes is essential. To this end, the Object Management Group consortium proposed the Software & Systems Process Engineering Meta‐Model (SPEM) that exploits the benefits of the Model Driven Architecture paradigm applied to software process models, instead of software specification models. The aim of this study is to discover evidence clusters and evidence deserts in the use and application of SPEM from a business process management point of view. To reach the proposed objective, we have undertaken a systematic mapping study of the existing scientific literature. The reviewed literature deals mainly with process modeling and, to a lesser extent, with process adaptability, verification, and validation, enactment and evaluation. Wide agreement exists in using the SPEM meta‐model to develop different types of methods and processes. Further research efforts are needed in areas related to enactment and evaluation of software processes. There is a need to evolve to a new version of the meta‐model that incorporates the improvements proposed by different authors. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This paper presents a systematic mapping study on the uses and applications of software process models defined with Software & Systems Process Engineering Meta‐Model.

pub.1095377366,OWL model to support business process and web services in SOA Environments,"With the emergence of SOA (service oriented architecture), a business process can be realized as a Web service. A business process can be viewed as a requirement phase artifact and Web service can be viewed as a development phase artifact. By reducing the gap between a business process and Web service, we can extend the reusability, flexibility, and pursued business agility. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an ontology model for managing a business process and Web service effectively within a single meta-model. In addition, we propose an inference rule for the search and discovery of related Web services and business processes in our proposed ontology model. By using our proposed model, we can effectively manage business processes and Web services, decrease maintenance costs, and increase the productivity of system development process through the reuse of well organized business processes and related Web services."

BPMN benefits from its expressiveness and the well-defined meta model, which is defined by the Meta Object Facility (MOF). The emergence of BPMN entails an increasing demand for language extensions in order to both benefit from the dissemination and apposite concepts. Although BPMN is one of very few languages that explicitly provides capabilities for its extension, the proposed mechanism reveals some shortcomings and inaccuracies concerning model abstractions, specificity and semantical clarity. A list of improvable aspects is hence provided based on an in-depth analysis of the extension mechanism. The analysis has a special focus on the abstract syntax (BPMN meta model). Several techniques for enhanced BPMN extension design are proclaimed by adapting alternative mechanisms for language extensibility: Profiling, under specification (hooking) and annotation (plug-ins and add-ons). The stated mechanisms are partly adapted from other modeling languages (profiling) or the field of Software Engineering (hooking, plug-ins, add-ons). Each approach is described by its core concepts, its application and by some examples. The approaches are finally compared regarding several criteria."
pub.1008527029,A Meta-model for Analyzing the Influence of Production-related Business Processes,"The improvement of business processes is viewed as a key to competitive success. Since the beginning of the 1990s, many companies could increase their efficiency through initiatives improving the production process. Despite the existence of numerous different scientific approaches to improve the supporting processes of indirect business areas, comparable successes could not be achieved. In the literature for business process management, the described guidelines and methods for process prioritization are often of very high level and hence not of much assistance when attempting to use them on production-related business processes. Further approaches focus the modelling and analyzing of single processes. These are often very detailed and do not taking into account the interrelations and influences that arise between the processes. An analysis and comparative evaluation of the production-related business processes of indirect areas does not exist. This paper presents an approach to analyze the influence of supporting business processes on the goals of their core process. Therefore, a meta-model is introduced to describe different types of interrelations between processes within in a process system by specific characteristics. The considered system includes the manufacturing process and its support processes as the interrelating elements. Based on the meta-model, influencing factors of the support processes on the characteristic values of the manufacturing process are determined. The paper contributes to theories on business process architecture and the modeling of process systems as well as the basics on system theory. In the literature review of this paper, different approaches for the selection of critical processes, the modelling of process systems and the interdependencies between processes are discussed."

However, effective concepts in this area still constitute a gap in the presently available array of business process management methods. To address this issue, this paper develops and shortly evaluates a refined business objective modeling approach. Our approach builds on use case-based effectiveness criteria, and on insights gained from assessing the state of the art. It derives required constructs and interrelations from application scenarios, and integrates these into a business objective meta-model. As an initial validation of our concept, we model a sample scenario and match the results against effectiveness criteria."

The meta-morphing model adds associations between measures and dimensions to a traditional multi-dimensional cube model, and thus facilitates a process where users are able to ask questions to a business intelligence (BI) system without the constraints of a traditional system. In addition, the model will learn the user’s presentation preferences and thereby reduce the number of interactions needed to present the answer. The nature of meta-morphing means that users can ask questions that are incomplete and thereby experience the system as a more intuitive platform than state-of-art."
pub.1146588473,Patterns for Improving Business Processes: Defined Pattern Categorization,"Business process improvement (BPI) is a theme that is widely studied in business process management. It permits the continuous improvement of a process by considering the impact of changes on its performance. One of the most highly cited solutions for BPI is the use of patterns: they allow presenting a set of reusable models aiming to transform the as-is model into an improved model. Our research work is devoted to the act of improvement of business processes. More precisely, we aim to put forward an approach for BPI based on a set of improvement patterns, classified according to their application context. The purpose of this paper is to present our proposed pattern categories by detailing the structure of two types of patterns and demonstrating the way a selected pattern in one of these categories would be applied. The definition of these patterns was primarily based on a pattern meta-model describing the structure of BPI patterns. It was defined in our previous research work where we identified a general meta-model and four specific pattern models applicable to specific contexts. To validate their usefulness, we choose to apply the proposed approach to the process of examining patients in an emergency service."

It is designed to be individualized to meet a particular set of requirements. As such, configurable process models promote systematic reuse of proven or common practices. Existing notations for configurable process modeling focus on capturing tasks and control-flow dependencies, neglecting equally important aspects of business processes such as data flow, material flow and resource management. This paper fills this gap by proposing an integrated meta-model for configurable processes with advanced features for capturing resources involved in the performance of tasks (through task-role associations) as well as flow of data and physical artifacts (through task-object associations). Although embodied as an extension of a popular process modeling notation, namely EPC, the meta-model is defined in an abstract and formal manner to make it applicable to other notations."

Resilient processes need to avoid failures that may result in process interruptions or complete breakdowns.Considering the particular requirements of unreliable communication environments, this paper addresses shortcomings when modeling and executing business processes. With resilient BPMN (rBPMN), the BPMN meta model is extended to allow resilient process designs by domain experts. Exemplary realizations of the introduced resilience strategies use state of the art technologies such as microservices and container virtualization. A proof-of-concept implementation illustrates the resilient design and execution of process models, serving as a guide for other use cases exposed to unreliable communication."

According to this, we further construct Logistics Warehousing domain ontology described by BPMN elements that makes it semantic."
pub.1041173513,Analysis of business process integration in Web service context,"The integration of Web services is a recent outgrowth of the Business Process integration field that will require powerful meta-schema matching mechanisms supported by higher level abstractions, such as UML meta-models. Currently, there are many XML-based workflow process specification languages (e.g. XPDL, BPEL) which can be used to define business processes in the Web services and Grid Computing world. However, with limited capability to describe the relationships (schemas or ontologies) between process objects, the dominant use of XML as a meta-data markup language makes the semantics of the processes ambiguous. OWL-S (Ontology Web Language for Services) exploits the semantic description power of OWL to build an ontology language for services. It therefore becomes a candidate for an inter lingua. In this paper, we propose an integration framework for business processes, which is applied to Web services defined in OWL-S."
pub.1151952709,Visualization of Digital-Enhanced Enterprise Modeling,"Since the METI of Japanese Government has published the Digital Transformation (DX) report in 2018, DX is now widely attracted in Japan. Although the DX report provided guidelines to promote DX, it just generally explained DX policies. In this chapter, we describe a visualization approach to promote DX by using ArchiMate which is a widely known Enterprise Architecture modeling language. The proposed approach derives value analysis, business model, and business process diagrams from the DX promotion index description which is also published to evaluate the DX provision state of enterprises by METI in 2019. In this chapter, a meta model for describing value analysis, business model and business process is introduced. Then, visualization patterns using ArchiMate are shown using the meta model. An Application example is also explained for the DX in the healthcare domain. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed visualization approach based on the application and related work."
pub.1026201573,Ontology-based process model for business architecture of a virtual enterprise,"As new collaborative business models emerge, considerable research is being carried out on Virtual Enterprise (VE) as an alternative to secure competition. To operate a VE, a common framework that must be shared between participants is needed to implement a seamless business process. This paper focuses on an ontology-based process model that provides a common semantic and communication protocol. The suggested process model has a single integrated meta-model that describes the internal and intra business process of a VE. The internal process is the formal process of each business partner and is described using the Collaborative Component Architecture (CCA) of Enterprise Distributed Object Computing (EDOC). On the other hand, the intra process is a collaborative process that can be modified by the business scenario and is described using a Role Activity Diagram (RAD). The suggested process model is applied for the collaborative design chain process of the automotive-part industry as a case study."
pub.1095097018,Development of a Business Process Modeling Methodology and a Tool for Sharing Business Processes,"Sharing know-how regarding business process modeling activities and best practices can save time in the early phases of business system development. To help developers share know-how and best practices, we have developed a methodology and a tool for business process modeling and have applied it to a system development project. Furthermore, we have developed process-template development techniques to realize granularity-unification of business processes so that business process models can be reused, and have clarified the practical divisions of process models and the design issues concerning each division. These techniques enable the preparation of reuse-oriented business process templates before the business process modeling activity. In this paper, we describe the methodology and tool, including a meta-model and notations we have constructed for business modeling. We then consider the effectiveness of the methodology and tool: in an actual development project, the tool and business process templates decreased development time by 46% or more."
pub.1105979778,A Metamodel-Driven Business Process Modeling Methodology and Its Integrated Environment for Reusing Business Processes,"Reusing business process models and best practices can improve the productivity, quality and agility in the early development phases of enterprise software systems. To help developers reuse the business process models and best practices, we propose a methodology and an integrated environment for business process modeling driven by the metamodel. Furthermore, we propose a process-template design method to unify the granularity and separate the commonality and variability of business processes so that business process models can be reused across different enterprise software systems. The proposed methodology enables to create reuse-oriented business process templates before the business process modeling. To support the proposed methodology, we developed an integrated environment for creating, reusing and verifying the business process models. As the key techniques, we describe the methodology and its integrated environment, including a metamodel and notations. We applied the methodology and integrated environment to an actual enterprise software development project, and evaluated that the productivity of business process modeling is improved by at least 46%. As the conclusion, this paper contributes to prove the effectiveness of the meta-model driven business process modeling methodology for the reuse of business process models."
pub.1025497879,Generic Linear Business Process Modeling,"Visual-oriented process modeling concepts and languages used today often lead to modeling of “spaghetti-processes”. Thus, the process models are not applicable effectively in distributed, partially automated and dynamic scenarios. They also support permanent adaptation and composition of process models insufficiently. The approach of Generic Linear Business Process Modeling describes a meta model that aims to avoid these inadequacy. According to the concept of linear programming, nested logic blocks are applied to model the process flow. Additionally, by using generic blocks composition and amplifying of process models on different levels of detail is achieved. Further the approach outlines the visualization of generic linear process models and an XML based format in order to exchange the models in a networked business environment."
pub.1023309714,A Proposal for Ownership Representation in the Context of Business Process Models,The literature on Business Process Management (BPM) confirms the importance of establishing process ownership but conventional approaches as BPMN or EPC do not offer a way to represent the process owner. The aspect-oriented business process (AO-BPM) approach makes this issue more prominent because of the separation between crosscutting concerns and the core elements of a process. In this paper we present a way to represent the ownership based on the Strategic Actor model from i* and incorporate this approach to the EPC meta-model. We also provide a proof of concept by means of an example that illustrates our solution.
pub.1092989444,Business Process Model Life-Cycle Management in Cloud Manufacturing,"To facilitate the vision of service-oriented manufacturing, Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) will need to support business process model life-cycle management. In this paper, we propose the Business Process Cataloging and Classification System (BPCCS) to support that role. BPCCS can facilitate adaptation of business process models. We validate life-cycle management requirements for such a system and propose capabilities the system must have to address these requirements. We analyze related work in academia and industry as a basis for synthesizing a meta-model and a conceptual architecture for the system. We conclude that contextual information for business process models is a critical part of such a system and where the CMfg community can contribute new and valuable results.Copyright © 2017 by ASME"
pub.1023008323,Unified Process Modeling with UPROM Tool,"UPROM tool is a business process modeling tool designed to conduct business process and user requirements analysis in an integrated way to constitute a basis for process automation. Usually, business process models are not utilized systematically to develop related artifacts, specifically when a process-aware information system is to be developed to automate those processes. This results in completeness, consistency and maintainability problems for those artifacts. Unified business process modeling methodology, UPROM, is developed to integrate process modeling and practices. Enabling the application of UPROM, the tool provides editors for six different diagram types based on a common meta-model. It offers features so that modelers can develop a cohesive set of models. Using these models, UPROM tool can be used to automatically generate artifacts of user requirements document, COSMIC based software size estimation, process definition document and business glossary."
pub.1041397077,Cooperative information systems engineering,"Cooperative information systems (CIS) aim at continued cooperativity between user groups through componentized networks of information systems. Change management is therefore a definitional part of CIS. We advocate a conceptual modeling strategy for addressing this task, and illustrate it with experiences gained in WibQuS, a project aimed at CIS support for Total Quality Management in manufacturing organizations. These experiences emphasize the role of meta models in focusing the change process. Specific meta models and supporting environments are presented for: cooperative business process modeling in distributed organizations; simulation analysis of short-term and long-term effects of information flow designs; forward and reverse mappings between a distributed (relational) system interoperability layer and the information flow model. Models are not just analyzed at change time, but also support planned and unplanned information flows at runtime."
pub.1107953787,MFI-5 Based Similarity Measurement of Business Process Models,"With the increasing use of business process model management techniques, a large number of business process models are being developed in the industry, so the corresponding enterprises and organizations usually need to maintain a large business process set. An approach is presented based on the Meta-model for process model registration (MFI-5) to accurately measure the similarity of process models. First, based on MFI-5, the Process Model Description Framework (PMDF) is constructed. According to PMDF, a similarity feature set of the process model (SFS) is defined. Second, the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is utilized to describe corresponding business process, and the BPMN models are obtained. Further the BPMN models are identified and quantified by using SFS, so the model vectors are obtained. At last, the Tanimoto Coefficient-based algorithm is utilized to calculate the similarity between any two vectors, the similarity measure matrix of the BPMN models can be extracted. We illustrate the approach in the context of measuring the similarity of the online sales service processes, the result of which shows that the proposed approach can facilitate business process recommendation."
pub.1095143945,Business Processes and Technical Processes A comprehensive meta model for execution and development,"The interaction between business processes and technical processes is getting more and more important. Throughout this paper, we present how concepts that are used in automation technology can be transferred into concepts that are suitable for use in business process modeling, too. An important aspect is the description of the procedures which have to be executed. In contrast to technical systems, humans as executing agents can, but do not have to follow predefined procedures due to their ability to use their knowledge to work independently in different situations. In a second part, the paper discusses the generation of business processes by project business processes on a meta model, and provides a reference model for a project business layer model."
pub.1021925879,Web Applications Design with a Multi-process Approach,"This paper deals with a new approach WApDM (Web Applications Design Method) for Web Applications Design. The WApDM is a multi-process approach whish covers all aspects should be considered during design of a Web application. The proposed approach is specified with the Map formalism. The use of the Map is three fold: (a) the Map process meta-model is adapted to the specification of complex methods, (b) Map introduces more flexibility in the method and (c) implicit information of the method are made explicit during the specification activity."
pub.1120756810,An Experience in Modelling Business Process Architecture,"We present a mapping of a previously designed Business Process Architecture (BPA) meta-model onto ArchiMate, i.e., the de facto standard Enterprise Architecture (EA) modelling language. This construct mapping allows developing process maps, i.e., descriptions of (views of) the business process architecture of an organization. We demonstrate the development of these process maps using the Signavio Business Process Management (BPM) modelling platform. The developed process maps are part of the organization’s enterprise architecture model and are linked to BPMN process diagrams that detail the functional, control-flow, data and resource aspects of the business processes included in the process map. Our research contributes to the integration of BPM and EA by researching BPA as a concept common to both disciplines."
pub.1093976740,A Service Oriented information system,"Generally the information system development is designing the systems with the use of visual design tools and takes the target modelling artefact as a basis to manually define the software application code. The process of mapping business requirements to the application code involves several parts that make the whole development process again very sensitive to errors. In this paper, we present a model-driven approach to overcome the gap between business requirements on one hand and service oriented architecture on the other. For this, we focus on the development of service oriented information system (SOIS) and a set of model transformation rules. Different ways of transforming a model into another exist. The choice of a target model differs according to quality criteria and is determined on the basis of specific requirements. The development process proposed is based on a BPMN meta-model, SOAML meta-model and a component meta-model. The approach leading elements are: the meta-modelling and automated mapping rules. Finally, we illustrate our proposal with a case study."
pub.1094886496,A Model-Driven Engineering approach with Diagnosis of Non-Conformance of Security Objectives in Business Process Models,"Several reports indicate that the highest business priorities include: business improvement, security, and IT man-agement. The importance of security and risk management is gaining that even government statements in some cases have imposed the inclusion of security and risk management within business management. Risk assessment has become an essential mechanism for business security analysts, since it allows the identification and evaluation of any threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to which organizations maybe be exposed. In this work, a framework based on the concepts of Model-Driven Development has been proposed. The framework provides different stages which range from a high abstraction level to an executable level. The main contribution lie in the presentation of an extension of a business process meta-model which includes risk information based on standard approaches. The meta-model provides necessary characteristics for the risk assessment of business process models at an abstract level of the approach. The framework has been equipped with specific stages for the automatic validation of business processes using model-based diagnosis which permits the detection of the non-conformance of security objectives specified. The validation stages ensure that business processes are correct with regard to the objectives specified by the customer before they are transformed into executable processes."
pub.1094041211,Compliance Scopes: Extending the BPMN 2.0 Meta Model to Specify Compliance Requirements,"Compliance of business processes is becoming increasingly important in the domain of business process design. Despite that, human process designers must be able to concentrate on the business goals which a business process needs to fulfil. Compliance aspects of the business process should not be in the main focus of the human process designer during the development phase. Therefore, tools must support human process designers in developing compliant business processes. In this paper we introduce the concept of compliance scopes. Compliance scopes are areas in a business process where certain compliance conditions must hold. These conditions are attached to the compliance scopes. Compliance scopes can be applied to existing business process models as well as to process templates. In this way compliance rules are applied to certain areas of a business process. During design time, compliance scopes can be used in graphical workbenches to evaluate modifications to business processes."
pub.1033532024,Business Process Families Using Model-Driven Techniques,"Traditionally, businesses have used IT systems as mechanical advantage for automating static a-priori-defined repetitive tasks. Increased business dynamics has placed greater demands of adaptation and agility on to IT systems. Service oriented architecture is a step in this direction through separation of business process concerns from application functionality. There have been multiple attempts at improving adaptability of application services with varying degrees of success. But current business process modeling languages and execution platforms can at best support optimal point solutions that are not amenable for agile adaptation. Application services have benefited to some extent, from product-line architectures related to adaptation to a-priori known situations. We can apply the same idea to business processes. An extension of essential BPMN meta model supporting business process families, and a set of adaptation operators are presented in this paper. We describe their realization using model-driven techniques."
pub.1093346188,Model-Driven Business Performance Management,"In this paper, we present a model-driven approach to Business Performance Management (BPM). BPM is a new frontier in IT-enabled enterprise that supports the monitoring and control of business operations. BPM solutions must be able to efficiently process business events, compute business metrics, detect business situations, and provide the real-time visibility of key performance indicators. In addition, system support is required for the rapid development of BPM solutions and the adaptation of the solutions to the dynamic business environment. We have adopted a meta-model, dubbed the observation meta-model, for capturing the business requirements for BPM, which frees solution developers from low-level programming concerns. We have also used a hybrid compilation-interpretation approach to map an observation model to the runtime executable. First, we extract and refactor the data aspect of the observation model to facilitate runtime access. Second, we compile the operational aspect of the model, such as logic for metric computation and situation detection, into Java code. Third, we develop a runtime engine that interprets the refactored model and dynamically loads the generated code, according to the meta-model. Our framework further enables the evolution and hot deployment of the observation model and provides the platform for several on-going customer engagement efforts."
pub.1092294091,DALTON: a Generic Meta-Model to Support Business Rules and Requirements Engineering in a PLM System,"This paper deals with the management of business rules and requirements to be integrated to a PLM system during the SE process. It proposes a rule and requirement management process made of four stages: the expression of the rule, the activation of the rule, the application of the rule and the checking of the requirement. To support this process, a generic meta-model is presented. The proposed model is called DALTON for “DAta Linked Through Occurrences Network” because it is based on a data network. The model is validated with a use case taken from the nuclear industry, and algorithms in Java were developped to implement the associated reasoning automating the process of rules and requirements engineering."
pub.1007656439,"“Adore”, a logical meta-model supporting business process evolution","The Service Oriented Architecture (Soa) paradigm supports the assembly of atomic services to create applications that implement complex business processes. Since “real-life” processes can be very complex, composition mechanisms inspired by the Separation of Concerns paradigm (e.g. features, aspects) are good candidates to support the definition and the upcoming evolutions of large systems. We propose Adore, “an Activity meta-moDel supOrting oRchestration Evolution” to address this issue. The Adore meta-model allows process designers to express in the same formalism business processes and fragments of processes. Such fragments define additional activities that aim to be integrated into other processes and adequately support their evolution. The underlying logical foundations of Adore allow the definition of interference detection rules as logical predicate, as well as the definition of consistency properties on Adore models. Consequently, the Adore framework supports process designers while they design and then apply evolutions on large processes, managing the detection of interferences among fragments and ensuring that the composed processes are consistent and do not depend on the order of the composition."

In such a context authors identified a lack of anticipatory models able to drive the ERP implementation process to the right thus proposing a meta-modeling approach able to bridge this gap. Proposed methodology integrates Data Analysis, Regression Meta-Modeling and Artificial Neural Networks processing, in order to identify hidden relationships among KPI guiding BPR decision makers. The paper presents the methodology as well as a practical application."
pub.1007782873,Concern-oriented business architecture engineering,"Organizations are subject to constant evolution and must systematically analyze and design the impact of change to implement it consistently across all organizational domains. A thorough understanding of all relevant business-related artifacts as well as their relationships is a prerequisite to achieve this. For many organizations, business architecture management is a means to ensure the correct and up-to-date documentation of these artifacts. One challenge of business architecture management is the development a company-specific business architecture meta model. Two directions of existing work provide partial solutions: (1) generic (meta) modeling methods and (2) business architecture meta models and languages. We argue that these two approaches complement each other and should be applied in an integrated way. The goal of this contribution is to propose such an integrated approach to business architecture engineering. The development of this approach follows the design research process and is based on experiences gained in three industrial business architecture engineering projects."
pub.1033805229,ARIS Method Extension for Business-Driven SOA,"Service-oriented architecture (SOA) promises making companies more flexible enabling them to react quickly to changing market conditions. To leverage those advantages, SOA must be integrated with other existing approaches like business process management and enterprise architecture management. The authors describe how they extended the enterprise architecture management and business process management modelling method ARIS. They first created a SOA meta model by abstracting from existing modelling methods as well as extracting expert knowledge through interviews. In a second step, they mapped the SOA meta model to ARIS to provide a concrete modelling language for service-oriented enterprises. The ARIS extension allows describing and governing service architectures, describing services, linking service development initiatives to projects and company strategy, and discovering services for business process automation."
pub.1049689509,Inter-organizational Reference Models – May Inter-organizational Systems Profit from Reference Modeling?,"Inter-organizational systems span from business models over business process models to their execution on top of a service-oriented architecture. In our project BSopt we have developed an integrated model-driven approach that addresses the different layers and builds up-on well-estabilshed languages on each of these layers. When applying our integrated methodology we recognized that models for the same business case are similar, but still varying for different business partner networks. Accordingly, a systematic approach to derive a model from another model, i.e., from a reference model, is needed. Significant achievements have been made by the reference modeling community in finding ways to leverage the potentials of model reuse in business process modeling. In this paper we outline the potentials of adapting design techniques known from reference modeling to the specific needs of inter-organizational system develpment even if we do not provide a solution yet."
pub.1032333300,Parallel Processing for Business Artifacts with Declarative Lifecycles,"The business artifact (a.k.a. business entity) approach to modeling and implementing business operations and processes is based on a holistic marriage of data and process and enables a factoring of business operations based on key business-relevant conceptual entities. The recently introduced Guard-Stage- Milestone (GSM) artifact meta-model provides a hierarchical and declarative basis for specifying artifact lifecycles, and is substantially influencing OMG’s emerging Case Management Modeling Notation standard. In previous papers one characterization of the operational semantics for GSM is based on the incremental, strictly serial firing of Event-Condition-Action (ECA) like rules. This paper develops a parallel algorithm equivalent to the sequential one in terms of externally observable characteristics. Optimizations and analysis for the parallel algorithm are discussed. This paper also introduces a simplification of the GSM meta-model that provides more flexibility and makes checking for well-formedness of GSM models simpler and more intuitive than in the preceding works on GSM."

This paper proposes a multi-model driven collaborative development platform for service-oriented e-Business systems. The platform provides three views, i.e., business view, process view, and service view to support service-oriented software engineering, top-down business planning and bottom-up service-oriented application development. Business and technical consultants can collaborate from distributed sites of, e.g., clients and IT vendors to provide their clients' with rapid development and demonstration. The proposed platform is driven by three models, i.e., service meta model, process model and business model. All of the three models support semantic description and rational operations, and facilitate intelligent service discovery, process execution and business-business integration. Concepts and implementation issues about the proposed platform has been presented in this paper. The platform has been developed and deployed in an innovation centre to be evaluated by visiting customers."
pub.1133450059,A Meta Model for Mining Processes from Email Data,"Significant research work has been conducted in the area of process mining leading to mature solutions for discovering knowledge from structured process event logs analysis. Recently, there were several initiatives to extend the scope of these analysis to consider heterogeneous and unstructured data sources. More precisely, email analysis has attracted much attention as emailing system is considered as the principal channel to support the execution of business processes. However, existing initiatives didn’t formalize the relationship between emailing systems and business process elements. As a result, they target to discover business processes limited to the activity perspective. In this paper, we first propose a meta model to specify what kind of process knowledge we can discover from emails. We define by this way a research roadmap for an effective multi-perspective process discovery from emails. This metamodel is proved through a concrete case study related to ""hiring"", ""patent application"", and ""paper submission"" business processes. In addition, we highlight the limitations of current process mining techniques in the discovery of different process perspectives."
pub.1111918862,PRESENTING A HYBRID PROCESSING MINING FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATED SIMULATION MODEL GENERATION,"Recent advances in information technology systems have enabled organizations to store tremendous amounts of business process data. Process mining offers a range of algorithms and methods to analyze and extract metadata for these processes. This paper presents a novel approach to the hybridization of process mining techniques with business process modelling and simulation methods. We present a generic automated end-to-end simulation framework that produces unbiased simulation models using system event logs. A conceptual model and various meta-data are derived from the logs and used to generate the simulation model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework using a business process event log, achieving reduction in waiting times using resource reallocation. The intrinsic idea behind our framework is to enable managers to develop simulation models for their business in a simple way using actual business process event logs and to support the investigation of possible scenarios to improve their business performance."
pub.1021855473,Investigating business processes: does process simplification always work?,"Describes the use of a meta‐level model to discover the core operations process, and how the boundaries around the business process were identified at an automotive manufacturer. Evidence was then collected both qualitatively and quantitatively for two models that shared the same business process in the same plant. This research design effectively removed much of the “noise”, such as organisation structure and payment systems, from the investigation. The study concludes that the two models have different and distinctive process needs, and that convergence through process simplification is actually a doubtful strategy to apply to all products in every context. Process simplification is not a general rule for improved competitiveness, and a business must understand the limitations in terms of product performance in the market place."
pub.1157075892,BPMN4MOOC: A BPMN extension for the design of connectivist MOOC,"Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard formalism for business process modeling that is very popular in professional practices due to its expressiveness, the well-defined meta-model, and its easiness of use by non-technical users. For instance, BPMN2.0 is used for business processes in commercial areas such as banks, shops, production, and supply industry. Due to its flexible notation, BPMN is increasingly being used in non-traditional business process domains like education. The presented research work aims to develop a valid extension by applying the BPMN representation of pedagogical scenario in connectivist cMOOC context. BPMN provides a set of generic process modeling elements that make it necessary to extend the language and notation by domain-specific concepts from connectivist pedagogical approach. Therefore, BPMN2.0 extensibility mechanism was explored to include the representation of specific cMOOC pedagogical concepts. Moreover, this paper provides an analysis of the requirements of those concepts. Based on a cMOOC-oriented pedagogical scenario model, the need for an extension is identified and the valid BPMN extension meta-model is designed by the construction of a conceptual domain-specific model and the corresponding BPMN extension model."

pub.1094748643,A unified framework for modeling cooperative design processes and cooperative business processes,"Looks at any cooperative design process as a decision-making process, i.e. as a non-deterministic process. The process is performed by responsible agents having the freedom to decide how to proceed according to their assessment of the situation they are faced to. However, the cooperative design process cannot be an ad-hoc and chaotic process. We look at it as a repeatable process made of steps resulting each of the application of the same pattern for decision making. The pattern views a decision as a choice of the way to proceed in a given situation to achieve an intention. An intention can be fulfilled in different ways depending on the situation being considered. We propose a process meta-model for describing such a pattern of decision making. This meta-model can also be used for modeling cooperative business processes, whether well-structured or ill-structured. In order to deal with a wide range of cooperative processes, we propose a single-process meta-model which provides the structuredness of predefined models and the flexibility of ill-structured processes."
pub.1094479763,An Ontology Acquisition Method for Business Process Modelling and Improvement,"the idea of ontology-based approach to business process modeling is certainly viable. However, according to the semantic representation deficiency of the process models, it's hard to realize the ontology auto-acquisition to support the model mapping from domain model to IT-specific PIM. This paper presents an ontology-activity-based model acquisition approach to improve business process modelling. It proposes that the key elements in business process modeling are activities and should be the basis in constructing the domain ontology. Aiming to provide the key description capability for the process model, it discusses the hierarchy of the model by adding the structure dimension between the information tier and process tier to describe the relationships of the object and the process from the viewpoint of activity structure attributes. It also describes a model-relevance-calculation-based optimal method for extracting ontology activities from the process meta-models. Finally, the ontology activity identification and acquisition approach is discussed."

Addressing such gap, this paper focuses on the interactions between the activities of a business process and the functionality provided by software services. It presents a meta-model to formally specify such interactions. The proposed meta-model is instantiated through a case study. Lessons learnt through the development of an example were used to define a graphic editor prototype, as an automated tool for managing interactions between business processes and software services. The proposed approach enables the alternative application of top-down and bottom-up analysis techniques for modeling processes and services, and assists developers with an integrated tool for modeling business processes and software services in a seamlessly combined way."

Therefore, MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) and CBSD (Component Based Software Development) methods were introduced. Firstly, the architecture of enterprise information system development process which is driven by CIM (Computational Independent Model) was proposed. It realized the quick development process based on MDA and quick building and implementation process based on software component of enterprise information system. Then, based on this architecture, CIM was studied in details, including the study of meta-models and basic concepts of global model and business model. Global model was composed of global business analysis model and global business model, and business model was composed of function/process model, organization model and information model. Finally, a global model example was built to validate the practicability and feasibility of this modeling method which ensure the quick development process."

First of all a resource meta-model is constructed, which represents the basic information unit. Then the concept of domain ontology is used to organize and manage resources obtained from distributed and heterogeneous sources. Based on the resource, Bite is used to compose RESTful services in order to control business processes in an orderly way. Therefore, the way of services to call resources within the limits of traditional web service architectures is being transferred into a resource flow. A software architecture is proposed and tested, based on an exemplary business process scenario. The result indicates a new research direction for the application of business process models based on the platform ORIPS."
pub.1095723475,Model Driven Data Warehousing for Business Performance Management,"Traditional data warehouses are manually designed starting from specific requirements and anticipated data analysis needs. As a result there is frequently a disconnect between business process models, business definition of data artifacts and the data stored in the data warehouses as they are often designed manually and in isolation. Hence it has always been a challenge to keep the data warehouse in sync with the continuously changing business process models, resulting in both high maintenance costs and lost opportunities. In this paper we present our Model Driven Data Warehousing (MDDW) approach in the area of Business Performance Management (BPM). The purpose of MDDW is to bridge the gap between the business process models and the data warehouse models, thus enable the rapid adaptation to changes in the business environment. We describe our modeling framework comprising the various modeling elements and meta-models that capture both business and IT data artifacts."

System like software or business model checking is significant research domain. Question is that when Model Transformation is performed for transforming a model to another model how much accurately it was performed. There is a method that I have used is Traceability to find out that natural language specifications accurately transformed to proposed business process model. Traceability is a method to find out that any specifications of natural language accurately transformed to proposed business process model. Traceability makes easy for users to trace the weight between different software engineering artifacts. Typically technique used for model checking very helpful to verify the correctness and accuracy of properties in a model. Our presented work presents an implementation of Traceability, a mechanism used to keep record between the Source model and Target model elements in model transformation framework. Traceability is a mechanism that can be used for instance level reverse transformation automatically. This type of applications for Traceability is essential for model transformation such as Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) to Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Our presented approach is inspired by Query View Transformation (QVT) that is formulated as an algorithm. This paper also reports on a case study that is based on model transformation in SBVR to BPMN, which uses new version of SiTra."
pub.1043141798,uBPMN: A BPMN extension for modeling ubiquitous business processes,"Context: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the de facto standard for business process modeling. It was developed by the Object Management Group with support of the major organizations in the fields of software engineering and information systems. Despite its wide use, when it comes to representing ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking.Objective: To address BPMN’s deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN).Method: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN.Results: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN’s capabilities and benefits with real-life examples.Conclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies."

It is considered as a basic process as it gathers, manages, and links vital information to the rest of the processes. The key to implement this process is the configuration management database (CMDB). However, commercial tools that implement CMDB are always oriented to large organizations; they are not flexible and difficult to adapt to small companies or to those that need a major flexibility in its service management. In this chapter, we present a simple, comprehensive, versatile meta model, based on business services, from which you can generate CMDB models adaptable to the needs of both small and large organizations and those that need greater flexibility in managing their services."
pub.1166009424,Dynamic Meta-Information Management for IoT-based Applications,"In recent days, the uses of Internet of Things (IoT) applications have been growing enormously. IoT considers the integration of business process models or process execution with resources of intelligent devices. The concept of process meta store (PMS) [1] optimizes the interactions between IoT devices and business processes. However, the mechanism of PMS highly depends on the meta-information of the system, associated devices, and interactions among them. In this context, a novel semantics of meta- information of process store (MIPS) for IoT-based applications is proposed in this paper. The semantics of various MIPS elements and their relationships are described using a class diagram. Further, a B+ tree-based indexing approach for the MIPS semantic is presented for efficient searching of meta-information. The semantics of MIPS are illustrated using the case study related to the clinical decision support system (CDSS). Moreover, a detailed comparative analysis has been carried out to show the expressiveness of MIPS."
pub.1016839878,Formalising Workflow: A CCS-inspired Characterisation of the YAWL Workflow Patterns,"We present work concerning the formal specification of business processes. It is of substantial benefit to be able to pin down the meaning of business processes precisely. This is an end in itself, but we are also concerned to do so in order that we might prove properties about the business processes that are being specified. It is a notable characteristic of most languages for representing business processes that they lack a robust semantics, and a notable characteristic of most commercial Business Process Management products that they have no support for verification of business process models. We define a high-level meta-model, called Liesbet, for representing business processes. The ontological commitments for Liesbet are sourced from the YAWL workflow patterns, which have been defined from studies into the behavioural nature of business processes. A formal characterisation of Liesbet is provided using Milner’s Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS). In this article, we omit some of the technical details of this characterisation and instead present the essential features by means of an abstract machine language, called LCCS. We also explain how we have facilitated the verification of certain properties of business processes specified in Liesbet, and discuss how Liesbet supports the YAWL workflow patterns. We include a simple three-part example of using Liesbet."

This calls for business processes that must be managed in an autonomic manner in response to changes in its environmental context. However, a key challenge is to provide variability, understandability and scalability in modeling increasingly complex business processes. In our work we rely on explicit representation of environment variability through context-awareness and quality attributes in order to properly represent autonomic features in Business Process Models. We outline a process that helps to define the modularity of the Business Process Models, indicating where the system needs to be instrumented. A meta-model with the concepts used is presented. This novel approach provides four well-defined levels of abstraction: Communicational Level, Technological Level, Operational Level and Service Level.

Indeed, it is based on the main aspects of the process such requirements, artefacts, and stakeholders. In this paper, we use the MDE approach to create our meta-model of process extended to improvement cycles. We generate this meta-model from the fusion of several meta-models: Process Structure View and concept View proposed in the framework of Seven Views approach, and the Meta model of improvement cycles which is in this case based on the PDCA approach. The proposed Meta model will facilitate the task in terms of the collection and sharing data for process improvement. We qualify here the process life cycle as intelligent cycle in the measure where several repositories containing information collected as soon as the theoretical modeling will be accessible and updated during each phase of the cycle, avoiding the need to repeat the same tasks. The objective of this paper is to propose an extension of Seven Views approach, by adding an eighth view which focuses on process improvement. The meta-model proposed is generic and will be valid for any type of information system."

For this purpose, platform-independent XML-based languages like the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) are suitable. XML documents are in fact human readable, but in general they are hard to produce and to understand by business experts which are, however, most qualified for defining business processes. We present a model-based development method based on an intuitive and adequate modelling notation, an automatic transformation of process models to their XML-based encoding, and techniques to analyze processes. In this context the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as standard notation for modelling software, graph transformation as meta language for defining model transformations, and a semantic interpretation of process models in terms of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) are used."

This integration leads to strengthen the paradigm of Business to Manufacturing (B2M) interoperability. However, this needs establishing standards and protocols for data exchange between different enterprise and manufacturing applications. Nevertheless, since there is no methodology for collecting data, exchanged information is generally incomplete. Business process modelling aims at specifying objects flows and processes inside an enterprise levels and among networked enterprises. However, the increased complexity of these models does not help at ensuring coherent relationships between its components. In this paper, we discuss a B2M Process Modelling approach for defining and building B2M process models, based on the concept of Holon. This approach aims at increasing the models abstraction in order to simplify its initial comprehensiveness, after while we draft the integration of a proposed Holon meta-model in existing methods for enterprise applications interoperability.

pub.1139941397,Verifiable Model Construction for Business Processes,"Business process specified in Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), which integrates existing services to develop composite service for offering more complicated function, is error-prone. Verification and testing are necessary to ensure the correctness of business processes. SPIN, for which the input language is PROcess MEta-LAnguage (Promela), is one of the most popular tools for detecting software defects and can be used both in verification and testing. In this paper, an automatic approach is proposed to construct the verifiable model for BPEL-based business process with Promela language. Business process is translated to an intermediate two-level representation, in which eXtended Control Flow Graph (XCFG) describes the behavior of BPEL process in the first level and Web Service Description Models (WSDM) depict the interface information of composite service and partner services in the second level. With XCFG of BPEL process, XCFGs for partner services are generated to describe their behavior. Promela model is constructed by defining data types based on WSDM and defining channels, variables and processes based on XCFGs. The constructed Promela model is closed, containing not only the BPEL process but also its execution environment. Case study shows that the proposed approach is effective."

In order to search for a potential business partner, one will first look for a partner who offers a required service on the economic level and who supports a complementary role in a choreography, before binding to its IT services. Inasmuch, a registry for inter-organizational systems should cover all three levels and maintain the dependencies between them.

pub.1003128838,"Modeling Human Aspects of Business Processes – A View-Based, Model-Driven Approach","Human participation in business processes needs to be addressed in process modeling. BPEL4People with WS-HumanTask covers this concern in the context of BPEL. Bound to specific workflow technology this leads to a number of problems. Firstly, maintaining and migrating processes to new or similar technologies is expensive. Secondly, the low-level, technical standards make it hard to communicate the process models to human domain experts. Model-driven approaches can help to easier cope with technology changes, and present the process models at a higher level of abstraction than offered by the technology standards. In this paper, we extend the model-driven approach with a view-based framework for business process modeling, in which models can be viewed at different abstraction levels and different concerns of a model can be viewed separately. Our approach enables developers to work with meta-models that represent a technical view on the human participation, whereas human domain experts can have an abstract view on human participation in a business process. In order to validate our work, a mapping to BPEL4People technology will be demonstrated."

pub.1010147165,Two Dependency Modeling Approaches for Business Process Adaptation,"Complex business processes in the form of workflows or service compositions are built from individual building blocks, namely activities or services. These building blocks cooperate to achieve the overall goal of the process. In many cases dependencies exist between the individual activities, i.e. the execution of one activity depends on another. Knowledge about dependencies is especially important for the management of the process at runtime in cases where problems occur and the process needs to be adapted. In this paper we present and compare two approaches for modeling dependencies as a base for managing adaptations of complex business processes. Based on two use cases from the domain of workflow management and service engineering we illustrate the need for capturing dependencies and derive the requirements for dependency modeling. For dependency modeling we discuss two alternative solutions. One is based on an OWL-DL ontology and the other is based on a meta-model approach. Although many of the requirements of the use cases are similar, we show that there is no single best solution for a dependency model."

Indeed, to minimize time of creation and to reduce cost and complexity, a solution can be given by the reuse of some existing business parts. The need to reuse of some business parts to fulfill companies’ requirements leads to the need of extracting business fragments from the business process model. The aim of this paper is to propose a method which enables to obtain a business fragments from a business process. The main idea is to decompose a business process into small fragments. These fragments have the ability to be reused for building a new business process or updating an existing one. The method the authors propose is presented as guidelines that allow the decomposition of business process to enable having a reusable business fragments, their method is based on variability in business process modeled in BPMN. The method also takes into account the business goal of each extracted fragment.

Service-oriented architecture and Web services can improve e-Business systems to be integrated and flexible. This paper proposes a multi-model driven collaborative development platform for service-oriented e-Business systems. The platform provides engineers/consultants with three views, i.e., business view, process view, and service view to support service-oriented software engineering, top-down business design and bottom-up service composite and development. The views are kept consistent through model-driven translation mechanisms. The platform employs three models, i.e., service meta-model, process model and business model to implement the translation. On the platform, business and technical consultants/engineers can use the views designated for their roles to collaborate for a service-oriented e-Business system based at the distributed sites of, e.g., IT vendors and their clients. The collaboration is featured with visual development and rapid demonstration. Comparingly, most of the mainstream development environments focus on object-oriented application development other than service-oriented business process modeling. The platform has been developed and deployed in an innovation centre to be evaluated by visiting customers."

pub.1107869556,Providing the Flexibility of the Shop Floor to Information Systems for Monitoring Tasks,"This chapter presents an approach to use business processes that describe the value‐adding processes of a company to configure the information system to provide the correct information. This approach uses two use cases, one for providing key performance indicators (KPIs) the other for providing condition‐monitoring information. The presented approach, increasing interoperability in terms of reducing configuration efforts for flexible systems by using business processes, has three main aspects. The first is that the different measuring models need to be integrated into the management system. The second is that the meta‐models of the management system and the business process model need to be compatible. The third is that the connections between the process model and the measuring models need to be created, ideally automatically. The business process model and notation (BPMN) models of the company's business are used to adopt the flexibility of the production processes."
pub.1093651820,Subject-Oriented Modeling and Execution of Multi-agent Business Processes,"This paper addresses a gap in handling multi-agent business processes that has prevented their larger-scale adoption in practice: the lack of a conceptual modeling approach that is easily understandable by business domain experts and sufficiently formal for direct transformation into executable systems. The emerging paradigm of subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM), which has been evaluated through academic research and is increasingly deployed in commercial applications, has the potential to augment multi-agent system (MAS) models with a process-centric layer that preserves autonomy and concurrent interaction of agents as essential system characteristics. In this paper we provide an aligned meta-model and illustrate its operational benefits with examples from business process applications."
pub.1037547945,Ontology design patterns for the semantic business processes,"This paper discusses two research paradigms: the first one is based on using the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) to support any kind of metadata, whereas the second one emphasizes the role of the Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) to support knowledge transformation between the source and the target models. More precisely, in this paper we represent the Business Process ODP, which reflects both the syntax and semantics of business process specification and brings an abstract solution to the typical problem of designing and modelling semantic business processes."
pub.1093553388,A Security Meta-Model for Service-oriented Architectures,"Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) facilitate the provision and orchestration of business services to enable a faster adoption to changing business demands. Several approaches have been described to generate executable description of service orchestrations based on visual business process models. These models describe workflows and related information on an abstract level supporting business analysts to state and verify business requirements. In previous work, we have adopted this approach to simplify the security engineering in Service-oriented Architectures. We foster a model-driven approach based on the integration of security annotations in visual modelling notation. These annotations are gathered and translated to a domain-independent security model that facilitates the generation of enforceable security configurations (e.g.WS-SecurityPolicy). In this paper, we introduce our security meta-model for SOA that constitutes the foundation for our model-driven approach. Based on a model for service interactions that describes the exchange of information in a service-based system, we define a model to express security requirements and policies, and introduce a mapping to WS-Policy and WS-Security Policy."
pub.1045605658,Finding Trading Partners to Establish Ad-hoc Business Processes,"Enabling technology for realizing ad-hoc business processes currently is becoming more and more popular, like for example web services. Ad-hoc business processes are semantically characterized by a description of the exchanged messages and by the potential message sequences. These semantic meta-data are required to enable efficient and precise searching and finding of potential trading partners. Based on the experience of current web technology, manual maintenance of meta-data is neglected by most editors, therefore the meta-data must be generated automatically.Within this paper,we propose a method to derive a specification of potential message sequences based on a private workflow model. Further, we describe an algorithm for matchmaking of message sequence specifications as part of a search engine for ad-hoc business processes."
pub.1017091116,InDico: Information Flow Analysis of Business Processes for Confidentiality Requirements,"This paper presents InDico, an approach for the automated analysis of business processes against confidentiality requirements. InDico is motivated by the fact that in spite of the correct deployment of access control mechanisms, information leaks in automated business processes can persist due to erroneous process design. InDico employs a meta-model based on Petri nets to formalize and analyze business processes, thereby enabling the identification of leaks caused by a flawed process design."

pub.1044544104,A Pattern-Knowledge Base Supported Establishment of Inter-organizational Business Processes,"In the domain of business-to-business (B2B) collaboration, companies are pursuing the objective of electronically linking their business processes for improving their supply chains. For creating such inter-organizational collaboration, intra- and inter-organizational knowledge workers (IKWs) function as assisting experts. However, IKWs must not constantly ”reinvent the wheel” but should instead be supported by a repository that contains knowledge about how to design business processes. Thus, this paper proposes the support of IKWs by a pattern repository for the effective and efficient design of inter-organizational business processes. A pattern is conceptually formulated knowledge that is technology independent. By storing patterns in a uniform specification template of a meta model, it is possible to perform systematic reasoning. Having information readily available about the technology support of individual patterns, IKWs can quickly analyse with which intersection of pattern sets it is possible to link intra-organizational business processes."
pub.1006558163,Knowledge Engineering in Business Process Management,"Business Process Management (BPM) is a commodity today after an evolution from the initial business process re-engineering in the 1980s to a well-established management approach. This chapter proposes three aspects of knowledge engineering (KE) in BPM. First, BPM can be seen as a domain itself focusing on the BP-framework that identifies the basic concepts of business model, domain, regulation, and model processing. Second, BPM needs to be applied by a management method. Third, BPM needs to be executed within an environment; hence, it is deployed. BPM can be the basic concept for corporate knowledge leading to knowledge-sensitive BPM. Studying the knowledge-sensitiveness according to the four dimensions (1) form, (2) content, (3) use, and (4) interpretation, KE and knowledge management support can be distinguished. In the following, the focus is on KE. KE in BP-frameworks can be established by models using the meta-model approach for integration. Knowledge-intensive actions within the BP-management method can be supported by KE techniques that are proposed on the basis of the results of demonstrations in research projects. The deployment of BPM within an execution environment that uses KE requires consideration of the KE concepts also in BPM. This chapter, therefore, argues to support BPM in the three areas, BP-framework, BP-management method, and BP-deployment. KE techniques are proposed, the experiences in the demonstration of research projects are described, and an outlook on the conceptual and technical integration, is given."
pub.1101106417,Connecting databases with process mining: a meta model and toolset,"Process mining techniques require event logs which, in many cases, are obtained from databases. Obtaining these event logs is not a trivial task and requires substantial domain knowledge. In addition, an extracted event log provides only a single view on the database. To change our view, e.g., to focus on another business process and generate another event log, it is necessary to go back to the source of data. This paper proposes a meta model to integrate both process and data perspectives, relating one to the other. It can be used to generate different views from the database at any moment in a highly flexible way. This approach decouples the data extraction from the application of analysis techniques, enabling the application of process mining in different contexts."
pub.1053048171,Aspects of the BPRIM Language for Risk Driven Process Engineering,"Nowadays organizations are exposed to frequent changes in business environment requiring continuous alignment of business processes on business strategies. This agility requires methods promoted in enterprise engineering approaches. Risk consideration in enterprise engineering is getting important since the business environment is becoming more and more competitive and unpredictable. Business processes are subject to the same quality requirements as material and human resources. Thus, process management is supposed to tackle value creation challenges but also the ones related to value preservation. Our research considers risk driven business process design as an integral part of enterprise engineering. A graphical modelling language for risk driven business process engineering was introduced in former research. This paper extends the language and handles questions related to modelling risk in organisational context."
pub.1005816565,A Systematic Literature Review of Consistency Among Business Process Models,"The field of business process modeling has been beset by inter-model consistency problems which are mainly due to the existence of multiple variants of the same business process, for instance when models have been produced by different actors, or through the time by a same (or different) actor(s), as well as the possibility of its modeling from discrete and complementary perspectives (using different lenses). The aim of our research is manifold. First we aim to develop a framework (i) enabling situating new research activities as well as the existing approaches and (ii) targeting to master the inter-model consistency issue. Second, this framework shall offer the capability of handling business process models coherence issue (i) having in mind various modeling goals and targets/products and (ii) having in hand a wide range of problem statements and project situations requiring the use of a large catalogue of business process meta-models. Third, we have the ambition of determining gaps in current research with the aim of suggesting areas for further investigations in the area of inter-models consistency. In order to do so, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of consistency among business process models, where a total of 982 published papers extracted from the most relevant scientific sources, were considered, of which 41 papers, were ultimately included."

Through building access subject granularities, access object granularities, permission assignment control granularities and the dependency, contradiction, delegation, nesting relationships between granularities, FBMOAC supports simplifying the authorization process, controlling access objects precisely and implementing the consistency control of permissions."
pub.1135328997,Enhancement of a Business Model with a Business Contextual Risk Model,"In this paper, we propose an approach of security risk-driven contextual model for software systems development. The approach is model-driven using enterprise business architecture as the basis for the contextual models definition, associating security risk concerns. Enterprise Architecture (EA) enables the description of an organisation’s structure, its business and its underlying Information System. By using a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach such as Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), we dene an architecture for models, and we provide a set of guidelines for structuring specications expressed as (EA) contextual models. Then these models are enhanced to integrate security aspects in the overall development process. The proposal aims to analyse enterprise security from a business-oriented view and define security requirements inherited by the lower architectures, particularly IS architecture. The approach provides a meta-model of business contextual risk with a security management process, consisting on a systematic method, guiding to risk modelling and risk treatment strategies."
pub.1091562438,Process Oriented Training with ADOxx: A Model-Based Realisation in Learn PAd,"Abstract
Process Oriented Training can be applied in two different approaches: (a) processes describing the methodology of training and learning as well as (b) processes describing the organizational context that need to be learned. This paper introduces the results of the EU project Learn PAd that developed prototypes of modelling tools enabling the latter - the usage of business processes to describe the organizational context. Flexibility of business processes have been introduced with case management and knowledge artefacts had been integrated to provide a homogeneous modelling environment. The requirements of such a modelling environment had been collected and implemented with the meta-modelling platform ADOxx®. The meta-model approach has been used to implement the modelling language as well as the mechanisms and the algorithms. The architecture of the modeling tool is introduced and a use case feedback is provided."
pub.1115214630,Business Process Compliance Despite Change: Towards Proposals for a Business Process Adaptation,"Business Process Compliance (BPC) denotes the execution of business processes in accordance with applicable compliance requirements. BPC can be satisfied through compliance processes that are integrated into the business process. In addition, compliance requirements place demands against IT components that are sometimes necessary to execute business or compliance processes. Various factors, such as outsourcing or business process reengineering can lead to a change of processes or IT components and thus to a violation of BPC. Consequently, our goal is to provide proposals for a business process adaptation to further ensure BPC. Following the design science research methodology, we developed two artifacts to reach our goal. First, we developed a meta-model that represents the interrelations between alternative compliance process patterns and compliance processes that satisfy the same compliance requirement. Second, we developed a method to automatically put forward proposals for a business process adaptation through the integration of alternative compliance processes to further ensure BPC."
pub.1070995341,Groupware and Business Process Improvement: technology enabled organisational learning,"Much of the evaluative research on groupware in organisations so far has been preoccupied with the role of groupware as a new interaction media to replace or extend face-to-face communication in groups. It has focused on gains and losses from a group interaction point of view, typically disregarding the impact of other functions such as allowing public access to relevant historical and business process information concerning the organisation. This paper tries to bridge this gap with a focus on the support provided by groupware to business process improvement groups. This paper is based on a qualitative analysis of the effects of the introduction of an asynchronous groupware system into a service company based in Brazil. That analysis suggests that improvements on business redesign efficiency and effectiveness can be attained not only from asynchronous groupware support to group communication, but also from: l)Its support for public sharing of historical information about former business process improvement; and 2)Its support for providing a repository of information about business processes that could be targets for improvement. The paper is finalised with the proposal of an explanatory model, describing the relationship between the introduction of technology, its integration with a business process improvement meta-process, and its effects on the efficiency and effectiveness of that meta-process."
pub.1051060132,A Survey on Approaches to Modeling Artifact-Centric Business Processes,"Business Process Modeling using artifact-centric approach has gained increasing interest over the past few years. The ability to put data and process aspects on an equal footing has made it a powerful tool for efficient business process modeling. The artifact-centric approach is based on key business-relevant entities called business artifacts, which are central for guiding business operations as they navigate through the business operations. The artifact-centric modeling approach can be laid in a four dimensional framework called BALSA for defining business processes, where the four dimensions include business artifacts, lifecycles, services and associations. Based on this data-centric paradigm, several artifact-centric meta-models have been emerged in the recent years. Although all the proposed models claim to support the artifact-centric approach, their support in specifying the BALSA elements of artifacts was not clearly described in the existing literature. This paper reviews all existing approaches to artifact-centric modeling and also discuss to what extent they align with the BALSA framework."
pub.1071882717,Context-Aware Business Process Versions Management,"<p>This work deals with a very active and promising research area that is the Business Process (BP) flexibility. One possible way to deal with this flexibility is the conjoint use of versioning and contextualization techniques. Versioning permits BP evolution by supporting the alternative use of BP versions. Contextualization ensures the definition of use conditions of BP versions to help the designer choosing a version among several ones. In a previous work, BP flexibility had been addressed using only versioning technique by considering the informational, organizational and process perspectives. In this work, the authors show how they conjointly use both versioning and contextualization techniques to address the BP flexibility. More precisely, they propose an extension of the VBP2M meta-model (Versioned Business Process Meta Model), introduced in their previous work, by adding a contextual perspective that offers two levels of contexts granularity (local and global). This perspective is illustrated using a well-known case study «automatic production process of mineral water bottle ». An extension of the VBPQL language (Versioned Business Process Query Language) is also introduced to allow the definition, manipulating and querying of BP versions' contexts. Furthermore, the authors propose an ontology-based method to select the appropriate BP version. Finally, they present our tool that represents the implementation of the proposed solution.</p>"
pub.1095705614,Business Process Optimization using Bio-Inspired Methods - Ants or Bees Intelligence?,"This paper presents two bio-inspired methods addressing the problem of business process optimization. We provide a comparative approach for optimal business process ${\bf flow}$ selection and resource allocation using two of the most important bio-inspired meta-heuristics: Ant Colony Optimization and Bee Colony Optimization. Our approach does not use predefined rules for making the decisions when selecting the flow in the business process model. Given a business process, our approach starts from the business goal and reconstructs the optimal process flow by going backwards in the process in an iterative manner and solving everything that needs to be done for that goal to be completed. This reconstruction is realized by combining the bio-inspired algorithms with resource allocation strategies. The bio-inspired optimizations have been comparatively evaluated on a set of manufacturing scenarios."
pub.1091416425,Modeling Dynamic Aspects of Sensitive Business Processes for Knowledge Localization,"This paper introduces BPM4KI- a generic Business Process Meta-Model for Knowledge Identification, which encompasses a clear and semantically rich definition of Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs). This meta-model is well founded on «core» domain ontologies. It covers all aspects of business process modeling and knowledge management: the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. The aim of BPM4KI is to develop a rich and expressive graphical representation of SBPs in order to identify and localize the crucial knowledge that is mobilized and created by these processes. In this research work, we focus more specifically on the description of the « Functional Perspective», which represents the core dimension in SBP modeling, exploring the collaboration, interaction and knowledge aspects. Besides, we evaluate the relevance of some proposed concepts through a real SBP scenario from medical domain in the context of the organization of protection of the motor disabled people of Sfax-Tunisia (ASHMS)."

Although large enterprises may benefit from this technology by educating their IT departments, SMEs are dramatically falling behind in cloud usage and hence lose the ability to efficiently adapt their IT to their business needs. This paper introduces the project idea of the H2020 project CloudSocket, by elaborating the idea of Business Processes as a Service, where concept models and semantics are applied to align business processes with Cloud deployed workflows. Four architectural building blocks proposed for (i) design, (ii) allocation, (iii) execution and (iv) evaluation are discussed before providing and outlook."
pub.1012295634,Formalising Business Process Execution with Bigraphs and Reactive XML,Bigraphical Reactive Systems have been proposed as a meta model for global ubiquitous computing generalising process calculi for mobility such as the pi-calculus and the Mobile Ambients calculus as well as graphical models for concurrency such as Petri Nets. We investigate in this paper how Bigraphical Reactive Systems represented as Reactive XML can be used to provide a formal semantics as well as an extensible and mobile platform independent execution format for XML based business process and workflow description languages such as WS-BPEL and XPDL. We propose to extend the formalism with primitives for XPath evaluation and higher-order reaction rules to allow for a very direct and succinct semantics.
pub.1001601868,Business renovation: business rules (still) the missing link,The main aim of this paper is to present the characteristics of business renovation efforts and research into some aspects of the business process and information modelling. Different business‐rule categories are discussed and the relationships that exist between business rules and other business‐related concepts are presented. The paper also introduces a business activity meta‐model as an integration link between business and information modelling. Its motivation is to help establish an environment in which business rules can be traced from their origin in the business environment through to their implementation in information systems.
pub.1014264509,Versions to Address Business Process Flexibility Issue,"This paper contributes to address an important issue in business process management: the Business Process (BP) flexibility issue. First, it defends that versions are an interesting solution to deal with both a priori (when designing BPs) and a posteriori (when executing BPs) flexibility. It also explains why previous contributions about versions of BPs are incomplete, and need to be revisited. Then, the paper presents a meta-model for BP versions, which combines five perspectives -the functional, process, informational, organizational and operation perspectives- for BP modelling, and which allows a comprehensive description of versionalized BPs."
pub.1050977842,A service-oriented travel portal and engineering platform,"A service-oriented travel portal is proposed to realize a classic business model with SOA paradigm. It provides tourists with composite travel packages through dynamic composition among travel-related services from distributed providers and across business domains. Further, a devoted service-oriented engineering platform (SOEP) is reengineered and customized for travel portals based on authors’ previous work and a travel portal project’s use scenario. The platform is driven by four models: service meta-model, process model, business model and global information model. These models support semantic description and rational operations of the application, and facilitate travel service discovery, process execution and business to business integration. The travel portal provides a real SOA application and well-defined business and service cases to improve the platform. The SOEP provides a professional implementation environment for service-oriented travel portals, and it could be customized for the service-oriented systems of other industries using a similar framework and approaches to those presented in this article."
pub.1138199811,Uma extensão do BPMN para modelagem de Processos de Desenvolvimento de Software: BPMNt,"The BPMN 2.0 is a meta-model and notation widely used in the Market to model business process featuring a high semantic representation capability. Nevertheless, when modeling Software Development Processes using BPMN, one can observe the lack of an important feature: process tailoring. This article proposes the BPMNt, a BPMN conservative extension that aims to aggregate a tailoring mechanism presented in SPEM 2.0. BPMNt uses the extensibility classes already present in the BPMN meta-model. Also, it proposes a set of consistency rules used to evaluate the final process."
pub.1050215241,The Dichotomy of Modeling and Execution,"This chapter introduces a set of languages intended to model and run business processes. The Business Process Modeling Notation 1.1 (BPMN) is a notation used to graphically depict business processes. BPMN is able to express choreographies, i.e. the cooperation of separate, autonomous business processes to jointly achieve a larger scenario. Since BPMN is only a notation, there is no specification for a meta-model that allows rendering BPMN choreographies into an executable form. This chapter describes how the Service Component Architecture (SCA) and the Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) help to close that gap. BPMN, SCA and WS-BPEL can jointly be used and combined to model, deploy and execute business process choreographies. We will also integrate the related BPEL4People specification, since BPMN allows human ‘user tasks’, but WS-BPEL focuses only on automated business process. The authors argue that, based on these specifications, the dichotomy between modeling and execution can be addressed efficiently. In this chapter, we will show that a key aspect of the future of Business Process Management is to combine graphical modeling (via BPMN) with a precise specification of an executable business process (via WS-BPEL and related standards)."
pub.1155417314,A Survey on Process Variants Meta-modelling Approaches,"This paper introduces the concept of process variants in process-aware
information systems (PAIS) during the design-time phase, where multiple
variants of a single process must be specified. Today's organizations have to
manage multiple variants of a given process, such as multiple order processes
or payment processes for a specific product or service they offer. Traditional
business process management tools lack in adequately capture and represent
explicitly these variants. Hence, for more than a decade an array of approaches
have been proposed to tackle this gap. A reference or customizable process
model has been introduced to model these variants collections in a way that
each variant could be derived by inserting/removing an activity according to a
process context. This survey reviews current literature by providing an
overview of meta-modelling approaches that have been extended in order to
capture the variations of business processes. Moreover, we give a comparative
analysis of these approaches based on different criteria we identified from the
inventory activity, providing insights into their strengths and limitations.
This paper concludes that current approaches to process variants meta-modelling
provide a comprehensive view of the conceptual level of process variants and
the control-flow process perspective. While some approaches go a step further
by capturing variability in resources or specialization among
activities/processes."
pub.1013863657,How Culture Might Impact on the Implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning Packages,"ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) packages provide generic off-the-shelf business and software solutions to customers. However, these are implemented in companies with different corporate and national cultures, and there is growing evidence that failure to adapt ERP packages to fit these cultures leads to projects which are expensive and overdue. This paper describes research which synthesises social science theories of culture to be able to model and predict the impact of culture on ERP package implementation. It describes a knowledge meta-schema for modelling the surface and the deeper manifestations of culture, and for integrating these models with more common business concepts such as processes, events and information flows. It reports data from an analysis of a recent ERP implementation in a higher education institution to validate the knowledge meta-schema. It concludes with an outline of a method for ERP implementation to ensure a fit with the customer’s corporate and national culture."

The basis for the validation is the Electronic Kanban replenishment process and data interchange protocol that has been standardized to support the Inventory Visibility and Interoperability (IV&I) project for the automotive supply chain. The paper discusses results of and lessons learned from the validation process."
pub.1003469786,Connecting Databases with Process Mining: A Meta Model and Toolset,"Process Mining techniques require event logs which, in many cases, are obtained from databases. Obtaining these event logs is not a trivial task and requires substantial domain knowledge. In addition, the result is a single view on the database in the form of a specific event log. If we desire to change our view, e.g. to focus on another business process, and generate another event log, it is necessary to go back to the source of data. This paper proposes a meta model to integrate both process and data perspectives, relating one to the other and allowing to generate different views from it at any moment in a highly flexible way. This approach decouples the data extraction from the application of analysis techniques, enabling its use in different contexts."
pub.1086686331,BPMN-Based Model-Driven Testing of Service-Based Processes,"Executable Business Processes realized in WS-BPEL and BPMN2 are used more and more for automating digitalized core processes in organizations. Due to their critical nature for the organization, these processes need to be developed with high quality standards. Existing literature concentrates on testing such processes, but do not offer integration into the development lifecycle and validation with other stakeholders. Our approach is based on Test Models that allow both the easier definition of automated test cases as well as discussion with non-technical stakeholders and, thus, can be used for business process validation and process modeling support. We define a meta-model for the BPMN-based Test Models that has been validated in a case study in an industrial project."
pub.1050698863,Heterogeneous Domains’ e-Business Transactions Interoperability with the use of Generic Process Models,"Interoperability is the key factor which will drive e-Business to the next level by offering fully automated transactions among Enterprise Applications, such as Enterprise Resource Planning or Supply Chain Management systems. Nowadays, research seems to have dealt with the problem of interoperability in various business domains, however the issue of interoperability in heterogeneous business domains — Enterprises, Governmental and Banking Institutions of different countries (cross-border) or Enterprises of different interests (cross-sector) - remains still a big challenge. This paper presents generic models of the most common business transactions carried out mainly by Small and Medium Enterprises. These models are constructed using state-of-the art notations and methodologies which facilitate the Application-to-Application interconnection and the automated business documents exchange between enterprises, governmental and banking institutions, covering not only national or sector specific business domain transactions but also cross-border and cross-sector processes, which imply different requirements as apart from the differences in the execution way, different legal rules and data entities, are also present."
pub.1095246833,AMABULO - A Model Architecture for Business Logic,"Models are widely used for communication and documentation purposes. They also tend to be used as parame-ters for code generation. Because these models have to be complete, consistent and correct we have to support mod-ellers in keeping their models clean. The modeller should have the choice to select the preferred view and the needed level of detail for his modelling and model maintenance tasks. This paper proposes a model architecture named AMAB ULO for a model driven development process of business logic for information systems. The model architecture consists of a meta model, corresponding visual diagrams and an interchange format. With the use of AMABULO the development process for business logic is supported from analysis until code generation."
pub.1006941964,From conceptual process models to running systems: A holistic approach for the configuration of enterprise system processes,"This paper proposes a method which aims at increasing the efficiency of enterprise system implementations. First, we argue that existing process modeling languages that feature different degrees of abstraction for different user groups exist and are used for different purposes which makes it necessary to integrate them. We describe how to do this using the meta models of the involved languages. Second, we argue that an integrated process model based on the integrated meta model needs to be configurable and elaborate on the enabling mechanisms. We introduce a business example using SAP modeling techniques to illustrate the proposed method."

Competitive markets require the collaborations to be highly agile, effective, and efficient. This paper defines Internet scale virtual enterprise collaborations (ISVECs) as well as their characteristics. We further present a process modeling method for Internet-based virtual enterprise collaborations. An end user process modeling language of ISVECs and a meta-model of the language are provided. Finally, we demonstrate how the method and language are used."
pub.1023086261,Conceptual Typology for Platform Service Ecosystems,"This study first introduces platform services and their business models. On the basis of the concepts of business ecosystem, we present a framework for distinguishing types of the platform service business models. Two key characteristics of business ecosystems-ecosystem configuration and value production process-are employed as fundamental dimensions for constructing typology. In particular, we also present the notion of value ecosystem, where not a single platform provider but a federation of platforms constitutes a virtual platform and completes a service system. The value ecosystem represents two distinct types of platform service business models : meta-platform ecosystem and platform coalition ecosystem. They show different governance structure in the platform federation and service flows across the ecosystem. We present detailed analyses of these two value ecosystems focusing on relevant cases of e-payment FinTech : Apple Pay as an example of meta-platform and Kakao Pay for platform coalition. Our conceptual typology contributes to platforms' proper strategy formulation and presents policy implications to, for example, platform neutrality."
pub.1051548295,A collaborative design framework for the Korean automotive parts industry,"In the automotive industry, although small enterprises that supply car parts participate in the design phase of new car development, they do not communicate with each other for developing parts or modules because of the lack of a common communication protocol. In order to provide solutions to such problems, there has been an emergence of collaboration solutions among participants. Moreover, collaborative product lifecycle management (CPLM) is suggested as an alternative for providing such collaboration solutions. In order to develop CPLM, a framework that supports the understanding and sharing of business processes across business boundaries is necessary. Such a framework includes a reference model, business process model, and business process. The reference model explains the business domain, and it must be shared among participants for a common communication purpose. The business process model describes the collaborative design process, which can be defined by common principles in a meta-model. This paper suggests a new reference model for the design chain in the Korean automotive parts industry. Under a collaborative environment, the design process of the reference model may be classified into the mechanical and human-driven processes. In order to define both process types, a new integrated process model that combines the Component Collaboration Architecture (CCA) model of Enterprise Distributed Object Computing (EDOC) and Role Activity Diagram (RAD) models is suggested. We also introduce model driven approach (MDA) of Object Modelling Group (OMG) in order to describe an abstract level for common communication among business partners."
pub.1109930657,Ant-Colony Optimisation for Path Recommendation in Business Process Execution,"In business process management, operational support concerns methods and tools to support users during the execution of business processes. One possible way of supporting users is to suggest the optimal way to complete the execution of a business process instance given the set of activities executed thus far and a notion of utility associated with the execution of possible remaining activities. This problem goes also under the label of process navigation. This paper proposes a novel technique to implement process navigation based on the innovative abstraction of business process models as a restricted class of directed hypergraphs, i.e. WF-hypergraphs. In our approach, workflow net process models are first transformed into WF-hypergraphs. Using this abstraction, finding the optimal way to complete a business process becomes a generalised hypergraph shortest path problem, which is NP-hard. To solve this problem, we propose a solution based on the ant-colony meta-heuristic specifically customised to the case of hypergraph traversal. The paper presents an experimental evaluation of the proposed optimisation heuristic and discusses how the proposed approach can be integrated into modern business process management systems."

This research article aims to develop a valid extension for including and implementing the knowledge dimension in Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs). We aim at enriching the graphical representation of SBPs in order to identify and localize the crucial knowledge mobilized and created by these processes.

pub.1094299719,Evaluating flexible workflow systems,"Active business process support utilizing workflow technology is promising for building information systems that are flexible regarding both business and corresponding IT infrastructure transformation. To achieve this, conceptual models of work processes have to be aligned with interests of several stakeholders, including business professionals and users. In particular, user access to process models presuppose comprehensible in addition to expressive models. We propose a framework for evaluating quality in process modeling languages (PMLs) and models. It is applied to a representative sample of flexible workflow products and prototypes. We study the properties of the various products' underlying PMLs, and derive their first cut ontology, or meta model. In carrying out the evaluation, we show the applicability of our framework, and point out some research opportunities in areas where the products differ widely or carry similar deficiencies."
pub.1030133525,Visual Change Tracking for Business Process Models,"Basically there are two options to display process change: (a) showing the corresponding process model before and after the change, or (b) including change tracking options within the process model. In this paper we want to find out how to support users best in grasping process changes. For this, first of all, a conceptualization of Change Tracking Graphs (CTG) is provided that is independent of any process meta model. The CTGs are then visualized in different ways following aesthetic criteria on the one side and mental map aspects on the other side. Further, different visual properties are applied. All different combinations of change representation for process models are evaluated based on an empirical study with 117 participants. This study provides a first stepstone towards a more user-centric application of process change."
pub.1039171038,An Enterprise Architecture Framework for Integrating the Multiple Perspectives of Business Processes,"Existing business process design strategies do not address the full breadth and depth characteristics of business processes. Multiple perspectives of business process design must be supported and integrated. Enterprise architecture frameworks provide a useful context to define and categorise these multiple perspectives. Levels of abstraction of business, systems and technology represent the lifecycle phase ranging from business requirements definition through to execution. Different deliverables are relevant to each level of abstraction. The business architecture consists of a set of modeling perspectives (process, activity, resource and management) that represent types of business requirements. The technology architecture defines a classification of execution architectural styles. The systems architecture consists of a meta-model that defines the fundamental concepts underlying business requirements definition facilitating the integration of multiple modeling perspectives and mapping to multiple execution architectural styles, thereby facilitating execution of the business requirements."
pub.1005152062,Choreography of ebXML business collaborations,"The ebXML framework consists of eight loosely coupled specifications for conducting e-Business. The choreography of ebXML business processes is defined by instances of the business process specification schema (BPSS). The BPSS is defined as an XML schema. It specifies elements describing the inter-organizational business processes, called business collaborations, but does not concentrate on intra-organizational business processes. Most of the underlying semantics were derived from the meta model of the UN/CEFACT Modeling Methodology (UMM). In this paper we describe the characteristics of ebXML business collaborations. We demonstrate how these concepts are captured by UMM and BPSS. These concepts must be supported by any proposed alternative business process interchange format in order to bridge between ebXML and other approaches, or even to replace BPSS."

This research article aims to apply the BPMN for the representation of clinical pathways in order to utilize its benefits in the clinical context. BPMN provides a set of generic process modeling elements what makes it necessary to extend the language by domain-specific concepts from the field of clinical pathways (e.g., evidence indicators). Therefore, the extension method of Stroppi Et Al. (2011) was applied and extended in order to facilitate a systematic design and development. This research article provides the analysis of requirements and relevant concepts for modeling clinical pathways. Based on a domain ontology, need for extension is identified and the valid BPMN extension meta model is designed by the construction of a conceptional domain model and the corresponding BPMN extension model. The evolved extension “BPMN4CP” is demonstrated by an example process of wisdom tooth treatment."
pub.1038737961,Modelling the Co-Evolution of Business Processes and IT Systems,"Modelling is a core element of IT development. System development involves developing models which describe both business processes and the IT systems which support them. Modelling is typically undertaken during the design stage. To a large extent it is separated from the normal running of the business. The view is one of periods of stable business punctuated by changes associated with IT developments. However, there are many pressures which mean that business processes are also subject to continual change, and IT systems need to be responsive to this. This provokes an alternative view where business processes and IT systems are continually changing and influencing each other; they co-evolve. There are modelling approaches which directly address the issues of ongoing evolution. The Viable System Model (VSM) is a management model which categorises essential functions a business needs in order to evolve and survive. The Process for Process Evolution (P2E) is a generic model which has been implemented to provide an evolutionary framework for process models. We review our work with both VSM and P2E and identify common themes: the relationship between an operational system and its meta-system, the importance of feedback, and the use of recursion to manage complexity. These themes underpin our ongoing research on tackling the problems associated with the co-evolution of business processes and IT systems."

One way proposed in the literature is to make a deep process analysis in order to have a better comprehension of the business process (BP) and adapt it to its new context. In this paper, we propose a meta model for a BP contextualization solution. The solution links a BP with business data and contextual data (weather, urban traffic, etc.) using semantics. We apply it to a commodity palletization process from our commodity traceability project and we conclude that it provides business expert with additional contextual data that impacted the BP execution."

The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach to develop logical models (referred here as 'meta-algorithms'), whose goal is to express the content described in the textual rules, for each BPMN element, considering the BPMN2.0.2 specification. We identified that there is completeness and correctness in this approach, applying decision tables and control-flow graphs to checking the proposed meta-algorithms. In addition, we applied two surveys, considering a potential audience for the proposed meta-algorithms in order to check users' acceptance. For validation results, we identified that only textual rules are not enough to implement the notational elements for 84% of the survey participants."

Then individual Business Process Management (BPM) requires a holistic vision that incorporates an inter organizational view that supports SC decision making. This study proposes a novel idea trying to address collaborative BP modelling problem with a new perspective, a bottom-up approach, reusing process models that each organization may have created with a different modelling language. Collaborative Business Generation (CBG) Framework, following Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm, includes a meta model, a method, a set of model transformations and a support tool to create collaborative BP models from individual ones, maintaining privacy and autonomy in decision making. This paper presents main CBG-Framework elements as well as a real world case study for early validation."
pub.1105195644,Business Process Variability and Public Values,"A business process is a structure of inter-related activities that are executed in order to achieve a specific business objective. Organizations often maintain multiple variants of a given business process because of changing conditions, different regulations in different countries, or other contextual factors. We aim at specifying the relationship between a generic business process and its different variants, taking the perspective of public values, such as privacy, accountability, and transparency. The business process variants in turn may be a basis for software specifications – in this, business processes would be bridging between societal demands (possibly concerning public values) and the corresponding technical (software) functionalities. Our contribution is featuring a meta-model that describes business processes on a value-independent level; they can be extended towards value-specific business process variants that can be related in turn to software architectures. We reflect this in proposed value operationalization guidelines, using concepts from business process design as a basis; those guidelines assume coming firstly through technology-independent artefacts and secondly – through technology-specific artefacts, to arrive at software specifications that are adequate with regard to public-values-related demands."

In this paper we propose a rule driven approach for adaptive business collaboration development in which rules drive and govern the development process. We introduce the Business Collaboration Development Framework (BCDF), which provides enterprizes with the context to define their capabilities and business collaboration agreements. Subsequently, we explain how rules can drive and control the business collaboration development process to develop complete, correct and consistent business collaboration agreements that are conform the conditions under which parties wish to cooperate."

Model checking is an automated technique used for verifying finite state machines. The properties to be verified are usually expressed as formula in temporal logic. In this paper we present an approach to verify access control security properties of a security annotated business process model. To this end we utilise a security enhanced BPMN notation to define access control properties.To enhance the usability the complex and technical details are hidden from the process modeller by using an automatic translation of the process model into a process meta language (Promela) based on Coloured Petri net (CPN) semantics.The model checker SPIN is used for the process model verification and a trace file is written to provide visual feedback to the modeller on the abstraction level of the verified process model. As a proof of concept the described translation methodology is implemented as a plug-in for the free web-based BPMN modelling tool Oryx.

Today’s e-commerce systems often involve a combination of multiple Web Services, which are implemented via a mix of technologies such as Business Process Markup Language (BPML), Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS), and Web Service Choreography Interface (WSCI).Recently, the application of Model Driven Architecture (MDA) to Web Services has received considerable attention. However, most of existing literature deals with the static aspects of Web Service modelling.

The paper presents a transformation of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) Activity diagram to the BPEL4WS."
pub.1029052936,An Ontology-Enabled Approach for Modelling Business Processes,"Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) have formal semantics and can describe any type of workflow system, behavioral and syntax wise simultaneously. They are widely studied and successfully applied in modelling of workflows and workflow systems. There is an inherent problem regarding business processes modelled with CPNs sharing and subsequently their reuse need to be considered. The Semantic Web technologies, such as ontologies, with their characteristics demonstrate that they can play an important role in this scenario. In this paper, we propose an ontological approach for representing business models in a meta-knowledge base. Firstly, the CPN ontology is defined to represent CPNs with OWL DL. Secondly, we introduce four basic types of manipulation operations on process models used to develop and modify business workflow patterns. To the best of our knowledge, representing business process definitions and business workflow patterns as knowledge based upon ontologies is a novel approach."

However, well-designed service composition approaches always lacks the consideration of execution environment, and the approach designed for application execution is usually incomplete and lacking necessary business consideration. In order to improve the comprehensiveness covered both design and execution stages, a service composition approach based on process mining is proposed. First, a meta-model is designed to connect the information of execution environment and business requirement. Next, the scene model based on this meta-model is generated by leveraging process mining. Then the scene model is applied to do service composition, including service selection from the Service Registry. After that, BPEL instance is converted based on aggregated scene information so as to enable application execution. Finally, a cloud-based logistics platform is implemented to verify the approach, and the result shows that the approach has high requirement accuracy and execution effectiveness."

In our work we developed a framework consisting of meta-models, model transformations and tools that address a consistent support of development and maintenance tasks. As contribution of this article, we present an architecture for generated business logic code as part our infrastructure blueprint. We aim at the generation of robust business logic layers and consider particularly maintenance and integration issues of complex information systems with external dependencies. For this purpose, our infrastructure supports the specification of global domain states and local conditions in visual software models and generates corresponding code artifacts which assure these conditions automatically."
pub.1089974659,Towards Extending Business Process Modeling Formalisms with Information and Knowledge Dimensions,"Abstract
Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs) modeling has become an effective way of managing and developing organization’s knowledge which needs to be capitalized. These processes are characterized by a high complexity and dynamism in their execution, high number of critical activities with intensive acquisition, sharing, storage and (re)use of very specific crucial knowledge, diversity of knowledge sources, and high degree of collaboration among experts. Hence, we propose a semantically rich conceptualization for describing an SBP organized in a generic Business Process Meta-model for Knowledge Identification (BPM4KI), in order to develop a rich and expressive representation of SBPs to identify and localize the crucial knowledge. BPM4KI covers all aspects of business process modeling: the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. This paper aims to introduce a more explicit border between information and knowledge concepts and dimensions which are relevant in SBP models, based on «core» domain ontologies."

This paper describes a business process oriented Platform-as-a-Service framework called BPPaaS including an integrated business process application programming model, and business process oriented Platform-as-a-Service middleware. BPPaaS can enable users to submit their business process logic source code programmed by integrated business process programming language to this platform. And BPPaaS will parse the logic source code, extract the business process tasks and task-relationship to form meta-data, and encode business process tasks as standalone executable components. Since different cloud data center has specific data, BPPaaS will assign the business process tasks to the specific data center as task execution nodes, which have the necessary data required by tasks. A scheduling algorithm is introduced to supporting business process intensive application execution with multiple heterogeneous java runtime environments as the underling parallel computation platform. Finally, a case in social security application shows this framework can streamline complex computational business process."

pub.1023758940,Presentation and exchange of business models with CIMOSA-XML,"In the modern competitive business world there is a frequent need for enterprises to modify their structure of business processes to become more effective in the market place. The solution to this management demand is an improved business integration which is only successful when it is supported by effective IT systems. The Esprit project PRIMA aims to create a competitive advantage for European companies in the process sector by providing a route to `smarter' IT investments that are effective across the whole enterprise. A process repository which will store business process models in suitable formats would provide users with appropriate views of the models, focusing only on their information needs. However, the existence of many incompatible modelling methodologies and tools makes it impossible to unify the modelling approach. Therefore it would be desirable to have a high level common modelling language. The PRIMA project has identified CIMOSA as the basis for common semantics of the business model language and the XML format, as a suitable format for the transfer of the model structure and content. The PRIMA working group, in an effort to elaborate these concepts, has developed the Document Type Definition concept (DTD) of the CIMOSA-XML meta-model, which can be used to build the partial enterprise models related to the Business Functional Requirements (BFR) of the PRIMA Process Methodology."
pub.1042088275,Knowledge Engineering in Business Process Management,"Business Process Management (BPM) has become a commodity nowadays. It has undergone an evolution from the initial business process re-engineering in the 1980s to a well-established management approach, which is extensively discussed in this book (See introduction chapter of Harmon on the Scope and Evolution of Business Process Management). This chapter deals with the increasingly important domain of knowledge-sensitive BPM as a current challenge imposed from semantic web, the cloud, social networks or Web 2.0 not only to provide new technologies for BPM but also trigger a cultural change of people involved. Three aspects of knowledge sensitiveness in BPM are proposed. First, BPM can be seen as a domain itself focusing on BP-frameworks identifying basic concepts such as business model, domain, regulation, or model processing (See introduction chapters by Rosemann and vom Brocke on the Six Core Elements of BPM). Second, BPM needs to be applied using a management method such as the BPMS methodology. Third, BPM needs to be executed within an environment; hence, it is deployed. BPM can be seen as a basic concept for corporate knowledge leading to knowledge-sensitive BPM. Studying the knowledge-sensitiveness two forms of interpretation are distinguished: (1) knowledge engineering (KE) focusing on machine interpretable knowledge and (2) knowledge management (KM) relating to human interpretation of knowledge. In the following, the focus lies upon KE distinguishing three viewpoints: (a) KE is established in BP-frameworks as a realization within the used meta models for those frameworks; (b) knowledge-intensive actions within the BP method – which is typically performed by business process (BP) analysts – is supported by KE techniques; (c) deployment of BPM within a typical execution environment is likely including knowledge-based applications, hence those knowledge concepts need to be reflected. KE techniques are proposed for the areas above and empirical experiences as results of research projects are described. As a conclusion an outlook on the conceptual and technical integration summarizes the chapter."

                    This paper aims to present a meta‐model for electronic government (e‐government) which takes account of the broad nature of this contemporary socio‐technical phenomenon. As such it contains within it a number of possible “business models” for the development of e‐government – strategies for e‐government focused around key business processes and information systems.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This meta‐model is built from literature taken from the domains of informatics, business and public administration. It is also built on established academic, policy and practitioner literature from the domain of e‐government itself.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The paper demonstrates and validates the use of this meta‐model in three ways. First, it is used as an explanatory tool to help review the contemporary experience of e‐government in the UK. To help in this process we position specific case examples of e‐government against the model from this experience. Second, it is used to evaluate a number of existing models of e‐government, particularly those which provide an explicit framework of e‐government progress. A number of deficiencies in such models are identified from this evaluation. Third, the meta‐model is proposed as a framework for evaluating and potentially benchmarking e‐government. The intention is to raise the perspective of evaluation and benchmarking in this area beyond its contemporary focus on electronic service delivery.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    To demonstrate the worth of this approach, the paper describes the application of elements of this meta‐model in two evaluation/benchmarking exercises undertaken by the author in the context of regional e‐government.

pub.1009089528,Conceptual modeling and specification generation for B2B business processes based on ebXML,"In order to support dynamic setup of business processes among independent organizations, a formal standard schema for describing the business processes is basically required. The ebXML framework provides such a specification schema called BPSS (Business Process Specification Schema) which is available in two stand-alone representations: a UML version, and an XML version. The former, however, is not intended for the direct creation of business process specifications, but for defining specification elements and their relationships required for creating an ebXML-compliant business process specification. For this reason, it is very important to support conceptual modeling that is well organized and directly matched with major modeling concepts. This paper deals with how to represent and manage B2B business processes using UML-compliant diagrams. The major challenge is to organize UML diagrams in a natural way that is well suited with the business process meta-model and then to transform the diagrams into an XML version. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of conceptually modeling business processes by prototyping a business process editor tool called ebDesigner."
pub.1072008671,An Effective Method for Manufacturing Data Integration Based on Resource Model,"During complex manufacturing process, various manufacturing information systems and management information systems are often existing as heterogeneous systems, and manufacturing data is distributed everywhere across the whole value chain of the enterprises. One of the most valuable targets in the integration of these manufacturing information systems is the sharing of enterprise resources which are described in different formats in different information systems. In this paper, meta-resource model is extended using workflow to combine enterprise resources together with business process during manufacturing. Then, an effective method of data integration is proposed based on the meta-resource model. In the proposed method, heterogeneous data is encapsulated in unified format of resource and binding with workflow so that data resources could be accessed according to the business process of manufacturing. Finally, case study shows that the resource-based data integration approach is more robot and flexible than traditional data integration method, especial under the environment of complex manufacturing."
pub.1037956224,A Meta-model for e-Contract Template Variable Dependencies Facilitating e-Negotiation,"Contracts are important for attaining business process interoperability and enforcing their proper enactment. An e-Contract is the computerized facilitation or automation of a contract in a cross-organizational business process. In this paper, motivated by a lease template example, we propose a meta-model for e-Contract templates and template variables. Furthermore, we discover different types of relationships, such as partial order and indivisibility, among template variables. In addition, negotiators can logroll among template variables, focusing on tradeoffs among these instead of arguing about single variables. Based on these relationships, we present an algorithm to determine a negotiation plan of an e-Contract. Furthermore, we propose a model for e-Negotiation of contracts based on contract templates and workflow management technologies. As a result, the process of contract e-Negotiation can be streamlined."
pub.1036548717,Enterprise Model Integration,"Due to rapid changing business requirements the complexity in developing enterprise-spanning applications is continually growing. A vital field of delivering technical concepts and technologies for integrating heterogeneous applications and components to support inter-organisational business processes is the area of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). A common characteristic of all EAI approaches is their focus on technical and runtime aspects of integration. From our project experiences in developing large B2B applications, it is necessary to integrate applications on the business and conceptual level as well. Because of the diversity of models and modelling languages for developing enterprise applications, we propose the Enterprise Model Integration (EMI) approach. In this paper we describe basic concepts of EMI, a pattern system for metamodel integration, and a case study applying EMI for developing B2B applications. The EMI approach is compatible with the MDA infrastructure and implemented within the meta model management tool ADONIS."
pub.1095517429,Process-Centered Model Engineering,"A new information system landscape is emerging that will be more model-centered than object-oriented, characterized by many models of low granularity and high abstraction. These models may describe various aspects of a system such as products, structural organization and processes. This latter category may be refined into manufacturing, software and business processes for example. Each of these sub-domains share common concerns such the definition of work items, performers, inputs and outputs, etc. However, as they may be represented using separate meta-models, there is therefore a risk of facing an uncontrollable number of meta-models that all redefine similar modeling constructs.

In this paper we underline some similarities between process meta-models and we sketch out how they could be organized."
pub.1031552733,An Engineering Approach for the Design of Hybrid Modelling Methods,"A fast moving business environment requires flexible and open conceptual modelling approaches for the discussion of diverse needs from the business point of view. In the conception and design of these business needs and resulting requirements, manifold modelling languages and methods on different levels of the realisation process are available. Despite their number, flexibility in this paper is referred to the exchange of ‘building blocks’ of modelling frameworks and the composition of hybrid modelling methods. That this claim for flexibility does neither affect efficiency nor goes at the account of a sound conception of the hybrid modelling method, a deliberate procedure comprising different steps is required. We call this procedure conceptualisation. At the end of this procedure an implementation on a meta-modelling platform is performed and the result of the conceptualisation process is a ‘deployable tool’. Furthermore we imply the hybrid modelling method is of a graphical, semi-formal kind and based on a meta-modelling approach. The conceptualisation is a platform dependent activity. In the paper at hand the meta-modelling platform ADOxx® is used."

Reactions can be short-term and influence the behavior of running process instances or they can be mid-term or long-term and cause the redesign of the process. In both situations, insights into the process flow are necessary and provided by Process Data Warehouse Systems. This paper proposes to derive the data warehouse structures from the meta model of the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), the actual de-facto standard of workflow languages. The resulting data structure is generic in order to be portable between application domains and to be stable in case of changing workflows."

pub.1145303446,Trust-aware process design: the case of GoFood,"
                    Purpose
                    Trust is an increasingly important requirement for any business and as a result has become a contemporary design criterion for business processes. However, the literature to date is very much focused on the technical (security) aspects, which are provider centric, as opposed to trust that is customer centric. In this paper, the authors extended an initial meta-model of trust-aware process design by proposing a way to capture trust-intensity for four trust dimensions, i.e. input, people, process and output and an organizational trust position. The authors also investigate the deployment of the extended meta-model in practice.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    An extensive literature study is conducted to derive an understanding of the dimension's customer trust when interacting with an organization. Based on the findings of the literature review and a previously developed trust meta-model, the authors propose a way to describe an organizational trust position, i.e. the depiction of how much uncertainty is prevalent in the trust dimensions. Next, the authors conducted an exploratory case study using secondary data to validate the extended meta-model.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The case study demonstrated the applicability of the extended trust meta-model and derived actionable practices. In this case, the Indonesian food delivery company GoFood, the authors identified trust concerns in the input, process, resources and output of their business at the start of their operations. Since then, GoFood took specific actions to reduce their operational, behavioral and perceived uncertainty and these identified trust concerns. To a lesser degree, GoFood has managed vulnerability issues and invested in measures to increase customers' confidence. As a result of reduced uncertainties, GoFood's business has grown and became the number one in food service delivery in Indonesia.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The approach to capture trust (in the trust dimensions) is still a simplified version and a pre-step for a fully developed management tool or method. The use of a secondary data from a single case study also limits the validity and generalizability of the findings.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The extended meta-model proposed in this paper has several implications related to the organization's BPM capabilities. The result also demonstrates how trust measures related to reducing uncertainty, reducing vulnerability and increasing confidence can be applied in practice. Strategies used by the case company presented here such as rating systems to increase confidence can be used by other firms within a similar context.

Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the quality of process models from different viewpoints. This is even more important as the increasing number of different end users, different purposes and the availability of different modeling techniques and modeling tools leads to a higher complexity of information models. In this paper the Guidelines of Modeling (GoM)1, a framework to structure factors for the evaluation of process models, is presented. Exemplary, Guidelines of Modeling for workflow management and simulation are presented.

For achieving the most refined results, high-quality and up-to-date process models are required. However, the selection of the proper process discovery algorithm is often addressed by human experts that can relate quality criteria, event logs behavior, and discovery techniques. Exploiting a meta-learning approach, we created a procedure that identifies the optimal discovery technique based on a user-defined balance of quality metrics. Our experiments exploited 1091 event logs representing extensive possible business process behaviors. Given a set of available algorithms, we obtained an F-score of 0.76 for recommending the discovery algorithm that maximizes quality criteria. Moreover, our method supports a more in-depth investigation of the process discovery problem by mapping log behavior and discovery techniques."

pub.1029114310,An Object-Oriented and Business Process-Based Meta Model of an Architecture for Management Support Systems,"The current enterprise environment is especially characterized by changes. Reasons are for example the constantly progressive change from supplier- to buyer-markets, the increasing internationalism of the markets and the distinct customers’ demands forcing the enterprises to an intensified market- and customer- orientation. As a consequence, the result from the economical activities of an enterprise depends more and more on its speed of response and its adaptability towards changing constraints - both internal and external. The enterprises come to meet this external change internally with more flexibility. A quick reaction and adaption towards changed constraints and a corresponding enterprise management require a permanent availability of complete, decision relevant and current information for the management. As a result, effective and efficient management support systems (MSS) especially supporting strategic decisions are called for by enterprises that want to retain their market position successfully.

However most BPM frameworks have used meta-models centered on flows of activities, with the data manipulated by these activities seen as second-class citizens. For business analysts (for example in complex product design collaborative environments) data plays a major role. In this paper, we propose a methodology backed by a conceptual framework to model the cross-organizational process relying on the product model. This framework defines the evolution of the product model through a finite number of states, and then automatically generates executable artifacts to support the collaboration during run-time phase. This approach is being implemented in the living laboratory provided by EADS in the context of the European project IMAGINE."

pub.1073673445,Exploring the Potential of Dynamic Perspective Taking on Business Processes,"Although many organizations have started to work with business process models in their operational practice, they have not explored the entire potential of intertwining business process modeling with organizational development. Process specifications contain workflows that require execution, in order to achieve business objectives and support business operation effectively. With the advent of Subject-oriented and Social Business Process Management, communication and stakeholder interaction have become novel perspectives on how to design and implement processes. They go beyond formal responsibilities encoded in functional roles, and are not very common across organizational hierarchies. However, stakeholders, including organizational developers and IT specialists, can be supported looking at processes and their execution from either perspective, namely, from a traditional one, focusing on functions and task accomplishment, and from an interactional perspective, focusing on communication among stakeholders and system interactions. The introduced dual-mode workflow execution engine UeberFlow allows considering both perspectives during process runtime, thus, checking operational completeness from either perspective. Stakeholders can start modeling with a perspective they are familiar with and subsequently proceed with the another one by switching dynamically to an alternate mode of execution. The presented meta-model and architecture of such a dual mode support tool enables coupling business process management directly with organizational development."
pub.1149794319,Things-Aware Business Process Model,"Nowadays, the usage of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is growing enormously with time. These devices apply computational capabilities to perform execution on the fragments of a business process. This may result in a smaller number of message interactions between the IoT network and the business process engine. However, business processes are explained by considering the centralized approach; it increases the workload in the upper level of business processes. This article conceptualizes process meta store (PMS) to optimize the number of interactions between IoT devices and business process engines. This layer enables an integration between business applications and IoT-things-level business processes. This approach is represented by a R-tree-based method for locating regions and their associated locations. After obtaining the exact location, the associated devices, services, and atomic services have found from PMS. A searching algorithm is proposed for this to optimize the searching operation. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is considered as a case study to explain the proposed approach. Several characteristics are considered to show the better performance of the proposed method over several existing integration approaches."

pub.1095815980,The Credit Suisse Meta-data Warehouse,"This paper describes the meta-data warehouse of Credit Suisse that is productive since 2009. Like most other large organizations, Credit Suisse has a complex application landscape and several data warehouses in order to meet the information needs of its users. The problem addressed by the meta-data warehouse is to increase the agility and flexibility of the organization with regards to changes such as the development of a new business process, a new business analytics report, or the implementation of a new regulatory requirement. The meta-data warehouse supports these changes by providing services to search for information items in the data warehouses and to extract the lineage of information items. One difficulty in the design of such a meta-data warehouse is that there is no standard or well-known meta-data model that can be used to support such search services. Instead, the meta-data structures need to be flexible themselves and evolve with the changing IT landscape. This paper describes the current data structures and implementation of the Credit Suisse meta-data warehouse and shows how its services help to increase the flexibility of the whole organization. A series of example meta-data structures, use cases, and screenshots are given in order to illustrate the concepts used and the lessons learned based on feedback of real business and IT users within Credit Suisse."

pub.1094877046,Checking Correctness and Compliance of Integrated Process Models,"Models of different kinds are used in the area of business process management. Abstract process knowledge as well as executable process definitions can be visualized and edited in a graphical manner. The same holds true for models of process instances in some process-aware information systems (PAIS), which allow for dynamic modifications in a process instance during process runtime. An appropriate modeling tool must not only provide means to graphically edit different kinds of models on different abstraction layers but also detect or prevent violations of certain model constraints. These constraints comprise a model's internal correctness as well as a model's compliance with general process knowledge expressed in another more abstract model. In this paper we contribute an approach that allows for uniformly specifying correctness as well as compliance checks for diverse graphical process models. This is achieved by means of an integrated meta-model for models of different kinds. The integrated meta-model is referenced by a fixed set of Object Constraint Language (OCL) expressions, which specify correctness and compliance checks. We exemplify some OCL expressions and their application within a prototypical modeling tool."
pub.1139938916,Meta-process: a noval approach for decentralized execution of process,"With the rapid growth of internet usage for enterprise-wide and cross-enterprise business applications (such as those in Electronic Commerce), workflow systems are gaining importance as an infrastructure for automating inter-organizational interactions. However, the traditional centralized workflow management technology can no longer meet the needs of current application services. For example, in e-commerce, cross-enterprise business applications may cause many security problems and cross-domain problems in the implementation of workflow. At the same time, due to the uncertainty and variability of environment and user requirements in practical applications, many business logics are difficult to be completely defined in advance. Therefore workflow models need to be immediately built or adjusted dynamically. Nowadays, distributed scheduling and decentralized control of workflow have become the emerging trend and are facing many challenges at the forefront of Internet development technology. In this paper, a distributed workflow control execution method based on “meta-process” is proposed. Specifically, we designed and implemented a decentralized distributed scheduling management system for workflow tasks. To manage and control the distributed scheduling of workflow, we constructed a “meta-process”, which can ensure the integrity of the control chain in the distributed scheduling process. Our system can efficiently handle the data state migration between task nodes and supports the dynamic adjustment of the workflow model. For validation, we simulated a large number of service scheme samples and applied them to the system, which proved that all service cases can be executed correctly. Therefore, the feasibility of this method is verified."
pub.1018355595,Architecture-Driven Business Transformation,"Enterprise architecture (EA) has primarily a business focus, but it involves the kind of systems thinking typically associated with information technology (IT). Any one of its component architectures could theoretically drive a business transformation. The example of process architecture is chosen because of its implications for other architectural domains; because of the link between customer-centricity and process-centricity; and because inherited attitudes to process desperately need overhaul. An imagined diagnostic in a financial services company provides context. The diagnostic recommends a holistic alternative to current approaches to process. It articulates an explicit logical meta-model from which it draws out a number of key concepts implementable as generic physical constructs. The resulting process architecture can drive radical business transformation given the right program management, governance, and, above all, sponsorship."
pub.1136618616,Risk-aware business process management using multi-view modeling: method and tool,"Risk-aware Business Process Management (R-BPM) has been addressed in research since more than a decade. However, the integration of the two independent research streams is still ongoing with a lack of research focusing on the conceptual modeling perspective. Such an integration results in an increased meta-model complexity and a higher entry barrier for modelers in creating conceptual models and for addressees of the models in comprehending them. Multi-view modeling can reduce this complexity by providing multiple interdependent viewpoints that, all together, represent a complex system. Each viewpoint only covers those concepts that are necessary to separate the different concerns of stakeholders. However, adopting multi-view modeling discloses a number of challenges particularly related to managing consistency which is threatened by semantic and syntactic overlaps between the viewpoints. Moreover, usability and efficiency of multi-view modeling have never been systematically evaluated. This paper reports on the conceptualization, implementation, and empirical evaluation of e-BPRIM, a multi-view modeling extension of the Business Process-Risk Management-Integrated Method (BPRIM). The findings of our research contribute to theory by showing, that multi-view modeling outperforms diagram-oriented modeling by means of usability and efficiency of modeling, and quality of models. Moreover, the developed modeling tool is openly available, allowing its adoption and use in R-BPM practice. Eventually, the detailed presentation of the conceptualization serves as a blueprint for other researchers aiming to harness multi-view modeling."
pub.1094585601,Integration of Conceptual Models and Data Services Using Metamodeling,The continuous shift to concepts of service orientation is a fact - not only in the area of information and communication technologies but also in business environments. Model-based approaches have been identified as a suitable means to bring together business and technology. In this paper we describe an approach how knowledge about business requirements laid down in the form of metamodels can be aligned with concepts of service orientation in information technology. For that purpose we propose an evolutionary process to migrate from existing metamodels to semantically annotated services by applying meta-model slicing techniques. The resulting data services are then passed back to the business environment where they may be reused for implementation tasks or for the integration in business applications.

pub.1048110813,Generating Business Process Models from Object Behavior Models,"Object-oriented modeling is an established approach to document information systems. In an object model, a system is captured in terms of object types and associations, state machines and collaboration diagrams, among others. Process modeling on the other hand, provides a different approach whereby behavior is captured in terms of activities, flow dependencies, resources, etc. These two approaches have their relative advantages. Also, object models and process models lend themselves to different styles of implementation. In this paper we define a transformation from a meta-model for object behavior modeling to a meta-model for process modeling. The transformation relies on the identification of causal relations in the object model. These relations are encoded in a heuristics net from which a process model is derived and then simplified. Using this transformation, it becomes possible to apply established object-oriented techniques during system analysis and design, and to transform the resulting object models into executable process models that can be deployed in a workflow engine. The proposal has been implemented in an object modeling tool."

This extended BPMN4SBP meta-model is derived by applying model transformation rules and by adapting, also, the UML profile mechanism to BPMN."
pub.1017266267,Interoperability Issues in Metamodelling Platforms,"Metamodelling platforms are getting more and more base technology, therefore interoperability of metamod-elling platforms becomes a crucial aspect in managing corpo-rations’ knowledge assets. This paper describes a generic metamodelling platform architecture and presents an overview of interoperability issues according to conceptual domains in metamodelling platform architectures. Some of these issues are illustrated by a case study from the insurance sector. The collection of interoperability issues can serve as a starting point to stimulate further research on interoperability prob-lems in the metamodelling platform domain."
pub.1039728543,Model-based support for business re-engineering,"What do we need to know about the business in order to understand and, eventually, to improve business operations? Many business modelling methods have been described in the literature and applied in business re-engineering projects. We feel that current business modelling methods do not have a precise enough model of the underlying business knowledge. A model should be comprehensive enough to allow for a systematic study and precise formulation of re-engineering methods. It should also provide a framework for designing tools to support business re-engineering projects. We identify information requirements for business re-engineering based on the commonly used business re-engineering methods and case studies published in the literature. We formalized these requirements within the conceptual business model that is described in this paper. Business models vary from a company to company and from one business re-engineering project to another. Therefore, we build a generic model first and then we customize the generic model to the needs of a given company and a re-engineering project in hand. We build the core of a tool environment for business re-engineering around the generic business model. We achieve a required level of tool flexibility by applying meta-CASE techniques. We derive the physical schema for tool repository and generate customized tools from the customized business model specifications. Tools built around our model can support business knowledge acquisition, business process modelling, performance/quality analysis and analysis of alternative business process re-engineering solutions. In the paper, we describe our business model and an integrated computer-aided business understanding and re-engineering tool environment that we build around the business model. We illustrate benefits of building tools on a rich business model, focusing on tools and analysis methods that have not been extensively described in other sources."
pub.1048453920,Implementation of Policy Based Management in Workflow Management System,"The foundation of a traditional workflow management system is process-based management. We have proposed to integrate policy-based management in workflow management systems to improve the flexibility and the dynamic behavior. In this paper, how to implement policy-based management in a workflow system is discussed. To construct policy model, a meta modeling method with four layer structure is introduced. The main tasks in each layer of the meta modeling architecture are described. To define where and when to apply policies in a workflow, a Control Point model is introduced. A workflow process meta model supporting policy-based management is presented. The architecture of a simple prototype system to support policy based management is also presented. The new approach has better flexibility in design time and higher adaptability at run-time."
pub.1145474247,Generic meta model of cumulative fact table for non-sequential processes,"Process mining refers to the set of techniques used to exploit the event logs of process-oriented information systems that manage and execute processes to gain hidden knowledge about an organization's actual business processes. The literature review noted that in the case of a non-sequential process, the structure of the cumulative fact table and the filling procedure do not allow all the data relating to an instance to be recorded. During the execution of the processes, loops are formed. Loops are explanatory variables for understanding process performance indicators such as cost, delay, and failure. We have proposed a meta-model for the cumulative fact table, allowing to take into account the filling procedure and the recording of all data related to an instance."
pub.1046204203,Prototype to Support Morphism between BPMN Collaborative Process Model and Collaborative SOA Architecture Model,"In a collaborative context, the integration of industrial partners deeply depends of the ability to use a collaborative architecture to interact efficiently. In this paper, we propose to tackle this point according to the fact that partners of the collaboration respect SOA (Service-Oriented Approach) concepts. We propose to design such a collaborative SOA architecture according to MDA (model-Driven Approach) principles. We aim at using business model (the needs) to design a logical model of a solution (logical architecture). The business model is a collaborative business model (in BPMN, at the CIM level), while the logical model is a collaborative architecture model (using UML, at the PIM level). This paper presents the theoretical aspects of this subject, the mechanisms of morphism and the dedicated translation rules. Finally, we show the prototype of a demonstration tool embedding the transformation rules and running those principles."
pub.1024264452,Towards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages,"The increasing interest in process engineering and application integration has resulted in the appearance of various new process modelling languages. Understanding and comparing such languages has therefore become a major problem in information systems research and development. We suggest a framework to solve this problem involving several instruments: a general process meta-model with a table, an analysis of the event concept, and a classification of concepts according to the interrogative pronouns: what, how, why, who, when, and where. This framework can be used for several purposes, such as translating between languages or verifying that relevant organisational aspects have been captured. To validate the framework, three different process modelling languages have been compared: Business Modelling Language (BML), Event-driven Process Chains (EPC) and UML State Diagrams."

pub.1095615830,Role-Centric RESTful Services Description and Composition for E-Business Applications,"Currently there are increasing interests in using REST architecture style to implement business process. However, the importance of role is not emphasized. In fact role is critical to determine the RESTful services description and to control the services composition. This paper presents a role-centric RESTful services description and composition mechanism to implement business process. Firstly a resource meta-model is proposed, and then process and role are formally defined, RESTful services description is then generated based on role and BPEL is extended by introducing the concept of role to control the access to resources. A case study is also given to illustrate the approach and the desirable features of the approach are discussed."
pub.1018837225,From Contracts to E-Contracts: Modeling and Enactment,"Contracts are complex to understand, represent and process electronically. Usually, contracts involve various entities such as parties, activities and clauses. An e-contract is a contract modeled, specified, executed and enacted (controlled and monitored) by a software system (such as a workflow system). Workflows are used to automate business processes that govern adherence to the e-contracts. E-contracts can be mapped to inter-related workflows, which have to be specified carefully to satisfy the contract requirements. Most workflow models do not have the capabilities to handle complex inter/intra relationships among entities in e-contracts. An e-contract does not adhere to activity/task oriented workflow processes, thus generating a gap between a conceptual model of e-contract and workflow. In this paper, we describe conceptual modeling of e-contracts and present a business process model for e-contract enactment. The enactment of e-contracts necessitates dynamic generation and initiation of workflows during the e-contract execution, besides the static workflows. EREC business process model facilitates an integrated approach to e-contracts enactment. Our methodology is illustrated by means of a case study conducted using Financial Messaging Solution contract for banking transactions."
pub.1094167038,An Automatic Approach to Transform BPMN Models to Pi-Calculus,"In order to automate Business Processes Modeling, the last research works in workflow technology have resulted in the identification of a number of models (workflow patterns) that describe the behavior of Business Processes. Like any new trend, the Business Process approach raises many expectations and many positions. BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) has been used to describe graphically such patterns. However, BPMN notation lacks verification tools which allow anomalies and errors detection such as deadlock and multiple repetition situations. On the other hand, formal methods, such as Pi-Calculus, have powerful tools for verifying such situations. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to transform the basic workflow patterns into their equivalent Pi-Calculus code for the analysis purposes. To achieve this goal, we use the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach which is mainly based on Meta-modeling and Model Transformations. The graph transformation tool AToM3 is used. Our approach is illustrated through an example."
pub.1036273397,Bridging Architectural Boundaries Design and Implementation of a Semantic BPM and SOA Governance Tool,"In order to increase IT and business agility or to improve IT systems and business processes integration many organizations are currently implementing business process management systems (BPMS) or adopting a service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm. However, in doing so, IT complexity will admittedly increase and IT managers then are in need of effective governance techniques covering both strategic initiatives, BPM and SOA. This contribution re-examines the problem domain in the novel Enhanced Process-Driven Architecture (ePDA) model in order to systematically derive the requirements for combined BPM and SOA governance. We then formulate a semantic meta model capable of capturing necessary artifacts and describe its technical implementation in Software AG’s and Fujitsu’s joint CentraSite governance re gis try/repository. As ""lessons learned"" from several projects we systematically derive governance benefits using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and highlight measures on software deployment issues."
pub.1127270642,How do Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) survive the COVID-19 outbreak?,"The purpose of this study is to describe a business model that can be applied to the SME during the COVID-19 pandemic with Business Model Canvas approach so that SME can survive (Business Resilience). This research uses a qualitative method, with literature studies taken from several sources both printed and electronic media, books, and research results accessed from various electronic journals. The data analysis used is content meta-analysis through an interactive procedure consisting of four stages: data collection, data condensation, data presentation, and drawing conclusions. The business model that can be applied to SME is the Business Model Canvas. Three important elements of business resilience are product excellence, people behavior, and process reliability, Business resilience is supported by digital transformation. Digital transformation exists when new digital skills emerge and digital tools are adopted. The right digitalization strategy is needed in achieving business goals and developing SME products or services to be more competitive. Competitive advantage is related to cultural diversity, plurality and social motivation. In the process of digital transformation, the correct digital infrastructure testing is required. By using the appropriate technology for system resilience, a business can carry out its digital transformation and create digital resilience."

pub.1001716464,A Conceptual Foundation of Requirements Engineering for Business Information Systems,"Requirements engineering (RE) is a crucial discipline when developing software systems. Applying RE activities successfully in the domain of business information systems (BIS) requires a deep and common understanding on how concepts of RE and business analysis are related. We consider this fact as being a challenge as currently no commonly accepted RE process exits that bridges the gap between these two disciplines. This results in unclear mappings and finally makes it difficult to align methods that exist in both areas. To tackle this challenge, we propose a reference issue model that aims to capture definitions and relations of the issues that are typically relevant in BIS development. In this context, we describe our followed research approach, an underlying meta-model as well as an exemplary instantiation and usage of the reference issue model. This contribution shall serve as a foundation for the integration of RE and business analysis as well as for the development of corresponding analysis approaches."
pub.1153242374,From Founder Identity to Family Business Group (FBG) Meta-Identity: Identity Development in the Journey from a Founder’s Firm to an Entrepreneurial Family with a Portfolio of Businesses,"Identity is a socially constructed phenomenon that emerges from the contemplation of commonly asked questions of who we are and where we belong that defines behavioral expectations. Identity—individual and collective—is especially important for entrepreneurial families because they identify strongly with their businesses, while their businesses’ strong organizational identity reflects the family’s identity. Yet, as family and business systems’ complexity increase, identities need to evolve. Using theoretical underpinnings of identity, social identity, and organizational identity, we propose a theoretical model of identity development in FBG. It shows the dynamic evolution of the firm founder’s individual owner identity through a family-owners collective identity towards FBG meta-identity that encompasses the legacy business and other assets in the business portfolio. This process, often triggered by external stakeholders’ expectations, includes identity conflicts and identity negotiations. We illustrate the proposed model with a case study of the Pentland Group."
pub.1093826985,REA-XML: An unambiguous language for REA business models,"Conceptual languages to describe business models - not business process models - become increasingly important. One of the most expressive approaches towards business models is the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology. REA has a substantial back-up in economic and accounting theory, but did lack a dedicated representation language for many years. Recently, we have introduced a domain specific modeling language including a REA meta model and a pertinent graphical notation. In this paper we build upon our previous work, but aim for a representation language that is able to serve as a serialization syntax also for other REA modeling approaches using UML class diagrams or OWL, etc. As a result we come up with REA-XML, an XML schema that allows a precise, tool-independent representation of REA models and that may also serve as an REA model exchange language between different tools."
pub.1092851711,Domain Model Definition for Domain-Specific Rule Generation Using Variability Model,"The business environment is rapidly undergoing changes, and they need a prompt adaptation to the enterprise business systems. The process models have abstract behaviors that can apply to diverse conditions. For allowing to reuse a single process model, the configuration and customisation features can support the design improvisation. However, most of the process models are rigid and hard coded. The current proposal for automatic code generation is not devised to cope with rapid integration of the changes in business coordination. Domain-specific Rules (DSRs) constitute to be the key element for domain specific enterprise application, allowing changes in configuration and managing the domain constraint with-in the domain. In this paper, the key contribution is conceptualisation of the do-main model, domain model language definition and specification of domain model syntax as a source visual modelling language to translate into domain specific code. It is an input or source for generating the target language which is do-main-specific rule language (DSRL). It can be applied to adapt to a process constraint configuration to fulfil the domain-specific needs."

pub.1033501911,A Unified RGPS-Based Approach Supporting Service-Oriented Process Customization,"Software as a Service (SaaS) aims to provide utility-oriented software delivery and provisioning. While software being published as reusable Web APIs, users can quickly compose multiple services into a new value-added process: a mashup. However, various users may have different requirements, thus preferring to compose the same set of services in different ways. Therefore, there is a need to provide a unified way for users to configure and compose services. RGPS (Role, Goal, Process, and Service) is an ongoing ISO-standard meta-model framework for describing service usage requirements. This chapter presents an approach of leveraging RGPS to help users configure a personalized service-based mashup. Based on users’ requirements, a hierarchical goal tree is generated for users to further refine their business goals. According to mappings between goals and variation points in business process templates, a personalized business process will be created. One task in a business process may be realized by an external service. Corresponding visualization tools are introduced to assist users. This chapter also describes a case study of customizing a mashup over an established service supermarket."
pub.1095307308,A knowledge-based adaptive collaborative work system implementation framework,"In collaborative environment, to complete a business often needs cross-organizational cooperation. Traditional workflow modeling methods cannot express this kind of cooperation completely. Furthermore, current workflow systems lack adaptability and flexibility. Firstly, this paper made use of the basic cooperative unit and virtual cooperative unit to model cooperation within one organization or among organizations. Then, it used knowledge related to them to express the cooperation. After that, a collaborative process based on cooperative units meta-model was proposed. On the basis of the meta-model, a knowledge-based adaptive collaborative work system implementation framework was designed. In this framework, knowledge management for cooperative units was involved, which give collaborative process better adaptability and flexibility."

Verifying compliance of complex and flexible processes becomes therefore a fundamental requirement. We propose a framework for performing compliance checking of process execution traces w.r.t. expressive reactive business rules, tailored to the MXML meta-model. Rules are mapped to Logic Programming, using Prolog to classify execution traces as compliant/non-compliant. We show how different rule templates, inspired by the ConDec language, can be easily specified and then customized in the context of a real industrial case study. We finally describe how the proposed language and its underlying a-posteriori reasoning technique have been concretely implemented as a ProM analysis plug-in."
pub.1041646525,A Meta-Modeling Approach to Designing e-Warehousing Systems,"A business application that leverages the Internet for selling products and services or for information dissemination is called an e-business solution. In the past few years, organizations have moved aggressively towards deploying e-business solutions to improve process efficiencies, be competitive, access new markets, increase market share, reduce costs and satisfy an array of other business drivers. Within the domain of e-business initiatives, particular emphasis has been provided on e-warehousing initiatives. The differentiating facet of e-warehousing initiatives is that they are high-impact solutions that affect various parts of the organization, and ultimately the business goals of the enterprise, by providing relevant decision-making information at the manager's desktop, irrespective of geographic location. Despite this, many of these initiatives are technology based and have lacked strategic level sponsorship, leading to compromised results. Development of e-warehousing systems should be viewed as a strategic business initiative with distinctly different business models and processes. Traditional design approaches alone are not suited to such strategic initiatives. E-warehousing initiatives require new models for design in the early stages of development. In the later stages, traditional design approaches are applicable. In this article, we propose a meta-modeling approach for e-warehousing initiatives. The model has four components: developing business goals and strategies, defining functional business processes, developing an e-warehousing integration architecture, and designing metrics for evaluating the performance of the e-warehousing initiative. This model is illustrated by using an e-warehousing initiative for a government agency."
pub.1095595894,Verifying GSM-based Business Artifacts,Business artifacts allow to manage operations of business processes by capturing the key concepts and relevant information to guide their work flow. The Guard-StageMilestone (GSM) meta-model is a novel formalism for designing business artifacts that features declarative description of the intended behaviour without requiring an explicit specification of the control flow. Its concept of hierarchical structures of stages and explicit rules for the fulfilment of their guards and milestones supports the designing process but poses a challenge for formal verification. We show here how to approach the verification problem by developing a symbolic representation amenable to model checking. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by presenting a case study on the direct verification of a GSM model using a tool implementation.

pub.1050872661,Enabling Ad-hoc Business Process Adaptations through Event-Driven Task Decoupling,"The ability to adapt running process instances is a key requirement to handle exceptions in service orchestrations. The design of the orchestration middleware and its underlying meta-model plays an important role to fulfill this requirement. However, current service orchestration middleware such as BPEL engines suffer from their imperative and tightly coupled task execution mechanisms making it difficult to adapt running process instances. In this paper we present a novel service orchestration middleware and its underlying meta-model to overcome this limitation. To achieve this, we combine the benefits of the models@runtime concept with the event-driven publish-subscribe mechanism. We evaluate our approach for its support to process instance adaptation and compare its performance to an existing orchestration runtime."

As the core of ITSM, IT Service Support ensures that the customer has appropriate services to support business function. Therefore, many organizations adopt best practices and tools in order to import IT Service Support normative and efficiency, and IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) has been the international de facto standard. However, current standards and tools are not enough to provide precise, abstract and systematic IT Service Support concepts. Furthermore, process model integration, reuse and exchange still remains a challenge in IT Service Support process development area. In this context, an ITIL-based IT Service Support Process metamodel was presented in this paper. The metamodel extends Business Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM) as an IT Service Support process is also a business process. The metamodel has characteristic of easy operation and simple structure, and it has been preliminary applied in implementation of IT Service Support Process tool. The proposed metamodel soundly support process modeling and business rule customization in the form of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)."

Due to the complexity and divergence of business processes, many challenges need to be solved when developing a business process management system (BPMS). In this paper, a system based on Cova, a meta-groupware, is proposed to support business processes. The paper shows how the functionality of Cova is extended with the new emerging Web technologies and how unstructured collaboration is supported via instant messaging, conference service and agent technology. The proposed approach can be used as a reference when improving existing systems or developing new solutions to support business processes."
pub.1142171100,BPMN2EVENTB Supporting Transformation from BPMN2.0 to Event B Using Kermeta,"Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) has acquired increasing relevance in business process modeling. However, it suffers, as all semi-formal languages, from the lack of rigorous semantic which hinder its full adoption and makes impossible the verification of relevant properties. In this paper, a model-driven approach for the verification of BPMN2.0 models using the Event B method is proposed. When the complexity of the target system increases, the traceability of Event B model elements back to the original BPMN model becomes a tedious task and failures to verify properties can be difficult to understand. For this reason, the proposed approach is adapted to keep trace of the transformation process in the format of a serialized file. It is automated through mapping rules implemented in a first prototype tool called BPMN2EVENTB."

                    Purpose
                    – The purpose of this paper is to propose a representation scheme based on the i* strategic actor model to represent the process owner information and show how to incorporate this approach into the event driven process chain and Business Process Modeling Notation-BPMN meta-models and also into the aspect-oriented business process modeling (BPM) context.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    – The authors use a case study in a real setting to evaluate the proposal and a controlled experiment to get more evidence about its relevance.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    – The authors presented evidence both from a case study in a real-world library showing the importance of representing – previously unavailable – process owner information, and from an experiment which involved participants analyzing the same models of the case study, confirming the preliminary evidences. It is important to stress the recognition that the proposed representation provided more transparency, in terms of ownership, than the usual BPM models. These benefits are due to the combination of the aspect-oriented approach and the strategic actor model, providing ownership information in a more transparent way.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    – The authors not only argue the importance of clearly established process ownership, both of the core process and the aspectual process, but also the authors presented an approach to represent the actor involved in process and aspect ownership as an instantiation of the i* strategic actor. Using this approach, the process owner can be defined in terms of actors instead of the activities performed. It is also possible to define the aspect owner and to include the aspectual process concept in the business process model.

pub.1131308857,ФОРМУВАННЯ МЕРЕЖЕВОЇ БІЗНЕС-МОДЕЛІ В ПРОЦЕСІ ІНТЕГРОВАНОГО РОЗВИТКУ ПІДПРИЄМСТВА,"The purpose of the current research is formation of the methodical approach for definition of optimum network business model of the enterprise taking into account possibilities of its integrated functioning. Essential filling of network business model is defined. Network business models are identified in accordance with their features. The developed classification of business models can be updated, supplemented and transformed with participation of new models. The choice of business model is considered as a strategic decision, which requires an adequate methodological basis and automation in the context of the functional module of intelligent systems to support strategic decision-making. The substantiation of a certain management decision is proposed to be considered as an engineering process. It is determined that key competencies and innovative potential of the enterprise are the main factors in the choice of network business model. Factors that hinder the implementation of the selected business model, which are determined at an early stage before making a management decision, have an impact in the form of risks. The structure of components of the network business model in the process of enterprise integrated development is formed and the methodology of its formation is justified. The proposed economic and mathematical model can be used to create an intellectual system designed for integrated development of network enterprises. The approach to business model identification is based on the similarity theory, which is widely used in data analysis systems, but in contrast to these systems, decision-making in the process of integration is not based on combinatorial methods, and is implemented through the production model. Features of this method are the use of meta-ontological classification templates, quality characteristics for evaluation and rules of fuzzy logic. The offered methodical approach allows to choose optimum network business model taking into account possibilities of integrated enterprise development. The proposed intelligent decision support tools are designed to implement effective strategic planning, support flexible organizational and economic mechanisms and optimal business process management."
pub.1093581905,Modeling Contextualized Flexible Cloud Workflow Services: An MDE Based Approach,"The evolution of the economy, competition, development of new technologies and globalization explain the blooming of inter-organizations cooperation. The inter-organizations cooperation represents a new opportunity to answer to complex challenges that a single organization can't face alone. Cloud Computing is an emerging computation paradigm in information technology and networking. Most recently business applications are leveraging the power of this novel technology. In this work, we are interested in the issue of Inter-organizations Cooperation in Cloud Computing environment. More precisely, this paper deals with Contextualized Flexible Cloud Workflow Services (CWS). By CWS, we mean services automating loosely coupled fragments of inter-organization business processes and whose description and execution are accessible through the Cloud. One possible way to deal with CWS modeling in a comprehensive conceptual framework is to use the Model-Driven Engineering. The basic principle of MDE is the separation of organizational concerns from their technical achievement. Therefore, business models are not corrupted by technical concerns and vice versa. Following this practice, we first propose the Cloud Workflow Service Meta-Model (CWS2M) by extending BPMN 2.0 to support the modeling of CWS. In order to deal with variability, evolution and adaptation of CWS, we also propose the Flexible Cloud Workflow Service Meta-Model (FCWS2M) as an extension of the CWS2M meta-model using the versioning technique. Finally, we propose the Contextualized Flexible Cloud Workflow Service Meta-Model (CFCWS2M) to characterize the situations in which CWS versions are executed. We illustrate our solution through the “Drug Development Process” case study."

pub.1104450931,"Business process runtime models: towards bridging the gap between design, enactment, and evaluation of business processes","Business process management (BPM) broadly covers a lifecycle of four distinct phases: design, configuration, enactment, and analysis and evaluation. Most BPM tool suites impose a strict separation between these phases, i.e., in each phase different languages and tools are used and the transition between phases is indirect and costly. This paper presents an environment for integrating all phases of the BPM lifecycle in which business process (BP) types and their instances can be modeled, visualized, managed and automatically synchronized, using a shared representation of models and code. The environment extends the capabilities of BP models to be used not only for specifying BPs but also for: (1) enactment—creating instance objects that capture BP operational data; (2) monitoring BP instances as they progress; (3) visualizing performance indicators of executed BPs at runtime; and (4) navigating from a BP type model to its respective instance population. As opposed to existing tools, the proposed environment does not require regenerating the workflow schema when BP designs change, nor does it require additional adaptations to support monitoring. Thereby, we facilitate a continuous and dynamic BPM environment, where workflow specifications can be changed at runtime. Our solution integrates a meta-programming language called eXecutable Modeling Facility (XMF) and the multi-perspective enterprise modeling framework (MEMO)."
pub.1149727624,A Process Warehouse for Process Variants Analysis,"Process model variants are collections of similar process models evolved over time because of the adjustments that were made to a particular process in a given domain, e.g., order-to-cash or procure-to-pay process in reseller or procurement domain. These adjustments produce some variations between these process models that mainly should be identical but may differ slightly. Existing approaches related to data warehouse solutions suffer from adequately abstracting and consolidating all variants into one generic process model, to provide the possibility to distinguish and compare among different parts of different variants. This shortcoming affects decision making of business analysts for a specific process context. This paper addresses the above shortcoming by proposing a framework to analyse process variants.The framework consists of two original contributions: (i) a novel meta-model of processes as a generic data model to capture and consolidate process variants into a reference process model; (ii) a process warehouse model to perform typical online analytical processing operations on different variation parts thus providing support to decision-making through KPIs; The framework concepts were defined and validated using a real-life case study."
pub.1035846516,Perspectives for Moving Business Processes into the Cloud,"Moving business processes into the cloud means that the business processes are no longer supported on premise but using a set of cloud services. Cloud services allow to highly reduce upfront investments, change to a “pay-as-you-grow” model and to flexibly react to changes in demand. However, to leverage the benefits of cloud services it is necessary to appropriately integrate the definition of cloud services into business process models. Therefore, three perspectives for defining cloud services are introduced. The functional perspective describes clouds services as the exchange of sub-services between service provider and consumer. The non-functional perspective describes cross-cutting, quality oriented properties of the cloud services. Meta-services as third perspective are used to capture functionality beyond the standard operation of a service, e.g. in the case of service failure."
pub.1019095087,A family of case studies on business process mining using MARBLE,"Business processes, most of which are automated by information systems, have become a key asset in organizations. Unfortunately, uncontrolled maintenance implies that information systems age overtime until they need to be modernized. During software modernization, ageing systems cannot be entirely discarded because they gradually embed meaningful business knowledge, which is not present in any other artifact. This paper presents a technique for recovering business processes from legacy systems in order to preserve that knowledge. The technique statically analyzes source code and generates a code model, which is later transformed by pattern matching into a business process model. This technique has been validated over a two-year period in several industrial modernization projects. This paper reports the results of a family of case studies that were performed to empirically validate the technique using analysis and meta-analysis techniques. The family of case studies demonstrates that the technique is feasible in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."

The dynamic nature of this domain presents a complex problem for potential software agent-based approaches that support this cross-organizational integration. Currently, there are few studies that measure the impact of the dynamic environmental effects on service composition. On an on-going basis, composite services or workflow processes of web services may be constantly changing in terms of responsiveness of services, accessibility of services and their meta-information, business process schema changes, etc. This paper describes an approach, model, and supporting software toward the efficient formation of agent teams and interaction protocols for business process orchestration in response to certain environmental conditions."
pub.1022248571,An Engineering Approach to Develop Business Networks,"In order to attain Business Networking goals, such as the simple and fast exchange of transactions, increased customer care or reduced inventories, business partners have to be convinced about new ideas, new business processes among them and new (information) systems. For implementation to be successful, a variety of decisions will have to be taken concerning strategy, process and systems. Business Networking projects require a methodical approach completely different from that of traditional ERP implementations. The proposed method therefore guides managers in designing and implementing cooperation-intensive business networks. It covers aspects from strategy to implementation and follows the principles of method engineering. The ‘Woodbridge’ -Cases illustrates the method in practice."

Activities such as business knowledge acquisition, business process modeling, performance, quality and impact analysis can all be done more effectively if supported by proper tools. In this paper, we describe a design scenario for business understanding and re-engineering tools that is based on the systematic modeling of business knowledge. The business knowledge model forms a conceptual schema for the tool repository. We start by building a generic business model. As both the model and required tool characteristics vary from company to company and from one business re-engineering project to another, we customize the generic model and tools to reflect needs of a given company and a business re-engineering project in hand. We achieve a required level of tool flexibility by applying meta-CASE techniques. The physical repository schema and tools themselves are automatically generated from the customized business model specifications. In this paper, we focus on tools and analysis methods that have not been extensively described in other sources. We describe an interview assistant tool, support for impact analysis, and an end-user query language in which a user can define new business analysis methods that are not supported by a generic tool environment."
pub.1125161157,An approach to measuring business-IT alignment maturity via DoDAF2.0,"Measuring the business-IT alignment (BITA) of an organization determines its alignment level, provides directions for further improvements, and consequently promotes the organizational performances. Due to the capabilities of enterprise architecture (EA) in interrelating different business/IT viewpoints and elements, the development of EA is superior to support BITA measurement. Extant BITA measurement literature is sparse when it concerns EA. The literature tends to explain how EA viewpoints or models correlate with BITA, without discussing where to collect and integrate EA data. To address this gap, this paper attempts to propose a specific BITA measurement process through associating a BITA maturity model with a famous EA framework: DoD Architectural Framework 2.0 (DoDAF2.0). The BITA metrics in the maturity model are connected to the meta-models and models of DoDAF2.0. An illustrative ArchiSurance case is conducted to explain the measurement process. Systematically, this paper explores the process of BITA measurement from the viewpoint of EA, which helps to collect the measurement data in an organized way and analyzes the BITA level in the phase of architecture development."

pub.1062983790,MODEL FOR INTEGRATED MONITORING OF BPEL BUSINESS PROCESSES,"Business process execution language (BPEL) does not provide a native support for defining data and metrics, required to perform business activity monitoring (BAM). Existing industry solutions are vendor-specific while platform-independent scientific approaches separate tightly coupled monitoring definitions from the core BPEL processes into external descriptors, thus increasing the complexity of the development, packaging and deployment processes. Furthermore, existing monitoring solutions reuse platform-specific audit trail events. This requires monitor model developers to be familiar with the details of the process implementation and the custom BPEL engine meta-model. To overcome these issues, this paper presents bpelx4bam — a new approach to defining monitoring data and metrics within BPEL processes, based on BPEL extensions. The bpelx4bam promotes these definitions into the first class citizens of the BPEL specification in order to unify and fully integrate BAM into the BPM lifecycle. It enables a cross-platform migration of BAM-enabled business processes, removes the need for separate models and specifications, eases development, packaging and deployment processes, aligns the separation of concerns with actual process roles and introduces BAM-specific and optimized events. Therefore, it presents a solid ground for a future specification or a standard in this area."
pub.1001132050,Towards an Inter-organizational Collaboration Network Characterization,"Nowadays in the international trade, there are many aspects that influence the interactive relationships between several types of organizations. Modeling such kinds of organizational interactions needs the consideration of a maximum of concepts related to the inter-organizational collaboration in general, in order to cover any kind and any case of collaboration. For this purpose, we present in this paper an inter organizational collaboration Meta Model dedicated to the generation of a knowledge-based used for inter organizational collaborative process modeling. The purpose is to build an inter-organizational collaboration Meta-model which covers the majority of the aspects and the concepts related to the inter-organizational collaboration, found in the literature. At this level it’s necessary to identify and extract the objectives and knowledge about the collaboration environment. These knowledge can be acquired from many different sources in many different ways such as interview, conversation, software, documentation, experiences, professional social web, etc. This knowledge acquisition is done to define the collaboration Meta-Model. At the end of this paper we are going to present the instantiation of our meta-model through a case study."
pub.1004920873,Role and Rights Management,"Role and rights management of today’s IT landscape is a challenging task that causes problems concerning the redundancy of organizational knowledge. This knowledge is the basis for specifying access rights and task assignment. As a consequence, the widespread technological methods are prone to inconsistencies on organizational changes, such as employees leaving, joining or moving within the organization. For this purpose, an approach is needed that offers both a comprehensive organizational meta-model and a declarative organization query language. The central meta-model helps to partially overcome the redundancy problem. In conjunction with the organization query language, the problems caused by redundancy is minimized. A query language expression describes formally characteristics of agents that are assigned to access rights, or tasks. Accordingly, this new approach uses a descriptive approach instead of total enumeration as required by other approaches. Thus, query expressions stay unmodified even if the organization changes."
pub.1173585236,A Meta-Model-Driven Approach to Support Digitization Evolution with Maturity Models,"Digitization makes knowledge and information a centerpiece since these connect all dimensions affected by innovation, i.e., people, processes, organization, business, and technology. Maturity Models (MMs) support managers in this evolution. The paper provides a theoretical formalization of MMs to give a practical knowledge contribution to increasing the intensiveness of information in enterprises, through digitization evolution. The paper reviews the main MMs, and presents their state of the art. Then, it defines a backbone structure common to MMs to abstract and describe their features by a meta-model. The new meta-model-driven approach guides companies in the selection of MMs, and in designing a new MM, where needed. The meta-model formalizes the two-levels inputs, the process, and the output to align the company’s motivations with the MM features, resulting in the definition of an appropriate MM for organizations. A qualitative exploratory case study shows the approach and its results, providing guidelines for future actions."

However, the process of building data mining models and transforming results of models execution into useful business knowledge is a complex process that is a result of a synthesis of the knowledge of a group of experts. This process is mostly intuitive and requires development of new scientific methods. Systemic synthesis might be one of the driving forces of such development.

The service compatibility checking algorithm based on the Mediation model, which can provide multi-level service checking compatibility, and realize the goal of Service Cooperation or the demand of Value-Added Services. Based on BPMN specification, a task modeling and management tool was proposed to support the service components for assembly component. It supports both Web service automatic retrieval and service content analysis based on QoS information, and the task execution model between the BPMN specification task descriptions was transformed into the BPEL specification task description model. Finally, a model transformation strategy based on meta-model mapping was put forward. The algorithm was designed and examples were given to demonstrate the efficiency of 3D Printing WS-BPEL."
pub.1094927896,The design of a domain-specified visualization modeling language for warfare simulation based on meta-model,"According to the theory of MDA, the domain meta-models for the Warfare Simulation System (WSS) are derived from the basic concepts and elements in the warfare simulation domain. Basing on these domain meta-models, a visualization domain-specified modeling language MT-CSML and its matching modeling toolkit CSMLDev are presented to diminish the negative influences of factors which exist in the traditional modeling process. The CSMLDev toolkit has four perspectives, which can give a detailed unified description about the static and dynamic features of the WSS. With MT-CSML and its modeling toolkit's help, the modeling engineers can focus on the key business logic derived from the warfare domain knowledge and establish the components, entities and interaction relationships of the WSM conveniently. MT-CSML's model is stored in readable XML format and the meta-models are compatible with MOF and BOM, which makes the further processing, transformation and extension possible. It is concluded from the practice that the MT-CSML is an intuitive visualization domain-specified modeling language, which has the multi-perspective describing capability to enable fewer cognitive-bias and more productivity in the domain modeling process."

pub.1024112517,On the Systematic Development of Domain-Specific Mashup Tools for End Users,"The recent emergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end user development, i.e., on enabling end-users without programming skills to compose their own applications. Yet, similar to what happened with analogous promises in web service composition and business process management, research has mostly focused on technology and, as a consequence, has failed its objective. In this paper, we propose a domain-specific approach to mashups that is aware of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is comfortable with. We show what developing a domain-specific mashup tool means, which role the mashup meta-model and the domain model play and how these can be merged into a domain-specific mashup meta-model. We exemplify the approach by implementing a mashup tool for a specific domain (research evaluation) and describe the respective user study. The results of the user study confirm that domain-specific mashup tools indeed lower the entry barrier to mashup development."

However, there is still a need for application systems to be implemented for support of daily business operations. However, these systems may be developed or acquired at different times from different vendors, and thus may be incompatible with each other. Because of this, a number of standards and technologies have been addressed to draw an integral vision in the field of enterprise application integration (EAI).Emerging Web Services has now promised enterprises that they can deploy new digital services faster than ever before by integrating the existing application systems. By integrating in this fashion, operational processes of heterogeneous systems are seamlessly controlled and integrated through a meta-processes. This integration could preserve the autonomy of original systems, as well as enhance the flexibility and agility of the business. The researchers who constructed this study have attempted to explore in detail the design of these meta-processes. Also the researchers have proposed a conflict detecting mechanism (CDM) in order to aid process designers. A prototype with a case study has been developed to evaluate the feasibility of the CDM, and the results show that it is useful in guiding process designers to correct and improve their designed meta-processes."
pub.1035957360,Case handling: a new paradigm for business process support,"Case handling is a new paradigm for supporting flexible and knowledge intensive business processes. It is strongly based on data as the typical product of these processes. Unlike workflow management, which uses predefined process control structures to determine what should be done during a workflow process, case handling focuses on what can be done to achieve a business goal. In case handling, the knowledge worker in charge of a particular case actively decides on how the goal of that case is reached, and the role of a case handling system is assisting rather than guiding her in doing so. In this paper, case handling is introduced as a new paradigm for supporting flexible business processes. It is motivated by comparing it to workflow management as the traditional way to support business processes. The main entities of case handling systems are identified and classified in a meta model. Finally, the basic functionality and usage of a case handling system is illustrated by an example."

What actually happened in the organization is set forth for consideration, not what people think about the organization. Therefore, it can be used in various industrial and scientific applications. This paper aims to provide information about the process mining concept, by revealing the differences with data mining, which is more commonly known in the literature, to point out the challenges in the use of BPM, to introduce the studies on this subject, to serve as a guide and to provide meta-information for researchers, scientists, software developers, etc. who are interested in the process mining."
pub.1026484828,Hybrid Enterprise Modelling: Integrating Modelling Mechanisms for Socio-Technical Systems Analysis and Design,"Nowadays, Model Driven Development (MDD) is a powerful technique for modelling complex systems and also for aligning business and information technology (IT), giving designers the ability to execute business models as they are intended to be run and behaved in the business environment. The Object Management Group (OMG) adopted many business standards into the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) environment e.g. Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), the Business Motivation Model (BMM), Business Process Modelling and Notation (BPMN) and Organisational Structure Model (OSM). These can work together to model different aspects of the enterprise at the business level. However, these models lack reasoning and dynamic simulation: there is no significant way to simulate discrete and continuous time system behaviour or to build arguments for reasoning about the design options within the OMG specifications. In this paper we propose an approach to overcoming this problem, by integrating a set of modelling tools into one single platform, taking advantage of meta-modelling techniques to integrate new tools with the OMG specifications in a model driven environment. The prospective framework should be able to tackle advanced analysis and design problems by intertwining design, reasoning and simulation to achieve a higher level of design maturity through implementing the desired scenario."
pub.1093419580,Methodological Limitations of Modeling Languages BPMN and ARIS,In this paper we briefly explain the main idea of business process management and its general importance as well as connected necessity of the unity of the technology and business perspectives. Then we discuss those general problems of modeling languages BPMN and ARIS which are important at the above mentioned business-technology border. As a basis for deriving the critical requirements for a language as well as for comparing both languages we use the “MMABP Business Process Meta-Model”. This semi-formal specification expresses the basic requirements for the modeling languages from both technical as well as business perspectives and abstracts their non essential features. It allows us to focus on just those features of the given language which are essential from both perspectives. In conclusions we summarize main findings and outline the corresponding primary fields of the future development of standards of this type.
pub.1095062962,A specialized meta-scheduler for business and applications constraints management,"The process of meta-scheduling, also called brokering, is a key feature in the architecture of typical computational Grids. Indeed, a Grid meta-scheduler - or Grid broker for short - is responsible for the load balancing work between sites which constitute the Grid. Many Grid broker projects currently exist and among them, an increasing number have reached maturity obstacles that slow down their use. On one hand, some meta-schedulers are tied to an environment or a middleware requiring users to adopt the whole infrastructure in order to use them. On another hand, some other meta-schedulers are difficult to deploy. Generally speaking, most of the Grid brokers are designed for an all-purposes use and may not fit the needs of specific usage where domain or business constraints have to be taken into account. The latter situation happened in the scope of the BEinGRID project where a business experiment in Grid technologies required handling domain specific scheduling constraints. Precisely, infrastructure and planning constraints were so strong that they required to define trade-offs. This paper describes how a lightweight, configurable and easy to deploy meta-scheduler was implemented to meet those constraints. More importantly, it is addressed how to be able to apply and to easily change business and domain specific rules while performing job scheduling and resource allocation. The resulting generic Grid broker has been applied to image rendering for architects, allowing to respect specific constraints of 3D rendering software as well as to base resource allocation on the analysis of architectural models."
pub.1121896398,Application of formal methods to modelling and analysis aspects of business process reengineering,"
                    Purpose
                    Business process (BP) reengineering is defined as reinventing BPs either structurally or technically to achieve dramatic improvements in performance. In any business process reengineering (BPR) project, process modeling is used to reason about problems found in existing (as-is) process and helps to design target (to-be) process. BP model notation is a widely accepted standard for process modeling. “Expressiveness” and “missing formal semantics” are two problems reported to its modeling practices. In existing studies, solutions to these problems are also proposed but still have certain limitations. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    In proposed methodology, a meta-model is formally defined that is composed of commonly used modeling elements and their well-formedness rules to check for syntactic and structural correctness of process models. Proposed solution also check semantics of process models and allows to compare as-is and to-be process models for gap identification which is another important aspect of BPR. To achieve the first goal, Z specification is used to provide formal specifications of modeling constructs and their rules and Z3 (an SMT solver) is used for comparisons and verifying properties.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Proposed method addresses both “expressiveness” and “missing formal semantics” of BPR models. The results of its evaluation clearly indicate that using formally specified meta-model, BPR model is syntactically and structurally correct. Moreover, formal modeling of BPs in Z3 helped to compare processes and to check control flow properties.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    Although the proposed method is tested on an example that is widely used in BPR literature, the example is only covering modeling elements which are part of the proposed subset and are reported in literature as frequently used modeling elements. A separate detailed study is required to test it on more complex systems.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    Specifying process models using Z specification and Z3 solver requires certain expertise.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    The proposed method adds value to BPR body of knowledge as it proposes a method to ensure structural and syntactic correctness of models, highlighting the importance of verifying run time properties and providing a direction toward comparing process models for gap analysis.

Therefore, reuse and more importantly, managing the ever changing business requirements, become almost impossible. Service-orientation and architecture, model-driven business development provides us a new and powerful approach to facilitate asset based industry solution design and development. To further accelerate this, this tutorial will discuss an innovative approach that take advantage of many proven best software engineering practices, from object/component based technology, meta-data driven architecture types (archetypes) that are used to model the common structural and in some cases non-structural business entities such as customer, product, payment, etc. In order to address the consequences introduced by abstracting those common elements out of the specific industry model and be able to enable easy and meta-data based transformation, we properly decompose business components/services into a multi-layered business architecture. Therefore, process/components/services can be decomposed accordingly to facilitate the decomposition and abstraction, while maintaining certain level of necessary traceability across various artifacts. In the realization phase, existing assets/operational systems will be mapped and transformed to the required business components and services to best leverage those existing valuable industry/client investments. To support such a SOA based, model and business driven development process, existing tooling, especially the necessary transformation and integration capability, needs to be significantly enhanced. This tutorial will also present some recommendation based on some recent design and implementation, and they could be used to guide future tooling alignment and integration effort across software modeling, implementation and solution products. In addition, we will present how to leverage existing internal or external assets or product offerings and the open industry reference models and standards (such as ACCORD, ebXML, ARTS/IxRetail).

This however presents a complex undertaking for workflow designers, as they have to gain sufficient knowledge and expertise of two diverse technologies in order to automate cloud-specific tasks across two different domains. Introduction of a unified orchestration platform would solve these issues, as it would deliver a common vocabulary for different types of workflow designers and would provide them with a single platform for orchestrating both business and technical activities, without having to face the integration complexities. The main objective of this paper is to provide support for cloud-specific workflows in BPMN business process engines. To achieve this objective we (1) define a meta-model for modeling cloud workflows, (2) extend BPMN 2.0.2 specification to orchestrate cloud-specific workflow activities, and (3) implement a meta-model with BPMN extensions by showing how cloud orchestration workflow elements (i.e. activities and workflow control) map onto extended BPMN elements. As a part of the evaluation we measure process size and complexity of two process models using various process metrics. The results have shown that when using our proposed BPMN extensions, the overall size and complexity of the use case process under test has been reduced by more than half on an average. We also improve the readability of BPMN process."
pub.1051142628,A Novel Hybrid Engineering Methodology to Enhance Collaboration During the Design and Development of Meta Product Services,"Since the Product-Service System (PSS) is accompanied by a paradigm shift towards the sustainability of the production process, it demands an advanced level of collaboration throughout the design and development process. This poses new challenges to enhance collaboration among cross-sectional, multi-disciplinary design teams in order to incorporate a variety of interdisciplinary services in a complex service-oriented system. Therefore, a new collaboration methodology is needed to reduce barriers to collaboration in a cross- organizational structure domain. This research work aims at highlighting the collaboration challenges that Meta-Product design teams face and also proposes a novel methodology to enhance collaboration among multi-disciplinary teams. The proposed methodology is a hybrid engineering model designed by integrating an Information Delivery Manual approach with a traditional software development process along with three interlinked collaboration services."
pub.1007817905,A Reference Methodology for Conducting Ontological Analyses,"The ontological analysis of conceptual modelling techniques is of increasing popularity. Related research did not only explore the ontological deficiencies of classical techniques such as ER or UML, but also business process modelling techniques such as ARIS or even Web services standards such as BPEL4WS. While the selected ontologies are reasonably mature, it is the actual process of an ontological analysis that still lacks rigor. The current procedure leaves significant room for individual interpretations and is one reason for criticism of the entire ontological analysis. This paper proposes a procedural model for the ontological analysis based on the use of meta models, the involvement of more than one coder and metrics. This model is explained with examples from various ontological analyses."
pub.1111519298,Alignment of Business Processes and Requirements Through Model Integration,"Business process and requirement specification are crucial phases in the software development process. Yet, business and requirement modeling are often carried out separately by different languages and design teams, leading to misaligned models. The degree of misalignment grows continuously with their independent evolution. Thus, the potential of model-driven software development cannot be fully exploited. There is a considerable agreement among researchers about the integration technique roles to bridge the gap between heterogeneous models. Therefore, this approach is based on this technique to align the business world represented by BPMN and the software requirement world represented by the UML use case. We define an integrated meta-model that incorporates all BPMN and use case elements as well as new others to map traceable elements. Further, we define a new diagram that provides a means to visualize and combines their use within an integrated model. Our approach supplements CASE tools with additional information and relationships to maintain the global system consistency. To illustrate it, we implement an editor for designing the proposed diagram, and we apply it in a topical case study."
pub.1000688822,A Meta Ontology for Organizations,"The research reported upon in this paper aims at developing a meta ontology for organizations, i.e. a schema for devising the ontology of a particular organization or a reference ontology for a class of organizations. The prospect of such a meta ontology is provided by the Ψ-theory that underlies the DEMO methodology. General requirements regarding such a meta ontology are stated. The proposed meta ontology satisfies all of them. It has the added advantage that there are socionomic laws at its core; this reinforces the ontological quality. It has been applied in several health care cases in practice, out of which a reference model for health care organizations has arisen."
pub.1095337731,Introducing Software Process Tailoring to BPMN: BPMNt,"BPMN 2.0 is a widely used notation to model business process that has associated tools and techniques to facilitate process management, execution and monitoring. As a result using BPMN to model Software Development Process (SDP) can leverage on the BPMN's infrastructure to improve SDP quality. Nevertheless, when using BPMN to model Software Processes one can observe the lack of an important feature: means to represent process tailoring. This article introduces the BPMNt, a conservative extension to BPMN that aims at aggregating a tailoring representation mechanism as the one found at SPEM 2.0. BPMNt uses the extensibility classes already present in the BPMN meta-model. Our work also presents an example to illustrate the approach."
pub.1093324821,The use of a meta-model to support multi-project process measurement,"In today's environment, software companies are engaged in multiple projects delivered on heterogeneous platforms for a wide class of applications in disparate application domains. They are increasingly engaged in the co-development of software systems through joint software development projects including staff from partners and customers as well as their own. As a result, they must support multiple software development processes while trying to guarantee uniform levels of process enactment, and product quality across all projects. Our approach is capable of providing process measurement in a joint-project, multi-process model business environment. It is based on a simple meta-model for computing across-process, multiple-project metrics designed to permit monitoring of CMMI compliance. The open source tool Spago4Q has been developed to support our approach and is capable of producing the measurements needed for monitoring of a set of large-scale development projects using different process models, in a real industrial setting in Europe. The results support the view that that it will not always be possible to aggregate the same set of metrics across disparate process models."

pub.1172790874,Social Media Initiatives through IoT to Link the Bridge between Industrial Demands with Higher Education Millennial Students through Experience Learning,"Despite recent improvements in e-Learning, additional work is necessary to enhance learning for everyone and fill the research gap in the artefacts that are now available. E-learning artefacts have limitations: First, they lack adaptability variants, since they only suggest communities, peers, or e-learning. Second, they often prioritize technology over e-learning theory and pedagogy. Finally, their focus on e-learning activities rather than processes prevents them from fully capturing the experience. The goal of this project is to improve the e-learning experience by examining the efficacy of combining three cutting-edge technologies (Business Process Modeling and Enactment, Semantics, and Service Oriented Computing) with learning methodology. The HeLPS e-Learning Framework, a hybrid process-based, semantically enhanced, and service-oriented framework, was created as a result of this research. A general e-learning process was developed bottom-up in this framework by evaluating a variety of e-learning models (practical artefacts) and related pedagogies/concepts (theories). An e-Learning Meta-Model captures the domain’s semantics and procedures. The e-Learning Meta-Model, which uses Semantic Web Rule Language to encapsulate domain rules, is a third major addition. Service-Orientation is promoted by creating a semantically enriched approach to recognize and locate online services from e-learning business process models."
pub.1155617502,Matching business process behavior with encoding techniques via meta-learning: An anomaly detection study,"Recording anomalous traces in business processes diminishes an event log?s quality. The abnormalities may represent bad execution, security issues, or deviant behavior. Focusing on mitigating this phenomenon, organizations spend efforts to detect anomalous traces in their business processes to save resources and improve process execution. However, in many real-world environments, reference models are unavailable, requiring expert assistance and increasing costs. The considerable number of techniques and reduced availability of experts pose an additional challenge for particular scenarios. In this work, we combine the representational power of encoding with a Meta-learning strategy to enhance the detection of anomalous traces in event logs towards fitting the best discriminative capability between common and irregular traces. Our approach creates an event log profile and recommends the most suitable encoding technique to increase the anomaly detection performance. We used eight encoding techniques from different families, 80 log descriptors, 168 event logs, and six anomaly types for experiments. Results indicate that event log characteristics influence the representational capability of encodings. Moreover, we investigate the process behavior?s influence for choosing the suitable encoding technique, demonstrating that traditional process mining analysis can be leveraged when matched with intelligent decision support approaches."
pub.1030408813,An overview of the knowledge discovery meta-model,"Modernization of existing software systems is expensive and not always successive process that involves many challenging activities. In order to support these activities, the Object Management Group within the Architecture-Driven Modernization initiative proposes a number of standard representations of views on existing software systems. The Knowledge Discovery Meta-model plays the fundamental role in this set of representations as it defines common concepts of software assets and their operational environments. This paper addresses issues related to the extraction of knowledge from the software assets and the representation according to the Knowledge Discovery Meta-model in order to abstract the business logic implemented in the system. It observes that although this meta-model minimizes the effort required to obtain representation, it has several drawbacks that limits its capability to express domain specific knowledge. It is believed that this paper will enable researchers and practitioners to get a better understanding of this kind of representation, prepare for the modernization activities, and provide a basis for the further research."
pub.1095408136,MFI Based Interoperability Measurement of Business Models in Service-based Enterprises,"Various business models of service-based enterprise exist and are currently used in industry, whilst their definitions, structures, functions, and supporting tools are quite different from each other. For interoperability, the partial semantic interoperability between heterogeneous business models is challenging to achieve. Almost all of the enterprise business models can be described from the four major dimensions: Role, Goal, Process, Service (RGPS), consequently in this paper, a business model of service-based enterprise is actually a specific RGPS model, an approach for measuring the interoperability of RGPS models is proposed. At first, the RGPS interoperability features framework is constructed based on Meta-model Framework of Interoperability (MFI), and it is specified to be the interoperability features set of RGPS models; secondly, the interoperability features set and a mathematical method are proposed to identify and quantify a RGPS model and its interoperability features, then the model instance of the RGPS model is produced; next, we calculate the similarity between two model instances, and obtain the measuring results of interoperability between corresponding RGPS models, which is used to build the interoperability measurement matrix of RGPS models set."
pub.1157633466,An Enneagram Approach to Strategy,"This conceptual paper examines how Enneagram as a personality typing system could be adopted as a meta-model across multiple domains. The enneagram strategy is a structural typology that many organisations and individuals use to effectively understand their business profiles and interpersonal patterns, despite scholars showing concerns about its robustness and dynamism. This paper extends the argument as to how the mechanics of the Enneagram are intrinsically interrelated with (a) organisational systems and networks, (b) organisational grammar, (c) supply chains, and (d) creativity. It also emphasizes the importance/close association of the Enneagram tool with interdependence, business model, networks, statics, and system dynamics. The paper uses a combination of research methods (theoretical, exploratory, and descriptive) to evaluate the adaptability of the enneagram. The findings demonstrate that enneagram as a strategy could be applied to various business phenomena but requires more cross-domain empirical research. The enneagram can also be used to develop meta-models/toy models that can relate to the organisational outcomes by integrating tangible and intangible process assets. This paper reliably lays a set of principles/foundations to launch the enneagram approach to a complex, broad, systematic, and creative scope."

pub.1035978765,Analysing Supply Chain Strategies Using Knowledge-Based Techniques,"We are experiencing a digital revolution that is rapidly changing the way business is conducted. In this new economy, information is shared speedily and many participants are collaborating. Effective and seamless collaboration between distributed supply chain members is therefore crucial. To understand how this may be done, we describe a knowledge based framework for abstracting, enriching, analysing and improving supply chain models. We employ business process modelling as a useful methodology for capturing and analysing supply chain strategies. In addition, we use a meta-interpreter and workflow engine for simulating business processes to help understand business scenarios. Its declarative approach makes business rationale more transparent. Our work is demonstrated by looking at a case study of Dell’s supply chain management that depicts its PC supply chain operation logics and strategies."
pub.1104648126,Experimenting and Assessing a Probabilistic Business Process Deviance Mining Framework Based on Ensemble Learning,"Business Process Intelligence (BPI) and Process Mining, two very active research areas of research, share a great interest towards the issue of discovering an effective Deviance Detection Model (DDM), computed via accessing log data. The DDM model allows us to understand whether novel instances of the target business process are deviant or not, thus becoming extremely useful in modern application scenarios such as cybersecurity and fraud detection. In this chapter, we further and significantly extend our previous line of work that has originated, across years, an innovative ensemble-learning framework for mining business process deviances, whose main benefit is that of introducing a sort of multi-view learning scheme. One of the most relevant achievements of this extended work consists in proposing an alternative meta-learning method for probabilistically combining the predictions of different base DDMs, and putting all together in a conceptual system architecture oriented to support common Business Process Management (BPM) scenarios. In addition to this, we here envisage the combination of this approach with a deviance explanation methodology that leverages and extends a previous method still proposed by us in previous research. Basically, the latter method allows to discover accurate and readable deviance-aware trace clusters defined in terms of descriptive rules over both properties and behavioral aspects of the traces. We complement our analytical contributions with a comprehensive experimental assessment and analysis, even in comparison with a state-of-the-art DDM discovery approach. The experimental results we derive confirm flexibility, reliability and effectiveness of the proposed business process deviance mining framework."
pub.1129683671,Adaptive and Resilient Business Architecture for the Digital Age,"The process of enterprise digitalization has become in recent years unstoppable. In the global competition, enterprises have to use all the means available in order to be able to respond to competitors’ innovations or to be able to implement innovations that would take them ahead of the competition. With the rising complexity of the used business and the information technologies, usage of enterprise architecture becomes inevitable so that the business-IT alignment is maintained. In this chapter we describe a method how to develop a resilient and adaptive minimal business architecture so that business requirements can be clearly defined, their support by the functionality of applications evaluated and the missing support resolved. The method is illustrated with the generally accepted EA standards TOGAF/ArchiMate, UML and BPMN and its benefits are discussed. We also provide the reader with a meta-model that specifies how these standards in the discussed areas match together."
pub.1027353929,Automated Resource Assignment in BPMN Models Using RACI Matrices,"Organizations need to manage the responsibility of their employees with respect to all the activities that are daily carried out within them. Process-oriented organizations need to do it, in addition, in accordance to the business processes their members participate in. However, powerful mechanisms to manage responsibility in combination with business processes are missing in current modelling notations, usually limited to indicating who is in charge of undertaking the activities. RACI matrices, on the contrary, were specifically conceived to provide responsibility management information. They enable the specification of the level of responsibility each human resource has with regard to each activity carried out in a company, ranging from the performer of the work to the resource that must approve it or receive certain notifications. In this paper, we propose the use of RACI matrices together with business process models to manage human resource responsibilities in processes. Focused on a concrete type of RACI matrices, called RASCI, we introduce a novel approach to automatically generate a BPMN model with RASCI information given a BPMN model that does not handle resources, and a RASCI matrix. The resulting model is BPMN-compliant and, thus, it is ready to be executed in existing business process management systems. With this approach, the assignment of responsibilities and the management of processes can be designed separately, while being executed together."

In order to clarify this issue, we looked at the case of Nestle Japan's Nescafe Barista and used this case as an illustration for our discussion. In other words, we are aiming to clarify how business models originating from head offices overseas are tailored to the needs and circumstances of Japan and adapted to local conditions (i.e., localized) to achieve further success, by looking at the case of Nescafe Barista, a very successful recent case of this approach. In this paper, we presented details of Nescafe Barista and discussed the following points: (1) Localization comprised two aspects: the products and the business model. (2) The local unit (Nestle Japan) adapted the business model from one based on instant coffee to one based on an appliance (the Nescafe Barista coffeemaker). (3) Localization of the business model required that characteristics of meta-national management be incorporated into a global matrix organization, and that during the localization process, the local unit be given a lot of freedom to determine not only the products it would sell, but also the business model it would employ. Specifically, the local unit needed to exercise strategic initiative and negotiate with head office on product development and other aspects of business. Furthermore, to carry out such negotiations successfully, the local managers had to be creative and capable of logically persuading head office to approve their ideas."

In service engineering, the comprehensive description of service value is a key step that helps service engineers design and develop high-quality interoperable service systems that will deliver expected values to customers and providers. In this paper, a service value metamodel is put forward from an engineering point of view. First, the objective of service value modeling is extensively analyzed. Then, the various essential aspects of service value that have significance for service system design are presented and each aspect is illustrated in detail by a set of concepts. Based on this meta-model, a multi-level service value model and the corresponding value-oriented service engineering process are briefly introduced."
pub.1100093639,makeSense: Simplifying the Integration of Wireless Sensor Networks into Business Processes,"A wide gap exists between the state of the art in developing Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) software and current practices concerning the design, execution, and maintenance of business processes. WSN software is most often developed based on low-level OS abstractions, whereas business process development leverages high-level languages and tools. This state of affairs places WSNs at the fringe of industry. The makeSense system addresses this problem by simplifying the integration of WSNs into business processes. Developers use BPMN models extended with WSN-specific constructs to specify the application behavior across both traditional business process execution environments and the WSN itself, which is to be equipped with application-specific software. We compile these models into a high-level intermediate language—also directly usable by WSN developers—and then into OS-specific deployment-ready binaries. Key to this process is the notion of meta-abstraction, which we define to capture fundamental patterns of interaction with and within the WSN. The concrete realization of meta-abstractions is application-specific; developers tailor the system configuration by selecting concrete abstractions out of the existing codebase or by providing their own. Our evaluation of makeSense shows that i) users perceive our approach as a significant advance over the state of the art, providing evidence of the increased developer productivity when using makeSense; ii) in large-scale simulations, our prototype exhibits an acceptable system overhead and good scaling properties, demonstrating the general applicability of makeSense; and, iii) our prototype—including the complete tool-chain and underlying system support—sustains a real-world deployment where estimates by domain specialists indicate the potential for drastic reductions in the total cost of ownership compared to wired and conventional WSN-based solutions."
pub.1062959503,ACTIVITY BASED CIM MODELING AND TRANSFORMATION FOR BUSINESS PROCESS SYSTEMS,"Computation-Independent Model (CIM) to capture domain requirements and the transformation from CIM to the Platform-Independent Model (PIM) are two crucial parts of the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). This paper presents an ontology-activity-based CIM modeling approach to achieve a semi-automatic transformation from CIM to PIM. It proposes that the key elements in business process modeling are activities and these should therefore form the basis in constructing the domain ontology. Aiming to provide the key description capability for the process model, it discusses the hierarchy of the model by adding an activity dimension between the object and process tiers. It also proposes a model-relevance-calculation-based method for extracting ontology activities from the process meta-models. Based on the presented model acquisition method, a decomposition approach is proposed to simplify the complexity of the transformation relationships between the CIM and PIM by introducing the concepts of ontology activities. A general framework surrounding the transformation from CIM to PIM is discussed. It uses the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to describe the ontology activity and considers the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to be the PIM."
pub.1084897077,A Capability-Driven Development Approach for Requirements and Business Process Modeling,"Requirements modeling and business process modeling are two essential activities in the earliest steps of any sound software production process. A precise conceptual alignment between them is required in order to assess that requirements are “operationalized” through an adequate set of processes. Complementary, the trip from requirements to code should benefit from using a precise model driven development connection, intended to characterize not only the involved conceptual models, but also their corresponding model transformations. Selecting the most appropriate conceptual models for specifying the different system perspective becomes a crucial task. This conceptual modeling-based solution requires to use a holistic conceptual framework to determine those modeling elements to be taken into account. Surprisingly, the link with MDD approaches to provide a rigorous link with the software components of a final software application has not been analyzed in a clear and convincing way. Exploring the notion of capability, this keynote will present a capability driven development approach together with its associated meta-model as the selected conceptual framework. Additionally, it will be shown how this framework facilitates the selection of the most appropriate method components in order to design an effective software process and in order to make feasible a sound MDD connection."

pub.1018748177,Heterogeneous Business Process Management: A Metamodel-Based Approach,"Dynamically adapting business process to changing needs, and promptly reacting to events are today key factors to maintain competitiveness in the market. Business Process Management (BPM) is focusing today more and more on a BPM in the large approach to process changes that embrace all of the specific techniques and mechanisms needed to design, enact, execute and monitor processes and process-aware information systems. A novel and promising feature of BPM in the large is the ability to store, aggregate and combine this huge and very diverse amount of data that can enable new ways of analysing current operations and can deliver new business insights. The KITE.IT Project [2] is aimed at facing such challenges in the context of the Italian aerospace industry, using and integrating Open Source tools exclusively. The project has recently deployed its initial open framework offering a robust data integration system in an open and scalable architecture. In such a context a metamodel approach was considered the very first base to design a system apt at integrating data originated from heterogeneous sources. The clear advantage that can be reached is the improvement of the speed and the effectiveness of business operations. The clear advantage, which can be reached, is the improvement of the effectiveness of business operations.

pub.1095657413,m3po: An Ontology to Relate Choreographies to Workflow Models,"External business processes (choreography models) are currently disconnected from internal processes (workflow models), which leads to synchronisation and verification problems. Connecting these by directly mapping internal to external processes requires a quadratic amount of mappings; an intermediate ontology reduces the amount of necessary mappings but is not trivial to construct due to the variety in work-flow meta-models. We introduce our multi meta-model process ontology (m3po), which is based on various existing reference models and languages from the work-flow and choreography domain. The m3po ontology relates workflow models to choreography models and allows choreography extraction from internal workflow models. An initial validation is given by translating an IBM Websphere $MQ$ Workflow model into the m3po ontology and subsequently extracting an Abstract BPEL model from the ontology."

pub.1124462048,Business model innovation by design: a review of design’s role in business model innovation,"In recent years, design research has increasingly focused on its use in the business model and innovation space. Despite this increased, little clarity exists surrounding the contribution of design in facilitating business model innovation outcomes. A literature review was conducted to answer the question: how does design contribute to business model innovation outcomes? 316 design and business model innovation (BMI) focused papers were reviewed, identifying five categories of design and BMI: functional design, outcome-based design, design as a methodology, design-logic orientation, and non-design. Reflection upon these 316 papers also highlighted a lack of repeatability and standardization amongst papers using design approaches to achieve BMI. This suggested a need to develop a clear, replicable design approach to achieving BMI outcomes in order to allow for the research field to build a consistent and rigorous evidence-base. Therefore, four meta-archetypes were identified for use as a first step toward building a consistent body of evidence for the contribution of design to BMI outcomes. The process describes the role of design in BMI processes, linking abstract and often external concepts, to tangible alternative business models – all in pursuit of better serving end-user needs and providing practitioners with replicable, transparent approaches to design and BMI."
pub.1094280347,TRANSFORMING YAWL WORKFLOW TO BPEL SKELETON,"Nowadays, a business process is presented widely in form of BPEL in order to illustrate the interaction of web services. Unfortunately, some complex business processes are not completely implemented by BPEL due to the limitation of the language. An alternative language called YAWL is lately created to support the complex patterns of business processes/workflows and to provide the well-form structural checking scheme of the patterns. However, BPEL is still famous, standardized and supported in the modeling tools. In this research, a YA WL-to-BPEL transforming procedure is proposed to encourage the alternative of using YAWL as a initial modeling language. The YAWL process/workflow patterns will be transformed into a meta-model using control flow graph. The Fold function is invoked to perform the iterative checking on both the well-structured and non well-structured process/workflow patterns. The corresponding BPEL skeleton will be finally generated."

Recently, the OMG has been working on developing a new standard for a business process management notation (BPMN). This standard development results in documents that contain the newest approved version of a standard or a standard proposal that can be amended. It is our vision that such a standard document, that also serves as a specification for BPMN modeling tool developers could benefit from a fact-based model in which the same domain knowledge is represented conceptually as a list of concept definitions (including naming conventions), a set of information structure diagrams and the constraints or business rules that govern the instances of the information structure diagrams. In this paper we will show precisely, how such a fact-based conceptual view on a standard document can be created, and we will show how a fact-based approach can improve the completeness of a specification."
pub.1122752541,Integrated Simulation of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages with Petri Net-Based Transformational Semantics,The development of domain specific models requires appropriate tool support for modeling and execution. Meta-modeling facilitates solutions for the generation of modeling tools from abstract language specifications. The Rmt approach (Renew Meta-Modeling and Transformation) applies transformational semantics using Petri net formalisms as target languages in order to produce quick results for the development of modeling techniques. The problem with transformational approaches is that the inspection of the system during execution is not possible in the original representation.We present a concept for providing simulation feedback for domain specific modeling languages (DSML) that are developed with the Rmt approach on the basis of meta-models and transformational semantics using Petri nets. Details of the application of this new approach are illustrated by some well-known constructs of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN).

The main idea is that the services provided by the business processes of an enterprise are implemented as corresponding workflow models, which can be considered to be “black-boxes ”, but can be subscribed and reused as sub-workflows by the service requestors in defining their own workflow models. The meta-model for supporting the proposed workflow modeling is given. The peer-to-peer interaction between workflow engines, the invoking of applications, and the monitoring and control of process instances can all be implemented as Web services. In order to endow this workflow management paradigm with more flexibility, multi-agent technology is used to perceive environment change, and to create adapted process definition through negotiation. Agents negotiate with KQML, but the communication is implemented with Web service model. The interfaces of the agents are defined with WSDL. KQML messages are mapped into SOAP messages."
pub.1016588227,Measuring Method Complexity of the Case Management Modeling and Notation (CMMN),"In 2014, the Object Management Group (OMG) published the Case Management Modeling and Notation (CMMN) version 1.0 specification, which is a new process modeling specification to complement its Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) specification. The declarative nature of CMMN is intended to supplement the procedural perspective of BPMN. CMMN takes a data-centric view to process modeling based on business artifacts to provide flexibility for knowledge workers, while retaining the advantages of business process management (BPM) systems. As far as the researchers are aware, this research is among the first contributions to the understanding of CMMN's method complexity in the context of other process modeling notations. We used the meta-model-based method complexity approach introduced by Rossi and Brinkkemper to evaluate the method complexity of CMMN. The results were compared with other popular process methods, including BPMN, Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity diagrams, and Event-driven Process Charts (EPC), all of which have undergone similar evaluations by other researchers. The initial results indicated that CMMN 1.0 compares favorably with BPMN 1.2."
pub.1018582879,Analytical View of Business Data: An Example,"This paper describes an example of how the Analytical View (AV) in Microsoft Business Framework (MBF) works. AV consists of three components: Design time Model Service, Business Intelligence Entity (BIE) programming model, and the runtime Intell-Drill for navigation between OLTP and OLAP data sources. Model Service transforms an “object model (transactional view)” to a “multi-dimensional model (analytical view).” It infers dimensionality from the object layer where richer metadata is stored, eliminating the guesswork that a traditional data warehousing process requires. Model Service also generates BI Entity classes that enable a consistent object oriented programming model with strong types and rich semantics for OLAP data. Intelli-Drill links together all the information in MBF using metadata, making information navigation in MBF fully discover-able."
pub.1071885060,Investigating Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering for Business Processes,"<p>Business processes are designed to execute strategies that aim at achieving organisational goals. During the last decade, several methods have been proposed that prescribe the use of goal-oriented requirements engineering techniques for supporting different business process management activities, in particular business process modelling. The integration of goal modelling and business process modelling aims at increasing the alignment between business strategies and the processes with their supporting IT systems. This new research area, which the authors call Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering for Business Processes (GORE-for-BP), is developing rapidly, but without a clear conceptualization of the focus and scope of the proposed GORE-for-BP methods. Furthermore, an overview is lacking of which methods exist and what their level of maturity is. This paper therefore presents a research review of the GORE-for-BP area, with the aim of identifying relevant methods and assessing their focus, scope, and maturity. This study used Systematic Literature Review and Method Meta-Modelling as research methods to identify and evaluate the state of the GORE-for-BP research area and to propose a research agenda for directing future research in the area. Nineteen methods were identified, which is an indication of an active research area. Although some similarities were found with respect to how goal models are transformed into business process models (or vice-versa), there is also considerable divergence in modelling languages used and the extent of coverage of typical requirements engineering and business process management lifecycle phases. Furthermore, the exploitation of requirements engineering techniques in the full business process management lifecycle is currently under researched. Also, the maturity of the methods found in terms of the formalisation of the transformation activity, the elaboration of method guidelines, and the extent to which methods are validated, can be further improved.</p>"

pub.1120492839,Trust-Aware Process Design,"Longitudinal studies point to the global erosion of trust in institutions and their business processes. As a result, the provision of trusted processes has become a new design criterion that exceeds the traditional Business Process Management (BPM) goals of time, cost, and quality, and also goes beyond security and privacy concerns. The notion of trust, however, has rarely been studied in the context of BPM. This paper initiates the conceptualization of trust in BPM by providing two new artefacts, i.e. a four-stage model for the design of trusted processes and a related meta model. Both have been derived from relevant theories and existing, general trust conceptualizations. Two exploratory case studies and secondary data have facilitated the identification of an initial set of application scenarios and trust requirements."
pub.1174003160,Managing next generation BP-x initiatives,"Past generations of BPM involved the efficient and effective management of business processes. Yet, we currently face a turning point. The technological facets of data-driven BPM add complexity to traditional BPM applications. As a result, organizations face intended and unintended technology-related changes across all business process initiatives. Using the term BP-x, we summarize the recent changes in BPM knowledge that has hitherto been fragmented across academic literature. To address the challenges of BP-x initiatives, we envision a holistic model that focuses on managing related cutting-edge technologies and BPM. Thus, we propose the operationalized BP-x management model as a valuable IT meta-artifact. We develop the model using a two-cycled Design Science Research methodology and conduct a threefold summative evaluation. The results of our study indicate that creating awareness of potentials and opportunities accelerates the process toward action and fosters new business outcomes in terms of performance and innovation. By strategically aligning BP-x endeavors, organizations promote visibility, shared understanding, and culture among stakeholders. Our model guides managers throughout the BP-x adoption journey in conjunction with organizational, managerial, and technological prerequisites."
pub.1027598635,On the Equivalence of Incremental and Fixpoint Semantics for Business Artifacts with Guard-Stage-Milestone Lifecycles,"Business artifacts (BAs, or artifacts) are used to model conceptual entities that are central to guiding the operations of a business, and whose content changes as they move through those operations. The recently introduced Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model for artifact lifecycles is declarative in nature, and allows concurrent execution of long-running (possibly human-executed) activities. Modularity is incorporated through the use of hierarchical clustering of activities. The GSM operational semantics is based on a variant of Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules, which are used to control the start and termination of individual and composite activities. This paper introduces, in an abstract setting, three different and provably equivalent formulations of the GSM operational semantics. The semantics is specified in terms of how a single external event is incorporated into the current “snapshot” (i.e. full description) of a running execution of an artifact model. The “incremental” formulation corresponds to the sequential application of the ECA-like rules in response to the event; the “fixpoint” formulation characterizes the mathematical properties of pairs of snapshots corresponding to the full impact of incorporating the event; and the “closed-form” formulation captures the fixpoint one in terms of first-order logic. The paper introduces a formally specified well-formedness condition on GSM models that guarantees the equivalence of the three formulations while permitting all of the commonly arising patterns for using GSM constructs to model business operations."

Our main objective is to develop multiplatform applications. In this sense, this paper presents an approach where an abstract user interface description is the key to achieve this purpose. A model-based environment, design patterns, interaction patterns and a meta-level structure are used in the user interface generation process. This proposal is a first step to achieve dynamic user interface generation, the next one should be link business and abstract graphical user interface model."

pub.1093752905,A Lightweight Aspect Modelling Approach for BPMN,"Aspectual Business Process Modelling is not a new concept in business process based development to support the separation of the cross cutting concerns. Most of the researchers use the concept of the heavyweight extensions of the business processes to incorporate the aspects. This requires changes in the meta-models of the languages and the tool infrastructures, which is not a feasible option. Some of the researchers also provide lightweight extensions in the form of profiles, but these are mostly incomplete and do not provide solutions for modelling some important aspectual concepts like Pointcuts effectively. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we provide a lightweight extension of the business processes expressed in BPMN to incorporate the aspect specific concepts in it. We propose a profile ABPMN which uses the existing notations of the BPMN models for expressing aspectual concepts. Further, we developed a language PCDL to express the pointcuts in an effective way. The language is implemented using XText in Eclipse. To evaluate the applicability of our approach, we applied it on a case study of the E-Bidding system."
pub.1093184567,Requirements-based development of BPMN extensions: The case of clinical pathways,"In recent years, the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has evolved to one of the most applied modelling General Purpose Languages in the Business Process Management discipline. Due to its application in different domains, it becomes frequently necessary to extend the BPMN by domain-specific concepts. Extending the BPMN fosters an adequate communication between system engineers and domain experts and enhances the semantically correct representation of the domain. Therefore, the BPMN meta-model provides an extension mechanism. However, there is a remarkable lack in procedure models for the design of such extensions. This research article outlines an extension method that focuses on domain analysis, extension requirements and the derivation of domain-specific extension concepts within BPMN. Therefore, the method of STROPPI ET AL. (2011) is extended in regard to domain analysis. The approach is motivated and demonstrated by the case of Clinical Pathways (CPs)."
pub.1140318723,Process Mining Encoding via Meta-learning for an Enhanced Anomaly Detection,"Anomalous traces diminish the event log’s quality due to bad execution or security issues, for instance. Focusing on mitigating this phenomenon, organizations spend efforts to detect anomalous traces in their business processes to save resources and improve process execution. Conformance checking techniques are usually employed in these situations. These methods rely on the comparison of the event log obtained and the designed process model. However, in many real-world environments, the log is noisy and the model unavailable, requiring more robust techniques and expert assistance to perform conformance checking. The considerable number of techniques and reduced availability of experts pose an additional challenge to detecting anomalous traces for particular event log scenarios. In this work, we combine the representational power of encoding with a Meta-learning strategy to enhance the detection of anomalous traces in event logs towards fitting the best discriminative capability between common and irregular traces. Our method extracts meta-features from an event log and recommends the most suitable encoding technique to increase the anomaly detection performance. We used three encoding techniques from different families, 80 log descriptors, 168 event logs, and six anomaly types for experiments. Results indicate that event log characteristics influence the representational capability of encodings differently. Our proposed Meta-learning method outperforms the baseline reaching an F-score of 0.73. This performance demonstrates that traditional process mining analysis can be leveraged when matched with intelligent decision support approaches."

Yet, it does not address security aspects. This paper is concerned with access control for BPEL based processes. We present an approach to integrate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and BPEL on the meta-model level. Moreover, we show that such an integration can be used to automate steps of the role engineering process. In particular, we extract RBAC models from BPEL processes and present an XSLT converter that transforms BPEL code to the XML import format of the xoRBAC software component."

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is becoming a leading paradigm for business process integration. This research work focuses on business process modeling, proposes a semantic model-driven development method named SMDA combined with the Ontology and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) technologies. The architecture of SMDA is presented in three orthogonal perspectives. (1) Vertical axis is the MDA 4 layers, the focus is UML profiles in M2 (meta-model layer) for ontology modeling, and three abstract levels: CIM, PIM and PSM modeling respectively. (2) Horizontal axis is different concerns involved in the development: Process, Application, Information, Organization, and Technology. (3) Traversal Axis is referred to aspects that have influence on other models of the cross-cutting axis: Architecture, Semantics, Aspect, and Pattern. The paper also introduces the modeling and transformation process in SMDA, and describes dynamic service composition supports briefly."
pub.1149703979,Towards a Full Model-Driven Approach for Modeling and Verifying Business Process Models Using CPN,"<p>This work addresses one of the core issues in modern enterprises applications: Business Process (BP), by proposing a new comprehensive model-driven approach for automated and formal verification of BP models. This allows BP specialists to formally and automatically verify their process models, without needing a deep knowledge of formal methods. The approach automatically converts BP models to Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) using CPN Tools for the analysis purposes. It starts with meta-modeling formalisms of BP and CPNs using Atom3 Tool. At this level, it proposes two graph grammars. The former converts BP models into their corresponding CPNs and the latter interprets the acquired CPN models in a text format based on XML. This enables model transfer from Atom3 to CPN tools by assessing the correctness of the BP model. In order to test the functional utility of our proposed approach, we applied it to several examples and the results showed that the system is working correctly and that inconsistencies are detected in BP models. One detailed example is given to illustrate our approach.</p>"
pub.1048829336,Using ontologies to capture the semantics of a (business) process for digital preservation,"IT-supported business processes and computationally intensive science (called e-science) have become increasingly ubiquitous in the last decades. Along with this trend comes the need to make at least the most important of these processes available for the long term, to allow later analysis of their execution, or even a re-execution. As such, the preservation of scientific experiments and their results enables others to reproduce and verify the results as well as build on the result of earlier work. All but the simplest processes require to be described by a multitude of information objects, as well as their interconnections and relations, to be successfully preserved. To enable a semantic description of these objects in a structured manner, we developed a formal meta-model that can be utilised in the digital preservation of a process. The meta-model describes classes of elements and their relations, in the form of ontologies, with a core ontology describing the generic concepts, and extension mechanisms to map supplementary ontologies describing more specific aspects. In this paper, we present the overall architecture and individual ontologies, and motivate their usefulness via the application to use cases from different domains."
pub.1043510979,Process Evaluation Model based on Goal-Scenario for Business Activity Monitoring,"The scope of the problems that could be solved by monitoring and the improvement of the recognition time is directly correlated to the performance of the management function of the business process. However, the current monitoring process of business activities decides whether to apply warnings or not by assuming a fixed environment and showing expressions based on the design rules. Also, warnings are applied by carrying out the measuring process when the event attribute values are inserted at every point. Therefore, there is a limit for distinguishing the range of occurrence and the level of severity in regard to the new external problems occurring in a complicated environment. Such problems cannot be ed. Also, since it is difficult to expand the range of problems which can be possibly evaluated, it is impossible to evaluate any unexpected situation which could occur in the execution period. In this paper, a process-evaluating model based on the goal scenario is suggested to provide constant services through the current monitoring process in regard to the service demands of the new scenario which occurs outside. The new demands based on the outside situation are analyzed according to the goal scenario for the process activities. Also, by using the meta-heuristic algorithm, a similar process model is found and identified by combining similarity and interrelationship. The process can be stopped in advance or adjusted to the wanted direction."

For making full use of domain-specific knowledge for a specific context this meta information has to be integrated with a domain ontology. In previous research, we have developed Enhanced Multimedia Meta Objects (EMMOs) as a new means for semantic multimedia meta modeling, as well as a query algebra EMMA, which is adequate and complete with regard to the EMMO model. This paper focuses on the seamless integration of ontology knowledge into EMMA queries to enable sophisticated query refinement."
pub.1021135980,MODELING A CONTROL SYSTEM FOR ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESSES,"It is widely accepted that any well designed organizational process includes a control mechanism through which management decides which aspects of the process performance are to be measured and how these measurements are to be used to change the level of resources utilized in the process. Little is known, however, about the best ways to design such a control mechanism for typical service sector processes. The focus of this research is to study how a variety of control mechanisms performs in managing a business process. The goal is to identify control mechanisms that are effective in different types of environments. This requires modeling both levels, the business process (object level), and the control system (meta level). The fundamental question we ask here is why control systems so often founder. We address the logical aspect of modeling only, not the socio-logical aspects of model use and of implementation. The scenarios for which we try to establish optimal control systems are ones of stationary, dynamic, and turbulent demand patterns. For this purpose we have designed a generic system dynamics model of a business process. The extensive simulation experiments realized with this model corroborate some of the generally acknowledged, basic principles of control, while refuting some of the usually accepted common-sense knowledge about management and organization. The pertinent reflections also lead to some substantive conclusions concerning the design of control systems."

This paper therefore introduces a new approach to the design of multi-agent information systems meant for planning, discovering, monitoring deviations, and optimizing business processes. Expected qualitative breakthrough in the system’s capacity is based on the matching of its constructional and behavioral perspective with the ontological model of supported enterprise. Besides, conformity between organizational and information systems is supplemented by their conceptual alignment in the description of states and processes. The method of multi-agent framework construction and its application for traceability in supply chains are presented in this paper."
pub.1135853227,An education model for project-based learning using ability map in various target products,"A project-based learning (PBL) education model that consists of three meta models, i.e. a resource pyramid meta model, an education process meta model, and an ability mapping meta model is proposed in practice. Most features of the model support various products such as the system software, web application, IoT program, and multimedia contents. Even if PBL products differ among the PBL education classes, fair student evaluations can be achieved because the meta models are dependent only on the maturity levels of the student abilities, and not the quality of the final products. In addition, the model was constructed based on empirical data of previous PBL projects. Based on this model, we conducted PBL classes in 2018 and 2019 at a university. The projects were focused on a business web application, project mapping system, programmable drone, and dynamic movie changing system. The students increased not only their programming techniques as novice members but also their project management techniques as team leaders through the four different projects conducted during the PBL classes. As a result, the teachers were able to fairly evaluate each student even though the final products of the PBL classes differed. At the same time, the students were able to grow as project managers or program specialists that they selected."
pub.1132489646,Automatic Code Generation with Document Responsibility Collaboration Modelling Method,"UML is highly preferred for design in current software development approaches. However, the conceptual gap between entities in business processes and classes in UML designs is not small. To reduce this gap, this paper proposes using documents that are vital to every business. The proposed new method called Document Responsibility Collaboration puts the concept of documents at the center. In the proposed method, documents are meta-models of classes in terms of programming, and at the same time, they are meta-models of relationships in terms of permanence. The proposed Document Responsibility Collaboration method uses the domain concept in which domains are made up of documents, and a document defined in a domain can work with another document in any domain to fulfill its responsibility. Document Responsibility Collaboration method defines a process, which starts at the transition from analysis to design phase and continues to the code generation phase. An example from the order management domain is provided to validate the recommended method."

Specifically the gap between business requirements and the realized Web application should be closed. This paper presents the development of a modeling tool for the automated configuration of Web Content Management Systems (WCM) which aims to reduce the complexity and increase the transparency of implementations. It allows business users to configure the business processes without technical support. We combine fragments of existing Web Engineering methods and specify an abstract and concrete syntax based on a domain model and end user analysis. The resulting WebForm Diagram has been implemented in a prototype and validated by subject matter experts. This research is part of a project to develop the Web Engineering Method (WEM) which provides an overall method towards a full coverage of the specification, design, realization, implementation and maintenance of WCM-based Web applications."
pub.1086155743,Coordinating multiple agents for workflow-oriented process orchestration,"Abstract.Distributed component-based services and semantic web services are promising technologies for next generation inter-enterprise integration. The dynamic nature of this domain presents a complex problem for tools that intend to support this cross-organizational integration. However, the autonomy and adaptation of software agents represent a viable solution for the composition and enactment of cross-organizational services. Currently, there are few studies that measure the impact of the dynamic environmental effects on service composition. On an on-going basis, composite services or workflow processes of web services may be constantly changing in terms of responsiveness of services, accessibility of services and their meta-information, business process schema changes, etc. These conditions impact what interactions a team of agents must undergo to achieve a specific process derived of composite web services. This paper describes an approach, model, and supporting software toward the efficient design of interaction protocols for coordinating agent teams in the business process orchestration domain. This approach considers several environmental conditions related to the dynamism of the Internet."
pub.1093454248,Towards Content-Oriented Integration for Process-Centric Knowledge Management Systems,"Workflow Management System (WfMS) which focuses on controlling, monitoring, optimizing and supporting business processes management is extensively used in Knowledge Management Systems (KMS). But traditional WfMS only work with complete processes on the basis of process models and therefore fail to support a large class of knowledge intensive business processes such as content-oriented integration. In this paper, a service-oriented framework supporting effective content-oriented integration for process-centric KMS is proposed. This framework uses a hybrid process-driven navigation mechanism including content-oriented high-level process and content fragments-oriented micro process. Representational State Transfer (REST) based interface is used to interact with outer entities to increase flexibility and extensibility in constructing complex knowledge intensive applications. A content-oriented services activation and composition meta-data model is given to map relationships among processes, services and related content and its fragments which is used to activate corresponding processes and transform service context into message exchange objects transmitted in enterprise service bus. Finally, the overview, design and implementation of the prototype system are illustrated."
pub.1052885041,Preface for OIS 2006,"A major bottleneck in business applications of Semantic Web technology is the lack of industry-strength ontologies that go beyond academic prototypes. The design of such ontologies from scratch in a textbook-style ontology engineering process is in many cases unattractive, for it would require significant effort and because the resulting ontologies could not build on top of existing community commitment. Also, real-world problems of data and systems interoperability can only be overcome using Semantic Web technology if ontologies exist that represent the very standards currently in use in systems and databases."
pub.1155196601,Integration of Internet of Things in BPM Lifecycle: Concepts and Comparison of Approaches,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that appeared in 1998; it describes a world made up of intelligent devices organized in a network, which can be connected to each other but also to the external environment. The technology of IoT touches several fields of application among them the field of business process management (BPM) where intelligent devices are considered as additional resources delivering a huge amount of data (big data) and have effect on the execution of business process instances. The integration of connected objects in a business process improves business performance where IoT devices are managed in an efficient manner. The objective of this paper is to define the main concepts related to BPM and IoT and propose a meta-model highlighting the links between these concepts. Also, the paper synthesizes existing works addressing the integration of IoT technology in the life cycle of BPM and shows the impact of IoT on each phase of the BPM lifecycle. Finally, the paper evokes open questions of BPM in the context of IoT."
pub.1107254217,A Meta-Model for Information Systems Quality,"Information Systems Quality (ISQ) is a critical source of competitive advantages for organizations. In a scenario of increasing competition on digital services, ISQ is a competitive differentiation asset. In this regard, managing, maintaining, and evolving IT infrastructures have become a primary concern of organizations. Thus, a technical perspective on ISQ provides useful guidance to meet current challenges. The financial sector is paradigmatic, since it is a traditional business, with highly complex business-critical legacy systems, facing a tremendous change due to market and regulation drivers. We carried out a Mixed-Methods study, performing a Delphi-like study on the financial sector. We developed a specific research framework to pursue this vertical study. Data were collected in four phases starting with a high-level randomly stratified panel of 13 senior managers and then a target panel of 124 carefully selected and well-informed domain experts. We have identified and dealt with several quality factors; they were discussed in a comprehensive model inspired by the ISO 25010, 42010, and 12207 standards, corresponding to software quality, software architecture, and software process, respectively. Our results suggest that the relationship among quality, architecture, and process is a valuable technical perspective to explain the quality of an information system. Thus, we introduce and illustrate a novel meta-model, named SQuAP (Software Quality, Architecture, Process), which is intended to give a comprehensive picture of ISQ by abstracting and connecting detailed individual ISO models."
pub.1037464082,The Scheme of Product Development Process as a Trigger to Product Success: A Theoretical Framework,"Researches on product development since 1970s have discussed many aspects. However, none of them clearly describes the relationship between product development activities and product success, the final goal of a business. This paper presents the development of a theoretical framework of the way product development affects product success. The result of a meta-analysis study prior to this study shows that product development is one of the five variables proven to influence product success (r = 0.32). Based on this result, a theoretical framework is developed through five stages. First, relationship between product development and four other variables is evaluated. Through an evaluation on some established models of product development process and a meta-analysis study, three variables, i.e. product characteristic, technological advanced, and management, could be assumed to be inseparable from and closely related to the product development process (0.57 ≤ r ≤ 0.64), while one other variable, market environment, is externally driven and still separated. Second, product development scheme is defined to cover the three variables mentioned above. A meta-analysis study is conducted and the result shows that product development scheme significantly affects the product success (r = 0.31). The model then is restructured into a model of the relationship between product success and the two remaining variables. Third, five sub-variables of product development process, as the elements of product development scheme, is developed based on a mostly referred model and some cases in Indonesia. Forth, a meta-analysis study on the relationship between product success and the five sub-variables is done (0.30 ≤ r ≤ 0.38). Finally, a theoretical framework to model the relationship of product success and product development scheme is developed, as a part of further study."
pub.1013367507,An Open Platform for Business Process Modeling and Verification,"In this paper we present the BPAL platform that includes a logicbased language for business process (BP) modeling and a reasoning mechanism providing support for several tasks. Firstly, the definition of a BP meta-model (MM) consisting of a set of rules that guide the BP designers in their work. Secondly, given a BP, the BPAL platform allows for the automatic verification of the compliance (well-formedness) of a given BP w.r.t. the defined MM. Finally, the execution semantics of a BP is given in term of its instances (referred to as traces) to provide services for i) checking if the actual execution of a BP has been carried out in accordance with the corresponding definition, ii) simulating executions by trace generation. The proposed platform is open since it can easily be enhanced by adding other logic-based modeling, reasoning, and querying functionalities."
pub.1101004152,A Startup Cockpit for the Proof-of-Concept,"More and more innovative new ventures step away from the traditional business plan centred model and follow the “Lean Startup Idea”. This paper introduces a measurement tool – the Startup Cockpit – that helps startups on their way from an idea-based organization to a company with a profit-generating business model. It is based on the Customer Development model of Blank (The four steps to epiphany. San Mateo, 2006), the Lean Startup methodology of Ries (The lean startup: How today’s entrepreneurs use continuous innovation to create radically successful businesses. New York: Crown Business, 2011), and Maurya (Running lean – Iterate from plan A to a plan that works, 2nd edn. Sebastopol: O’Reilly Media, 2012), the Lean Analytics concept of Croll and Yoskowitz (Use data to build a better startup faster. Sebastopol: O’Reilly Media, 2013) and Faltin’s ideas (Brains versus capital: Entrepreneurship for everyone – Lean, smart, simple. Berlin: Stiftung Entrepreneurship, 2013, Kopf schlart, simple. München: Carl Hanser Verlag, 2008). All of those authors introduced a number of crucial processes and meta-principles that promote successful business model development for startups.In an innovation-driven market a business plan is not always the instrument of choice in the early days of a business. Many Internet startups have established a key performance indicators (KPI) oriented process and successfully refined their business model or, as Faltin calls it, the entrepreneurial design (cp. Kopf schlovation-dri. München: Carl Hanser Verlag, 2008). This paper analyses the foundations of the Lean Startup process: the discovery-driven planning and the hypotheses-driven planning approach and the application of those principles in Ries’ Lean Startup methodology and Blank’s Customer Development model. A business plan still is a necessary tool. But it comes later in the startup process, after the proof-of-concept.In our research we found patterns in the usage of numbers/metrics/KPIs to support the business model design process – a Startup Cockpit seems to be within reach. But it is often said that “every entrepreneur is unique”. That makes it difficult to define a “one-size-fits-all”-set of KPIs that helps startups from different industries and in different development stages. Nevertheless, a generic Startup Cockpit can be outlined. But according to our findings it has to be adjusted to each startup’s situation. The main determinants are the development stage, the business model, the strategy, and the financing structure.We prefer the term “cockpit” over “dashboard” as the later has become directly linked to online business models whereas our approach is to find a generic approach to manage the process from an idea to the proof-of-concept. In the same way every airplane pilot and every car driver only tracks a selected set of information such as speed, engine temperature, and gasoline, an entrepreneur has to think about and find those elements of information that best re"
pub.1044512373,Adapting the UML to Business Modelling’s Needs—Experiences in Situational Method Engineering,"In 1999 the Swiss Mobiliar Insurance Company (Mobiliar) started a program to transform to a process oriented organization. Based on reengineered business processes, the refocusing of the information system infrastructure was strived. To ensure a unified methodical procedure during this transformation a competence center was founded. It supports project specific needs by situational method engineering. At inception PROMET BPR and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) were chosen. During the first projects, the requirements for method support changed from being purely process engineered, to a focus of supporting process improvement. This paper characterizes the phases and the specific needs they raise. It shows the evolution and integration of the method fragments. Thereby, the main focus is to describe how the concepts of UML would be linked in particular to ratios of process management in the meta-model of this reengineered method."
pub.1147325336,[Retracted] Optimization of Business English Teaching Based on the Integration of Interactive Virtual Reality Genetic Algorithm,"With the continuous advancement of the global economy and the deepening of internationalization and openness, it is also necessary to keep pace with the times in the optimization of business English teaching. At this point, a genetic algorithm based on the interactive virtual reality (VR) should be established for the optimization of business English teaching to adapt to the future trend in business English teaching optimization more appropriately. In the business English teaching process at present, it is required to change the traditional teaching concept, adjust the previous teaching ideas, widen the horizon continuously, establish an international and diversified English teaching and training program, incorporate the outstanding foreign teaching models, and proactively absorb the excellent educational concepts to drive the development of the domestic business English teaching model more effectively. The results of the simulation experiment indicate that the improved algorithm designed in this article can reduce the computational overhead of the meta-algorithm to a great extent, and the improvement strategy is designed based on the evaluation results of practical examples."
pub.1104503651,Using information flow analysis to detect implicit information leaks for web service composition,"Information leak, which can undermine the compliance of web-service-composition business processes for some policies, is one of the major concerns in web service composition. We present an automated and effective approach for the detection of implicit information leaks in business process execution language (BPEL) based on information flow analysis. We introduce an adequate meta-model for BPEL representation based on a Petri net for transformation and analysis. Building on the concept of Petri net place-based noninterference, the core contribution of this paper is the application of a Petri net reachability graph to estimate Petri net interference and thereby to detect implicit information leaks in web service composition. In addition, a case study illustrates the application of the approach on a concrete workflow in BPEL notation."

However, in many cases the mined knowledge by this process could not meet the real-world business needs. Actually, in real-world business, knowledge must be actionable, that is to say, one can do something on it to profit. Actionable knowledge discovery is a complex task, due to it is strongly depend on domain knowledge, such as background knowledge expert experience, user interesting, environment context, business logic, even including law, regulation, habit, culture etc. The main challenge is moving data-driven into domain-driven data mining (DDDM), its goal is to discover actionable knowledge rather than general pattern. As a new generation data mining approach, main ideas of the DDDM are introduced. Two types of process models show the difference between loosely coupled and tightly coupled. Also the main characteristics, such as constraint-base, human-machine cooperated, loop-closed iterative refinement and meta-synthesis-base process management are proposed. System architecture will be introduced, as well as a paradigm will be introduced."
pub.1039888157,An Ontological Approach for Semantic Annotation of Supply Chain Process Models,"A Supply Chain Process involves various departments and organizations. However, terminology for supply chain process models doesn’t have formalized representations. Moreover, formal definitions of dynamic semantic of process models are commonly absent. Such problems discourage the integration of various process models from different partners. Thereafter, technologies of semantic annotation for business process models are developed to solve these problems. In this paper an ontological approach is proposed to annotate supply chain process models with semantic meanings. The ontology for supply chain process model, so-called scorBPMN ontology, is introduced for such semantic annotation, which specifies semantics of supply chain process models at both meta-model level and mode level. Then the similarity-based matching functionality is developed to link process model elements with concepts in the ontology. The proposed approach presents an ontological description of semantics of supply chain processes and similarity-based annotation of process models, so that various supply chain process models can be standardized and explained with unified semantic annotations, which is the basis for process integration, implementation and analysis."
pub.1002789626,Using Alloy in process modelling,"Many notations and supporting tools are available to be used for describing business processes, but most lack the ability to do more than a syntactic check on the form of the model. Checking that they correctly depict the semantics of the situation is left to inspection. In this paper, we examine the uses that the analysable language Alloy can play in process modelling. We explore its application to descriptions of the organisation and its rules, to the description of processes and in the meta-modelling of process models. From the experiment with modelling a somewhat complex organisational situation, we conclude that Alloy has potential to increase the value of process modelling."
pub.1029538817,Protection of the information resources of a library based on analysis of business processes,"This paper justifies the relevance of the reliable protection of information and the development of measures to reduce information risks in libraries with comprehensive information resources. A brief description of the objects of protection and the main threats, including those that are related to the processing of personal data, is provided. It is alleged that analysis of models of the business processes of a library makes it possible to track the impacts of changes on many aspects of information security. The position of the information system for security analysis of the business process in the overall system of information security is determined. Steps for the formalization and updating of the rights of access to information resources of a library are illustrated. It is emphasized that the basic document for information-security risk management is a threat model that reflects the data on sources of threats and vulnerabilities of the system, impacted objects, and a number of other parameters. A block diagram that illustrates the process of analyzing the threats and vulnerabilities and a knowledge meta-model for the management of information-security risks are provided. It is concluded that based on the relationship of business processes that are reflected in a formal notation it is possible to automatically obtain the data on the degree of influence of security aspects of information objects of a particular sub-process on the results of business processes of a higher level, and as a result, on the achievability of the purposes of an organization."
pub.1071879995,Automating the Migration of Enterprise Architecture Models,"<p>The evolution of Enterprise Architectures (EA) is the result of applying EA development projects within organizations with the goal of accomplishing specific business requirements. Recent approaches seek to automate and improve EA practice within organizations by employing EA management tools. Thus, evolving the organization's EA meta-model is a consequence of fulfilling such initiatives. Currently, the migration of EA models conforming to a specific EA meta-model evolution is a manual task in which EA data corresponding to the actual models is gathered and the models re-designed. This results in an error-prone and time-consuming task. To address this issue, the authors propose a set of migration rules to automate the migration process. The proposed migration rules were implemented within an EA tool and then demonstrated and validated using a fictitious organization migration scenario.</p>"
pub.1030690942,Defining a Trust Framework Design Process,"Trust Management researchers have created several sound frameworks for well-defined problems based on their deep understanding of the field and the current state of the art. However, Trust Management experts are rarely contacted for the design of distributed business applications. Developers of these kinds of business applications are not familiar with latest results and are only aware of a very limited set of applicable solutions. This hinders the adaption of these novel security solutions into provided future services. To support the integration of Trust Management into these areas we defined a design process, which can be applied systematically by developers. Based on the design process they can use their scenario knowledge to narrow down their design space and finally select from a limited set of applicable implementations the best fit. We extended the static TrustFraMM meta-description of Trust Management in a way to enable it to support the exploration and exclusion of existing trust functionality implementations. We built our process on a number of requirements collected through our user-centered design approach. We also provide a possible visualization of the process which we evaluated using a paper prototype. Our process had a positive user acceptance among the questioned users."
pub.1000793502,Introducing the Guard-Stage-Milestone Approach for Specifying Business Entity Lifecycles,"A promising approach to managing business operations is based on business entities with lifecycles (BEL’s) (a.k.a. business artifacts), i.e., key conceptual entities that are central to guiding the operations of a business, and whose content changes as they move through those operations. A BEL type includes both an information model that captures, in either materialized or virtual form, all of the business-relevant data about entities of that type, and a lifecycle model, that specifies the possible ways an entity of that type might progress through the business by responding to events and invoking services, including human activities. Most previous work on BEL’s has focused on the use of lifecycle models based on variants of finite state machines. This paper introduces the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model for lifecycles, which is an evolution of the previous work on BEL’s. GSM lifecycles are substantially more declarative than the finite state machine variants, and support hierarchy and parallelism within a single entity instance. The GSM operational semantics are based on a form of Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules, and provide a basis for formal verification and reasoning. This paper provides an informal, preliminary introduction to the GSM approach, and briefly overviews selected research directions."

Proper understanding of the entire production system is the first step in the design of an effective construction production process. This paper aims to provide a conceptual framework to enable understanding of construction production behaviors and to facilitate the design of construction production processes. This framework is based on observations of construction production characteristics, fundamental concepts of system theory, and ideas from many fields including manufacturing production, business process design, and lean construction. Production system analysis is accomplished by using discrete-event simulation for modeling and meta-heuristic methods for optimization."
pub.1022017417,Effort based performance measurement in business process management,"Abstract  This paper presents a holistic methodology and associated toolset for business process modelling and analysis. The importance of integrating performance measurement (PM) indicators and tools in business process management has been identified in the literature as well as contemporary approaches that attempt to give a solution to this problem. However, most of these approaches propose solutions based on theories and techniques used in other disciplines or research fields which approach the issue of performance measurement in BPR from their individualistic perspective. In the majority of cases the proposed theories and techniques prove to be inadequate to measure performance holistically and integrate, organizational, human resource management, process management and workflow management concepts. The resulting methodology and toolset is based on business analysis ratios that define and measure key performance indicators in qualitative and quantitative terms and identify the relationships between them. These ratios allow enterprises to achieve a performance evaluation tool for continuous improvement in their attempt to respond and adapt quickly to turbulent markets. The performance measurement toolset (called ADJUST) is used for (1) planning different reorganization scenarios for the achievement of desired performance, (2) for assessing real time performance and (3) reporting deviations from desired planned performance.   In order to monitor and assess real time performance the ADJUST software tool provides interfaces to three kinds of management tool categories, namely:    Process management tools (PMT) : business models, cycle time, primitive cost, etc.     Human resource management (HRM) tools : job descriptions, performance measures, etc.     Workflow management (WFM) tools : transactions, business rules, workflow models, etc.     The ADJUST business analysis engine is based on employee effort analysis and provides meta‐analysis of data analysed in PMT and HRM tools. Data like activity sequencing, cycle times, primitive costing, etc. from PMT tools are analysed in ADJUST in order to assess the percentage of high‐business and low value added activities, mission‐non mission activities, concentration analysis, etc. Knowledge management elements are integrated to job descriptions and associated with performance measures and workflow elements. Similarly, job descriptions and performance measurement data that are provided by HRM tools are analysed further in terms of cost to manage, principal‐agent analysis etc. In the case of WFM tools the ADJUST system provides not only meta‐analysis of workflow processes, transactions and document flows but also dynamic monitoring of their performance in real time.

As a result, these languages are difficulty to read and implement. Thus it is significative to make the OWL meta-model simpler. This paper introduces a modified RDF Schema (M-RDFS) as a metamodeling basis for OWL; it also describes how to overcome some problems of the original RDF Schema. Based on this metamodeling architecture, the M-RDFS will be a meta-language for OWL, thus it will not directly define specific ontologies. This paper introduces a conventional metamodeling architecture for semantic web languages. This method makes the modified RDF Schema easier to read and formalize, and it offers a firm semantic basis for OWL."

The target systems of this development process are web based information systems running on a J2EE platform. The automation and optimization of that process was achieved by the application of model driven techniques, mainly the integration of development tools via a Meta Object Facility (MOF) repository backbone. The internal evaluation of NTT Data pointed out a development effort and time reduction of more than 50%. The main lessons learned form this case include the necessity of model-to-model transformations, the need to preserve advantage of existing development process and tools landscape, the requirements to care about configuration and change management from the beginning and the requirements to support also non modeling tools. Also, we identified a new business role, which is that of a tool and process integrator."
pub.1094398883,From Intentions to Software Design using an Intentional Software Product Line Meta-Model,"Software Product Line Engineering is a paradigm to develop software which allows the reducing of development costs for each individual product. In this kind of engineering, a family of related products is built out of a common set of core assets. The common characteristics and differences between products are managed in a systematic way. These differences are called variabilities. The variations analysis and the impact of the choices made for a required product are the reason of the main effort to design a product from the product line. In this paper, we try to argue that it is difficult to fully benefit of the SPL if it remains at the software level. The paper proposes a move towards a description of software product line in intentional terms, i.e. intentions and strategies to achieve business goals. We present ISPL, the model to describe intentional Software Product Line. We try through this Meta-models to present the different concepts which we will use in our approach. Thereafter, we propose our process to show how to use this model. This process combines the use of maps, visual techniques for the modeling of product lines, specially features diagrams and Meta-models."
pub.1000317673,Process time patterns: A formal foundation,"Companies increasingly adopt process-aware information systems (PAISs) to model, execute, monitor, and evolve their business processes. Though the handling of temporal constraints (e.g., deadlines or time lags between activities) is crucial for the proper support of business processes, existing PAISs vary significantly regarding the support of the temporal perspective. Both the formal specification and the operational support of temporal constraints constitute fundamental challenges in this context. In previous work, we introduced process time patterns, which facilitate the comparison and evaluation of PAISs in respect to their support of the temporal perspective. Furthermore, we provided empirical evidence for these time patterns. To avoid ambiguities and to ease the use as well as the implementation of the time patterns, this paper formally defines their semantics. To additionally foster the use of the patterns for a wide range of process modeling languages and to enable pattern integration with existing PAISs, the proposed semantics are expressed independently of a particular process meta model. Altogether, the presented pattern formalization will be fundamental for introducing the temporal perspective in PAISs."
pub.1093362626,Business intelligence applied to monitoring and meta-monitoring scenarios,"This paper presents the use of the Business Intelligence process and some of its technologies to perform monitoring and meta-monitoring actions on sensed data and physical components that compose an environmental monitoring platform. These actions are mainly related to the capture of data that are the input to carry out the support of the decision-making process in the regulation and control of environmental pollution, the definition of policies, and the application of preventive and corrective actions to keep the monitoring physical infrastructure operational. For application development, they were used three tools of the Pentaho Suite. Kettle for carrying out the Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process of data stored using the relational model (MySQL), and the no relational (MongoDB) paradigm, Worbench for modelling the On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) cubes that operate over the data warehouse created from the monitoring operational data, and BI Server tool for publishing the defined cubes.

pub.1172907784,A meta-model for formulating digital transformation strategies for SMEs: A knowledge management-based approach,"Digital Transformation (DT) is a new socio-technical paradigm that has been reshaping society. The intensification of the use of the most recent digital technologies has triggered the need for significant changes in organizations (e.g. educational institutions, physical commerce), and in their different organizational elements (e.g. processes, technologies, culture). In this context, the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) stands out. They have great value for social well-being due to their ability to generate work. However, they have a long way to go on the path to digital transformation, compared to large companies. Its specific limitations, such as the scarcity of financial resources and the lack of knowledge to deal with DT, accentuate this difficulty. This implies the need to know how to design a more effective DT strategy or process, which makes better use of its scarce resources and which strategically aligns them with the potential of digital technologies. Therefore, with an approach based on knowledge management and interdisciplinary research, the following research question was investigated: how to support SMEs to face challenges and take advantage of the opportunities brought through digital transformation? Therefore, under a systemic view of TD in organizations, a meta-model was proposed, which focuses on the strategic level and initiates the adaptation of business models, through cycles of adaptation and response to new external demands. As theoretical and basic foundations, the Cesm method, the Canvas Business Model, and the organizational resilience mechanisms were used, linked to the Seci knowledge spiral. As a methodological approach, systematic reviews of scientific articles, case studies and business reports were used, combined with the Design Science Research Process (DSRP). The adopted design involved iterative and collaborative steps of conceptual review and refinement of the constructed meta-model, which was subjected to conceptual review through the submission of articles and the analysis of two domain experts in DT. As a final result, the developed artifact is presented, which structures three phases to guide the TD process, focusing on the strategic level of organizations, also recommending steps and samples of support materials (examples of tools to assist TD). As delimitations, it is highlighted that the meta-model does not address elements inherent to the tactical and operational levels of organizations. As limitations, it is pointed out that larger and more diverse samples can be used in the future. Its practical implications are to guide SMEs, indicating where and how to start DT, using phases and steps to guide this process.. As future work, its instantiation in various sectors and organizations of different sizes is recommended, as well as the use of different tools, and measurement of long-term results."

To this end, common semantics for product lifecycle meta data are required. In this regard, the ontology model for product lifecycle meta data can play a major role in supporting the sharing of product lifecycle data and information during whole product lifecycle. It can facilitate the communication among lifecycle actors, smart products, and a PLM system. For this purpose, in this study, we propose a primitive ontology model for product lifecycle meta data in the closed-loop PLM. For this, first, we clarify what the product lifecycle data is. We then design the structure of meta data that describes contents of product lifecycle data. Subsequently, we build up a primitive ontology for product lifecycle meta data in resource description framework (RDF) and have discussion about pros and cons of the proposed model."

For these purposes run-time monitoring ofservices provided by an enterprise and early decision making through this becomes core competition of the enterprise. In addition, in order to process various innumerable events which are generated on enterprise systems techniques which make filtering of meaningful data are needed. However, the existing study related with this is nothing but discovering of service faults by monitoring depending upon API of BPEL engine or middleware, or is nothing but processing of simple events based on low-level events. Accordingly, there would be limitations to provide useful business information. In this paper, through situation detection an extended complex event model is presented, which is possible to provide more valuable and useful business information. Concretely, first of all an event processing architecture in an enterprise system is proposed, and event meta-model which is suitable to the proposed architecture is going to be defined. Based on the defined meta-model, It is presented that syntax and semantics of constructs in our event processing language including various and progressive event operators, complex event pattern, key, etc. In addition, an event context mechanism is proposed to analyze more delicate events. Finally, through application studies application possibility of this study would be shown and merits of this event model would be present through comparison with other event model."
pub.1172094146,Alignment of Business Process and Information System Models Through Explicit Traceability,"In the software development lifecycle, business process models (BPMs) turn out to play an ever more pivotal role in the development and continued management of information systems (ISs). However, BPMs and IS models (ISMs) are traditionally expressed separately. This separation causes drift between them, impedes their interoperability, and thus builds up misaligned models. Traceability in software development proves its ability to link together related artifacts from different sources within a project (for examples, business modelling, requirements, design models), improves project outcomes by assisting designers and other stakeholders with common tasks such as impact analysis, etc. In this paper, we propose an improvement and an extension of an existing requirement traceability method in order to tackle the traceability between design, requirement and BPMs. In fact, the extension consists in adding the UML class diagram concepts structured according to the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern to be traced with BPMN and UML use cases models in a single unified model. This method is based on the integration mechanism, acts at the model and the meta-model levels, and can be used to develop a new IS and/or to examine the misalignment of the existing ISMs and the BPMs after BPM/ISM evolution."
pub.1005867071,A Goal-Oriented Meta-Model for Scientific Research,"In many research domains, studies need to be addressed in a multidisciplinary manner: each expert deals with a particular aspect of the problem. It may be useful for experts to take into account new data, share partial results, and update their own indicators and models, in order to take advantage of new measures and updated indexes in real time. For this, an easily-understandable knowledge model for any raw data source, statistical operator, indicator or business process to be available for experts, is needed. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented meta-model, to index and reuse treatments and an extension of existing semantic Web standards to index goal-oriented services and assist and/or automate their selection. These features enable capabilities for interoperability and information exchange between three layers of knowledge: goal, domain and data layers.

To implement it in a SOA framework, unified service description is required. Nevertheless, the work of deriving service description from process models is arduous and inaccurately. To solve the problem, a novel approach is proposed. Firstly, meta-data for process model is extracted from SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference model), which provides standardized terminology and definitions for supply chain management. Thereafter, XML-Nets, a high-level Petri-Net, is employed for description of such process models and relevant characteristics of supply chain, as well for the following mapping models to service description. Finally, with aids of mapping rules, general description for service interface and orchestration can be smoothly derived, which comprehensively describe supply chain process and well support further IT development, analysis and improvements of supply chain management."

pub.1035444257,Ontology-driven Semantic Mapping,"When facilitating interoperability at the data level one faces the problem that different data models are used as the basis for business formats. For example relational databases are based on the relational model, while XML Schema is basically a hierarchical model (with some extensions, like references). Our goal is to provide a syntax and a data model neutral format for the representation of business schemata.We have developed a unified description of data models which is called the Logical Data Model (LDM) Ontology. It is a superset of the relational, hierarchical, network, object-oriented data models, which is represented as a graph consisting of nodes with labeled edges. For the representation of different relationships between the nodes in the data-model we introduced different types of edges. For example: is_a for the representation of the subclass relationship, identifies for the representation of unique key values, contains for the containment relationship, etc. In this paper we discuss the mapping process as it is proposed by EU project STASIS (FP6-2005-IST-5-034980). Then we describe the Logical Data-Model in detail and demonstrate its use by giving an example. Finally we discuss future research planned in this context in the STASIS project."

This is done by detailed examination of all available unpublished variorum drafts of the key papers in the RBC story, so as to determine the origins of the ideas. The analysis of the process their discovery is then set out followed by explanations of the evolution and dissemination of the models, from first generation papers through full blown research programs. This is supplemented by interviews and correspondence with the individuals who were at the center of the development of RBC models, such as Kydland, Prescott, Long, Plosser, King, Lucas and Barro, among others. This book gets stright to the heart of the debates surrounding RBC models and as such contributes to a real assessment of their impact on modern macroeconomics. The volume, therefore, will interest all scholars looking at macroeconomics as well as historians of economic thought more generally."
pub.1044699709,Integration between enterprise process monitoring and controlling system and enterprise application,"The relationships and the features of integration between Enterprise Process Monitoring and Controlling System (EPMCS) and Enterprise Process Related Applications (EPRA) were analyzed. An integration architecture centered on EPMCS was presented, in which there were four layers to connect from EPMCS to EPRA:EPMCS, application integration layer, transport layer and EPRA, and there were four layers used to etstablish integration: presentation layer, function layer, data layer and system layer. The frameworks to connect EPMCS and EPRA were designed, that Enterprise-Independent Model (EIM), Enterprise-Specific Model (ESM) and meta-model to describe these two models were defined. The method to integrate data based on XML was designed to exchange data from EPMCS to EPRA according to the mapping between EIM and ESM. The approches are suitable for integrating EPMCS and systems in Product Data Management (PDM), project management and enterprise business management."
pub.1095376931,Extending BPMN for Business Activity Monitoring,"Real-time access to key performance indicators is necessary to ensure timeliness and effectiveness of operational business processes. The concept of Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) refers to the observation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about business activities across systems and companies' borders. Designing and maintaining BAM applications is challenging, as the involved concepts (e.g., business processes, audit logs, performance measures) though being strongly interrelated— are developed by different communities of practice. Also, they reside on different levels of abstraction, and are handled by different IT systems. Hence, we developed a conceptual modeling language which extends the widely accepted Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) by BAM-relevant concepts. The main results presented in this paper are: (1) a meta-model which formally describes the conceptual aspects of the developed BPMN extension (abstract syntax); (2) graphical symbols as an exemplary representation of this abstract syntax (concrete syntax); (3) a demo scenario that illustrates the application of the language in a fictitious scenario."

Thus, after an introduction to EC concepts, EC definitions are proposed (including enterprise model, enterprise meta-model, architectural sentence, alive artifact, transformation initiative, architectural maps, enterprise observation, knowledge base, as-was state, as-is state, to-be state, enterprise architect, and enterprise cartographer). Next, five EC primitives are described. The system representation and the EC formalization are presented next."
pub.1095808677,A Cooperative Framework for Inter-Organizational Workflow System,"Workflow management systems (WfMSs) are accepted worldwide due to their capability to model and control business processes. With WfMS, enterprises can improve work efficiency and react to the emergent situation quickly. However, most WfMSs adopt the centralized architecture in an organization so that they usually lack of a cooperative communication mechanism across different organizations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative framework for inter-organizational workflow systems. The framework consists of an inter-workflow meta-model, CA-PLAN (Cooperative Agentflow Process LANguage), and a prototype system based on Agentflow, a system developed in our laboratory. The cooperation mechanism between WfMSs in CA-PLAN is modeled as a Remote Call Process (RCP) paradiem. A Process Service is a mechanism that defines a process to participate in an inter-organizational process among different WfMSs and specifies the associated arguments in and out. A Remote Process is a proxy mechanism that refers to a process service on another WfMS. RCP provides the mechanism by which the process service and the remote process communicate and pass information back and forth and process monitor mechanism. The mechanism, also allowing dynamic changes and reconfiguration, can adapt dynamic and competitive business environment. Through RCP, the cooperative process across organizations becomes simple, faster, and flexible."

That is why business and IT alignment plays a key role in digital transformation, brought value to organization’s stakeholders. The paper deals with value modeling approach for network enterprise as a platform, which allows to create value for network enterprise. The paper is built in according to Design Science method. The most famous approaches to integration of different business models are considered in the paper. The developed approach is based on integration of Value Proposition Canvas and Value Delivery Modeling Language (VDML) and afterwards transforming them into the modeling language of the enterprise architecture ArchiMate. The approach allows to connect business strategy and value creation process in terms of Enterprise Architecture. Moreover, the approach was applied in real estate sales company as an owner of digital platform. Transformation to the network enterprise allows to create new services, which will bring value both for its clients and partners."
pub.1094137883,BPMN4CP Revised — Extending BPMN for Multi-Perspective Modeling of Clinical Pathways,"Clinical Pathways (CPs) can be seen as business processes of hospitals or clinical institutions. Modeling these pathways is an emerging field of research, as it provides promising benefits for systems integration, quality management and documentation. The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) provides a range of process-related concepts but naturally lacks in representing specific aspects from the CP domain. Therefore, the BPMN extension BPMN4CP was designed in a previous research project. In accordance with research guidelines from Design Science, the extension ran through an iteration based on its practical application within a telemedical project. Based on several new requirements, the extension was revised regarding to the integration of resources, documents, objectives and quality indicators. These concepts were assigned to particular perspectives and diagrams in order to support model complexity management and provide appropriate diagrams for respective stakeholders. In order to provide a commonly usable extension, these enhancements were implemented as BPMN meta model extension."

In this position paper, we focus on the foundations of the problem, arguing that contemporary approaches struggle to find a suitable equilibrium between data- and process-related aspects. We then propose a new formal model, called db-nets, that balances such two pillars through the marriage of colored Petri nets and relational databases. We invite the research community to build on this new model, discussing in particular its potential in conceptual modeling, formal verification, and simulation."
pub.1095566902,Do Ontological Guidelines Improve Understandability of Conceptual Models? A Meta-Analysis of Empirical Work,"Conceptual models are used to understand information systems application domains and to communicate about them in order to better understand system requirements. Conceptual models are required to represent relevant aspects of the modeled domain faithfully, and be understandable. The use of ontological theories has been proposed to guide the creation of effective models. Specifically, Bunge's ontology has been applied to guide the use of the ERM, the UML, and business process grammars. However, because the choice of ontology reflects beliefs, and model understanding involves human cognition, whether or not ontological guidance results in better models is an empirical question. Several empirical works studied this issue, differing in grammars, modeling aspects, empirical tasks, and measures. We report a meta-analysis of published empirical research about the impact of ontological guidance based on Bunge's model, and user understanding of conceptual models. The results support the proposition that ontological guidance can improve model understandability."

pub.1014722547,Meta-Models and Consistency Issues,"Rather than considering a “model” as a one-piece object, we can translate and adapt the concept of meta-models, commonly used in computer science, to the field of insurance management. We actually deal with a number of interconnected models. These models involve common concepts such as risk and value, assets and liabilities, reserves, management actions, etc. To avoid cacophonies (i.e. operational inefficiencies), every piece has to be placed in the right order. Depending on objectives and context, different levels of modelling will be required. Coherence in the modelling process does not mean uniformity. It is vital to understand correctly how models can effectively enhance business performance, yet not be blurred by undue complexity."
pub.1020387499,A Startup Cockpit for the Proof-of-Concept,"More and more innovative new ventures step away from the traditional business plan centred model and follow the “Lean Startup Idea”. This paper introduces a measurement tool – the Startup Cockpit – that helps startups on their way from an idea-based organization to a company with a profit-generating business model. It is based on the Customer Development model of Blank (Blank SG (2006) The four steps to epiphany. San Mateo. cafepress.com), the Lean Startup methodology of Ries (Ries (2011) The lean startup: how today’s entrepreneurs use continuous innovation to create radically successful businesses. Crown Business, New York), and Maurya (Maurya A (2012) Running lean – iterate from plan A to a plan that works. Second edn. O’Reilly Media, Sebastopol), the Lean Analytics concept of Croll and Yoskowitz (Croll A, Yoskowitz B (2013) Use data to build a better startup faster. O’Reilly Media, California), and Faltin’s ideas (Faltin G (2013) Brains versus capital: entrepreneurship for everyone – lean, smart, simple. Stiftung Entrepreneurship, Berlin, (2008) Kopf schlägt Kapital. Carl Hanser Verlag, München). All of those authors introduced a number of crucial processes and meta-principles that promote successful business model development for startups.In an innovation-driven market a business plan is not always the instrument of choice in the early days of a business. Many Internet startups have established a key performance indicators (KPI) oriented process and successfully refined their business model or, as Faltin calls it, the entrepreneurial design (cp. Faltin G (2008) Kopf schlägt Kapital. Carl Hanser Verlag, München). This paper analyses the foundations of the Lean Startup process: the discovery-driven planning and the hypotheses-driven planning approach and the application of those principles in Ries’ Lean Startup methodology and Blank’s Customer Development model. A business plan still is a necessary tool. But it comes later in the startup process, after the proof-of-concept.In our research we found patterns in the usage of numbers/metrics/KPIs to support the business model design process – a Startup Cockpit seems to be within reach. But it is often said that “every entrepreneur is unique”. That makes it difficult to define a “one-size-fits-all”-set of KPIs that helps startups from different industries and in different development stages. Nevertheless, a generic Startup Cockpit can be outlined. But according to our findings it has to be adjusted to each startup’s situation. The main determinants are the development stage, the business model, the strategy, and the financing structure.We prefer the term “cockpit” over “dashboard” as the later has become directly linked to online business models whereas our approach is to find a generic approach to manage the process from an idea to the proof-of-concept. In the same way every airplane pilot and every car driver only tracks a selected set of information such as speed, engine temperature, and gasoline"
pub.1157603582,Application of Enterprise Architecture and Artificial Neural Networks to Optimize the Production Process,"Production optimization is a complex process because it must take into account various resources of the company and its environment. In this process, it is necessary to consider the enterprise as a whole, taking into account the interaction between its key elements, both in the technological and business layer. For this reason, the article proposes the use of enterprise architecture, which facilitates the interaction of these layers in the production optimization process. As a result, a proprietary meta-model of enterprise architecture was presented, which, based on good practices and the assumptions of enterprise architecture, facilitates the construction of detailed optimization models in the area of planning, scheduling, resource allocation, and routing. The production optimization model formulated as a mathematical programming problem is also presented. The model was built taking into account the meta-model. Due to the computational complexity of the optimization model, a method using an artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed to estimate the potential result based on the structure of the model and a given data instance before the start of optimization. The practical application of the presented approach has been shown based on the example of optimization of the production of an exemplary production cell where the cost of storage and the number of unfulfilled orders and maintenance are optimized."
pub.1008105117,Meta-model of servitization: The integrative profiling approach,"This study develops a profiling framework that allows systematic comparison of different value constellations of industrial, service-based business models. Following the systematic review method, 154 research articles on servitization are analyzed using this profiling approach, producing an integrative meta-model of servitization. Three different approaches to represent servitization in studies are identified: 1) end-state models; 2) gradual transition models, and 3) stepwise progression models. These are systematically compared and eight conceptually different, generic value constellations ranging from low to high levels of servitization are identified: products with limited support; installed and supported products; complementary services; product-oriented solutions; systems leasing; operating services; managed service solutions; and total solutions. These form a pattern of servitization showing increases in complexity of the offering and value for the customer as well as changes in operational responsibilities in the value constellations. This approach resolves the gap of conceptual incommensurability’ in the literature by providing a reference against which the different value constellations of servitization can be compared. The meta-model connects the various perspectives, models and terminology into a base line theory of servitization as a process, and enables a systematic comparison of the different empirical studies."
pub.1041506876,Consistency Verification Between Goal Model and Process Model in Requirements Analysis of Networked Software,"In requirements analysis of networked software, achieving goal depends on the relevant business process, and each process associates with goal. On the one hand, the process can complete the corresponding function goal to directly realize the function needs from users; on the other hand, the process can promote the realization of the non-functional goals to improve the satisfaction of the non-functional goals. So, it requires that the goal model and process model of the networked software requirements meta-model must be consistent. This paper studies the consistency verification between goal model and process model. In our methods, GM model is used to describe goal model, and PZN model is used to describe process model, and their mapping relationship is reflected by selection set in GM and effective activity path in PZN. We analyze consistency through the mapping relationships between the whole goal model and the process model from atomic goal to atomic process. Under this way, it ensures that the process model can realize the users' demand correctly. Through the application in actual project, it shows that this method is effective to ensure the unity of the goal and the process during the requirement analysis."

Design/methodology/approach This is an exploratory empirical paper, which integrates the results of five rankings of the world’s most innovative companies.   Findings The five innovation rankings include a variety of companies based on different methods and strategic focus. This variety underscores the importance of a meta-ranking, whose multiple aggregation methods lead to consistent results. Only the following 11 companies are mentioned in at least three rankings, leading to a list of the 11 most innovative companies in the world: Amazon, Apple, Tencent, Google/Alphabet, Netflix, SpaceX, Tesla, Microsoft, IBM, Intel and General Electric. Overall, the meta-ranking is dominated by US companies from various industries with firms from China gaining importance.   Originality/value The paper contributes to research into innovation antecedents and consequences by illustrating the importance of innovation perceptions. The meta-ranking highlights the need for pursuing different types of innovation, following the innovation-based view on firm performance with first-order and second-order innovations. Moreover, the results deepen our understanding of digital transformation and of capturing value from innovation in the digital economy because a considerable portion of the leading innovators has a business model emphasizing artificial intelligence and digital platforms, which have led to the generation of new and to the disruption of established markets.

pub.1181830642,Towards an enhanced next activity prediction using attention based neural networks,"Predictive Business Process Monitoring has gained significant attention in recent years due to its capability to forecast process outcomes and predict the next event within an ongoing process. In the last few years, works have focused on deep learning and its applications in predicting the next activity. Some research used Long Term Short Memory, while others used Convolutional Neural Networks. However, long-term short-term memory models have the constraint of relatively slow training, while Convolutional Neural Networks are fast but may reach lower accuracy. In previous studies, researchers attempted to use meta-attributes to improve the accuracy of next activity prediction. However, in this research, a network that includes a layer of Bi-Directional Long Term Short Memory and utilizes attention mechanisms is introduced for an enhanced next activity prediction. Attention mechanisms in this research help determine the dependencies and importance of the activities within the process. At the same time, this network benefits from the fast training properties of the Convolutional Neural Network. This research also notes that gathering meta-data is not always efficient for businesses and may be overlooked in real-life systems. Therefore, only activity and sequence are used as input and managed to surpass the state-of-the-art deep learning models in designated experiments. Additionally, a case study was conducted on Order to Cash to test an Attention-based Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network in a real-life situation. This model achieved an accuracy of 87% in the case study."
pub.1084919613,MDA Approach for Reusability in Serious Game and E-learning Design,"Serious games have known an enormous outburst during the last decade. These games have the power to use the gamers’ immersion in order to foster their motivation and engagement in educational and professional trainings. Unfortunately, the development of serious game scenarios remains an expensive, time consuming business that is exclusively dedicated to computer scientists. Our work aims to solve this problem by introducing a new process capable of building generic reusable and interoperable scenarios. This process is based on MDA (Model Driven Architecture). Its starting point consists in enriching an e-learning standard to define a new meta-model (CIM). This meta-model will manage, assemble and index the scenario components. Starting from CIM model, we define a transformational mechanism to implement playful yet pedagogical scenarios and integrate them within two contexts. The first context focuses on the playful aspect (Unity 3d environment) whereas the second one is purely pedagogical (E-learning platform: claroline connect)."
pub.1035485427,Flexibility in Process-Aware Information Systems,"Process-aware information systems (PAIS) must be able to deal with uncertainty, exceptional situations, and environmental changes. Needed business agility is often hindered by the lacking flexibility of existing PAIS. Once a process is implemented, its logic cannot be adapted or refined anymore. This often leads to rigid behavior or gaps between real-world processes and implemented ones. In response to this drawback, adaptive PAIS have emerged, which allow to dynamically adapt or evolve the structure of process models under execution. This paper deals with fundamental challenges related to structural process changes, discusses how existing approaches deal with them, and shows how the various problems have been exterminated in ADEPT2 change framework. We also survey existing approaches fostering flexible process support."

pub.1026217132,SOA+d: a new way to design the decision in SOA—based on the new standard Decision Model and Notation (DMN),"In recent years, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies are emerging as a powerful vehicle for organizations that need to integrate their applications within and across organizational boundaries. In addition, organizations need to make better decisions more quickly. Moreover, they need to change those decisions immediately to adapt to this increasingly dynamic business environment. It is primarily a question in ensuring the decisional aspect by adopting the SOA as a support architecture. In this paper, we describe a new approach called SOA+d$$^\mathrm{+d}$$ based on a certain number of standards. It is going to be studied on three dimensions: The first is related to the definition of the information system implied in the SOA based on the use case model. The second develops the business dimension which is based on the BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). The last dimension addresses the need of decision; we use the new standard decision model and notation (DMN) which is recently approved by Object Management Group (OMG) and considered as a simple notation to specify the decision. Finally, Service Oriented Architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) will be used for design of several services. We also present our meta-model Decisional Model of Service (DMS) to define a new set of concepts necessary for modeling the three levels. Some of them are already known, whereas others are new and are proposed as an element of this work. we illustrate our proposal with a real case study in the Pharmacy Inventory Management."
pub.1094326597,Conceptual Modeling of Web Application Transactions: Towards a Revised and Extended Version of the UWA Transaction Design Model,"Business Web applications are complex data- and operation-intensive Web applications intended to support business processes. In this kind of application, the user executes sets of activities organized into transactions (also generally called workflows) in order to accomplish one of his/her tasks or fulfill one of his/her goals. The way these transactions are structured, the properties associated with their component activities and the way each activity is implemented by the Web application are a consequence of the transaction design as well as the business rules implied by the business process. The Ubiquitous Web Applications (UWA) design framework explicitly includes a design activity and a related meta-model, called the Transaction Design Model, specifically focused on the conceptual design of Web application transactions (Web Transactions for short). This paper describes preliminary steps towards a revised and extended version of the UWA Transaction Design Model that emphasizes a user-centered approach, is easier to adopt and manages the information, navigation and operation aspects involved in a Web Transaction in a comprehensive and integrated way."

pub.1019076757,Understanding antecedents of new product development speed: A meta‐analysis,"Abstract   New product development (NPD) speed is a key component of time‐based strategy, which has become increasingly important for managing innovation in a fast‐changing business environment. This meta‐analytic review assesses the generalizability of the relationships between NPD speed and 17 of its antecedents to provide a better understanding of the salient and cross‐situationally consistent factors that affect NPD speed. We grouped the antecedents into four categories of strategy, project, process, and team, and found that process and team characteristics are more generalizable and cross‐situationally consistent determinants of NPD speed than strategy and project characteristics. We also conducted subgroup analyses and found that research method variables, such as level of analysis, source of data, and measurement of speed, moderate the relationships between NPD speed and its antecedents. We apply the study's findings to assess several models of NPD speed, such as the balanced model of product development, the strategic orientation and organizational capability model, the compression vs. the experiential model, the centrifugal and centripetal model, and the product development cycle time model. We also discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice. "

The workshop focuses on different facets of conceptual modeling and design of service-oriented systems, a recent development paradigm that has the potential to transform current business software systems and applications from an archipelago of isolated entities that barely talk to one another, into a seamless organism that transcends physical and organizational boundaries, and creates new opportunities for interoperability and integration."
pub.1093335340,Building the Record Keeping System (RKS). Process Improvement Triggered By Management Of Archival Documents,"This paper results from a research project at Tilburg University in which organization, information and archival studies have been integrated. We argue that the archivistic concept of the record keeping system (RKS) can be used as an instrument for improving the performance of the document-flow in a business process, and, as a result, of the process. Archival documents contain information related to the result of an activity, to the circumstances of their creation and to organization and business processes. The elements of a RKS are context, quality, appraisal, warehousing and logistics. The translation of our conceptual model is the process-specific archival document-file, a meta-file that operates as an engine managing document management. The approach was tested in a case-study. It became clear that our approach leads to considerable improvements in the flow of documents and thus in the primary processes supported by these documents."
pub.1118280045,Designing Traceability into Big Data Systems,"Providing an appropriate level of accessibility and traceability to data or
process elements (so-called Items) in large volumes of data, often
Cloud-resident, is an essential requirement in the Big Data era.
Enterprise-wide data systems need to be designed from the outset to support
usage of such Items across the spectrum of business use rather than from any
specific application view. The design philosophy advocated in this paper is to
drive the design process using a so-called description-driven approach which
enriches models with meta-data and description and focuses the design process
on Item re-use, thereby promoting traceability. Details are given of the
description-driven design of big data systems at CERN, in health informatics
and in business process management. Evidence is presented that the approach
leads to design simplicity and consequent ease of management thanks to loose
typing and the adoption of a unified approach to Item management and usage."
pub.1181095986,Optimizing Retail Recommendation via Similarity Measures and Machine Learning Approach,"Finding a suitable retail business with potential success in a specific location can be challenging for retailers. The process is often lengthy and inconsistent due to the subjective nature of expert opinions. Previous research has demonstrated several techniques that consider numerous influential attributes for location optimization problems. However, while many studies rely on a business's core data for analytical purposes, accessing this information is often a significant constraint. This study aims to address the challenge of extracting valuable location features to enhance the profitability of chosen businesses despite the inaccessibility of core business data. The proposed methodology involves three main steps. First, an analytical dataset must be created by utilizing geographic and demographic information. Second, we conduct similarity measures by applying Manhattan distance to the entire analytical dataset, using an ideal business outlet that contains the footfall information. Through this process, we can identify businesses that share similar characteristics with popular outlets. Finally, several supervised machine learning models are trained to employ the extracted meta-features. Experimental results show that the XGBoost classifier performs best with an 87% accuracy score, outperforming the baseline models. The proposed methodology in this research presents a robust framework that demonstrated remarkable efficiency in achieving the stated objectives and improving the performance of retail business recommendations within a given location. Future work could consider a broader range of features that could potentially enhance model performance by applying ensemble learning. "
pub.1094174508,A Role and Task-based Workflow Dynamic Authorization Modeling and Enforcement Mechanism,"Current workflow products can support more complex modeling of business processes, workflow engine mechanism is well researched, but the link between organizational elements and process activities is less well understood. In access control, most products can only support fixed role-based task assignment, not enough in considering more complex security policies, such as DSOD, task binding of duties, and temporal constraints, that important in dynamic workflow system. This paper examines workflow access control requirement in practice, analyzes WFMC workflow meta-model, and adopts the R&TBAC approach to separate role-based organization and task-based authorization-step modeling, and especially designs an agent-based dynamic policy enforcement mechanism to bridge the gap. The intelligent task assigning agent to be defined as a virtual participant in workflow process definition, and creating within workflow engine controlled available task instance, acts as to evaluate task dynamic authorization policy to provide eligible task participant role-set based on its information model. This paper gives a formal specification of the workflow authorization model, and designs the agent information model, assigning policy model, and function model in detail. The modeling approach can widely adapt to various existing workflow systems and can automatically change policy as enterprise organization or business process definition need changing."

To address the changes, the capabilities of digital enterprises need to adapt. Capability modeling can facilitate this process of transformation. However, a plethora of approaches for capability modeling exist. This study explores how concepts relevant to change have been implemented in the meta-models of these approaches, aiming to visualize relationships among change-related concepts, and identify ways to improve capability modeling toward a more efficient depiction of capability change. The concepts are visualized in concept maps, and a framework is developed to assist the classification of concepts relevant to change functions. Similarities and differences among the existing models are discussed, leading to suggestions toward improvements of capability modeling for capability adaptation."

pub.1156441087,Enhancing Ethical Reflection of Managers Through Andragogy and Socratic Approaches: A Multi-University Comparison,"There have long been debates about the teaching of business ethics. Should business ethics be taught like functional business courses like marketing, law and strategy using behaviourist or teacher centred models in business courses? Or should adult learning methodologies adopt Socratic method with reflective practice as a means of promoting ethical self-awareness and enhancing personal development in meta-cognition and learning? This paper canvases literature pertaining to how business ethics and fields such as CSR should be taught. It outlines the methodological differences between pedagogical versus andragogic approaches and focuses on Socratic and reflective practice approaches. Extracts from student assessments including comments, feedback, and insights, from a number of MBA ethics and management subjects in different universities are presented. This provides evidence of the effectiveness of these approaches in enhancing participants’ abilities to engage in ethical reflection and decisions, validating the process as an appropriate and effective educational method."
pub.1084920762,Rethinking BPM in a Cognitive World: Transforming How We Learn and Perform Business Processes,"If we are to believe the technology hype cycle, we are entering a new era of Cognitive Computing, enabled by advances in natural language processing, machine learning, and more broadly artificial intelligence. These advances, combined with evolutionary progress in areas such as knowledge representation, automated planning, user experience technologies, software-as-a-service and crowdsourcing, have the potential to transform many industries. In this paper, we discuss transformations of BPM that advances in the Cognitive Computing will bring. We focus on three of the most signficant aspects of this transformation, namely: (a) Cognitive Computing will enable “knowledge acquisition at scale”, which will lead to a transformation in Knowledge-intensive Processes (KiP’s); (b) We envision a new process meta-model will emerge that is centered around a “Plan-Act-Learn” cycle; and (c) Cognitive Computing can enable learning about processes from implicit descriptions (at both design- and run-time), opening opportunities for new levels of automation and business process support, for both traditional business processes and KiP’s. We use the term cognitive BPM to refer to a new BPM paradigm encompassing all aspects of BPM that are impacted and enabled by Cognitive Computing. We argue that a fundamental understanding of cognitive BPM requires a new research framing of the business process ecosystem. The paper presents a conceptual framework for cognitive BPM, a brief survey of state of the art in emerging areas of Cognitive BPM, and discussion of key directions for further research."
pub.1172266101,Graphical Specification of Sensitive Business Processes,"This paper aims at developing a new BPMN extension, called “BPMN4SBP”, supporting the multi-dimensional modeling of Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs) (i.e., the knowledge, functional, organizational, behavioral, informational and intentional dimensions). It aims to explicitly integrate all the relevant issues and aspects relevant at the coupling of the business process modeling (BPM) domain and the knowledge management (KM) domain for improving the identification and management of crucial knowledge which are mobilized and created by these processes. This paper provides the analysis of requirements and relevant concepts for modeling SBP. Based on a core domain ontology, need for extension is identified and the valid BPMN4SBP extension is designed (according to the BPMN extension mechanism) by the construction of a conceptional domain model and the corresponding BPMN extension model. This extended BPMN4SBP meta-model is derived by applying model transformation rules and by adapting, also, the UML profile mechanism to BPMN. The applicability of the proposed BPMN extension is demonstrated by modeling an SBP in a real case study in the healthcare domain."
pub.1000520783,A service pattern model for service composition with flexible functionality,"A key feature with service-oriented-architecture is to allow flexible composition of services into a business process. Although previous works related to service composition have paved the way for automatic composition, the techniques have limited applicability when it comes to composing complex workflows based on functional requirements, partly due to the large search space of the available services. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, the prospect service. Unlike existing abstract services which possess fixed service interfaces, a prospect service has a flexible interface to allow functional flexibility. Furthermore, we define a meta-model to specify service patterns with prospect services and adaptable workflow constructs to model flexible and adaptable process templates. An automated instantiation method is introduced to instantiate concrete processes with different functionalities from a service pattern. Since the search space for automatically instantiating a process from a service pattern is greatly reduced compared to that for automatically composing a process from scratch, the proposed approach significantly improve the feasibility of automated composition. Empirical study of the service pattern shows that the use of the proposed model significantly outperforms manual composition in terms of composition time and accuracy, and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed automated instantiation method is efficient."
pub.1005554417,eSPEM – A SPEM Extension for Enactable Behavior Modeling,"OMG’s SPEM – by means of its (semi-)formal notation – allows for a detailed description of development processes and methodologies, but can only be used for a rather coarse description of their behavior. Concepts for a more fine-grained behavior model are considered out of scope of the SPEM standard and have to be provided by other standards like BPDM/BPMN or UML. However, a coarse granularity of the behavior model often impedes a computer-aided enactment of a process model. Therefore, in this paper we present eSPEM, an extension of SPEM, that is based on the UML meta-model and focused on fine-grained behavior and life-cycle modeling and thereby supports automated enactment of development processes."
pub.1092372816,Supporting Continuous Changes to Business Intents,"Software supporting an enterprise’s business, also known as a business support system, needs to support the correlation of activities between actors as well as influence the activities based on knowledge about the value networks in which the enterprise acts. This requires the use of policies and rules to guide or enforce the execution of strategies or tactics within an enterprise as well as in collaborations between enterprises. With the help of policies and rules, an enterprise is able to capture an actor’s intent in its business support system, and act according to this intent on behalf of the actor. Since the value networks an enterprise is part of will change over time the business intents’ life cycle states might change. Achieving the changes in an effective and efficient way requires knowledge about the affected intents and the correlation between intents.
                  The aim of the study is to identify how a business support system can support continuous changes to business intents. The first step is to find a theoretical model which serves as a foundation for intent-driven systems. We conducted a case study using a focus group approach with employees from Ericsson. This case study was influenced by the spiral case study process. The study resulted in a model supporting continuous definition and execution of an enterprise. The model is divided into three layers; Define, Execute, and a common governance view layer. This makes it possible to support continuous definition and execution of business intents and to identify the actors needed to support the business intents’ life cycles. This model is supported by a meta-model for capturing information into viewpoints.
                  The research question is addressed by suggesting a solution supporting continuous definition and execution of an enterprise as a model of value architecture components and business functions. The results will affect how Ericsson will build the business studio for their next generation business support systems."

According to BMKG, Pekanbaru meteorological station declared a forest fire had struck 11 regencies in Riau Province on July 2019. Indications of the fire were detected from the existence of 38 hot spots in the area. Previous research has been conducted to develop the SI/TI framework for the mitigation of forest fire disaster using TOGAF, which result is a reference in business development to technology design for disaster management. This paper proposes a recommendation for business process development and the design of disaster management technology. BPTrends Redesign method outlines activity and improvement in business process consisting of activity, role, result, technique, and meta-model in the development of disaster management prevention information system, thus obtained a more comprehensive recommendation in its application development. The results of the discussion obtained technology architecture from the Organization Database to Emergency Management information System and overview of the business model in the form of Disaster integration and Safety Information system which explains about internal and external access."
pub.1120486141,A Model Driven Architecture Approach to Generate Multidimensional Schemas of Data Warehouses,"Over the past decade, the concept of data warehousing has been widely accepted. The main reason for building data warehouses is to improve the quality of information in order to achieve specific business objectives such as competitive advantage or improved decision-making. However, there is no formal method for deriving a multidimensional schema from heterogeneous databases that is recognized as a standard by the OMG and the professionals of the field. Which is why, in this paper, we present a model-driven approach (MDA) for the design of data warehouses. To apply the MDA approach to the Data warehouse construction process, we describe a multidimensional meta-model and specify a set of transformations from a UML meta-model which is mapped to a multidimensional meta-model. The transformation rules are programmed by the Query View Transformation (QVT) language. A case study illustrates our approach. It demonstrates how it reinforces the components traceability and reusability and how it globally improves the modeler’s efficiency. Furthermore, the use of the UML, as a technique to build data warehouses, is an important facilitator which prepares our further work to automate this approach."
pub.1010063608,AOMD approach for context-adaptable and conflict-free Web services composition,"BPEL or Business Process Execution Language is so far the most important standard language for effective composition of Web services. However, like most available process orchestration engines, BPEL does not provide automated support for reacting according to many changes that are likely to arise in any Web services composition, like downtime services, modifications in the business logic or even new policies to govern the composition. Also low-level specification of these new changes, which would be integrated at runtime in the BPEL process, will be far from being used conveniently. Moreover, the complexity of interaction in composite Web services and the diversity of rules and policies can lead to critical behavioral conflicts. We propose in this paper AOMD, a novel aspect-oriented and model driven approach that defines new grammar to address both adaptability and behavioral conflicts problems, and offers extension for WS-BPEL meta-model for high level specification of aspects. Further, we formally verify our proposition and we present real life case study, examples and experimental results that demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our work."
pub.1148652532,Extending Process Discovery with Model Complexity Optimization and Cyclic States Identification: Application to Healthcare Processes,"Within Process mining, discovery techniques had made it possible to construct
business process models automatically from event logs. However, results often
do not achieve the balance between model complexity and its fitting accuracy,
so there is a need for manual model adjusting. The paper presents an approach
to process mining providing semi-automatic support to model optimization based
on the combined assessment of the model complexity and fitness. To balance
between the two ingredients, a model simplification approach is proposed, which
essentially abstracts the raw model at the desired granularity. Additionally,
we introduce a concept of meta-states, a cycle collapsing in the model, which
can potentially simplify the model and interpret it. We aim to demonstrate the
capabilities of the technological solution using three datasets from different
applications in the healthcare domain. They are remote monitoring process for
patients with arterial hypertension and workflows of healthcare workers during
the COVID-19 pandemic. A case study also investigates the use of various
complexity measures and different ways of solution application providing
insights on better practices in improving interpretability and
complexity/fitness balance in process models."
pub.1035454213,A Business and Solution Building Block Approach to EA Project Planning,"Many EA groups battle to establish an overall programme plan in a way that is integrated, achievable and understandable to the stakeholder and sponsor community as well as the downstream implementation groups, including: IT, Process Management, Human Resources and Product Management. This paper presents an approach that achieves these objectives in a simple way. The approach is currently being implemented in a fairly new enterprise architecture function within an aggressively expanding Telco with promising results. The problem is introduced and a solution including meta model and visual representations is discussed. Early findings are made to the effect that the technique is simple to apply as well as being effective in establishing shared understanding between the EA function, project sponsors, project stakeholders and IT personnel. The technique is explicated with an example that should make it easy for others to replicate in their own setting."
pub.1093436715,Flexible Service Selection Optimization Using Meta-Metrics,"The web services paradigm enables an organisation to implement business processes by orchestrating existing services, some of which may be provided by external organisations. Service selection optimization is the application of techniques to optimize the selection of services for business processes. These processes are often modelled to accomodate anticipated variations in control-flow during execution using choice control-flow patterns. This enables a single business process model to represent multiple execution paths, a phenomenon known as modelled flexibility. In certain scenarios, modelled flexibility can cause conflicts in service selection optimization, making it impossible to simultaneously optimize all execution paths. This paper presents an approach to service selection that addresses this type of conflicts by enabling the user to bias service selection based on an arbitrary set of metametrics."
pub.1049708218,A Fact-Based Meta Model for Standardization Documents,"Recently, the OMG has been working on developing a new standard for a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). This standard development has resulted in documents that contain the latest approved version of a standard or a standard proposal that can be ammended. Such a standard document also serves as a specification for BPMN modeling tool. In this paper we show how a fact-based approach can improve the completeness and maintenance of such a specification."
pub.1085268031,OBJECT-PROCESS DATA MODEL IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"We have studied the question of data models creation with respect to the process-based management of industrial enterprise. It is proposed to use an object data model for management and operational management decision making systems at the process organization of industrial enterprise. We consider the basic concepts and definitions used in object-process data model, suggest its mathematical description, that includes tree representation of the system goals, object meta-models of production system, business process, the center responsible for resource. We have defined four phases of information system creation based on the object-process data model: goal tree description, metamodeling of objects and processes, data structure representation, data warehouse modeling of the production system. The goal tree is a hierarchical scorecard of the enterprise. Production objects are described by hierarchical structures and should meet requirements of the specified system of quality indicators for goods or services. The most important stage of material system metamodeling is to establish connections between objects, processes passing in it and indicators of the goals tree. The ultimate objective for metamodeling of the material system objects and processes should lie in the repository creation where one can get the structures of objects, processes, indicators and links on the basis of their unique identifiers. We have proposed a variant of object-process model application in integrated information systems based on the service-oriented architecture with the ability to take into account the goals of business, collect data on the current state of processes and organize data storage for retrospective data analysis tasks. The usage of object-process model during information system creation enables to combine two types of control: deviation control and management-by-objectives."
pub.1004647607,The Things of the Internet of Things in BPMN,"The component “thing” of the Internet of Things does not yet exist in current business process modeling standards. The “thing” is the essential and central concept of the Internet of Things, and without its consideration we will not be able to model the business processes of the future, which will be able to measure or change states of objects in our real-world environment. The presented approach focuses on integrating the concept of the Internet of Things into the meta-model of the process modeling standard BPMN 2.0 as standard-conform as possible. By a terminological and conceptual delimitation, three components of the standard are examined and compared towards a possible expansion. By implementing the most appropriate solution, the new thing concept becomes usable for modelers, both as a graphical and machine-readable element."
pub.1156956398,"BPM Lifecycles and Their Core Cycle Steps: Identification, Processing and Clustering","Business Process Management (BPM) constitutes an organizational discipline with an emphasis on continuous process improvement. Given the fact that BPM is divided into concrete phases and steps, it is translated into a circular model, defined as a BPM lifecycle. However, BPM lifecycle models are heterogeneously defined in the literature. The high presence of a variety of components within the proposed models, indicates the differences in perception throughout the research community. The latter signifies the need for a more systematic BPM lifecycle that would sufficiently substantiate the importance, the associations, and the placement of each included cycle steps. To harmonize the variety of the proposed BPM lifecycles, this study aims at elaborating the notion of Core Cycle Steps (CSSs), as previously introduced by the authors. For this purpose, the placement of each CCS in the BPM lifecycle range is examined, facilitating their clustering. After examining twelve lifecycle models, 11 out of the 22 identified CCSs bear a unanimous agreement among the authors who place it in the same quarter of their cycles. Contrary to the intuitive sense of their irresolute positioning in the proposed models, each step entails a minimum of 50% authors agreement regarding their placement in the BPM lifecycle range. Altogether, this study is expected to shed light on the ordering of BPM steps within a BPM lifecycle range, while shifting the discourse towards a meta-BPM lifecycle model."
pub.1049117559,Warehousing Manufacturing Data,"Strong competition in the manufacturing industry makes efficient and effective manufacturing processes a critical success factor. However, existing warehousing and analytics approaches in manufacturing are coined by substantial shortcomings, significantly preventing comprehensive process improvement. Especially, they miss a holistic data base integrating operational and process data, e. g., from Manufacturing Execution and Enterprise Resource Planning systems. To address this challenge, we introduce the Manufacturing Warehouse, a concept for a holistic manufacturing-specific process warehouse as central part of the overall Advanced Manufacturing Analytics Platform. We define a manufacturing process meta model and deduce a universal warehouse model. In addition, we develop a procedure for its instantiation and the integration of concrete source data. Finally, we describe a first proof of concept based on a prototypical implementation."
pub.1046206430,A Role-Based Framework for Information System Self-Development,"This paper presents an approach to information systems development based on contemporary business and organization models. Business organizations are changing very quickly and their information systems must evolve dynamically with them. We have developed a concept of IS self-development where the information system is treated as an active information view or a level of a business organization providing and mediating not only the information and communication services but also the development services of the organization and its IS. This makes it possible for IS development processes to be handled in the context of the organizational roles ofthe business organization, allowing specialized development organizations to focus on services for IS development. A meta-model of the architecture of the IS development process and a general methodological framework for modeling and organizing such subject-centered development processes have been developed. The paper reflects the current status of an ongoing project (Estonian Science Foundation grant G3765)."
pub.1105031037,Comparative Analysis of Contemporary Modeling Languages Based on BPM4KI Meta-Model for Sensitive Business Processes Representation,"This article presents a set of Sensitive Business Process (SBP) modeling requirements and proposes a multi-criteria evaluation framework to appraise the expressiveness of currently widely used business process modelling formalisms to select the most suitable for SBP representation. The modelling of SBPs, be they process oriented or knowledge oriented, presents special requirements dictated by several factors: the highly dynamic complexity and flexibility of the processes; the high number of critical activities requiring intensive acquisition, sharing, storage and (re)use of very specific crucial knowledge; the specificity and diversity of information and knowledge sources; and the high degree of collaboration and interaction (intra/inter-organizational) among participants (who apply, create and share a great amount of very important tacit organizational knowledge, in order to achieve collective objectives and create value). As SBP models get more complex, the selection of the appropriate modeling formalism gains in importance to improve the identification of crucial knowledge that is mobilized and created by these processes. Furthermore, the result of the evaluation led us to justify the choice of the better one positioned nowadays, the standard BPMN 2.0. Besides, the authors have illustrated the practical applicability of this specification on a medical process in the context of the organization of protection of the motor disabled people of Sfax-Tunisia."
pub.1143000946,"E-Commerce on the Success of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises","This study aims to analyze the role of e-commerce in business success in the meta-measure path. E-Business is a new business model that provides significant benefits such as savings in the cost of fast execution of business transactions and encourages the globalization of business activities, thereby removing barriers to market penetration. E-Business is developed in large companies and creates in Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are an essential part of a country or region's economy, including Indonesia. The method used is a qualitative analysis method with case studies. This study uses four micro-scale entrepreneurs who use e-commerce in carrying out their business activities as research objects. The analysis process is carried out based on e-commerce in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Bandung. This picture is obtained through direct interviews with the object of research. Based on the study results, it can be concluded that, in general, e-commerce has a role that can help uses four micro-scale entrepreneurs in improving their business development. The results of the analysis also explain that the four micro-scale entrepreneurs persist in using e-commerce."
pub.1130379708,A Disciplined Method to Generate UML2 Communication Diagrams Automatically From the Business Value Model,"One of the most crucial objectives of enterprises is bridging the gap between its businesses and information systems. In this vein, many approaches have emerged among them: the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). This approach is an initiative of the Object Management Group (OMG) and considers the model as the central entity in the software systems development process offering many techniques allowing transformation between models. In addition, the OMG introduces for the MDA three abstraction levels, namely Computation Independent Model (CIM), Platform Independent Model (PIM), and Platform-Specific Model (PSM). This contribution proposes a disciplined method that ensures an automatic alignment between businesses and information system models at CIM and PIM levels. The source model consists of E3value model, which is the Business Value model, whereas, the generated model represents UML2 Communication diagrams, that are the UML's behavior and interaction models. The transformation is achieved automatically using meta-models and ATLAS Transformation Language and proved to be effective."

The design of a process map is of central importance as many organizations create them at the start of a business process management (BPM) initiative to serve as a framework. Despite this importance, the design of process maps is still more art than science, essentially because there is no standardized modeling language available for process map design. In this paper, we address the research question of which concepts are currently used in process maps in practice. To this end, we investigate a collection of 67 process maps from industry. Our contribution is a meta-model for process map design which is grounded in actual usage. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of different concepts for process map design."
pub.1101404210,Event-Driven Process Chain for Modeling and Verification of Business Requirements–A Systematic Literature Review,"Automation of any business process primarily requires the identification of clear and precise requirements. However, the initially collected business requirements are usually expressed in natural language that creates ambiguities among different stakeholders. To overcome this problem, various business process modeling languages (BPMLs) have been introduced to represent the business requirements graphically. In this context, event-driven process chain (EPC) is a well-known BPML that supports the modeling and verification of business requirements in early automation phases. Although EPC is frequently researched to improve its modeling and verification capabilities, there is no study available yet to the best of our knowledge that examines and summarizes the latest EPC developments. Therefore, in this article, we comprehensively investigate the latest EPC approaches, trends, and tools for the modeling and verification of business requirements. Particularly, a systematic literature review is carried out to select and analyze 73 research studies published during 1998–2017. Consequently, the selected studies are classified into six categories, i.e., modeling (14), transformation (13), verification (17), general (20), semantics (5), and requirement (4). Moreover, latest EPC modeling approaches are identified and analyzed, i.e., UML (2), meta-model (3), integration (5), and EPC notations (4). Furthermore, EPC verification methods are also investigated, i.e., EPC (6), petri-nets (8), and other languages (3). Finally, 25 leading EPC tools have been presented, i.e., existing tools (14), proposed/developed tools, (5) and additional tools (6). It has been concluded that EPC provides adequate approaches and tool support for the modeling and verification of simple business requirements through atomic events. However, the complex business requirements cannot be modeled and verified through EPC due to the lack of complex event processing. Consequently, there is a strong need to include the support for the modeling and verification of complex events in EPC to manage multifaceted business requirements."
pub.1013829132,Classifying Assumptions Made during Requirements Verification of Embedded Systems,"We are investigating ways to improve the process of modelling of embedded systems for formal verification. In the modelling process, we make a mathematical model of the system software and its environment (the plant), and we prove that the requirement holds for the model. But we also want to have an argument that increases our confidence that the model represents the system correctly (with respect to the requirement). Therefore, we document some of the modelling decisions in form of a list of the system assumptions made while modelling. Identifying the assumptions and deciding which ones are relevant is a difficult task and it cannot be formalized. To support this process, we give a classification of assumptions. We show our approach on an example."
pub.1049258364,A view framework for modeling and change validation of artifact-centric inter-organizational business processes,"Over the past several years, more efficient approaches have been on increasing demands for designing, modeling, and implementing inter-organizational business processes. In the process collaboration across organizational boundaries, organizations still stay autonomic, which means each organization can freely modify its internal operations to meet its private goals while satisfying the mutual objectives with its partners. Recently, artifact-centric process modeling has been evidenced with higher flexibility in process modeling and execution than traditional activity-centric modeling methods. Although some efforts have been put to exploring how artifact-centric modeling facilitates the collaboration between organizations, the achievement is still far from satisfaction level, particularly in aspects of process modeling and validating. To fill in the gaps, we propose a view framework for modeling and validating the changes of inter-organizational business processes. The framework consists of an artifact-centric process meta-model, public view constructing mechanism, and private view and change validating mechanisms, which are specially designed to facilitate the participating organizations to customize their internal operations while ensuring the correctness of the collaborating processes. We also implement a software tool named Artifact-M to help organizations to automatically construct a minimal and consistent public view from their processes."
pub.1021325990,Model-Driven Development of Enterprise Applications,"Modern business systems need to cater to rapidly evolving business requirements in an ever-shrinking window of opportunity. Modern business systems also need to keep pace with rapid advances in technology. For developing large and complex applications, industrial practice has traditionally used a combination of non-formal notations and methods. Different notations are used to specify the properties of different aspects of an application and these specifications are transformed into their corresponding implementations through the steps of a development process. The development process relies heavily on manual verification to ensure the different pieces integrate into a consistent whole. This is an expensive and error-prone process demanding large teams with broad-ranging expertise in business domain, architecture and technology platforms. We present a model-driven development approach that addresses this problem by providing a set of modeling notations for specifying different layers of a system namely user interface, application functionality and database; a set of code generators that transform these models into platform-specific implementations; an abstraction for organizing application specification into work-units and an associated tool-assisted development process. Models, being at a higher level of abstraction, are easier to understand and verify for properties of interest. Model based code generation incorporating proven design and architectural patterns results in significant gains in productivity and uniformly high quality. Models defined using these different notations are instances of a single meta model. This enables well-formedness constraints to be specified between different models ensuring their consistency leading to smooth integration of implementations of these models. The approach has been used extensively to construct medium and large-scale enterprise applications resulting in improved productivity, better quality and platform independence. We also discuss issues that need to be addressed for the approach to gain wider acceptance in the industry."

pub.1020635151,Pattern-Based ETL Conceptual Modelling,"In software development, patterns and standards are two important things that contribute strongly to the success of any system implementation. Characteristics like these ones improve a lot systems communication and data interchange across different computational platforms, integrating processes and data flows in an easy way. In ETL systems, the change of business requirements is a very serious problem leading frequently to reengineer existing populating processes implementations in order to receive new data structures or tasks not defined previously. Every time this happens, existing ETL processes must be changed in order to accommodate new business requirements. Furthermore, ETL modelling and planning suffers from a lack of mature methodology and notation to represent ETL processes in a uniform way across all implementation process, providing means to validate, reduce implementation errors, and improve communication among users with different knowledge in the field. In this paper, we used the BPMN modelling language for ETL conceptual modelling, providing formal specifications for workflow orchestration and data process transformations. We provide a new layer of abstraction that is based on a set of patterns expressed in BPMN for ETL conceptual modelling. These patterns or meta-models represent the most common used tasks in real world ETL systems."

Knowledge management is crucial in all design activities, since a designer often relies on his or others’ experience to solve a new problem. This paper presents a tool for design knowledge management, focused on knowledge capture and reuse. Design knowledge is stored in process traces, which represent the successive steps leading to the solution (as opposed to just the solution). The tool is generic: it is independent both from the design method and from the application domain, thanks to the combined use of meta-modelling and case-based reasoning. We describe the tool and its application to a real Business Process Reengineering case."

pub.1171213660,A Study on the Development of Conceptual Model of Career Savvy for General High School Students,"Objectives The purposes of this study were to investigate the definition of career savvy that fits general high school students and its components and variables for the conceptual model.
 Methods For the purpose of this study, a conceptual model draft of career savvy was derived based on a comprehensive review of literature in business administration and pedagogy as well as two main theories which are trait-factor theory and cognitive information processing theory. With a conceptual model draft, Delphi surveys were conducted three times on eight career education experts.
 Results As a result of the Delphi survey, a conceptual model of career savvy was made and it was agreed upon by the expert panel and its validity was secured. Carrer savvy is the concept that consists of 3 components (career information collecting competence, career strategic formulation ability, and career meta-cognition ability). Specifically, career information collecting competence has 3 factors(technological ability, Networking ability, and critical acceptance ability). Career strategic formulation ability includes 4 factors(finding the gaps, analysis, synthesis, and executing). Career meta-cognition ability forms 2 factors(knowledge meta-cognition, process meta-cognition).
 Conclusions Career savvy consists of three components which are the ability to collect career information, the ability to formulate career strategies, and the ability of career meta-cognition and these components also contain more specific variables. The Career savvy conceptual model of this study can be used as a foundation for customized career education to improve the future career competency of general high school students."

pub.1170136679,Multi-Stage Prompting for Next Best Agent Recommendations in Adaptive Workflows,"Traditional business processes such as loan processing, order processing, or procurement have a series of steps that are pre-defined at design and executed by enterprise systems. Recent advancements in new-age businesses, however, focus on having adaptive and ad-hoc processes by stitching together a set of functions or steps enabled through autonomous agents. Further, to enable business users to execute a flexible set of steps, there have been works on providing a conversational interface to interact and execute automation. Often, it is necessary to guide the user through the set of possible steps in the process (or workflow). Existing work on recommending the next agent to run relies on historical data. However, with changing workflows and new automation constantly getting added, it is important to provide recommendations without historical data. Additionally, hand-crafted recommendation rules do not scale. The adaptive workflow being a combination of structured and unstructured information, makes it harder to mine. Hence, in this work, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine process knowledge with the meta-data of agents to discover NBAs specifically at cold-start. We propose a multi-stage approach that uses existing process knowledge and agent meta-data information to prompt LLM and recommend meaningful next best agent (NBA) based on user utterances."

pub.1136894507,Causal Modelling in Enterprise Architecture Frameworks,"Publisher: Vilnius University Institute of Data Science and Digital Technologies, Journal: Informatica, Title: Causal Modelling in Enterprise Architecture Frameworks, Authors: Saulius Gudas , Abstract: The paper deals with the causality perspective of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks. The analysis showed that there is a gap between the capabilities of EA frameworks and the behavioural characteristics of the real world domain (enterprise management activities). The contribution of research is bridging the gap between enterprise domain knowledge and EA framework content by the integration of meta-models as part of EA structures. Meta-models that cover not only simple process flows, but also business behaviour, i.e. causality of the domain, have been developed. Meta-models enable to create a layer of knowledge in the EA framework, which ensures smart EA development, allows validation of developer decisions. Two levels of the enterprise causal modelling were obtained. The first level uses the Management Transaction (MT) framework. At the second level, deep knowledge was revealed using a framework called the Elementary Management Cycle (EMC). These two causal frameworks were applied here to justify the causal meta-models of the EA. The new concepts Collapsed Capability, Capability Type and Capability Role which meaningfully complement MODAF with causal knowledge are introduced. Strategic Viewpoint (StV) modelling using causal meta-models is described in detail and illustrated in the case study. The example provided shows a principled way that causal knowledge supports the verification and validation of EA solutions. The presented method provides an opportunity to move the EA development to smart platforms."

It then goes on to develop a model of the collaborative architecture for extended enterprises and demonstrates the validity of this architecture through a case study. It concludes that, in order to create and sustain competitive advantage, collaborative systems should facilitate the management of: the collaborative architecture of the extended enterprise; the extended business processes and the value proposition for each extended enterprise through a meta level management process. It also identifies areas for further research, such as better understanding of: the exact nature and interaction of multiple strategies within an enterprise; how to manage people/teams working along extended business processes; and the nature and prerequisites of the manage processes"
pub.1046582845,Generating Enterprise Applications from Models,"For developing large and complex applications, industrial practice uses a combination of non-formal notations and methods. Different notations are used to specify the properties of different aspects of an application and these specifications are transformed into their corresponding implementations through the steps of a development process. The development process relies heavily on manual verification to ensure the different pieces integrate into a consistent whole. This is an expensive and error prone process. We present a set of notations for specifying the different layers of a software architecture and a method for transforming a specification into an implementation. Models defined using these different notations are instances of a single meta model. This provides a means to unify the specifications of different layers and leads to a simple and elegant implementation method. The method has been used extensively to construct medium and large-scale enterprise applications."
pub.1110109092,Well-being as a staged social responsibility process for business and society,"
                    Purpose
                    This paper aims to conceptualize how business and society co-evolve their efforts to maximizing the greatest well-being of the greatest number following a conscious-unconscious, staged, dialectical process.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This study used a conceptual framework linking eight components of well-being (economic, environmental, social, cultural, psychological, spiritual, material and physical), with stages of consciousness and the co-evolution of business and society.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Stages of consciousness – traditionalist, modernist, post-modernist and integral – moderate both the pace and direction with which business and society co-evolve to the greatest well-being of the greatest number across eight components of well-being.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    This is a conceptual framework which integrates existing empirical relationships, but the overall framework itself is yet to be empirically tested.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The whole process of maximizing well-being can become more conscious for both business and society. This requires making unconscious components conscious and becoming conscious of the inseparability of the eight components of well-being as a counter-balanced set.
                  
                  
                    Social implications
                    Businesses and societies can maximize well-being across eight inseparable components. But implementing this is a staged process requiring progressing populations through stages of consciousness. Earlier stages lay the platform for a critical mass of people able to integrate the eight components.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    Knowledge of well-being is dominated by disciplinary disconnection and bivariate studies; yet, current meta-crises and calls for post-conventional leaders indicate the importance of an integrated multidisciplinary well-being model which explains past efforts of business and society, diagnoses current problems and points towards more viable paths.

pub.1085967356,Contextualized Meaning Extraction: A Meta-Algorithm for Big Data Text Mining with Pragmatics,"<p>Text mining is a powerful form of business intelligence that is used increasingly to inform organizational decisions. Current text mining algorithms rely heavily on the lexical, syntactic, structural, and semantic features of text to extract meaning and insight for decision making. Although semantic analysis is a useful approach to meaning extraction, pragmatics suggests that a more accurate meaning of text can be extracted by examining the context in which the text is recorded. Given that massive amounts of textual data can be drawn from multiple and diverse sources, accounting for context is increasingly important. A conceptual model is provided to explain how concepts from pragmatics can improve existing text mining algorithms to provide more accurate information for decision making. Reversing the pragmatic process of meaning expression could lead to improved text mining algorithms. The theoretical process model developed herein can provide insight into the development and refinement of text mining algorithms that draw from diverse sources.</p>"

SQL queries will be used to represent the mapping between the source and the target data."
pub.1048064949,Supporting knowledge‐intensive work in public administration processes,"Abstract Knowledge management efforts focus much on the strategic applications of knowledge‐related initiatives and not so much on their implications at the level of concrete business processes. On the other hand, business process management efforts have not concentrated on leveraging knowledge. In this paper we attempt to fill that gap by developing a tool for proactive, context‐sensitive delivery of knowledge. We focus on the modelling of knowledge‐intensive business processes and we develop a framework for modelling this type of processes that explicitly considers knowledge‐related tasks and knowledge objects. We present a tool that is an implementation of our theoretical meta‐model and realises proactive, context‐sensitive delivery of knowledge, integrated with the workflow enactment. As an example, we sketch one case study, the process for granting full old‐age pension as it is performed in the Greek Social Security Institution, discussing the benefits derived from applying our tool. Finally, we draw the main conclusions of our work and discuss further research directions. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Several metrics proposed in the literature for business process models can be used for ITSM process models as well. This paper formalizes some of those metrics and proposes some new ones, using the Metamodel-Driven Measurement (M2DM) approach that provides precision, objectiveness and automatic collection. According to that approach, metrics were specified with the Object Constraint Language (OCL), upon a lightweight BPMN metamodel that is briefly described. That metamodel was instantiated with a case study consisting of two ITSM processes with two scenarios (“as-is” and “to-be”) each. Values collected automatically by executing the OCL metrics definitions, upon the instantiated metamodel, are presented. Using a larger sample with several thousand meta-instances, we analyzed the collinearity of the formalized metrics and were able to identify a smaller set, which will be used to perform further research work on the complexity of ITSM processes."
pub.1000118793,Modelling Capabilities as Attribute-Featured Entities,"The concept of capability is a fundamental element not only for Service Oriented Architecture but also for Enterprise Information Systems. This concepts denotes what an action (i.e., a service, a program, a business process, etc.) can do from a functional perspective. Despite its importance, current approaches do not model it properly: either they confuse it with an annotated invocation interface or do not go beyond the classical IOPE paradigm which, from an end user perspective, does not have an intuitive description of what is the capability being modeled. In this paper, we present a conceptual model as an RDF-schema for describing capabilities as attribute-featured entities which is more user friendly. Actually, we consider a capability as an action verb and a set of domain specific attributes that relates to an exact business meaning. This way, we are able to represent capabilities at several levels of abstraction from the most abstract one with just an action verb to the most concrete one that corresponds to the exact need of an end user which is not possible with current capability modelling approaches. We are also able to interlink capabilities for creating a hierarchical structure that allows for improving the discovery process. Our meta model is based on RDF and makes use of Linked Data to define capability attributes as well as their values."
pub.1093599280,Considering Quality Factors for Business Processes During Requirement Engineering,"Business process (BP) modelling is considered as an important part of Requirement Engineering in describing the context within which requirements are articulated, specified and analysed. The intertwining of business and information systems imposes considerable stresses on requirements engineers to consider quality factors that need to be present in both business processes and the software that supports these processes. We argue that the quality of BPs has to be taken into account at the requirement engineering stage, where quality requirements are to be defined, along with the corresponding quality factors and the metrics that will be used to evaluate them. We consider that a BP is represented by a model and that quality requirements are to be examined within the BP model. In this work, our goal is to provide a support for evaluating the quality of a BP through the corresponding model. We present a quality framework for BPs and a quality-oriented BP metamodel. This metamodel is enriched with quality-related attributes that will be used to evaluate the quality factors. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed quality framework we will use a BP model relating to the management of spectators at an Olympics venue, we will show the instantiation of our meta model in this context along with evaluation results for some quality factors."
pub.1120508160,A Traceability and Synchronization Approach of the Computational Models of an Enterprise Architecture,"An Enterprise Architecture (EA) represents the fundamental organization of the business process and Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, serving to capture the essentials of business, IT and its evolution, being relevant to protecting the business and maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of the organization. In the context of the enterprise architecture modeling, some problems were identified: (i) the lack of traceability of the elements present in the computational models or the visualization, in an understandable way, of the chain of elements that are related; and (ii) the absence of synchronization between the computational models of the strategic (strategic model), tactical (business process model) and operational IT levels, focusing on information systems (system requirements model). Among the negative impacts related to these problems are, for example, the obsolescence of models, the difficulty of carrying out impact analysis and decision making, in scenarios of organizational changes. Thus, in order to provide a reduction or elimination of the negative impacts caused by these problems, an approach is proposed to promote the traceability and synchronization of the computational models of an AE. The approach proposed in this work is composed of three layers that together provide: (i) a set of meta-models, representing the strategic, tactical and operational levels of the EA; (ii) a model traceability structure that supports change and configuration management through the use of COBIT, ITIL and ISO 20.000 recommendations and good practices; and (iii) a model synchronization structure that uses the techniques of model driven development (DDM) and allows automated (or semi) automated support to synchronize between the models produced. The purpose of this approach is to keep the computer models traceable and up-to-date, allowing: (i) the support for visualization and understanding of how a set of models (strategic, tactical and operational IT) and their elements relate; (ii) the support for impact analysis and decision-making in change scenarios; (iii) the necessary support to avoid the obsolescence of the models; and (iv) the creation and maintenance of the strategic alignment of the business with IT."

Making such systems self-adaptable is a priority concern for the future implementation of Industry 4.0 application scenarios. In this position paper, we design a meta-model and use it as a tool to describe an end-to-end communication use case from an ongoing research project. Based on this use case we develop a business process performance and security trade-off model, which shows that maximazing both parameters at the same time is not possible, thus an efficient balance between them has to be achieved. Motivated by the result, we propose self adaptation as a solution towards a flexible and secure end-to-end communication in Industry 4.0. To identify and document the self-adaptation points in a structured methodological and lightweight way we use the bespoken meta-model."

Some European countries like Denmark or Spain already started to mandate electronic invoicing, but most other countries in the European Union are still in the planning phase for implementation. This weak adoption rate hinders governments to generate benefits of electronic invoicing, so an understanding of this fact from a public sector perspective is crucial. Still, the majority of preceding studies investigated electronic invoicing from a private sector perspective. In addition to that, an overarching model explaining electronic invoicing adoption is still missing. This paper develops a unifying meta-model of influencing factors of electronic invoicing adoption on governmental level by analyzing relevant literature and by conducting expert interviews. The paper then discusses implications for future research with a focus on the public sector."
pub.1049910857,A situational method for semi-automated Enterprise Architecture Documentation,"The business capabilities of modern enterprises crucially rely on the enterprises’ information systems and underlying IT infrastructure. Hence, optimization of the business-IT alignment is a key objective of Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM). To achieve this objective, EAM creates, maintains and analyzes a model of the current state of the Enterprise Architecture. This model covers different concepts reflecting both the business and the IT perspective and has to be constantly maintained in response to ongoing transformations of the enterprise. In practice, EA models grow large and are difficult to maintain, since many stakeholders from various backgrounds have to contribute architecture-relevant information. EAM literature and two practitioner surveys conducted by the authors indicate that EA model maintenance, in particular the manual documentation activities, poses one of the biggest challenges to EAM in practice. Current research approaches target the automation of the EA documentation based on specific data sources. These approaches, as our systematic literature review showed, do not consider enterprise specificity of the documentation context or the variability of the data sources from organization to organization. The approach presented in this article specifically accounts for these factors and presents a situational method for EA documentation. It builds on four process-supported documentation techniques which can be selected, composed and applied to design an organization-specific documentation process. The techniques build on a meta-model for EA documentation, which is implemented in an EA-repository prototype that supports the configuration and execution of the documentation techniques. We applied our documentation method assembly process at a German insurance company and report the findings from this case study in particular regarding practical applicability and usability of our approach."

And then, Service Management Data Model (SMDM) is established to complete instantiation of metamodel by studying Share Information /Data (SID) Model. In this methodology, firstly, universal metamodel is established to ensure data sharing and reuse in SMS. Secondly, based on analysis of all kinds of information and process in SMS, core classes are defined to instantiate metadata classes and guarantee extendibility of SMDM. Each operational process can establish corresponding data model by definition of sub-class inheriting core class. Finally, data model of service quality monitoring is established to validate modeling methodology's validity. Therefore, consistency between SMDM and functional requirements is achieved and extension of business entities in SID is realized."
pub.1037642925,Towards Multi-perspective Modeling with BPMN,"BPMN is the prevalent process modeling language and a lot of domain-specific BPMN extensions have evolved during the last couple of years. Due to the plenty of extensions and elements within BPMN, it is promising to consider complexity reduction mechanisms in order to provide appropriate, purpose-specific views on BPMN models. We therefore analyze capabilities of BPMN in regard of the definition of additional perspectives and diagrams in order to provide dedicated views on aspects of business processes (e.g., separate resource diagrams). As both BPMN and BPMN-defining MOF reveal shortcomings regarding to the definition of perspectives, we introduce a BPMN meta model extension in order to allow an integrated definition of new perspectives and their respective graphical elements. We further provide methodical guidance by conducting and customizing the BPMN extension method of Stroppi et al. (2011)."
pub.1031095795,An architecture for the interoperability of workflow models,"The goal of this work is to contribute to the field of interoperability of Workflow models. To achieve interoperability, we have built a generic architecture that addresses three levels of abstraction: a common meta-model that the Workflow models must share, a common model that they enact collectively, and a common data model whose management is shared. So, the approach we have adopted is based on a strategy of uniformity to solve the problems related to the semantic, syntactic and execution platform heterogeneity. The common meta-model gathers the common concepts that are shared between Workflow models and it defines their semantics. Common concepts (activity, event, etc.) that are extracted from different formalisms used in the field of business process (or Workflow) allow us to instantiate a canonical model that describes only common parts (activities, artifacts). As for the common data model, it is instantiated by the common model. For the control interoperability, we have adopted an approach that deals with a flexible connection mechanism based on events through a connection server. This approach can be implemented above any interoperability platform (CORBA, EJB, etc.). Moreover, the shared canonical model that we have proposed is generic, simple and re-usable."

Adaptation of cloud computing services for robotic applications is relatively straightforward while adaptation of underlying ideas will require a new design attitude. Cloud computing is a cost-effective and dynamic business model. Currently cloud robotics is understood as a client server methodology which enables robots utilize resources and services placed at centralized servers. These cloud servers treat robots as any other client computer offering them platform, infrastructure, process or algorithm as a service. HTM5 is an OMG MDA based multi-view meta-model for agent oriented development of cloud robotic systems. HTM5 encourages design of peer-to-peer service ecosystems based on an open registry and matchmaking mechanism. In peer-to-peer cloud robotics, a robot can trade its hardware, software and functional resources as a service to other robots in the ecosystem. The peer-to-peer trade in such systems may be driven by contracts and relationships between its member agents. This article discusses trade-view model of HTM5 methodology and its use in developing a cloud robotic ecosystem that implements peer-to-peer, contract based economy. The article also presents a case study with experiments that implement distributed artificial intelligence and peer-to-peer service oriented trade on simulated and real robot colonies."

Extended Reality (XR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Mirror World technologies are important technological pathways for the metaverse. The metaverse concept is changing organizational structures with new opportunities and shaping the workforce for the future environment. The purpose of this review article is to discuss the concept of metanomics, the business implications of the metaverse in the context of the economy, business and employee-based value, future workforce, B2B opportunities and new business models. The concept of metaptation was associated with the metaverse in later studies to be conceptualized within the framework of adaptation theory. This review concludes by asserting that as the metaverse continues to evolve, driven by advancements in XR, AR, MR, and Mirror World technologies, it will not only revolutionize traditional business models but also necessitate a new paradigm of metaptation, where businesses must continuously adapt to harness the full potential of the metaverse in the realms of economic growth, innovative B2B opportunities, workforce development, and customer engagement. In order to be successful in this dynamic change process, businesses should adopt a strategic approach to adopting these innovative technologies. These strategic steps of businesses will contribute to gaining competitive advantage by enabling them to make the most of the commercial potential of the Metaverse."

To overcome this problem, a service matchmaking process should use the semantics of both the service and the user. Hence, we propose the G +  conceptual model that explicitly captures the service/user objectives, scenarios and contexts. Scenarios capture the required snapshots of the service/user behaviour. Based on the G +  model, we introduce the PILLAR conceptual model that captures multiple semantic descriptions of the service. The PILLAR concept is also used to semantically model the user request. Different domain ontologies could be used to provide a service/user PILLAR models with the basic vocabulary. Consequently the ontology mapping process becomes fundamental during the matching process. Hence, we propose an ontology meta-structure to facilitate the ontology mapping process. PILLAR explicitly captures the semantics of both the service and the user creating a framework for more precise service semantic discovery process."
pub.1025384340,Towards a Method for Business Networking,"Translating the key success factors developed in Chapter 13 into implemented processes and appUcations represents a major challenge. In order to reach Business Networking goals, such as improved customer care or reduced inventories, business partners have to be convinced, business processes among the partners have to be agreed upon, and the strategic and process scenario has to be translated into enabUng IT applications. Some of the specific questions which arose in the various cases discussed in previous chapters are:
What is a proven sequence for proceeding in a Business Networking project? What are the major steps and what are suitable techniques for ensuring quick and successful implementation?Which networking scenario (cf. Chap. 3.3) and strategy (cf. Chap. 4) meets our goals? What is the return on investment of this solution?Are partners needed to realize the solution? How is the participation of future users ensured and how are partner relationships organizedWhat applications are chosen and how can they be integrated into existing system landscapes? What are the implications of the networking solution for the overall application and service architecture?"
pub.1155419388,Applying an ecosystem lens to low-carbon energy transitions: A conceptual framework,"Business model innovations aiming at systemic change influence the speed and direction of low-carbon transitions, thus supporting public decarbonization policies. However, their potential is often limited by institutional settings or a lack of alignment with potential partners. Therefore, to exploit the potential for systemic change of business model innovations in socio-technical systems, it is necessary to consider their interactions with their wider environment. In this conceptual study, we explore the mechanisms through which business activities interact with public policy goals under low-carbon energy transitions. We take an ecosystem lens to analyze value creation at the levels of customers, business, inter-organizational networks and the public. Based on an integrative literature review, we build a conceptual meta-model specifying the constitutive elements, dynamics and environmental dimensions describing regional energy ecosystems under transition. The main constitutive element of the ecosystem is the value network, i.e. the interlinked business models of collaborating organizations exchanging money, goods, services, information or intangible benefits. The value network interacts dynamically with a pool of resources (assets, capabilities and intangible resources) that improves the ecosystem's ability to enact systemic change. Orchestration is a crucial process to steer the ecosystem's development towards creating value for customers as well as for the public. Finally, the relevant environmental dimensions include policy, culture, markets, industry structure as well as potential future members or resources. We illustrate our conceptual model with the case of the development of low-carbon district heating to decarbonize space heating in a Swiss city. This illustrative case study shows that the ecosystem perspective combined with public value theory is well suited to describe the dynamics of a low-carbon energy transition and provides valuable insights on the prospects of novel business models."
pub.1029924109,Aspects Based Modeling of Web Applications to Support Co-evolution,"When an information system is introduced to an organisation it changes the original business environment thus changing the original requirements. This can lead to changes to processes that are supported by the information system. Also when users get familiar with the system they ask for more functionality. This gives rise to a cycle of changes known as co-evolution. One way to facilitate co-evolution is to empower end-users to make changes to the web application to accommodate the required changes while using that web application. This can be achieved through meta-design paradigm. We model web applications using high level abstract concepts such as user, hypertext, process, data and presentation. We use set of smart tools to generate the application based on this high-level specification. We developed a hierarchical meta-model where an instance represent a web application. High level aspects are used to populate the attribute values of a meta-model instance. End-user can create or change a web application by specifying or changing the high level concepts. This paper discusses these high level aspects of web information systems. We also conducted a study to find out how end-users conceptualise a web application using these aspects. We found that end-users think naturally in terms of some of the aspects but not all. Therefore, in meta-model approach we provided default values for the model attributes which users can overwrite. This approach based on meta-design paradigm will help to realise the end-user development to support co-evolution."
pub.1024227832,The BPM lifecycle,"
                    Purpose
                    The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that incorporates factors external to the organization into the business process management (BPM) lifecycle through dynamic capabilities (DCs), beginning with strategy and persisting through the business process transformation.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The study comprised four distinct phases. First, a literature review was conducted to identify validated theoretical models related to the topic. Then, a systematic review of the literature was conducted by accessing the EBSCOhost, ISI/Web of Science and Scopus databases, for the purpose of understanding how the relationship between BPM and DCs has been addressed. The third step was the identification of the meta-capabilities involved in the relationship between DC and BPM, the fourth step was the construction of a framework that integrated an external view into BPM through DC, and the final step evaluated these framework through a case study.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Ten texts were selected after a systematic literature review. The following main points of convergence were identified: DC contributes to the conceptualization and understanding of BPM, DC assists in the process of organizational change by promoting the adaptation of the company to the environment, and DC enhances BPM performance. A framework was developed and presented.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The proposed framework, which incorporates an external perspective into the BPM lifecycle through DCs, can be used by managers and researchers interested in the promotion of BPM.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    The study shows how the sensing, seizing and transforming meta-capabilities can act to evaluate the outside-in perspective, serve as a benchmark for the alignment of business processes and enable the operationalization of emerging demands through the dynamic adaptation of processes.

pub.1163915678,Beta tourist world: a conceptual framework for organizing an event in the metaverse,"The relationships between metaverse applications and tourism can be categorized into two dimensions. One is about the effects of metaverse applications on the real entities in the tourism sector and the second is about the effects of metaverse applications on the meta entities in the tourism sector. These dimensions create a new ecosystem for tourism which encompass brand new stakeholders with new business models. Providing new and creative touristic products in the metaverse environment, revising existing touristic products in a way that will provide different experiences, and structuring beta tourist world are the ways of creating a very deep new touristic universe which is a combination of meta tourism universes. This study provides a framework for tourism businesses, especially hotels, aspiring to exist in the metaverse to host an event. The framework provides a system development life cycle model which explains step-by-step how to establish a concert world in the metaverse. The framework starts with the planning process, which includes personnel, software, hardware, data and objectives, and continues with the analysis process covering preparation, implementation and evaluation stages. The framework is complemented by the design, development and implementation processes. The case study is based on the organization of an event, namely a concert, in the metaverse within the context of a hotel. The new framework is significant in that it sheds light onto new business models and how stakeholder roles take place in the metaverse."

Thus, domain-specific extensions of the BPMN are facilitated. This research article provides an overview of BPMN extension development by the descriptive analysis and classification of 30 BPMN extensions. An extensive literature review was conducted in order to find published extensions. Further, a classification framework was designed to enable a comprehensive analysis of each extension. The analysis showed, that four out of five extensions are not compliant with the BPMN standard. Also, we found several methodological shortcomings that should be tackled in further research."
pub.1115214626,User-Centered and Privacy-Driven Process Mining System Design for IoT,"Process mining uses event data recorded by information systems to reveal the actual execution of business processes in organizations. By doing this, event logs can expose sensitive information that may be attributed back to individuals (e.g., reveal information on the performance of individual employees). Due to GDPR organizations are obliged to consider privacy throughout the complete development process, which also applies to the design of process mining systems. The aim of this paper is to develop a privacy-preserving system design for process mining. The user-centered view on the system design allows to track who does what, when, why, where and how with personal data. The approach is demonstrated on an IoT manufacturing use case."
pub.1041088141,Goal-Oriented Analysis and Agent-Based Design of Agile Supply Chain,"In dynamic enterprise environment, it is a pressing problem to reconfigure supply chain swiftly with the formation and dissolution of virtual enterprises. Multiagent technology provides a promising solution to this problem. In this paper, we present the approach for developing agent-based agile supply chain from goal-oriented analysis to agent-based design. To begin with, a meta-model used for the analysis and design of agile supply chain is given, which defines the abstract entities identified in the analysis and design phase as well as their relationship, such as goal, role, activity, rule and agents. In the analysis phase, the goal of supply chain is represented in AND-OR goal graph and then activities, roles and business rules are identified accordingly. In the design phase, roles are late binded (assigned) to agents and thus the analysis model can be reused. Finally, the architecture of multiagent supply chain based on CORBA platform is described."
pub.1130556063,Designing integrated Conceptual Model of Talent Management Using Meta-Synthesis Approach,"It is widely accepted that in the recent economic downturn, there are many demands for talent, and thus many organisations employ talent management systems to create a competitive advantage. The lack of an integrated talent management process, as a strategic approach, leads to a waste of time, effort, and money. The present study aims to provide an integrated model of talent management using the meta-synthesis approach. This study falls within the category of applied research in terms of purpose and meta-synthesis in terms of methodology. The researchers in this study, in a meta-synthesis way, have carefully scrutinised the topic and combined the findings of both quantitative and qualitative research studies. In this regard, 3615 research studies in the field of talent management and integrated talent management were selected by searching in Web of Science (2008-2018), Magiran, University of Tehran’s magazines, and international databases of papers and books; and finally, based on 106 studies underwent content analysis, dimensions and codes were extracted, and the significance and priority of each one were determined using the Shannon entropy. Based on research findings, management and planning codes for succession, learning, and talented employee involvement; organisational acceptance; and talent strategy relationship with business strategy, progression management, and organisational culture had the highest impact. Finally, according to the extracted components, the proposed model was presented."
pub.1147376929,Data-Aware Process Oriented Query Language,"The size of execution data available for process mining analysis grows several orders of magnitude every couple of years. Extracting and selecting the relevant data to enable process mining remains a challenging and time-consuming task. In fact, it is the biggest handicap when applying process mining and other forms of process-centric analysis. This work presents a new query language, DAPOQ-Lang, which overcomes some of the limitations identified in the field of process querying and fits within the Process Querying Framework. The language is based on the OpenSLEX meta model, which combines both data and process perspectives. It provides simple constructs to intuitively formulate questions. The syntax and semantics have been formalized and an implementation of the language is provided, along with examples of queries to be applied to different aspects of the process analysis."
pub.1150402058,Requirements-Based Composition of Tailored Decision Support Systems,"Corporate decision makers have individual requirements for decision support influenced by business goals, regulatory restrictions or access to resources such as data. Ideally, decision makers could quickly create tailored decision support systems (DSS) themselves which optimally address their individual requirements for decision support. Although service-oriented architectures have been proposed for DSS customization, they are primarily targeting trained software developers and cannot immediately be adapted by decision makers or domain experts with little to no software development knowledge. In this paper, we therefore motivate an assisted process-based service composition approach which can be used by non-developers to create tailored DSS. For assistance during service composition, we contribute a meta-model for the formalization of both decision support requirements and functionality of decision support services. Models created according to the meta-model can be used to detect mismatches between a decision maker’s requirements for decision support and services selected in the service composition representing a DSS. Furthermore, the formalizations may even be used for automated service composition given a decision maker’s decision support requirements. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our meta-model in the domain of regional energy distribution network planning."
pub.1011849983,A New Action Rule Syntax for DEmo MOdels Based Automatic worKflow procEss geneRation (DEMOBAKER),The current way of specifying Action Rules in the Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) is ambiguous and leads to incomplete specifications that do not contain enough ontological information so that we can more systematically convert DEMO models to comprehensive Business Process Management and Notation (BPMN). With our proposal we now can specify – still at an ontological level – much more needed details and essential information for a more complete and close to automatic generation of BPMN models. Action rules are also the perfect spot to already specify functional and implementation requirements for the information systems supporting the Workflow Management System running such BPMN models. Thus we also contribute to bridge the huge gap between DEMO models and important implementation issues that arise at design time and should immediately be specified together with ontological elements.
pub.1123453527,Meta description of female business engagement scenarios,"This article contains a meta-analysis of representations of the main models of recruiting women into the field of professional business in European, English language and Russian periodical press. The aim of this study is to systemize the theoretical-conceptual and practical aspects of reproducing certain means of recruitment into the economic elite, as well as the restrictions which women face when choosing a professional development trajectory. A meta-description of the career paths of those women who established themselves in the entrepreneurial field allows for reconstructing women’s scenarios of choosing and forwarding their career in business, as well as for constructing a typology of narrative strategies which affect women’s choices in professional development trajectories in the context of different countries. The empirical basis for this study consists of full-text articles from periodical and serial publications in leading foreign and domestic academic journals. Using critical discourse analysis of articles and open data allows for reconstructing the significance of gender aspects when it comes to choosing a career in business, as well as for tracing the influence of the context of developing female entrepreneurship on recruitment mechanisms in various countries. The results of the empirical study show that the representation of mechanisms for recruiting women into the professional environment is differentiated in different ways in English language and Russian periodic press. Peculiarities inherent to different countries are one of the factors which affect the development of business trajectories specific to certain regions. In Europe a discourse-system education prevails as the most adequate means for establishing oneself in the economic field. Eastern Asian countries mostly focus on the immigration process. In Russia we see gender labeled strategies in leadership positions. The manner in which recruitment mechanisms are pitched also varies: European articles mostly focus on positive trends and representing the discourse of successful business cases, while Russian periodical press concentrates on the obstacles and restrictions women have to deal with when choosing a career path. The narratives used for reconstructing the mechanisms for recruiting women into the realm of business, together with the terminology chosen by the authors of this article, confirm a positive representation of female entrepreneurship in Europe, an ambiguous nature of the business environment in countries of the Far East, and a certain degree of underdevelopment in Russia’s segment."
pub.1072435572,Managing Functional Safety Processes for Automotive E/E Architectures in Integrated Model-Based Development Environments,"The international standard ISO 26262 for functional safety of road vehicles claims processes and requirements for the entire product lifecycle of automotive electric and electronic systems. The demanded activities and work products within the standard are highly interconnected. Additionally, references to exemplarily external quality management standards or commonly recognized industry sources are given. Therefore, the application of functional safety processes in distributed development is challenging regarding description, understanding, analysis and planning of processes. To overcome these inconveniences, we provide a meta model extension for model-based architecture description languages regarding process description, organizational structures and resource assignment. This is related to the established “Business Process Model and Notation” (BPMN) according to ISO/IEC 19510:2013. Our integration in a domain specific environment for large-scaled electric and electronic (E/E) architectures provides graphical modeling of processes. The process model artifacts can be linked to data model artifacts of the E/E architecture. Additionally, analysis and planning based on the process model is supported. As a research case study this was applied to the functional safety processes described in ISO 26262."

To achieve this a descriptive research approach was used, guided by a systematic review of literature from 2016 to 2022. Among the 4037 studies initially identified, only 69 were deemed relevant. Meta‐synthesis was then used to systematically identify, categorize, and quantify fundamental constructs inherent in the models from the relevant literature. As a result of this process, 406 constructs were identified across six thematic categories. These were subsequently integrated to develop a conceptual model that can be used to coordinate strategies to harness the potential of the 4IR towards a future‐ready business. Findings show that the role of technology adoption remains pertinent in the ever‐digitized world in which businesses operate and certain constructs are key to explain, support, and predict enterprise‐wide adoption in the 4IR paradigm. Future studies can expand and test the model to promote digital fluency required by business constituents, noting differences across sectors."
pub.1041955703,Ontological Analysis of Business Systems Analysis Techniques,"For many years in the area of business systems analysis and design, practitioners and researchers alike have been searching for some comprehensive basis on which to evaluate, compare, and engineer techniques that are promoted for use in the modelling of systems’ requirements. To date, while many frameworks, factors, and facets have been forthcoming, most of them appear not to be based on a sound theory. In light of this dilemma, over the last 10 years, attention has been devoted by researchers to the use of ontology to provide some theoretical basis for the advancement of the business systems modelling discipline. While the selected ontologiesare reasonably mature, it is the actual process of an ontological analysis that still lacks rigour. The current procedure leaves room for individual interpretations and is one reason for criticism of the entire ontological analysis. This chapter proposes an enhanced procedural model for the ontological analysis based on the use of meta-models, the involvement of more than one coder and metrics. This model is explained with examples from various ontological analyses."

Fully observed recursive mixed process model. Findings. Results show that (i) extraversion positively predicts turnover and that (ii) openness does not predict turnover. Moreover, comparing size effects between studies reveals that only extraversion has significantly more positive effect on employee turnover, which is in contradiction with previous meta-analysis. Theoretical implications. This research identifies a plausible boundary condition – national culture – in examining how a person’s personality impact employee turnover in organizations. It highlights the shortcomings of previous meta-analysis that failed to incorporate differences in societal values and business contexts and identifies. Practical implications. In studying cultural contexts and value congruencies, this study contributes to the international human resources literature by identifying boundary conditions that explain how personality impacts employee turnover. Originality/Value. This study is the first to analyze the effects of personality on turnover using a within-individual unfolding and holistic model. Research limitations/Future research.

This issue has mainly been investigated in the context of intra-organizational processes but it received little attention in the context of Inter-organizational Processes (IoP), which correspond to processes crossing the boundaries of companies. This paper deals with IoP flexibility modeled as collaborations and choreographies in BPMN, advocating a version-based approach. Firstly, the paper introduces the provided extensions to BPMN 2.0 meta-model to take into account the notion of version considering both static and dynamic aspects of collaboration versions.

Ponomarev - Student, Business Informatics MSc Program, National Research University Higher School of Economics; Software Engineer, Intel CorporationAddress: 25/12, Bolshaya Pecherskaya Street, Nizhny Novgorod, 603155, Russian FederationE-mail:nik4nikita@gmail.com Enterprise architecture design is a complex process which makes it possible to synchronize the capabilities and needs of business and information technologies (IT). It can be achieved by clarifying the understanding and formalization of the business processes and the interaction of the elements of the system through their formal description. The large number of interacting business processes and enterprise architecture entities raises the question of verifying their correctness. Therefore, it is necessary to formalize the requirements for architecture and be able to automatically verify them. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting logical contradictions in enterprise architecture models based on a model checking approach adopted in the context of business modeling. As an enterprise architecture description language, we use the modern open and independent ArchiMate standard. Developed by The Open Group, the standard provides a general specification for business processes, organizational structures, information flows, IT-systems and the technical infrastructure description of the enterprise. As a verifier, the language and tools of the MIT Alloy Analyzer system were chosen; they facilitate analysis of model constraints in terms of relational logic by automatically generating structures that satisfy the requirements of a logical model. In this paper, we propose to simplify and automate the process of specification and verification of enterprise architecture domain models using Archi - the visual editor for ArchiMate models. We have developed the editor plug-in which translates the enterprise architecture models into the language of the MIT Alloy Analyzer system and uses the meta-model of the ArchiMate specification as the basis for constructing specific domain models. The proposed method and software solutions have been tested using the ArciSurance case and their enterprise architecture model.The research was carried out with financial support of Russian Fund of Basic Research No. 16-06-00184 A “Development and investigation models of online-discussion based on materials of political news”"

The Enhydra Shark from the existing WfMS shows the process records on the web client by the allocated activities during the designing process of the process log for the sake of the process monitoring. In WfMOpen, the documentation on the definition of the process is complication and insufficient, and there is no interacting part with other work flow services. Therefore, it rather provides services in accordance with the process result information that was allocated during the previous designing, rather than the monitoring of the changes by the influence of the external environment. In this paper we propose a system, which can interpret and monitoring to the result of each business acts follows in change of external environment. The proposed system applies a meta-heuristic genetic algorithms which to reduce additional load and to acquire the accuracy of system information. In addition, the similarity with the activities, dependency, and correlation are examined to find similar process model, and then the relevancy is extracted by using the event property information.

pub.1108010157,An Ensemble-based p2p Framework for the Detection of Deviant Business Process Instances,"The problem of discriminating “deviant” traces (i.e. traces diverging from normal/desired outcomes, such as frauds, faults) in the execution log of a business process can be faced by extracting a classification model for the traces, after mapping them onto some suitable feature space. An ensemble-learning approach was recently proposed that trains multiple base learners on different vector-space views of the given log, and a probabilistic meta-model that combines the predictions of the discovered base classifiers. However, the sequential centralised implementation of this learning approach makes it unsuitable for real applications, where large volumes of traces are produced continuously, while both deviant and normal behaviours tend to change over the time. We here propose an online deviance detection framework that leverages a novel incremental learning scheme, which extracts different base models from different chunks of a trace stream, and dynamically combines them in an ensemble model. Notably, the system is based on a p2p architecture that allows it to distribute the entire learning procedure among multiple nodes and to exploit the power of HPC resources (e.g. cloud computing environments). Preliminary tests on a real-life log confirmed the validity of the approach, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency."

In this paper a formal process modeling language is developed which incorporates IEB (Integrated Enterprise Balancing)/4R (Risk, Return, Regulation, Reporting) requirements formulated by Faisst and Buhl [FaBu05]. This is realized through the inclusion of 4R elements and 4R relations into the new 4R process modeling language. An evaluation of the process modeling language with regard to the assessment criterion “feasibility of implementation” was successfully executed using the meta modeling platform ADONIS. For that purpose the ADONIS modeling language for business processes (ADONIS BPMS) was extended with additional 4R modeling elements. Furthermore a new model type as well as required classes and relation classes have been developed which enable the connection of the 4R process modeling language to the research results of the above mentioned contribution."

pub.1094100244,A Traceable Maturity Assessment Method Based on Enterprise Architecture Modelling,"Maturity assessments of business processes and capabilities are powerful tools for organizational improvement. Business process modelling is a key activity in the assessment of organizational maturity and capability of processes. How-ever, the resulting models are complex and can often not be communicated successfully to the organizational stakeholders. Similarly, assessment methods rely strongly on the expertise of the assessors translating their perception of an organization into an assessment outcome. These assessments often carry a subjective component and are hard to compare. Moreover, they lack efficient traceability mechanisms as organizations evolve. Additionally, mainstream methods such as ISO 15504 and SCAMPI are complex, expensive and resource demanding, which place them out of reach for many organizations. This paper describes a research approach that builds on Enterprise Architecture models and IT Governance frameworks to guide the definition of a simple process metamodel for maturity assessment. This simple meta-model is used to create an intermediary representation that can be communicated to stakeholders. A formal expression of maturity conditions in SPARQL queries increases the objectivity of the assessment and separates it from the collected and formalized evidence. We discuss our model and method and report on a preliminary case study."
pub.1021273583,Meta web service: building web-based open decision support system based on web services,"Web services are currently one of the trends in network-based business services, which intuitively will be applied to build a semantic web-based decision support system (DSS). Since web services are self-contained, modular business process applications, based on open standards, enable integration models for facilitating program-to-program interactions. Decision modules in a semantic web-based DSS can be viewed as a web service. However, according to the current features, web services know only about themselves, they are neither autonomous, nor are they designed to use ontologies; they are passive until invoked, and they do not provide for composing functionalities. These lead to the motivation on building a sophisticated web service to contain these features and to utilize web services on behalf of the user. This paper aims to propose a new concept of Meta Web Service, a web service-based DSS. The meta web service understands the user's problem statement with ontology, performs web service discovery, web service composition, and automatically generates codes for composite web service execution. Case-based reasoning is applied to quickly find past histories of successful service compositions. A prototype of research web service has been developed to show the feasibility of the proposed idea."
pub.1136591971,Privacy-aware Process Performance Indicators: Framework and Release Mechanisms,"Process performance indicators (PPIs) are metrics to quantify the degree with
which organizational goals defined based on business processes are fulfilled.
They exploit the event logs recorded by information systems during the
execution of business processes, thereby providing a basis for process
monitoring and subsequent optimization. However, PPIs are often evaluated on
processes that involve individuals, which implies an inevitable risk of privacy
intrusion. In this paper, we address the demand for privacy protection in the
computation of PPIs. We first present a framework that enforces control over
the data exploited for process monitoring. We then show how PPIs defined based
on the established PPINOT meta-model are instantiated in this framework through
a set of data release mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to provide
provable guarantees in terms of differential privacy. We evaluate our framework
and the release mechanisms in a series of controlled experiments. We further
use a public event log to compare our framework with approaches based on
privatization of event logs. The results demonstrate feasibility and shed light
on the trade-offs between data utility and privacy guarantees in the
computation of PPIs."
pub.1008533159,A meta-model of information systems to support reverse engineering,"Maintenance of large information systems typically suffers from a failure to fully understand both the software and the broader context in which it operates. In particular, effective maintenance requires knowledge of not only the source code, but also user documentation, system design and the business goals and objectives the system aims to support. The Esprit docket project seeks to develop an integrated set of tools, and supporting method of use, to enable software maintainers to gain a richer understanding of a software system and its components. This is achieved by enhancing traditional, reverse engineering tools with other sources of knowledge, such as test cases, documentation and user expertise, in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of a system. Underpinning the docket toolset is an organizational meta-model called the Global System Model. This model seeks to represent all aspects of an information system, necessary for system understanding and software maintenance, at different levels of abstraction. This paper presents the Global System Model and discusses its benefits to the software maintenance process. The associated issues and characteristics of the model are also examined."

pub.1094808175,A process-driven content-oriented integration framework for knowledge management systems,"A process-driven content-oriented integration framework is proposed for knowledge management systems and enterprise content management applications to perform effective content based integration in service-oriented computing environment. The framework consists of workflow engine, OSGi framework based kernel, content repository for Java technology API compliant content repository, enterprise service bus and content based service activation component. Complex content related business logics are encapsulated in processes executed and managed by workflow engine. The service activators use data stream processor to analyze content and activate processes according to the service meta-data model which defines the mapping relationship between content fragments and processes. The lifecycle of components and services and their dependency relationship are managed by OSGi framework and communication among processes and services is served by a distributed Java business integration compliant enterprise service bus, thus a service-oriented, modularized and scalable integration infrastructure can be achieved as well as the load-balancing capability. Distributed context management that is built upon distributed cache replicates context objects automatically among multiple containers and provides a clustering, uniform and distributed Java Business Integration compliant enterprise service bus transparent context view."
pub.1155965815,XL-BPMN Model-Based Service Similarity Measurement Technique,"In service-oriented developments, existing studies do not give lots of efforts on a formalized and systematic method for measuring similarities between services for their reuse in business models. This deteriorates the reusability of the constructed service due to the developers’ intuition and informal service analyses. In this paper, we propose a technique for measuring similarity of services by analyzing syntax and semantics between services in the eXtended Layered business process modeling notation (XL-BPMN) model. First of all, the profiles of the formalized attributes for specifying services are defined, and the criteria for determining service similarities are established. To measure similarity between services, a technique both a syntactic similarity analysis facilitated by the XL-BPMN model-based edge counting method and a semantic similarity analysis based on meta data registry (MDR)-applied service attributes is specified. To automate analysis, a tool that can support the semantic similarity analysis technique is implemented. An online shopping mall system is investigated and evaluated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The similarity measurement technique, which is further formalized at upper business levels, can improve the accuracy of service analyses and enhance service reusability by distinguishing services with high similarity levels as common services."
pub.1166949332,A Model-driven Approach for Knowledge-based Engineering of Industrial Digital Twins,"Digital twins are heralding a new paradigm in the process and manufacturing industries by providing real-time decision support for a range of key problems. Engineering digital twin solutions is a knowledge and effort intensive activity. In-depth knowledge of manufacturing plant, process operations, underlying physics, data, and technical problems is essential in the design of digital twin application for a given business objective. Industry domain experts, data scientists and solution developers must collaborate to build it with the required features and functionalities. Currently, it is not an easily scalable process. For each industry vertical and even for the same plant type, the development process has to be repeated manually. To address this, we present a model-driven knowledge-based approach where knowledge can be captured in a machine processible form and reasoned with, to systematically guide the solution development process. Knowledge is modelled at three levels of abstraction, namely, meta, plant type and plant instance. We describe how this helps in generalizing the knowledge, in driving the knowledge acquisition process, and in contextualizing knowledge to specific problem instances. We then outline how the captured knowledge can be exploited to guide various digital twin engineering tasks such as problem definition, model building (physics or data-driven), data preparation, algorithm selection, etc. In particular, we discuss how the approach helps in arriving at a detailed digital twin specification starting from a high-level business problem statement. We present a case study demonstrating the approach on a real-life industrial problem."

Information technology strategy planning is multistage process and information system development relies on implementation of each stage of IS lifecycle. A knowledge-based IS engineering proposed system modelling and decision-making tools and methods, which helps to expand more precise and comprehensive subject area corresponding to the project. Participants of IS project such as developer or programmer is allowed to use not only the knowledge of the project, which is collected in traditional CASE tool storage, but also the knowledge storage, where subject area knowledge is collected according to formal criteria. There have been made many efforts for the analysis of Unified Modelling Language (UML) models generation of diverse knowledge-based models combining frameworks, workflow patterns, modelling languages and natural language specifications. Knowledge-based subsystem as CASE tool component with Enterprise Meta-Model (EMM) and Enterprise Model (EM) within can significantly help with UML dynamic models generation using transformation algorithms. Application of the knowledge-based transformation algorithms grants the possibility to operate additional models validation methods that EMM determines. The main purpose of the paper is to present how EM can be used in UML models generation process. This paper combines results from previous researches and summarizes part of them. There is described importance of knowledge-based IS engineering in business and IT alignment process. There is also described UML models elements roles variations after generation from EM.

pub.1174020515,Process Oriented Knowledge Engineering: Reflections and Project Experiences,"Process oriented knowledge management started as a research topic around 2000. 2023 was counted year 1 of ChatGPT, this paper reflects how process oriented knowledge management evolved over the time by reflecting a series of research projects—mainly in the context of the EU Research Frame Programmes FP6, FP7, H2020 and HEU. A research topology consisting of (a) application scenario level, (b) model-based knowledge engineering level and (c) enabling IT environment level is used to structure the different initiatives. Three EU projects are introduced in more detail, discussing (1) Process Optimization in the FAIRWork project (HEU), (2) Process Digitization in the Change2Twin project (H2020) and (3) Process Deployment in the CloudSocket project (H2020). The corresponding support of knowledge management and engineering as well as the enabling IT-infrastructure are introduced. The reflection reasons that although the technology and algorithms massively evolved over the years, the underlying meta model to link knowledge management and engineering to organizational structures such as processes to ensure a targeted support has proven to be an appropriate assumption over the years."
pub.1028611149,Model-Driven Design Using Business Patterns,"Business applications are designed using profound knowledge about the business domain, such as domain objects, fundamental domain-related principles, and domain patterns. Nonetheless, the pattern community's ideas for software engineering have not impacted at the application level, they are still mostly used for technical problems. This book takes exactly this step: it shows you how to apply the pattern ideas in business applications and presents more than 20 structural and behavioral business patterns that use the REA (resources, events, agents) pattern as a common backbone. If you are a developer working on business frameworks, you can use the patterns presented to derive the right abstractions (e.g., business objects) and to design and ensure that the meta-rules (e.g., process patterns) are followed by the developers of the actual applications. And if you are an application developer, you can use these patterns to design your business application, to ensure that it does not violate the domain rules, and to adapt the application to changing requirements without the need to change the overall architecture. As with patterns in general, this approach allows for both more flexible and more solid software architectures and hence better software quality. ""It's a great book, marvelous in breadth and depth. An impressive achievement. I particularly liked the modeling handbook examples."" Bob Haugen, Business Technology Consultant and Contributor to REA standardization in ISO, UN/CEFACT and ebXML, UK ""I enjoyed reading it very much, it gave many new insights into REA and its applications.""

pub.1013165734,Geo-Distribution of Flexible Business Processes over Publish/Subscribe Paradigm,"An increasing amount of business processes are inherently knowledge-intense and require ad-hoc decision making. Flexible modeling approaches such as the Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) were designed to support such scenarios. At the same time, many processes involve participants and data from different organizations across the globe. Often, legal regulations such as data privacy render centralized execution engines impractical because data must be processed where it is collected. Instead, distributed approaches to coordinate process and data are necessary for supporting geo-scale execution. In this paper, we present a fully geo-distributed workflow engine that implements the core execution semantics of CMMN, the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model, and supports locality of process data by distributing data and control-flow management over a loosely-coupled publish/subscribe infrastructure. We present a novel context-aware mapping (CAM) of GSM into Workflow Units (WFUs), representing the unit of distribution in our system. We have developed our distributed workflow execution engine over PADRES, an enterprise-grade event management system. Evaluation results show that our approach scales well with process size and degree of distribution and that CAM improves throughput and latency by up to 5X compared to the baseline mapping (BLM)."
pub.1050872827,Developing domain-specific mashup tools for end users,"The recent emergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end user development, i.e., on enabling end users without programming skills to compose own applications. Yet, similar to what happened with analogous promises in web service composition and business process management, research has mostly focused on technology and, as a consequence, has failed its objective. Plain technology (e.g., SOAP/WSDL web services) or simple modeling languages (e.g., Yahoo! Pipes) don't convey enough meaning to non-programmers. We propose a domain-specific approach to mashups that ""speaks the language of the user"", i.e., that is aware of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is comfortable with. We show what developing a domain-specific mashup tool means, which role the mashup meta-model and the domain model play and how these can be merged into a domain-specific mashup meta-model. We apply the approach implementing a mashup tool for the research evaluation domain. Our user study confirms that domain-specific mashup tools indeed lower the entry barrier to mashup development."

Design/methodology/approach The mandatory elements of a method (MEM) framework is used to illustrate DFSS's maturity as a process redesign method. The use of DFSS in a BPM context is described through several action research case examples.   Findings This research specifies the procedure model (order of development activities), techniques, results, roles and information/meta model (conceptual data model of results) associated with using DFSS to address BPM-related challenges. The action research case examples provided discuss the details of implementing BPM using DFSS to design, implement and test redesigned processes to ensure they fulfill the needs of process participants.   Research limitations/implications While the case examples discussed were performed in only a few settings, which limits the generalizability of their results, they provide evidence regarding the wide range of domains in which the proposed DFSS-BPM approach can be applied and how the tools are used in different contexts.   Practical implications This research offers a road map for addressing the challenges practitioners often face with BPM lifecycle implementation.   Originality/value This research provides the first attempt to integrate DFSS as a complementary method for BPM lifecycle implementation. "
pub.1181145030,Optimization of office process task allocation based on deep reinforcement learning,"In office platforms, we often need to face the situation of a large number of parallel heterogeneous process tasks. This not only tests the ability of the task executors themselves, but also puts forward requirements for the performance of the collaborative scheduling system. Using the reinforcement learning method, combined with quantitative analysis such as collaborative coordination and slackness, and based on the Markov Bollinger theory, a multi-agent Bollinger model is proposed to realize the optimization scheduling system with overall process coordination and maximum completion time as the optimization objectives, thereby improving the overall execution efficiency. Taking the real business system process as the test scenario, under the same optimization objective, the reinforcement learning algorithm based on D3QN and DRL and the meta-heuristic algorithm based on ant colony are compared to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."
pub.1142693794,From Service-Orientation to Agile Development by Conceptually Linking Business IT Services and User Stories: A Meta-Model and a Process Fragment,"IT services are being built by IT departments and other service providers to address the core technological requirements of organizations. Even if these services solve operational issues, their adoption – because of their internal behavior – has a sustaining or non-sustaining impact on the (long term) strategy of the organization. This impact is called the Business and IT alignment (BITA); as such, it is problematic to estimate before the development of the service without a view on its design. To be properly done, BITA evaluation indeed needs details about the service run-time behavior. Conversely, the agile wave refrains from a detailed upfront software design; functions providing high operational value to users are indeed selected and built for one sprint at a time. The mismatch between a traditional service approach and an agile way of development is therefore quite obvious. The present paper proposes a method (called Agile-MoDrIGo) to reconcile these two approaches. For this purpose, it (i) decomposes services into epic user stories under the scope of which (user-level built) user stories can be mapped (i.e. functional alignment) and (ii) links services as (coarse-grained) conceptual elements along with the strategic objectives they sustain to fine-grained user story functional elements for value-driven prioritization (i.e. strategic alignment). The proposal is presented in the form of a meta-model and supported by a process fragment; it is validated on a case study in healthcare."

In such factories BPR (Business Process Engineering) usually takes place without the support of Modeling & Simulation although such methodologies have proved to be very effective and helpful. Main reasons for that have to be investigated in the high costs usually associated with a simulation study, especially for data collection, model building and model validation. In order to avoid this problem a general-purpose simulation framework was designed enabling self-build according to production process information stored in a relational database. Moreover, the simulation model was used in conjunction with a statistical analysis tool in order to build the relationship among selected parameters and the proposed objective function by mean of Response Surface Methodology and 2nd order regressions meta-models. Authors applied the proposed schema to several industrial applications obtaining interesting results."

This trend of using optimization and modeling techniques in various specific areas has led to the question of how widespread these approaches are overall in medical specializations. We compiled a list of 272 medical disciplines that we used as a search string with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) for a Web of Science database search. Thus, we found a total of 485 documents that we subjected to the exclusion criteria. We analyzed the remaining 108 articles using bibliometric and content analyses to find answers to three research questions. This systematic review was carried out using the procedure proposed by Kitchenham and following the Preferred Items of the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Report (PRISMA). Due to the broad scope of the medical field, it was no surprise that for almost 85% of the sought-after medical specializations, we could not identify any publications in the given database when applying the BPMN. We analyzed the impact of upgrades to the BPMN on publishing. The keyword analysis showed a diametrical difference between the authors’ keywords and the so-called “Keywords Plus”, and we categorized the publications according to the purpose of applying the BPMN. However, the growing interest in combining BPMN with other approaches brings new challenges in practice."

pub.1042838984,A Semi-automated Method for Capturing Consumer Preferences for System Requirements,"There is a pressing need in the modern business environment for business-supporting software products to address countless consumers’ desires, where customer orientation is a key success factor. Consumer preference is thus an essential input for the requirements elicitation process of public-facing enterprise systems. Previous studies in this area have proposed a process to capture and translate consumer preferences into system-related goals using the Consumer Preference Meta-Model (CPMM) used to integrate consumer values from the marketing domain into objectives of information systems. However, there exists a knowledge gap between how this process can be automated at a large scale, when massive data sources, such as social media data, are used as inputs for the process. To address this problem, a case in which social media data related to four major US airlines is collected from Twitter, is analyzed by a set of text mining techniques and hosted in a consumer preference model, and is further translated to goal models in the ADOxx modelling platform. The analysis of experimental results revealed that the collection, recognition, model creation, and mapping of consumer preferences can be fully or partly automated. The result of this study is a semi-automated method for capturing and filtering consumer preferences as goals for system development, a method which significantly increases the efficiency of large-scale consumer data processing."
pub.1021362305,Models for designing business situations in the context of mutations,"Firms are involved in strategic movements that generate alliances, mergers, acquisitions and divestitures of activities. In this cycle of mutations, change is continuous. Two firms can build an alliance, expand it to other firms, merge, or even dismantle all or any part of their activities. Between competition and cooperation, networks of activities are created and reorganized, contributing to corporate renewal. In such situations, how could information systems provide relevant information for managing mutations and how could they support the global redesign of the strategy, organization and management of firms? In this paper we first give an overview of the mutation process. Then we outline the principles and concepts of an integrated approach to strategy, organization and management in the context of mutations. Third, we present a meta‐model based on these principles and concepts that allows the information system to provide models for designing changing configurations of activities. The meta‐model can combine strategic, organizational and management thinking. Finally, we propose to look in more detail at the development phase of the mutation process.

pub.1040640471,Designing for Recombination: Process Design through Template Combination,"Process design remains an important yet difficult concern for postindustrial organizations. We posit that processes ‘become’ processes in these organizations only via their anchoring in concrete artifacts. Consequently, we identify and refine two design principles: processes as anchored in concrete material artifacts (not abstract process representations); and process design through recombination of existing processes (instead of designing anew). Our research starts by building a research artifact, ReKon, that instantiates these two principles. The paper describes this artifact with the meta-model, an implementation and the fine-granular process units, as template chunks created from ~1,200 real-world templates, to populate the tool. We revise and refine the design principles via successive cycles of implementation of the research artifact, formative evaluation with student teams, and insights obtained from an ongoing field study. We conclude by pointing to directions for future research."

To the best of our knowledge, most of these works have been addressing security rules verification after deployment phase and without taking into account security infrastructure generation, deducing the source code corresponding to the functional and non-functional aspect at the same time. In this current work, we have concentrated our efforts on non-functional components, business logic, and quality of services of the systems so that to reduce design mistakes and generating secure software applications that respect the criteria's of the software engineering qualities. To do that, we have proposed a new meta-model for Java platform allowing to improve the MDA methodology to inject the security architecture description and security properties verification during software development process. Therefore, security properties will be described in the form of secure models represented through Security profile and enriched through the Object Constraint Language designed to add the security constraints to security models. Basing on the new approach, an Intermediate Structural Model (ISM) is obtained from chosen Platform Specific Model (PSM) to enrich the functional code with other improvements instead generating the source code directly. In this context, ISM will be improved with security rules and constraints about confidentiality, availability, non-repudiation, data integrity, and data encryption after its generation from sequence diagram of system internal behavior that respects the proposed meta-model. Finally, the final code will be generated from sequence diagram of system's internal behavior such as application security configuration, methods signatures and their bodies, persistent entities, and the security objects."

In order to realise sharing and collaboration of manufacturing resources, a commonly unified resource model is needed to support expandability. Manufacturing service demands are classified into three different levels from a business point of view. Manufacturing services and grid nodes can then be divided correspondingly. Part and process features are used in describing service demands from the viewpoints of customers and production plans of manufacturers. The resulting unified meta-data model is based on the object-oriented concept. A standard and expandable resource model is established and a service match algorithm is developed based on service features. A simulation prototype of a mould manufacturing grid is demonstrated."
pub.1021365798,Decision making using time‐dependent knowledge: knowledge augmentation using qualitative reasoning,"Abstract In this paper we propose a method to enhance the performance of knowledge‐based decision‐support systems, knowledge of which is volatile and incomplete by nature in a dynamically changing situation, by providing meta‐knowledge augmented by the Qualitative Reasoning (QR) approach. The proposed system intends to overcome the potential problem of completeness of the knowledge base. Using the deep meta‐knowledge incorporated into the QR module, along with the knowledge we gain from applying inductive learning, we then identify the ongoing process and amplify the effects of each pending process to the attribute values. In doing so, we apply the QR models to enhance or reveal the patterns which are otherwise less obvious. The enhanced patterns can eventually be used to improve the classification of the data samples. The success factor hinges on the completeness of the QR process knowledge base. With enough processes taking place, the influences of each process will lead prediction in a direction that can reflect more of the current trend. The preliminary results are successful and shed light on the smooth introduction of Qualitative Reasoning to the business domain from the physical laboratory application. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
pub.1014013616,Managing Large Scale Reuse Across Multiple Software Product Lines,"For large scale applications in today’s competitive business environment, partial reuse at class, library, component or module level is still inadequate. Software product lines provide systematic reuse only within a product family. Better gains in productivity and high confidentiality can be achieved by large scale reuse across multiple product lines. This paper puts a methodical way, articulated as “Software Factory Automation”, which can manage reusable assets across distinct software product lines based on “domain specific kits” and “software asset meta model”. The approach is validated by analyzing the software asset reuse in two different product lines implemented in banking domain and practically used in real life. The results show that high level of reuse within and across multiple product lines can be achieved with the charted roadmap."
pub.1173662321,iDOCEM: defining a common terminology for object-centric event logging and data-centric process modelling,"In the business process lifecycle, models can be approached from two perspectives: on the one hand, models are used to create systems in the design phase, and on the other hand, systems in use produce (event) logs that are used to discover the models representing the structure of the systems. These discovered models can be the starting point of a new cycle of analysis, redesign, implementation, etc. Therefore, proper logging of implemented processes in line with system design is a critical element for process discovery. Recently, the consideration of the integration of data and process aspects has seen a surge in interest in both the model-for-design domain as in the automated-model-discovery domain. However, it seems that these domains use different conceptualizations of data/object-aware systems. A definition of how the captured event logs are related to the structure of the global system they are extracted from or are trying to discover is still missing. Especially the concept of an event needs to be aligned, as this is the main concept that the domains have in common. This paper investigates the concepts and terminology used in the different phases of the business process lifecycle: the design phase, the implementation phase (including the implementation of logging) and the discovery phase. The paper contains an extensive running example that is used to illustrate five misalignment issues. The main contribution of this paper is a meta-model that presents a unified terminology for modelling both domains and is demonstrated using the running example. The paper also shows how the concepts of iDOCEM relate to the concepts of a conceptual modelling approach and several event logging formats. iDOCEM is validated with the implementation of a log generator for the running case, demonstrating the feasibility of generating DOCEL-compliant logs from an application."
pub.1151469594,A Fuzzy Robust Programming Model for Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design with Efficiency-Oriented Multi-Objective Optimization,"Sustainable closed-loop supply chain (SCLSC) network design and decision-making is a critical problem for enterprises and organizations’ operations because of its excellent economic, environmental, and social performance. This article proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model with targets for minimum total cost, reduction in environmental damage, and maximum social responsibility. In order to deal with the uncertainty caused by the dynamic business environment, a fuzzy robust programming (FRP) approach is applied. Furthermore, an efficiency-oriented optimization methodology, hybridizing meta-heuristics and efficiency evaluation, is proposed to solve the developed multi-objective model and functions as auxiliary decision-making. Data envelopment analysis is applied to evaluate the sustainability performance of feasible solutions and calculate their efficiency. The efficiency can comprehensively reflect the sustainability performance and guide the evolution process of meta-heuristic algorithms. A numerical case validates the proposed FRP model and efficiency-oriented optimization methodology. The results demonstrate that with the proposed methodology, decision-makers not only can obtain a set of efficient schemes but also can determine the optimal scheme with the best sustainability performance."

This will initiate new business opportunities in providing these novel applications and services, which integrate efficiently IoT services into enterprise applications. The work presented here proposes an Agent-based approach for an effective integration of the IoT in enterprise systems. The proposed approach defines a new meta-model to describe this integration. Also, the paper presents an agent-based system architecture whose main goal is to address and tackle interoperability challenges in the context of IoT environments. Also, it solves the interoperability issues between heterogeneous Cloud services environments by offering a harmonized API."
pub.1134598721,Using Metamodels to Improve Model-Based Testing of Service Orchestrations,"Online model-based testing is one of the most suitable techniques to assess the proper behavior of service orchestrations. However, the diverse panorama in terms of modeling languages and test case generation tools is a limitation to widespread adoption. We advocate that the application of Model-Driven Engineering principles as meta-modeling and model transformation can cope with this problem, improving the interoperability of artifacts in the test case generation process, thus bringing benefits in case of agile development processes, where system and technology evolution is frequent. In this paper, we present our contribution to this idea, introducing i) a reference metamodel, which stores the business process behavior and the information to generate input models for testing tools, and ii) transformations from orchestration languages towards testing tools. The proposed approach is implemented in a testing framework and evaluated on a case study where multiple orchestrations are expressed in two languages. Also, the paper presents how test cases are appropriately generated and successfully executed, starting from an orchestration model as a consequence of successful transformations."

With the rapid development of information technology and electronic commerce applications, more and more people realized that only to promote the symmetries and transparency about information can provide more equal opportunities for various graduates. In order to solve the deficiency about existed employment management system, a core business scenario is proposed in the paper for the whole process of employment, which includes five roles, such as government, enterprise, university, student, and platform administrator. Based on analyzing the five meta-models for employment in dynamic e-Commerce, i.e., B2C for student, B2B for enterprise and university, C2C for personal society network, mobile Commerce and collaborative e-Commerce for employment application, a new dynamic e-Commerce model, enterprise-University- Student Trading Model (DEC-EUST) about recruitment for college graduates is proposed in the paper. Furthermore, an independent management platform for Campus Recruitment, XiaoZhen website, is designed, which integrates the five meta-model for employment channel and provides comprehensive information services for every platform role."
pub.1140406674,Silhouetting the Cost-Time Front: Multi-objective Resource Optimization in Business Processes,"The allocation of resources in a business process determines the trade-off between cycle time and resource cost. A higher resource utilization leads to lower cost and higher cycle time, while a lower resource utilization leads to higher cost and lower waiting time. In this setting, this paper presents a multi-objective optimization approach to compute a set of Pareto-optimal resource allocations for a given process concerning cost and cycle time. The approach heuristically searches through the space of possible resource allocations using a simulation model to evaluate each allocation. Given the high number of possible allocations, it is imperative to prune the search space. Accordingly, the approach incorporates a method that selectively perturbs a resource utilization to derive new candidates that are likely to Pareto-dominate the already explored ones. The perturbation method relies on two indicators: resource utilization and resource impact, the latter being the contribution of a resource to the cost or cycle time of the process. Additionally, the approach incorporates a ranking method to accelerate convergence by guiding the search towards the resource allocations closer to the current Pareto front. The perturbation and ranking methods are embedded into two search meta-heuristics, namely hill-climbing and tabu-search. Experiments show that the proposed approach explores fewer resource allocations to compute Pareto fronts comparable to those produced by a well-known genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization, namely NSGA-II."
pub.1010940785,Metamodelling Platforms,"The elements of an enterprise are managed more and more model-based. The state-of-the-art in the area of modelling of organisations is based on fixed metamodels. Product models are created by using product modelling environments, process models are created in business process modelling tools and organisational models are realised in personnel management tools. Web service models link these business models to information technology. They are created by using standardised languages and common ontologies. Information technology is modelled in tools supporting notions such as workflow or object-orientation. The models of the company’s strategy, goals and the appropriate measurements are described and monitored by using tools supporting management concepts such as Balanced Scorecard.Major requirements to an enterprise modelling platform are flexibility and adaptability. These are fulfilled by environments providing flexible metamodelling capabilities. The main characteristic of such environments is that the formalism of modelling—the metamodel—can be freely defined. This raises research issues on how to design, manage, distribute and use such metamodels on a syntactic as well as on a semantic level and how to integrate, run and maintain a metamodelling platform in a corporation’s environment.Platforms based on metamodelling concepts should support the following topics:
Engineering the business models & their web servicesDesigning and realizing the corresponding information technologyEvaluating the used corporation resources and assetsThis paper presents a framework for metamodelling platforms and gives some answers to the research issues stated above. As part of the framework flexible metamodel integration mechanisms, using meta-metamodels (meta2-models) and semantical mapping, are discussed. Additionally, a system architecture and the building blocks of a corporate metamodelling platform are described. Finally, best practices from three EU funded projects—REFINE, ADVISOR, and PROMOTE—all realised with industrial partners, are presented.The full version of the paper can be downloaded from http://www.dke.univie.ac.at/mmp"
pub.1154457399,From Business Objectives to Analytics and Machine Learning Solutions: A Framework for Conceptual Modeling,"Analytical methods and machine learning are progressively being incorporated into all kinds of information systems. Despite the excitement around these technologies, contemporary firms nonetheless have trouble utilizing them to fully use their data and solve the company's challenges. Businesses must deal with a variety of challenges while developing business analytics and machine learning solutions, including requirements elicitation, design, development, and implementation. Although conceptual modelling and requirements engineering approaches to the process are important and relevant, little study has been done in this area. In this paper a conceptual modelling framework for business analytics and machine learning solutions that is shown and evaluated. The framework consists of instantiations, meta-models, techniques, design patterns and catalogues, rules, and recommendations. It is made up of three modelling perspectives that each reflect a distinct aspect of a solution or the perspective of a different role in the creation of such systems. Through the capture of stakeholders, strategic goals, choices, questions, and necessary insights, the Business View aids in the elicitation of business analytical needs. The Analytics Design View, which largely focuses on machine learning solutions, aids in the design of the solution by collecting algorithms, metrics, and quality criteria."
pub.1026296345,TelCoW: telework under the co-ordination of a workflow management system,"Telework is considered as an innovative work organization form for new decentralized structures. The flexibility of telework in both time and location of task execution must make it possible to take advantage of this work organization for company competitiveness. Today, telework is mainly used for isolated tasks and for those with only few cross-references to others. But telework will only achieve its full potential if attention is given to the fact that work in companies is normally co-operative work. For this co-operative work, business process modeling and workflow management is accepted as a supporting methodology. On the one hand this is important for enabling a production company to distribute work to employees who operate within this organizational model, and at the same time, compared with conventional models of organizing work, to increase the productivity of task execution. The increasing effort for co-ordination and monitoring is seen to be the main obstacle of co-operative telework. The use of existing workflow management systems for the support of co-operative telework is currently not possible; there is no tool available with specific co-ordination and planning functionality for this purpose. In this paper, we will define a specific business process model which is oriented for the modeling of decentralized structures especially for telework and the direct support by a workflow management system (WFMS). Compared to traditional WFMSs, our system is extended by a module for the planning and monitoring functionality required for monitoring of teleworkers and their time management. The distribution of work is supported by means of a co-ordinator as a constituent part of the WFMS. It executes workflows which are provided by a certain method for modeling business processes. This method already considers necessary refinements in passing over business processes to workflows. The models for business processes are supplied by means of a meta-model, which is extended by aspects of telematics. The system is built using Internet technology and uses platform-independent WWW software for the user interface."
pub.1031783679,Engineering Adaptive IT Service Support Processes Using Meta-modeling Technologies,"IT service support is a process-oriented practice that strives to manage the efficient supply of IT services with guaranteed quality. Many organizations adopt best practices and tools in order to improve the maturity of IT service support processes. However, when existing solutions and methodologies are applied in various organizations, the customization efforts and costs are usually large. And also dynamic changes during IT service support process execution can’t be supported by almost all of the existed tools. Furthermore, process model integration, reuse and exchange still remain challenges in IT service support process modeling area. In this context, an IT service support process metamodel is presented in this paper. The metamodel extends a generic business process definition metamodel – BPDM, through its domain characteristics. Based on the proposed metamodel, we develop a flexible IT service support process engineering platform, which integrates and automates IT service support processes including incident, problem, change, release and configuration management. In contrast to other IT service support tools, besides process modeling and enactment, it can evolve the metamodel, interchange process models with other tools through metamodel parsing adapter flexibly, and also support adaptive process management via metamodel-based ECA rules."
pub.1164536097,"COmmunity-Government, and Private Partnership (CGPP): Revisiting the Concept of Community-Based Forest Management","The Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM) model has been seen as a potential solution to solve various problems related to forest degradation and the creation of inclusive forest governance. However, in practice, CBFM does not always implement smoothly, with some studies highlighting the weaknesses of CBFM in term of accountability, transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, empowerment, monitoring, law enforcement, and dependency on external actors. Accordingly, this paper revisits the concept of CBFM from the perspective of New Institutional Economics and the proper governance concept. The data collection process was conducted through literature studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) methodology. It may be argued that the implementation of CBFM has weaknesses in terms of, amongst other things, business and organizational activities, inclusivity, community empowerment, community income, and sustainability. In reference to the various flaws encountered in the implementation of CBFM, and to put in place proper governance in forest business activities, this paper proposes a new model – the so-called Community-Government and Private Partnership model (CGPP). This developed model has positioned the cooperative as ""core institutions"" whose role is to orchestrate five main governance functions, namely: organizational, business activities, human resource development, and corporate and environmental sustainability. This CGPP model is expected to contribute to the existing literature of institutional analysis and forest management with a different approach, as well providing concrete recommendations for the implementation of the CGPP model in CBFM."
pub.1135124585,Research on Information Association and Fusion of Product Design based on Digital Twin,"The association and fusion of multidimensional information is the key to establishing the whole digital twin system. In view of the fact that digital twins lack of data interaction and linkage between physical domain and information domain in the whole life cycle, which cannot meet the demand of rapid driving of multi-dimensional information of digital twin products. In order to support product design, this paper studies the modeling framework of digital twins first, and proposes a product design modeling framework including physical layer, model layer, information layer and application layer. Then, based on the meta-modeling method, the digital twin design meta-model is defined, which includes business metadata, data model and associated metamodel. Meanwhile, a unified description model for the whole life cycle of digital twins is constructed, which includes the relational sets of metadata models such as process, resources, knowledge and products. The data interaction between physical entities and digital twins is completed, which solves the problems of data interaction between physical domains and information domains, data exchange and information sharing among heterogeneous models, and realizes the association and fusion of multi-dimensional information in the whole life cycle of digital twins."
pub.1146943169,Model-based data integration along the product & service life cycle supported by digital twinning,"Currently, a mega-trend on digitization and servitization using digital technologies and digital twins to support digital (business) transformation can be observed. In literature, emerging digital technologies are considered as an enabler for the creation of additional value, the strengthening of the customer relationship, and as an accelerator of the servitization process in manufacturing. The introduction of such technologies may result in adaptations of the product & service life cycle as well as the business model. A generic product & service life cycle consisting of four phases – design, simulation, manufacturing, and usage of products and services – serves as a foundation for the integration of digital technologies and related data. It can be observed that there is a gap with respect to data integration between the manufacturing and the usage of products and services. A model-based approach including digital twinning is applied to bridge this gap and to show how data can be integrated along the product & service life cycle. The conceptual approach of such a model-based digital twin environment is presented in form of a meta model. To depict how the integration could be eased and guided in manufacturing, findings of the European project Change2Twin, where a digital twin is established for a paint production pilot, are introduced. This industrial manufacturing pilot was supported by production process models. Additionally, a physical experiment was created to raise awareness for the challenges of digitization and servitization."

P2P agencies also have problems such as absconded with ill-gotten gains and out of business. Therefore, it is necessary to assess their risks based on P2P company data. This paper proposes a framework of Data-driven Risk Assessment for P2P(DRAP2P) network lending agencies based on unstructured natural language data. First, use the natural language processing technology, such as word segmentation, keyword, LDA topic model, word2vec and doc2vec, to process and extract features of company profile which reflect its business status. Then, seven machine learning classifiers and three deep learning models are used for analysis. Since keywords show good performance in machine learning models, we improve Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with keywords and propose two CNN+Keyword models, namely CNN+Keyword(static+BP) and CNN+Keyword (Expand word embedding). Experiments have shown that CNN+Keyword(static+BP) can achieve the best performance. Finally, we use the method of meta-learning to integrate CNN+Keyword(static+BP) and logistic regression classifier to further strengthen the performance."
pub.1050414338,Deriving document workflows from feature models,"Despite the increasing interest in the Document Engineering community, a formal definition of document workflow is still to come. Often, the term refers to an abstract process consisting in a set of tasks to contribute to some document contents, and some techniques are being developed to support parts of these tasks rather than how to generate the process itself. In most proposals, these tasks are implicit in the business processes running in an organization, lacking an explicit document workflow model that could be analysed and enacted as a coherent unit. In this paper, we propose a document-centric approach to document workflow generation. We have extended the feature-based document meta-model of the Document Product Lines approach with an organiza-tional metamodel. For a given configuration of the feature model, we assign tasks to different members of the organization to con-tribute to the document contents. Moreover, the relationships between features define an ordering of the tasks, which may be refined to produce a specification of the document workflow model automatically. The generation of customized software manuals is used to illustrate the proposal."

However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture commoditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was iteratively developed in close collaboration with the firm’s practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems."

It aims at enabling the knowledge user to make better and faster daily business decisions. In order to supply a decisional database, meta-data is needed to enable the communication between various function areas of the warehouse and an ETL tool (Extraction, Transformation, and Load) is needed to define the warehousing process. The developers use a mapping guideline to specify the ETL tool with the mapping expression of each attribute. In this paper, we will define a model covering different types of mapping expressions. We will use this model to create an active ETL tool. In our approach, we use queries to achieve the warehousing process. SQL queries will be used to represent the mapping between the source and the target data. Thus, we allow DBMS to play an expanded role as a data transformation engine as well as a data store. This approach enables a complete interaction between mapping meta-data and the warehousing tool. In addition, this paper investigates the efficiency for a Query-based data warehousing tool. It describes a query generator for reusable and more efficient data warehouse (DW) processing. Besides exposing the advantages of this approach, this paper shows a case study based on real scale commercial data to verify our tool features."

pub.1092293280,Towards an extended BPMS prototype: Open challenges of BPM to flexible and robust orchestrate of uncertain processes," Nowadays, uncertainty is widely discussed as serious a challenge against business decision-making. The current business process management systems (BPMSs) are only able to manage certain processes, where there is practically a huge gap between what is expected and what is realized due to uncertainty. This study developed an extended BPMS prototype to facilitate and improve any business process management subject to uncertainty. This prototype can model, design, control and optimize in uncertainty modes, in addition to classic BPMSs operations. For developing a new prototype, the authors first provided a meta-model for designing new engine functions. Thereafter, by defining the architecture style and abstract model, defining user interfaces and component interfaces, uncertain BPMS prototype with CORBA standards created. Furthermore, flexible components are implemented to deal with uncertainty during run-time. This paper has used three evaluation methods to validate the proposed uncertain BPMS prototype. Firstly, an executable prototype has been built and evaluated with a rating model, which obtains quantitative metrics. The comparison between the proposed uncertain BPMS prototype and other classic BPMSs has effectively demonstrated the ability of an extended BPMS prototype in BP management under uncertainty modes. Secondly, a case study in oil and gas industry was studied with a focus on the industry 4.0. The results have revealed the improvement in planning service time after using the proposed prototype. Thirdly, the efficiency of uncertain BPMS prototype has been investigated through different object-oriented software metrics. These results also show the ability of the extended BPMS prototype to flexibly and robustly orchestrate uncertain processes."
pub.1139008337,Development of Industry 4.0 predictive maintenance architecture for broadcasting chain,"Industry 4.0 Predictive Maintenance (PdM 4.0) architecture in the broadcasting chain is one of the taxonomy challenges for deploying Industry 4.0 frameworks. This paper proposes a novel PdM framework based on advanced Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) to reduce operation and maintenance costs. This framework includes real-time production monitoring, business processes, and integration based on Design Science Research (DSR) to generate an innovative Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) meta-model. The addressed model visualizes sub-processes based on experts' and stakeholders' knowledge to reduce the cost of maintenance of audiovisual services including satellite TV, cable TV, and live audio and video broadcast services. Based on the recommendation and the concept of Industry 4.0, the proposed framework tolerates the predictable failures and further concerns in similar related industries. Some empirical experiments have been conducted by using the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting’s (IRIB) high-power station (located near the capital city of Iran, Tehran) to evaluate the functionality and efficiency of the proposed predictive maintenance framework. Practical outcomes demonstrate that interval times between data collection should be increased in audio and video broadcasting predictive maintenance because of the limitation of the internal processing performance of equipment. The framework also indicates the role of the Frequency Modulation (FM) transmitters’ data clearance to reduce the instability and untrustworthy data during data mining. The proposed DSR method endorses using a customized RAMI 4.0 meta-model framework to adapt distributed broadcasting and communication with PdM 4.0, which increases the stability as well as decreasing maintenance costs of the broadcasting chain in comparison to state-of-the-art methodologies. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed framework outperforms the best-evaluated methods in terms of acceptance."
pub.1022571690,A meta-model for knowledge configuration management to support collaborative engineering,"This paper focuses on industrial design and simulation processes especially in automotive and aerospace areas. Designers use business models (called expert models) such as CAD (computed aided design) and CAE (computed aided engineering) models to optimize and streamline the engineering process. Each expert model contains information such as parameters, expert rules, mathematic relations (parametric models, for example) which are shared by several users and in several different domains (mechanical, thermal, acoustic, fluid, etc.). This information is exploited at the same time in a concurrent engineering context. It is the basis of an imperfect collaboration process due to the fact that existing tools do not manage encapsulated information well and are unable to ensure that parameters and rules are consistent (same value of parameters for example) throughout different heterogeneous expert models. In this context, we propose an approach to manage knowledge using configurations synchronized with expert models which enable designers to use parameters consistently in a collaborative context. Our approach is called KCModel (knowledge configuration model): it allows acquisition, traceability, re-use and consistency of explicit knowledge used in configuration."

However, many organizations struggle to keep up with the rapidly changing technologies, putting their survival at risk. To address this challenge, a maturity model taxonomy for digital transformation is proposed in this paper. The taxonomy aims to provide organizations with a clear roadmap for their digital transformation journey, allowing them to smoothly transition from their current state to the desired state. Based on a literature review and a three-phase approach, five dimensions for developing a maturity model have been identified: strategy, technology, organization, customer, and process digitization. The findings from this paper can be utilized by organizations as a blueprint for identifying and focusing on the dimensions crucial for preparing a meta maturity model tailored to their digital transformation journey."
pub.1011614242,A Language Oriented Extension to Toulmin’s Argumentation Model for Conceptual Modelling,"The constructive step of modelling must account for the specific requirements of various stakeholders. Further, the quality of a model in terms of goodness-of-fit, completeness or other aspects may vary, because of future, as yet unknown, requirements. Natural language underpins the process of modelling as it is the predominant form through which models are acquired, negotiated and agreed. Whilst a model defines system requirements, it does not capture the assumptions, discussions and negotiations that led to the requirements. The ability to access this information, which is lost by most development processes, may significantly improve the utility of models with respect to changing requirements and system maintenance. This paper proposes a form of ‘literate modelling’ that can be used to capture the steps in model development and is based on Toulmin’s Argumentation model. The paper contributes the design of an argumentation modelling language and a set of rules for integrating multiple languages (or domains) with the Toulmin approach. The language and approach is applied to the domain of business process modelling."

In the literature, the version-based approach is largely used in the field of business process management (BPM) to cope with process flexibility. However, BPM practitioners can face difficulties in a multi-version environment. So, the following questions arise: How can we use the version-based approach to easily model flexible CP? Does an appropriate version exist for a given situation or is it necessary to create a new one? The chapter answers these questions recommending a solution for the modeling of CP versions and the retrieval of the adequate CP version for a given situation. This solution comprises (1) a meta-model to consider the modeling of the CP versions, (2) an ontology-based approach to model and query the context of use of CP versions, and (3) a framework to provide support for both the modeling of CP versions and the context querying."

We define method architecture as an abstraction of the common properties of methods and propose a method architecture meta-model. At the construction engineering level, we represent a method as a method organisation. Method architecture can be implemented as one or more method organisations. We show that the MIA based approach is generic and can be used to engineer Information Systems Development Methods as well as Business Process Models."

By comprehensively analyzing the critical demands of the operation, control and management in distribution network, distribution control area is modeled based on common information model (CIM), in order to improve the efficiency of the fault diagnosis and optimal dispatching. Taking advantage of meta-modeling theory of CIM, this paper establishes a highly scalable, unified information model. The modeling requirement of static network topology and dynamic traverse is taken into consideration and the distribution control area is regarded as a base unit of business flow and information flow in the operation and management process. Finally, taking outage analysis for example, the accuracy and effectiveness of distribution control area modeling is verified."

The examined educational models of ADDIE, Bloom, and Kirkpatrick are widely known and recognized as models for design and measuring the effectiveness of learning in order to achieve the best possible learning outcomes based on the needs of a specific target group in a specific educational context whether traditional or digital. Specifically, the ADDIE Model is a widely known learning design model used by many educational designers and training programmers to develop education and training programs. The Bloom Taxonomy is a method of building learning goals that follows the process of cognition. The Kirkpatrick Model is a method of evaluating the effectiveness of e-learning and educational programs in general, both in terms of training and business performance of learners. The purpose of this paper was both the investigation of the academic performance, the self-regulated learning and the collaborative learning in relation to the models of ADDIE, Kirkpatrick and Bloom in distance online environments and their effectiveness to the learning process. Meta-analysis was applied for research methodology. After a systematic literature review, we found that only 37 articles were appropriate for meta-analysis. Especially, 23 articles were on the ADDIE model, 9 articles were on the Kirkpatrick model and 5 articles were on the Bloom model. According to the results of this study, we found that all models apply to online process and meet different learning requirements. Regarding the cognitive performance of the trainees, all models supported the effectiveness of distance education. Moreover, the self-regulated learning and the collaborative learning, as factors inextricably linked to the effectiveness of the distance education, were examined in a small number studies in the above models. Finally, all three examined models reinforced students’ positive attitudes and perceptions, even while transferring the acquired knowledge to the workplace."
pub.1017249406,On the Formal Semantics of Change Patterns in Process-Aware Information Systems,"Due to a turbulent market enterprises should be able to adapt their business processes in a quick and flexible way. This requires adaptive process-aware information systems (PAISs) which are able to support changes at different levels and of different process aspects. As for process modeling languages, a multitude of approaches, paradigms, and systems for realizing adaptive processes have emerged. This variety makes it difficult for PAIS engineers to choose the adequate technology. Therefore we introduced a set of commonly used process change patterns which facilitate the comparison between different approaches and tools. In this paper, we provide the formal semantics of these change patterns to ground pattern implementation and pattern-based analysis of PAISs on a solid basis. As challenge, we want to describe the formal semantics of change patterns independent of a certain process meta model. Altogether, our formalization will enable unambiguous and systematic comparison of adaptive PAISs."

However, the efficient indexing and matching method for RESTful Web Services is still a significant challenge. In this paper, a service indexing and matching method based on functionality and semantic domain ontology for RESTful Web Services is presented. Firstly a resource meta-model is defined to describe RESTful Web Services, and then the state description for IOPE is proposed. A whole calculation method based on domain ontology is generated and also a case study is provided to illustrate the application of this method."

pub.1143543639,Towards Automated Attack Simulations of BPMN-based Processes,"Process digitization and integration is an increasing need for enterprises, while cyber-attacks denote a growing threat. Using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is common to handle the digital and integration focus within and across organizations. In other parts of the same companies, threat modeling and attack graphs are used for analyzing the security posture and resilience. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to use attack graph simulations on processes represented in BPMN. Our contributions are the identification of BPMN’s attack surface, a mapping of BPMN elements to concepts in a Meta Attack Language (MAL)-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL), called coreLang, and a prototype to demonstrate our approach in a case study using a real-world invoice integration process. The study shows that non-invasively enriching BPMN instances with cybersecurity analysis through attack graphs is possible without much human expert input. The resulting insights into potential vulnerabilities could be beneficial for the process modelers."
pub.1038375647,Architecting a security strategy measurement and management system,"The use of formal models to guide security design is appealing. This paper presents a model driven approach whereby security systems in operation can be assessed and measured against various requirements that are defined when the system is created. By aligning with organisational policy, and business requirements of a specific system, design and operation can proceed in a way that allows measurement of how successfully security objectives are being achieved. This paper describes a model driven approach which overcomes the contextual restrictions of existing solutions. In particular, where models have been used previously these have tended to be predefined and closed models, whereas the approach described here is an extensible model that comprises all parts of the security monitoring and decision support process. By means of interlinked semantic concepts, the proposed security strategy meta model provides a way to model security directives at an abstract level, which can be automatically compiled into specific rules for an underlying framework of monitoring, decision support, and enforcement engines."

This introduction first presents the research context for these evaluations followed by a synthesis of the overarching barriers and facilitators to scaling across three domains: (1) context, (2) business model, and (3) advocacy and ownership based on a qualitative synthesis. The synthesis showed that implementers often started multiple pilot projects in different contexts rather than scaling-up in one context. We also present a summary of impacts on learning outcomes from impact evaluations of three of the five education programmes."
pub.1131155052,The Methodology of Design Thinking as a Tool for Forming Innovative Solutions,"The problem of modeling business problems and the process of forming the most effective and “elegant” (less radical, more minimalistic) ways to solve them is one of the central and most essential tasks of benchmarking and innovation management since they can significantly improve and optimize company performance. Any aspect of the business will have a more favorable result from such planning and implementation of the latest solutions to achieve the objectives. It is impossible to effectively and consciously approach the organization of innovative activities at an enterprise. This paper examines in detail some of the most interesting decisions in planning, modeling, and strategic thinking, from process design and adaptation of the methodology to achieve the objectives. The authors consider such factors as personal experience, language, thought processes, preferences, and prejudices as integral and essential factors of design thinking. The research methodology includes a comparison and analysis of available information on the methods of the formation of innovative solutions, their effectiveness, and their initial focus. The research methodology includes analysis of the results obtained for their implementation in the company’s practical activities."
pub.1111165198,Business process architecture design methodologies – a literature review," Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the current state of the research field of business process architecture (BPA) and its design methodologies.   Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using meta- and content-based perspectives.   Findings From over 6,000 candidate studies, 89 were selected. A fifth of these primary works corresponded to BPA design methodologies. Though the BPA research field remains in an early stage of development, it bears promising growth potential. Regarding BPA design methodologies, the following aspects susceptible for further research were detected: identification and modeling of business process relationships; specification of inputs; standardization of models, notations and tool support; consideration of managerial concerns; integration of knowledge from other areas; and validation of methodological and product quality aspects.   Research limitations/implications The main limitation of the work lies in not being fully reproducible due to the fixed number of data sources and their digital nature, together with subjective decisions in work selection, data extraction and data analysis.   Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge no study has yet analyzed the BPA research field by means of an SLR. This study will benefit practitioners and research groups working on this topic by allowing them to get a rigorous overview of the BPA research field with an emphasis on available BPA design methodologies, and become aware of research gaps within the BPA field to position further research.

pub.1051783405,Business Transformation Management Methodology,"This book provides an integrative Business Transformation Management Methodology, the BTM2, with an emphasis on the balance between the rational aspects of transformation and the often underestimated emotional readiness of employees to absorb and accept transformation initiatives. A '360-degree' view on what business transformation means and how to manage it successfully, this handbook is suitable for business executives dealing with organizational change. A range of illustrative case studies ensure this is also a valuable resource for academics interested in change and transformation management. Business transformation management is about extensive, complex change. 'BTM squared' or 'Business Transformation Management Methodology' presents a new approach, developed by corporates, academics, and consultants to improve on earlier models. BTM is a meta-management discipline. The Business Transformation Academy (BTA) manages a trans-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and intercultural network working with the Business Consulting Division of SAP. A team of thought leaders from psychology, IT, strategic and process management, and social sciences have created a '360-degree' view of what transformation means. BTM squared focuses on an integrative approach to transformation providing a conceptually robust and practical methodology. Transformation failure is chiefly laid at the door of poor needs analysis or communication. However, issues around employees’ readiness to absorb and accept initiatives are often underestimated. Combining the rational and emotional aspects of transformation is a consistent theme of this handbook. For practitioners, the emphasis is on execution and on closing the knowing-doing gap, with new insights from the case studies that were used to both develop and test the BTM squared methodology."
pub.1004591371,D2WORM,"Unlike traditional activity-flow-based models, data-centric workflows primarily focus on the data to drive a business. This enables the unification of operational management, concurrent process analytics, compliance with process or associated data constraints, and adaptability to changing environments. In this demonstration, we present D2Worm, a Distributed Data-centric Workflow Management system. D2Worm allows users to (1) graphically model data-centric workflows in a declarative fashion based on the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model, (2) automatically compile the modelled workflow into several fine-granular workflow units (WFUs), and (3) deploy these WFUs on distributed infrastructures. A WFU is a system component that manages a subset of the workflow's data model and, at the same time, represents part of the global control flow by evaluating conditions over the data. WFUs communicate with each other over a publish/subscribe messaging infrastructure that allows the architecture to scale from a single node to dozens of machines distributed over different data-centers. In addition, D2Worm is able to (4) concurrently execute multiple workflow instances and monitor their behavior in real-time."
pub.1018916723,POREI,"The requirements elicitation is essential to the success of software development projects. Many papers have been written that promulgate specific elicitation methods. However, none have yet modeled elicitation in a way that makes clear the critical role played by situational knowledge. This paper presents a unified model of the requirements elicitation process that emphasizes the applying the concepts of patterns as it transforms the current state of the business requirements and the situation to an improved understanding of the requirements and, potentially, a modified situation. One meta-model of requirements elicitation, selection of an appropriate elicitation technique, is also captured in the model. The values of this model are: (a) an improved understanding of elicitation helps analysts improve their elicitation efforts and (b) as we improve our ability to perform elicitation, we improve the likelihood that systems we create will meet their intended customers' needs. These patterns are elicited from coordination and transaction costs economics theories and they are validated through a wide variety of relevant situation."
pub.1150233211,"Relational Action Bases: Formalization, Effective Safety Verification, and Invariants (Extended Version)","Modeling and verification of dynamic systems operating over a relational
representation of states are increasingly investigated problems in AI, Business
Process Management, and Database Theory. To make these systems amenable to
verification, the amount of information stored in each relational state needs
to be bounded, or restrictions are imposed on the preconditions and effects of
actions. We introduce the general framework of relational action bases (RABs),
which generalizes existing models by lifting both these restrictions: unbounded
relational states can be evolved through actions that can quantify both
existentially and universally over the data, and that can exploit numerical
datatypes with arithmetic predicates. We then study parameterized safety of
RABs via (approximated) SMT-based backward search, singling out essential
meta-properties of the resulting procedure, and showing how it can be realized
by an off-the-shelf combination of existing verification modules of the
state-of-the-art MCMT model checker. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach on a benchmark of data-aware business processes. Finally, we show how
universal invariants can be exploited to make this procedure fully correct."
pub.1003962395,Ontologies to Support RFID‐Based Link between Virtual Models and Construction Components,"Abstract: Virtual models have in recent years proven their worth in practice in building design. Today, virtual models of a complete building project are often created before the project is carried out in practice. The immediate advantages of this new working process are great; it reduces the number of errors, it gives a better production basis, and it improves clarity and enhances communication compared to traditional 2D drafting methods. However, there is still much unutilized potential in the virtual models, especially for use in the construction and operation phases. A digital link between the virtual models and the physical components in the construction process can improve the information handling and sharing in construction and building operation management. Such a link can be created by means of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Ontologies play an important role as the foundation for information sharing between trading partners, reuse of data from one phase in construction to the next, integration of process and product models with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, easy access of information, communication of data through networks, reading of data stored in electronic tags, etc. This article reviews existing ontologies relevant in relation to creating such a digital link between virtual models and the physical components. The ontologies are reviewed from an ontology consumer (system developer) point of view. The ontologies are categorized according to their applicability to specification of technical services, resources, organizational relations, business processes, and overall frameworks for ontology descriptions and their relations. It is concluded, with a few modifications for industrial use, the technical service and resource ontologies are applicable and that the meta‐, organizational, and business process ontologies need further development and industrial maturity to be applicable for use in system development."

In this work we examine several proposed methodologies and synthesize them into a new methodology that we demonstrate through a case study of an electric power distribution company. This is a practical research study. First, the research approach for creating the knowledge map is process-oriented and the processes are considered as the main elements of the model. This research was done in four stages: literature review, model editing, model validation and case study. The Delphi method was used for the research model validation. Some of the important outputs of this research were mapping knowledge flows, determining the level of knowledge assets, expert-area knowledge map, preparing knowledge meta-model, and updating the knowledge map according to the company’s processes. Besides identifying, auditing and visualizing tacit and explicit knowledge, this knowledge mapping enables us to analyze the knowledge areas’ situation and subsequently help us to improve the processes and overall performance. So, a process map does knowledge mapping in a clear and accurate frame. Once the knowledge is used in processes, it creates value."
pub.1156194898,Causal Knowledge Modelling for Agile Development of Enterprise Application Systems,"Experience shows that Agile project management tools such as Atlassian Jira capture the state of EAS projects by relying solely on expert judgement that is not supported by any knowledge model. Therefore, the assessment of project content against strategic objectives and business domain features are not supported by any tool. This is one of the reasons why Agile project management still does not provide sufficient EAS project delivery results. In order to address this problem, the Enterprise Application Software (EAS) development using Agile project management is summarized in a conceptual model. The model highlights the knowledge used and indicates its nature (empirical or causal digitized). The modified Agile management process we have developed and described in previous works is based on causal knowledge models that supports EAS development and Agile management processes. The purpose of this article is to specify knowledge repository to ensure the Agile management solutions of an EAS project are aligned with strategic goals and business domain causality. It is worth noticing that strategic goals have been identified and specified as capabilities using some enterprise architecture framework (NAF, MODAF, ArchiMate, etc.). The novelty of the proposed method is incorporating the business domain causal knowledge modelling approach into the Agile project management process. The causal knowledge unit is considered as a Management Transaction (MT), which includes closed loop dependence of its components. The modified Agile activity hierarchy (theme, initiative, epic, user story) defines the required content of their mutual interactions. An important new results obtained are the conceptual model of causal knowledge base (KB) and specification of enhanced Agile management tool components: project management database and project state assesment knowledge base. Causal KB includes specification of causal knowledge unit (MT metamodel) and specifications of traditional and causal Agile hierarchy meta-models. These conceptual models define the causal knowledge components necessary to evaluate the state of Agile activities in the EAS development project using intelligent Agile project management tool."

Digital transformation is a process of organizational change that utilizes digital technology to improve performance. Digital transformation includes aspects such as processes, business models, and changes in organizational culture. This research aims to analyze the impact of digital transformation on organizational performance. The research used a literature review method to analyze 37 journal articles published between 2016 and 2023.
 The research results show that digital transformation has a positive and significant influence on organizational performance. This performance improvement can be seen in increased efficiency, productivity and organizational competitiveness. The impact of digital transformation on organizational performance is not always linear. Several factors can influence the magnitude of digital transformation, including Organization Size, Industry, Organizational Culture, Competitiveness, Technological Change, and Organizational Capability in managing digital transformation. Therefore, organizations need to understand the factors that can influence the impact of digital transformation and make optimal use of digital transformation to improve performance."

pub.1094025494,Empowering Business Users to Analyze Enterprise Architectures: Structural Model Matching to Configure Visualizations,"Visualizations are common means to analyze Enterprise Architecture (EA) models and support decision makers with relevant information on organizational processes, information systems, infrastructure, and their interconnections. These EA visualizations are tailored typically to the specific information demand of stakeholders. Currently, creating such stakeholder-specific visualizations requires experts with a strong technical background due to complex configurations and inflexible tool solutions. In particular business users often lack technical expertise. At the same time, their concerns and questions often arise spontaneously. In this vein, visualizations that can be generated without expert knowledge would enable business users to perform ad-hoc analyses of an EA information model. Against this background, we propose a solution which facilitates analyses of arbitrary EA information models by non-technical stakeholders. Our approach is based on ad-hoc, configurable visualizations. We introduce an end-user friendly wizard that lowers the barrier for the creation of EA visualizations. The wizard is based on structural pattern matching of models. Key to our approach are abstract viewpoints that model best-practice knowledge of EA visualizations and abstract view models which model the information demand of abstract viewpoints. Our contributions in this paper are 1) a meta-information model capable to capture both the technical information demand of an abstract viewpoint and the information offer of an EA information model, 2) a pattern matching algorithm calculating viable configurations for bindings of visualizations to information, and 3) a wizard to support nontechnical stakeholders with the creation of these visualizations. We present an implementation of our approach and show user interface design of the wizard. The wizard recommends feasible configurations automatically in order to unburden the configuration process for non-technical stakeholders."

Those changes are also expected to dramatically influence current business models and impact the management accounting domain. The profession may adjust existing procedures to adapt to these changes or invent novel approaches to improve analyses and decision-making, and will likely become more intelligent and automated. This paper explores a new management accounting paradigm: Management Accounting 4.0 using the organizing principles of accounting information systems meta-theory model. We further establish a roadmap toward the new paradigm from the perspectives of vision, strategy approach, requirements, and priority areas."
pub.1094841628,The Impact of Model Driven Development on the Software Architecture Process,"While Model-Driven Development (MDD) is an increasingly popular software development approach, its impact on the development process in large-scale, industrial practice is not yet clear. For this study the application of MDD in a large-scale industrial software development project is analyzed over a period of two years. Applying a grounded theory approach we identified 14 factors which impact the architectural process. We found that scope creep is more likely to occur, late changes can imply more extensive rework and that business engineers need to be more aware of the technical impact of their decisions. In addition, the introduced Domain-Specific Language (DSL) provides a new common idiom that can be used by more team members and will ease communication among team members and with clients. Also, modelers need to be much more explicit and complete in their descriptions. Parallel development of a code generator and defining a proper meta-model require additional time investments. Lastly, the more central role of software architecture design documentation requires more structured, detailed and complete architectural information and consequently, more frequent reviews."

Accountability, position, work complexity, authority, coordination mechanism, organizing, and work system can induce several problems when this regulation is implemented. This research aims to critically explore the model for organizing government institutions in simplifying Bureaucracy. This research employed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). This research shows that the adhocratic organisation model as the antithesis of Bureaucracy by creating several task groups coordinated by the highest functionary position, reconfiguring the management of functionary position, and applicating business process are recommendations to anticipate problems emerging from simplifying Bureaucracy. But, not all government functions can be made adhocratic, and it is also crucial to understand that the management and leaders need to departmentalise in simplifying Bureaucracy meticulously."

Therefore, the Software Product Line (SPL) engineering for developing Self-Adaptive systems (SPL4SA) can be an effective way. At the first sight, SPL4SA is the straightforward combination of the two methodologies of SPL engineering and self-adaptive systems. However, the direct and unsystematic combination will bring difficulty in the domain requirements analysis and in the customization process. In this paper, in order to give a solution to the practical problems, we propose a domain requirements meta-model in SPL4SA. It is described with different point of views and the variability binding constraints inside are emphasized. Based on it, a guidance is concluded to support the consistent customization towards the domain model. In addition, an experimental study about a web-based business product line involving self-adaptation capability is conducted to evaluate the model."

pub.1011211077,The role and impact of comparison websites on the consumer search process in the US and German airline markets,"The paper examines how consumers search for airline tickets based on a comparative analysis of the US and German markets. Data from comScore is analysed using an innovative application of set theory. ComScore is a leading commercial provider of business intelligence and consumer analytics based on its worldwide panel of two million online users. The search process is modelled using the concept of the consideration set based on primary search with the airline websites and secondly by the use of online travel agents and meta-search engines, which are termed comparison websites. Three generic search models are proposed: (1) primary search with airline websites only; (2) search of comparison websites only; (3) a combination of primary search and comparison websites. Each generic search model accounts for a significant proportion of overall users in both markets. The consideration sets are 2.58 in Germany and 2.74 in the United States. It is shown that the use of comparison websites significantly increases the propensity to conduct additional primary search based on analysis of all major airline pairs in both markets. The theoretical and managerial implications of the results are described and future research opportunities are outlined."
pub.1016063362,Schema Change Operations for Versioning Complex Objects Hierarchy in OODBs,"In this paper, we propose a set of schema change operations which allows to restructure complex object hierarchy in object-oriented databases. This model extends a schema version model, called RiBS, which is based on the concept of Rich Base Schema. In the RiBS model, each schema version is in the form of updatable class hierarchy view over one base schema, called the RiBS layer, which has richer schema information than any existing schema version in the database.In this paper, we introduce new operations for restructuring composite object hierarchy in schema versions, and explain their semantics. The originality of this paper lies in that 1) we introduce several new operations to restructure composite object hierarchy, and 2) this extended RiBS model operations raise the concept of data independence in OODBs upto the schema level."

Based on medini, we have developed a modelling suite for telecom services which consists of EDOC as a platform independent modelling technique and CORBA/Corba Component Model (CCM) as a platform specific modelling technique. Since that time, this modelling suite has been significantly enhanced: Support for Web Services has been added as an alternative target platform and we have extended the model transformers to consider EDOC behavior models (namely choreographies). The behavior descriptions can now be transformed to Web Service behavior expressed using BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) and to behavior descriptions for our CORBA/CCM based platform facilitating UML 2 state-machines and the creation of Java code. In this paper we will explain our behavior transformations and report on the experiences we have made by simultaneously addressing two different target platforms with different kinds of behavior descriptions."

pub.1006243081,An Approach to Parameterizing Web Service Flows,"The flexibility and reusability of Web Service flows (WS-flows) are limited especially by the fact that portType and operation names are hard-coded in the process definition. In this paper we argue that through parameterization and substitution WS-flows flexibility can be improved, while reusability is enhanced. We introduce a meta-model extension to enable run time evaluation of parameter values and thus discard the need to predict any possible partner service types during process modeling. The extension enables also run time changes in portType values. We show how the approach can be mapped to BPEL. We discuss prototypical implementation for the extended functionality and present conclusions and ideas for future work."
pub.1134363081,Open Internationalization Strategy,"Open internationalization is a concept that brings a new perspective on the process of firm internationalization. As theories of internationalization show, some companies expand abroad only on their own, known as closed internationalization, while others combine their resources with those of other firms or use their networks for facilitating foreign implantation, known as open internationalization. Parallel to the development of the well-known concept of open innovation, open internationalization can be conceived as a meta-model for understanding companies’ expansion abroad. This book gathers a selection of contemporary research works dedicated to open internationalization, either seen as a way to analyze expansion in foreign countries, or as a way to investigate the management of geographically dispersed activities. All the authors of the chapters are researchers specialized in the internationalization field. Readers will benefit from this new lens for understanding, studying or practising international business, from the decision to go abroad to its implementation and its efficiency. Open Internationalization Strategy includes both academic empirical investigations and literature reviews on specific topics, making it valuable to researchers, academics, managers and students in the fields of business and management history, international business, organizational studies and economics."
pub.1047107740,Design for Mass Customization,"Mass customization has recently received a significant amount of attention by the business community. However, the engineering approach to produce an increasing variety of customers' requirements without a corresponding increase in cost has not been well developed. In this paper, we propose a design approach to mass customization (DFMC) that is based on the belief that mass customization can be effectively achieved through design, in particular during the conceptual design and preliminary development stages. The core of DFMC is to develop a mass customization oriented product family architecture (PFA) with a meta level design process integration as an unified product creation and delivery process model. The formulation of PFA enables the optimization of reusability/commonality in both product design and process selection from the product family perspective. It also provides a basis to facilitate the front end configuration in order to fulfill the individual requirements of customers. This paper reports the proposed approach with an example of mass customization of power supply products."
pub.1091033446,Identifying Quality Factors of Information Systems Integration Design,"The Information Systems (IS) community has long recognized the importance of studying quality at various stages of the IS design process. Many studies target the quality factors at various stages of design and development. However, research about the factors that specifically affect the quality of IS integration remains largely fragmented. Existing quality frameworks fail to cover integration-specific factors. This motivates the need for a holistic model of integration quality. The paper proposes two artefacts to address this need. It explores the literature of related domains, including systems, model, and process quality to elicit the quality factors that are relevant in the context of IS integration. The factors can be used to evaluate the quality of integration solutions during design and development. The paper also proposes a quality model to describe the quality of the design components of integration solutions following the principles of model-driven development. The model enables the quality factors to be associated with other parts of the IS integration design. The proposed factors are evaluated with the help of expert feedback using a questionnaire, and the quality model is demonstrated with an example business case."

pub.1146620208,Facebook and the creation of the metaverse: radical business model innovation or incremental transformation?,"
                    Purpose
                    In a move characterized by ambiguity, Facebook changed its name to Meta in October 2021, announcing a new era of social interaction, enabled by the metaverse technology that appears poised to become the future center of gravity for online social interactions. At first glance, the communicated change signals a radically new business model (BM) based on an unprecedented configuration of the three following components: value creation, value proposition and value capture. The purpose of this paper is to analyze Facebook’s announced changes in its BM to clarify whether the change is as radical as communicated or rather represents an incremental transformation of the current BM.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This investigation adopted an in-depth case study research method. The process included using a structured approach to collect 153 data points, including academic studies and publicly available information, followed by qualitative content analysis.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results of our analysis of Facebook’s entrepreneurial journey indicate that the communicated strategic refocusing does not correspond to a radical BM innovation pattern. Even though Facebook’s BM might evolve into the innovation phase, as the current changes appear very futuristic, the authors estimate that the core elements of the BM will change incrementally. The investigation indicates that the underlying logic of the straightforward communicative efforts primarily serves two purposes: to improve the external perception of the company and to disseminate an internal change signal within the organization.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    This paper is the first study that takes an entrepreneurship and BM perspective in analyzing Facebook’s approach in rebranding to Meta and refocusing its strategy on building the metaverse. The academic and practical relevance, as well as the potential future impact on business and society, makes the investigation of this case an intriguing prospect. Additionally, the study illuminates the difference between the communicated vision and the real impact on the business, suggesting critical questions about future large-scale rebranding efforts and their effects.

Gather and qualify these services in a container helps to discover, match and reuse them in developing new business applications for companies. Our objective in this work is the design of a software capability container offering a wider view qualification for REST-based services. Moreover, we aim to enrich the designed container with semantic elements to ease the discovery and the selection of the qualified services. In this purpose, we define an ontology based on a proposed Enterprise Architecture Capability Profile offering a qualification covering business, operational and technical aspects for services. Ontologies are widely acknowledged as a means to specify explicitly the meaning of concepts in a domain of interest, and to facilitate consistent sharing of data and knowledge pertaining to them. The qualification profile is based on a proposed meta-model that helps to retrieve and gather initial requirements used to guide the development of existing REST-based Web Applications. Furthermore, a Framework is proposed to exploit the designed container in order to respond to users requirements for developing future business process and efficiently reuse the qualified services. Our contribution aims to upgrade technical components to the level of end-users requirements. This helps to accelerate business application development and improve the reuse and sustainability of existing services."
pub.1049275043,Making Virtual Communities Work: Matching Their Functionalities,"Virtual professional communities increasingly make use of standard information tools, like mailers and groupware applications, to support their collaborative activities. However, the requirements of these communities and the technologies in use change rapidly, so that requirements and available functionalities continuously need to be recalibrated. Changing their mappings is not trivial, because of the many dependencies between the business processes and tool components. To increase the efficiency of the specification process, functionality matching approaches need to be developed that are sensitive to the socio-technical semantics of the community. In this way, the technical feasibility of a proposed change can be more easily determined.In this paper, we propose a concrete matching approach based on the RENISYS method for legitimate user-driven system specification. The approach consists of a series of matching process steps which are based on a functionality matching meta-model. We illustrate how such an approach could be used in practice by applying it to a proposed system change process in the case of an electronic journal."

Enterprise architects, software engineers and process engineers will have to work closely together to build the information systems that are connected to the shop floor and aligned with the business needs of smart manufacturers. However, it is unclear whether they have the means to do so. This research aims to provide enterprise architecture modelling support for smart manufacturers by investigating ArchiMate 3.0’s fitness for this purpose. ArchiMate 3.0 meta-model is compared to the ISA-95 standard for enterprise systems and control systems integration.

pub.1129852661,Relation-aware Meta-learning for Market Segment Demand Prediction with Limited Records,"E-commerce business is revolutionizing our shopping experiences by providing
convenient and straightforward services. One of the most fundamental problems
is how to balance the demand and supply in market segments to build an
efficient platform. While conventional machine learning models have achieved
great success on data-sufficient segments, it may fail in a large-portion of
segments in E-commerce platforms, where there are not sufficient records to
learn well-trained models. In this paper, we tackle this problem in the context
of market segment demand prediction. The goal is to facilitate the learning
process in the target segments by leveraging the learned knowledge from
data-sufficient source segments. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm,
RMLDP, to incorporate a multi-pattern fusion network (MPFN) with a
meta-learning paradigm. The multi-pattern fusion network considers both local
and seasonal temporal patterns for segment demand prediction. In the
meta-learning paradigm, transferable knowledge is regarded as the model
parameter initialization of MPFN, which are learned from diverse source
segments. Furthermore, we capture the segment relations by combining
data-driven segment representation and segment knowledge graph representation
and tailor the segment-specific relations to customize transferable model
parameter initialization. Thus, even with limited data, the target segment can
quickly find the most relevant transferred knowledge and adapt to the optimal
parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale industrial
datasets. The results justify that our RMLDP outperforms a set of
state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, RMLDP has been deployed in Taobao, a
real-world E-commerce platform. The online A/B testing results further
demonstrate the practicality of RMLDP."

Yet ethical scandals abound in various areas, including business, law, politics, medicine, education, and so forth. As unethical behavior becomes “in vogue” (Lewicki & Robinson, 1998, p. 665), researchers have increased effort to identify the individual-level causes of unethical behavior (Kish-Gephart, Harrison, & Treviño, 2010; O’Fallon & Butterfield, 2005;Tenbrunsel & Smith-Crowe, 2008; Treviño, Weaver, & Reynolds, 2006). Yet this line of inquiry, which has largely adopted rationalist approaches (e.g., Kohlberg, 1969; Piaget, 1965), focuses on trait and situational factors (Kish-Gephart et al., 2010; Moore & Gino, 2013) and neglects the important effects of state/temporary factors, such as emotions (Haidt, 2001;Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007). Emotions have been considered “a non-essential aspect to the ethical decision process that is best ignored, if not controlled, as it interferes with a logical, rational ethical decision process” (Gaudine &Thorne, 2001, p. 175; also see Eisenberg, 2000;Treviño et al., 2006). Yet Tenbrunsel and Smith-Crowe (2008) noted that they are “disappointed that most research assumes that the process is a reason-based one (in the traditional sense), thus ignoring the roles of emotions, the subconscious, and intuition” (p. 547)."

pub.1101353232,A Mapping Study on Mining Software Process,"Background: Mining Software Process (MSP) helps distill important information about software process enactment from software data repositories. An increasing amount of research effort is being dedicated to MSP. These studies differ in various aspects (e.g., topics, data, and techniques) of MSP. Objective: We aim to study the state of the art on MSP from following aspects, i.e., research topics, data sources, data types, mining techniques, and mining tools. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study on the research relevant to MSP at both microprocess and macroprocess levels. Results: Our mapping study identified 40 relevant studies that can be grouped into microprocess and macroprocess levels. The identified mining techniques have been mapped onto the associated mining tools that fall into four types. Driven by the three research questions which represented in a meta-model, the findings revealed the correlations among the research topics, data sources, data types, mining techniques, and mining tools. Conclusion: It is observed that in order to discover the software process model or map, the main data source is from industrial project. Current mining techniques for microprocess research are mostly business process mining or sequence mining techniques used to recover descriptive software process. In addition, various machine learning algorithms and novel proposed methods are used to improve the accuracy of macroprocess level factors (e.g., software effort estimation)."

Difficulties arise where there are requirements to integrate existing systems within the migrated and often-extended web based services. The Institutionally Secure Integrated Data Environment (INSIDE) project is addressing the problems and issues surrounding the development and delivery of web based services for “joined up systems” for institutions within Higher Education (HE). The project is working with a variety of existing information systems, e.g. student record systems and managed learning environments, at two universities. To better understand the requirements for an integrated web based service, a common business process, the registration of new undergraduate students, has been analysed and modelled at both sites. Progressing from initial informal models to more formal models in a systematic way, following a meta-process incorporating good practice from domain analysis and requirements engineering has allowed the project to lay the foundation for its development of web-based services."
pub.1048130015,Development of Knowledge Intensive Applications for Hospital,"Most studies of medical intelligence system have focused on the development of backend data repositories rather than frontend user applications. Also, they tend to lack systematic development models which demonstrate how user requirements inform system design and implementation. For these reasons, it is highly desirable to show the process of eliciting knowledge requirements in addition to the development process for knowledge-intensive applications. This research covers the implementation of a medical intelligence system based on analysis of knowledge requirements such as OLAP (On-line Analytical Processing) fundamental functionalities and knowledge types. The proposed medical intelligence system provides health care providers and their supporters with the ability to draw meaningful insights from very large, complex data sets. A real life case is presented to illustrate the system’s practical usage. Six application packages are defined, namely: explorer, analyzer, reporter, statistician, visualizer, and meta administrator. Finally, the study concludes with an evaluation of the developed system and future research directions."
pub.1014509336,A Study on a Framework for Persistence Layer Supportable Web Services in Distributed Environments,"The web service was proposed as a standard to assemble service modules without any relation where they exist in distributed environments. The standard web service is declared with XML based language about registration, searching, orchestration and execution, which will be used to represent domain data model and process model. Each model can be mapped between data object and execution object but the mapping process have no standard so it can cause higher coupling between logics for processing domain objects and for business. Therefore, a web service framework should provide a domain model to reduce coupling and it must support features for registration, searching, orchestration and execution which are compatible with the standards. We propose a framework for persistenc layer supportable web services in distributed environments. Proposed framework is implemented for service registry, orchestration engine, execution engine, and a meta model for various domain. In service registration and searching, it shows high performance because it uses hashing based searching. And it shows higher performance than other ORMs such as the Hibernate and iBatis on the MS-SQL which is general DBMS in factor of domain objects’ creation, modification and removal."
pub.1164621851,A scenario-based robust possibilistic-flexible programming model for responsive supply chain network design with a performance-oriented solution methodology,"This study addresses an integrated multi-objective responsive supply chain network optimization problem under hybrid uncertain business environment and optimal scheme selection. In addition to economic performance, delivery time and delivery reliability, as responsiveness indicators, are introduced into the multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model. To deal with hybrid uncertainties caused by various scenarios, parameters, and flexible constraints, a scenario-based robust possibilistic flexible programming approach is extended. Moreover, a performance-oriented solution method is developed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The method integrates meta-heuristic and entropy-weighted TOPSIS to perform performance evaluation together with iteration optimization. The set of non-dominant solutions obtained by evaluation guide the iteration process. The numerical case verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model, uncertainty technical and solution method. Interestingly, Pareto optimal solution set and its sort obtained by evaluation provide the optimal network scheme with the best supply chain performance."
pub.1027623191,Supporting Communication and Cooperation in Global Software Development with Agile Service Networks,"Current IT markets exhibit many constraints (e.g. budget, staff shortage, etc.). These constraints force IT companies to increase productivity using globally distributed manpower. Literature shows that global software development (GSD) indeed raises productivity but reduces communication and collaboration between teams. Consequently, the risk of failure increases. To ease communication and collaboration among teams, novel engineering methods must be provided. To address this problem, we propose using Agile Service Networks (ASNs). ASNs are an emergent paradigm in which service oriented applications (network nodes) collaborate through agile and dynamic service interactions (network edges). Agile interaction among ASN nodes, allow mitigating distance (typical of GSD) by dynamically adapting communication and collaboration as needed. Through ASNs, GSD can be seen as a global network of resources (teams, documentation, knowledge, etc.) among which agile interactions allow flexible knowledge exchange and team collaboration. To establish feasibility of our proposal, we investigated how ASNs can support GSD. Based on existing works in the fields of both ASNs and GSD, we mapped GSD challenges on ASNs key features and devised a meta-model showing how ASNs are used to support GSD requirements."
pub.1163235500,Safety Verification and Universal Invariants for Relational Action Bases,"Modeling and verification of dynamic systems operating over a relational representation of states are increasingly investigated problems in AI, Business Process Management and Database Theory. To make these systems amenable to verification, the amount of information stored in each state needs to be bounded, or restrictions are imposed on the preconditions and effects of actions. We lift these restrictions by introducing the framework of Relational Action Bases (RABs), which generalizes existing frameworks and in which unbounded relational states are evolved through actions that can (1) quantify both existentially and universally over the data, and (2) use arithmetic constraints. We then study parameterized safety of RABs via (approximated) SMT-based backward search, singling out essential meta-properties of the resulting procedure, and showing how it can be realized by an off-the-shelf combination of existing verification modules of the state-of-the-art MCMT model checker. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a benchmark of data-aware business processes. Finally, we show how universal invariants can be exploited to make this procedure fully correct."

pub.1099378692,Implementation of a Physics-Based Decision-Making Framework for Evaluation of the Multidisciplinary Aircraft Uncertainty,"In today's business climate, aerospace companies are more than ever in need of rational methods and techniques that provide insights as to the best strategies which may be pursued for increased profitability and risk mitigation. However, the use of subjective, anecdotal decision-making remains prevalent due to the absence of analytical methods capable of capturing and forecasting future needs. Negotiations between airframe and engine manufacturers could benefit greatly from a structured environment that facilitates efficient, rational, decision-making. Creation of such an environment can be developed through a parametric physics-based, stochastic formulation that uses Response Surface Equations as meta-models to expedite the process. This paper describes the implementation of such an approach in order to demonstrate the types of insights that might be gained as an engine manufacturer tries to forecast the effects of the associated airframe uncertainties (structural, aerodynamic, etc. design changes) on engine related characteristics for the design of a hypothetical regional business jet."

Nevertheless, simulators are usually tailor-made for a specific application. This paper proposes an original approach, an architecture for a software tool capable of simulating any electric power system application, the first energy-oriented meta-simulator. This tool would only require the definition of a set of behavior rules, easing the process of developing new simulators aimed at the energy sector. Its applications range from pure software simulators, that could be used with, for example, benchmarking, decision-making or competition purposes, to applications monitoring and controlling energy assets in real-time, such as hardware devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, or power plants) or digital twins. The proposed architecture resulted by studying previous tools and simulators with the objective of finding common blocks and elements to abstract them. For this reason, the proposed architecture intents to encompass any tool that aims to model the energy sector. Additionally, the proposed architecture is compliant with lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) protocols and smart systems and supports the synchronization with other frameworks at different levels."

A theoretical analysis was performed to develop a special correlation matrix between the Air Transport System to ATC service and ATC technical services, which reflect the top-down approach of process modelling proceeding. A particular research of different international ATC service organization, selected by defined parameter was performed for analysis. The analysis was implemented with different scientific research methods. Basing on this international research, a detailed SWOT analysis and conclusions of each ATC organization itself and additionally a parameter-oriented comparison between the different organizations and their specifics were performed. The results of this research were described in a SWOT analysis, rating assessment of utilization of the theoretical methods and qualified evaluation of implemented KPI System. For final maintenance process evaluation an ATC-Maintenance Process Maturity method based on ISO /IEC Standard 15504 was developed. The results and developments of the research will be the essential prerequisite for the further research of dissertation and development of a harmonized ATC Meta Frame Maintenance Process Model as a part of the Air Transport System on macro model level and deriving to the ATC specific Maintenance Service Model on micro level for the specific ATC organization basing on service and business modelling methods."

The introduced novel approach promotes this transformation by supporting the appropriate stakeholders in formalizing, analyzing, assessing, comparing and hence selecting the most suitable methods, like physical and virtual design methods or CAx methods, that are utilized to execute these tasks.The separation of knowledge types by applying Semantic Technologies, like ontologies, rules and queries, enables the appropriate roles to manage this knowledge independently and in their own way, because (conceptual) domain knowledge, (operational) business rules and an implemented data model have different lifecycles, scopes and owners. Furthermore, this particular domain and business knowledge features interdependencies with remaining enterprise knowledge, including business processes, organizational aspects and the IT architecture, which is usually modeled in an Enterprise Architecture (EA). Therefore, we showcase the implementation and integration of a method meta model, method contexts, like metrics and product knowledge, and an EA using Semantic Technologies to promote the transparency, interchange, interconnection, synchronization, sharing, reusability, re-deployment, up-to-dateness and maintenance of this particular knowledge and consequently analyses and assessments based on it."
pub.1095543749,Context Model Based SOA Policy Framework,"With the popularity of SOA, SOA policy becomes one of the core technical enablers for SOA governance and management. Different in several aspects from traditional policy for distributed system management, policy applied in SOA solutions needs to take into account various policy types and enforcement points in different layers of SOA solution stack and different phases of SOA lifecycle. As well, it has the unique requirements on compliance to match existing SOA technologies and characteristics, as simplicity, standardization, high performance, etc. In this paper, a novel context model based SOA policy management framework by innovatively extending W3C Service Modeling Language (SML) and ISO Schematron is introduced. Firstly, a common context model distilled from SOA policy types typically including service policy, service governance policy, application policy and business policy, is presented. Then, the core components - context model based policy engine and definition tool are described. Finally, it is illustrated how the unified definition tools and policy engine are manipulated within the context model based SOA policy framework to manage and enforce policies in typical scenarios as service meta-data management, service match making and business process management. Based on the project, we participated in the works for defining W3C SML V1.1 working draft and proposed the works introduced in this paper to W3C SML Working Group. This paper demonstrates how these technologies and architectures significantly enhance the capability of SOA governance and management throughout whole SOA life cycle and spanning the layers of SOA solution stack."

The transportation business has suffered greatly as a result of advanced technology like the Internet of Things (IoT). Ensuring the security of passengers and conserving their valuable time are the top priorities for various transportation networks. The system’s proper design is essential to transportation safety. This work uses the SPIN model checker to solve the issue of guaranteeing accuracy and upholding system safety. IOT-based smart transport systems have been the subject of much study, but formal verification to guarantee the accuracy of these systems has received less attention. This paper solves this issue by officially validating an SPIN-based transport system. Use the formal specification language, Process or Protocol Meta Language (PROMELA), to formally define the Internet of Things (IOT)-based smart transport system in this study. Using linear temporal logic (LTL) in the form of a formula, create a program graph for this process using the SPIN Model Checker and explain the safety and liveness features. By providing the program graph and LTL formulae as input to the SPIN model checker, which determines if the properties are met with the program graph, formal verification is carried out to guarantee accuracy."
pub.1132442615,A Comprehensive Management Framework for Preventing Operational Bankruptcy of Construction Firms,"Construction is considered to be one of the most complex businesses due to the presence of multiple risks, uncertainties, and ever-changing conditions. These properties, among others, lead to the bankruptcy of thousands construction firms each year irrespective of the number of years spent in the market. In fact, the failure rate of construction firms is more substantial compared to other industries. Construction firms that fail to adjust their operations to match with internal and external environmental challenges will eventually collapse. Many previous research studies proposed models to predict the business failure of companies in the construction industry by the incorporation of different causes and factors. However, for the developed models, no previous research study used a comprehensive list of causes that lead to the bankruptcy of construction firms. Indeed, many scholars highlighted the need for and the absence of a holistic framework for the identification of the factors contributing to business failure in construction companies. As such, this paper attempts to bridge this critical knowledge gap through a multi-step methodology. To this end, the authors: (1) conducted a meta-analysis of previous research studies; (2) identified the causes leading to the failure in the business operations of construction firms; and (3) performed an analysis to quantitatively determine the overlooked business failure causes. By following this methodology, the authors were able to determine the causes that contribute to firms’ failures in the construction industry. Moreover, the results showed that there exists a critical need to better examine some understudied critical failure factors, including inadequate company organizational structure and human capital. Ultimately, the comprehensive framework proposed in this paper will provide means to ameliorate the operational decision-making process within construction firms."

In ambiguous and unpredictable business situations, strategic management in various industries has extensively used dynamic capabilities (DC) theory to pursue a competitive advantage. The objective of this study is to construct an integrated conceptual model for DC in MSME in the agribusiness sector. Using the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) protocol, the study employs a systematic literature review methodology in order to achieve the goals. A comprehensive search of the Scopus database using keywords and search strings returned 443 papers published between 2002 and 2022, with 26 relevant research highlighted and synthesized. The study results indicate that the integrated model of DC focuses on three aspects: the antecedent, the process, and the outcome. This article’s findings should be regarded as a guide or road map for future empirical studies on the subject of DC in MSME."
pub.1152338358,The making of cities after disasters: Strategic planning and the Central Italy temporary housing process,"The interest of scholars in the temporal dimension of post-disaster housing has grown in the past decade, but the analytic focus has primarily been around the design and delivery of more sustainable Temporary Housing solutions. However, addressing temporality and promoting Building Back Better in disaster recovery and reconstruction also requires a better understanding of the regulatory and organisational process which produces the post-disaster transitional city. Since strategic planning grows in popularity as a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) paradigm, an analysis of its application and outcomes helps capture lessons to inform future housing assistance practices. To this end, the paper reconstructs and analyses the Central Italy temporary housing supply and delivery process. It combines a meta-analysis of published documents and business process modelling to uncover links between policy, society, and space. The results suggest that gaps in strategic planning (related to multi-level governance, process and resource management) are significant explanatory factors for the technical and social clashes highlighted by the analysis. It is emphasised the importance to produce well-informed strategic plans to achieve DRR goals and the potential benefit of adopting the proposed approach to this end, leveraging its capacity to model and simulate the temporary housing supply and delivery process."
pub.1000764076,Evolution of Service Processes by Rule Based Transformation,"The notion of service is closely coupled with the notion of process in general and of workflow in particular. Processes capture the coordination logic for the various resources involved in the realisation of the service content. Moreover, processes drive the actual delivery of a service. Internal processes underpin the capabilities of a service provider. Delivery processes underpin contractual agreements between service providers and consumers. In both cases, the ability to adapt service processes in response to changing environmental conditions is fundamental. Change must be rapid but at the same time accurate and consistent. In this paper, we present the framework for automated process transformation developed within the context of the FRESCO (Foundational Research on Service Composition) initiative. The conceptual part of the framework builds on the standard workflow meta-model proposed by the WfMC (Workflow Management Coalition). The change logic is expressed by transformation rules that can be automatically applied to the processes underpinning a service. The technical part of the framework specifically targets Web service platforms and BPEL (Business Process Execution Language)."

Moreover, this paper gives a real case study of applying this model in a project of “Maritime and shipping integrated system of Yunnan Province”. The case study shows that MSFDSI separates the business logic and the specific implementation technology, achieves the dynamic service integration successfully, improves the performance of system and provides a new and effective solution for applying SOA."
pub.1026770064,A Practical Method and Tool for Systems Engineering of Service-Oriented Applications,"As software organizations develop systems based on service-oriented architectures (SOAs), the role of systems engineers (SEs) is crucial. They drive the process, in a top-down fashion, from the vantage point of the business domain. The SE, utilizing tools that allow work at a suitably high level of abstraction, creates service description artifacts that document service contracts, the obligations that govern the integration of services into useful applications. This paper describes a practical systems engineering methodology and supporting toolset for SOA that has been successfully used within the telecommunications domain. The methodology and toolset, named the STructured Requirements and Interface Design Environment (STRIDE), are based upon a high-level service description meta-model, and as such, encourage top-down service design. STRIDE promotes reuse of service models, as well as of the artifacts generated from those models, across the enterprise. STRIDE also embodies an effective service evolution and versioning strategy."

pub.1125945274,An ensemble-based approach to the security-oriented classification of low-level log traces,"Traditionally, Expert Systems have found a natural application in the behavioral analysis of processes. In fact, they have proved effective in the tasks of interpreting the data collected during the process executions and of analyzing these data with the aim of diagnosing/detecting anomalies. In this context, we focus on log data generated by executions of business processes, and consider the issue of detecting “insecure” process instances, involving some kind of security breach (e.g. attacks, frauds). We propose a hybrid framework for accomplishing a security-oriented classification of activity-unawaretraces, i.e., traces consisting of “low-level” events with no explicit reference to the “high-level” activities the analysts are typically familiar with. The framework integrates two classification approaches traditionally used as alternative ways to decide on the “secureness” of process traces: (i) a model-driven approach, using knowledge of behavioral models expressed at the abstraction level of the activities, and (ii) an example driven approach, exploiting the availability of event sequences labeled by experts as symptomatic of “secure” or “insecure” behavior. The core of our solution is a meta-classifier combining (i) and (ii) thanks to a probabilistic Montecarlo mechanism that allows the traces to be simultaneously viewed as sequences of low-level events and of high-level activities. The framework has been empirically proved effective in jointly exploiting the two aforementioned forms of knowledge/expertise, typically coming from different experts, and in acting as a sort of “super-expert” classification tool. Its accuracy and efficiency make it a solid basis for implementing a novel kind of expert system for the security-oriented monitoring/analysis of business processes."

pub.1143000817,Gender-related Analysis in American Advertisements TV,"Advertising is “the non-personal communication of information usually paid for and persuasive in nature about product, service or ideas by identified sponsors through the various media” (Buren,1992:7). The ad aims to market products and services, this is according to business and this is an effective marketing tool. Advertising also offers information so that customers are aware of what is available, who makes it, and where they can get it (Durant & Lambron, 2009: 93). Advertisers need to consider gender differences to the best capacity possible to use appropriate advertisement design features. The most significant aspect of gender issues for advertisers can be how males and females react differently to the advertisement. So, “the focus is on how gender in language and society is negotiated and how linguistic forms represent and shape social and cultural conditions in which men and females live”. (Behnam and Zamanian, 2014:4) American advertisements often contain different meta-functions that are worthy of analysis. The present study intends to analyze American advertisements according to the three meta-functions such as ideational, interpersonal, and textual. This study examined 5 American advertisements (each one of them has a different theme) from a verbal and non-verbal perspective, based on the three meta-functions models developed by Halliday (1994). The results of the study revealed that American advertisements are biased to females rather than males to introduce the products because they considered females as powerful signs who use their high attractiveness to promote the products or brands. Concerning the grammatical aspects, the results showed that material process, mental process, declarative mood, and first-person pronouns are the highest used to achieve the goals of this study."

pub.1106360118,Full Meta Object profiling for flexible geoprocessing workflows,"Abstract The design and running of complex geoprocessing workflows is an increasingly common geospatial modelling and analysis task. The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard, which provides a graphical representation of a workflow, allows stakeholders to discuss the scientific conceptual approach behind this modelling while also defining a machine‐readable encoding in XML. Previous research has enabled the orchestration of Open Geospatial Consortium Web Processing Services (WPS) with a BPMN workflow engine. However, the need for direct access to predefined data inputs and outputs results in a lack of flexibility during composition of the workflow and of efficiency during execution. This article develops metadata profiling approaches, described as two possible configurations, which enable workflow management at the meta‐level through a coupling with a metadata catalogue. Specifically, a WPS profile and a BPMN profile are developed and tested using open‐source components to achieve this coupling. A case study in the context of an event mapping task applied within a big data framework and based on analysis of the Global Database of Event Language and Tone database illustrates the two different architectures."
pub.1000675299,Pragmatic applications of the Semantic Web using SemTalk,"The Semantic Web is a new layer of the Internet that enables semantic representation of the contents of existing Web pages. Using common ontologies, human users sketch out the most important facts in models that act as intelligent whiteboards. Once models are broadcasted to the Internet, new and intelligent search engines, “ambient” intelligent devices and agents will be able to exploit this knowledge network.SemTalk is designed to empower end-users to contribute to the Semantic Web by offering an easy-to use MS Visio-based graphical editor to create RDF-like schema and workflows. Since the modeled data is found by Microsoft’s Office XP SmartTags, users benefit from the knowledge captured in such a ‘Semantic Web’ as a natural byproduct of their daily work with other Microsoft Office products such as Word, Excel or Outlook.SemTalk has a graphically configurable meta model. It extends the functionality of the Visio modeling tool because users can easily configure Visio to conform to different modeling worlds such as Business Engineering and CASE methodologies. These diverse modeling views can also be applied to any other Visio drawings.This paper presents the following applied uses of this technology:•Department-wide information modeling at the Credit Suisse Bank. The main emphasis of this project was to linguistically standardize terms. Based on a common central glossary, local knowledge management teams developed specialized models for their decentralized departments. As part of the knowledge management process, local glossaries were continually integrated into a commonly shared model.•Data warehouse modeling for the AOK Berlin, a health insurance company. As part of establishing a data warehouse, there was a need to document the contents of the data warehouse such as cubes and reports. Initially this was done in a MS Word-document but documentation soon became hard to navigate through and staff were reluctant to keep data current. A distributed, decentralized modeling approach was undertaken to implement these cubes and reports locally by local process experts.•Business process management project: distributed process modeling of the Bausparkasse Deutscher Ring, a German financial institution, to create an industry-specific Semantic Web. Several groups of students from the Technical University FH Brandenburg explored how to develop and apply an industry-specific Semantic Web using business process modeling.•Knowledge Representation experiment performed at the ISWC2002 in Sardinia to create a graphical knowledge base of Semantic Web research presented at the conference. This paper is an extended version of our original WWW2002 paper. It includes a more detailed technical discussion of key issues such as interface engines as well as the addition of more practical examples of how this technology can be used."
pub.1048445228,Integration and verification of semantic constraints in adaptive process management systems,"Adaptivity in process management systems is key to their successful applicability in practice. Approaches have been already developed to ensure system correctness after arbitrary process changes at the syntactical level (e.g., avoiding inconsistencies such as deadlocks or missing input parameters after a process change). However, errors may be still caused at the semantical level (e.g., violation of business rules). Therefore, the integration and verification of domain knowledge will flag a milestone in the development of adaptive process management technology. In this paper, we introduce a framework for defining semantic constraints over processes in such a way that they can express real-world domain knowledge on the one hand and are still manageable concerning the effort for maintenance and semantic process verification on the other hand. This can be used to detect semantic conflicts (e.g., drug incompatibilities) when modeling process templates, applying ad hoc changes at process instance level, and propagating process template modifications to already running process instances, even if they have been already individually modified themselves; i.e., we present techniques to ensure semantic correctness for single and concurrent changes which are, in addition, minimal regarding the set of semantic constraints to be checked. Together with further optimizations of the semantic checks based on certain process meta model properties this allows for efficiently verifying processes. Altogether, the framework presented in this paper provides the basis for process management systems which are adaptive and semantic-aware at the same time."

However, while systems and software have standardized languages for their visual representations, communications lack them. Accordingly, the main objective of our efforts was to define a visual language for the modeling of corporate communications, based on the Business Process Model and Notation standard. To achieve the stated objectives, we applied a system design approach as follows. Based on the literature and by identifying the potential use-cases, the technological requirements of the language were specified. On that basis, we defined a notation, a meta-model and an Extensible markup language based representation of the proposed solution and finally validated it via modeled diagrams. The main result is a standard-based and interchangeable language for representing corporate communications. Additionally, we demonstrated all of its capabilities in two illustrative examples and positioned the proposed language within an organizational setting."
pub.1063009017,A PLATFORM FOR SERVICE PROVIDER TO ADVERTISE QUALITY OF SERVICE USING WSDL,"Web services are programs which perform some elementary business process of an application and are distributed over the Internet. These services are described, discovered and executed using standard languages WSDL, SOAP and UDDI. Proliferation of web services has resulted in intense competition between providers, which provide the same service. To survive in such a competitive environment, they need to advertise the quality of their service. Web service description language does not provide support to describe quality attributes. Recently, DAmbrogio proposed QOS model of web services based on a meta model of WSDL. In this paper, we present a platform to advertise QOS as declared by the service provider. This tool generates a WSDL file from Java code along with its quality of service attributes. It accepts Java code and a file containing quality attributes. These attributes include reliability, availability, and operation demand and operation latency. These attributes are included in WSDL file as a content of description element."
pub.1049981261,A meta model for authorisations in application security systems and their integration into RBAC administration,"This paper presents a new concept for efficient access rights administration and access control. It focuses on the special requirements of application security and reflects experiences from the implementation of security for large industry application systems. Application security shows a considerable inherent complexity due to the large number of combinations of objects and processes for which access rights must be defined. Based on practical experiences, this paper introduces a new approach for the implementation of access control for application systems which reduces this complexity. After describing the challenges for such an approach, we introduce process spaces and object spaces as a basis for authorisations. We show how they make application security maintainable, controllable and offer sufficient flexibility for reaction to changing business needs. In addition, we discuss how a separation of administration and access layers allows for convenient administration as well as optimised access decision performance in business-critical applications. To facilitate the integration of this rule-based concept into enterprise-wide security administration, we show how application security can be integrated into role-based access control (RBAC) systems. In particular, this goal is achieved by enhancing Enterprise RBAC (ERBAC) with variable roles. These roles can contain variable process and object spaces referencing user and role attributes. Finally, we give a short overview over related work."
pub.1043631165,Opportunity Tree Framework Design For Optimization of Software Development Project Performance,"Today, IT organizations perform projects with vision related to marketing and financial profit. The objective of realizing the vision is to improve the project performing ability in terms of QCD. Organizations have made a lot of efforts to achieve this objective through process improvement. Large companies such as IBM, Ford, and GE have made over of success through business process re-engineering using information technology instead of business improvement effect by computers. It is important to collect, analyze and manage the data on performed projects to achieve the objective, but quantitative measurement is difficult as software is invisible and the effect and efficiency caused by process change are not visibly identified. Therefore, it is not easy to extract the strategy of improvement. This paper measures and analyzes the project performance, focusing on organizations' external effectiveness and internal efficiency (Qualify, Delivery, Cycle time, and Waste). Based on the measured project performance scores, an OT (Opportunity Tree) model was designed for optimizing the project performance. The process of design is as follows. First, meta data are derived from projects and analyzed by quantitative GQM(Goal-Question-Metric) questionnaire. Then, the project performance model is designed with the data obtained from the quantitative GQM questionnaire and organization's performance score for each area is calculated. The value is revised by integrating the measured scores by area vision weights from all stakeholders (CEO, middle-class managers, developer, investor, and custom). Through this, routes for improvement are presented and an optimized improvement method is suggested. Existing methods to improve software process have been highly effective in division of processes' but somewhat unsatisfactory in structural function to develop and systemically manage strategies by applying the processes to Projects. The proposed OT model provides a solution to this problem. The OT model is useful to provide an optimal improvement method in line with organization's goals and can reduce risks which may occur in the course of improving process if it is applied with proposed methods. In addition, satisfaction about the improvement strategy can be improved by obtaining input about vision weight from all stakeholders through the qualitative questionnaire and by reflecting it to the calculation. The OT is also useful to optimize the expansion of market and financial performance by controlling the ability of Quality, Delivery, Cycle time, and Waste."
pub.1092105045,A Configurable WoT Application Platform Based on Spatiotemporal Semantic Scenarios,"With the transformation of Internet of Things to Web of Things (WoT), a variety of applications are required to deal with huge volumes of real-time and heterogeneous data. However, in most applications, due to the weak semantics of data itself and the loose combination with specific scenarios, it is sometimes difficult to depict the spatiotemporal feature of the scenario in an application only through the data. In this paper, a spatiotemporal semantic scenario meta-model-based configurable platform is proposed for the development of WoT applications to address this issue, based on the data configuration, event stream configuration, and service encapsulation, the entire WoT scenario can be depicted with an abstract data model and related rules, and the business process can be changed by redefining corresponding rules when requirements change. A case study is given to verify the feasibility of our platform. The result shows that the platform can provide background support for WoT applications in a promising way."

This study proposes the use of a hybrid computational intelligence technique — an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system — for the effective identification and selection of sustainable suppliers. This hybrid modelling configuration was applied in a paint manufacturing company to select the best possible supplier. Information obtained from the company within the period of investigation was fed into the model. The result obtained shows a faster and more reliable prediction by the creative model. Professionals and business managers will benefit greatly from the selection of sustainable suppliers in an in-bound and out-bound supply chain system."

DoDAF is the basis for integrated architectures and provides broad levels of specification related to operational, system, and technical views. In our earlier work, we described an approach to support specification of DoDAF architectures within a development environment based on DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) for semi-automated construction of the needed simulation models. The result is an enhanced system lifecycle development process that includes both development and testing in an integral manner. We also developed automated model generation using XML which paves the way for OVs to become service-providing components in the Web Services architecture. In this paper we present the semantic structure for one of the Operational View documents OV-6a that would aid the development of these semi-automated models. We will describe how OV-6a can be structured in a more generalized meta-model framework such that every rule is reducible to meaningful code which is automatedly constructed through Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and further be reduced to DEVS based models. The paper also presents an overview of the Life-cycle development methodology for these enterprise architectures and how a common enterprise domain-model can be used in customized business/domain-specific rules and policy structures."

In our earlier work, we described an approach to support specification of DoDAF architectures within a development environment based on DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) for semi-automated construction of the needed simulation models. The result is an enhanced system lifecycle development process that includes both development and testing in an integral manner. We also developed automated model generation using XML which paves the way for OVs to become service-providing components in the Web Services architecture. In this paper we present the semantic structure for one of the Operational View documents OV-6a that would aid the development of these semi-automated models. We will describe how OV-6a can be structured in a more generalized meta-model framework such that every rule is reducible to meaningful code which is automatedly constructed through Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and further be reduced to DEVS based models. The paper also presents an overview of the Life-cycle development methodology for these enterprise architectures and how a common enterprise domain-model can be used in customized business/domain-specific rules and policy structures."
pub.1035189332,Bridging Query Languages in Semantic and Graph Technologies,"Software systems and software development itself make use of various technological spaces, e.g., relational databases, XML technology, ontologies, and programming languages. The usage of several technological spaces in a single system or development process requires a proper bridging between them. “Bridging” can be achieved by transforming concepts of one space into another, by using an adapter to make concepts of one space usable in another, or even by integrating both spaces into a single one, for instance.This paper presents a transformation-based bridge between the query languages SPARQL and GReQL, with SPARQL originating from the semantic technological space and GReQL representing the model-based space. Since transformation of queries requires the prior mapping of the queried knowledge base, the approach also involves transforming the underlying data in the form of RDF documents and TGraphs, respectively. The benefits of the bridge are shown by applying it for traceability."
pub.1116546271,知識移転の構成概念とプロセス : 知識の使用とルーチン形成の相互作用,"Knowledge is regarded as the most important source of competitive advantage in modern business. Therefore, researchers have examined knowledge transfer between organizations, especially private companies. In particular, previous studies have analyzed the factors that facilitate or prevent knowledge transfer and their effects on successful knowledge transfer. However, there is a paucity of empirical studies on knowledge transfer, and most of the existing empirical studies on the subject have focused exclusively on the relationship between the individual factors that facilitate or prevent knowledge transfer, without attempting to investigate the comprehensive model of knowledge transfer in its entirety. Thus, in an attempt to identify the unaddressed issues in the existing quantitative studies on knowledge transfer, this study conducts a meta-analysis of these studies. Subsequently, it reviews the existing knowledge transfer process model, which comprises four phases - initiation, implementation, ramp-up, and integration - and proposes a modified process model as a hypothesis. In the proposed modified model, the ramp-up phase, where the transferred knowledge is utilized, and the integration phase, where the knowledge is integrated into organizational routine, have a reciprocal relationship. In other words, in the knowledge transfer process, (1) initial routine is established by the recipient of the knowledge, (2) transferred knowledge is utilized according to the established routine, and (3) the routine is continuously updated based on the feedback obtained after the knowledge has been utilized. This modified knowledge transfer process seems to offer a better explanation of the actual knowledge transfer process, although this should be validated through empirical research."
pub.1011254752,Legitimacy and Organizational Sustainability,"The literature regarding social and environmental sustainability of business focuses primarily on rationales for adopting sustainability strategies and operational practices in support of that goal. In contrast, we examine sustainability from a perspective that has received far less research attention—attitudes that inform managerial decision-making. We develop a conceptual model that identifies six elemental categories of attitudes that can be held independently or aggregated to yield a meta-attitude representing the legitimacy of sustainability. Our model distinguishes among three types of internally held attitudes and externally perceived subjective norms: pragmatic, moral, and cognitive. We propose a refinement of Ajzen’s (In: Kuhl J, Beckmann J (eds) Action control: from cognition to behavior, 1985; Organ Behav Hum Decis Process 50:179–211, 1991) Theory of planned behavior (TPB) that incorporates these sub-categories of personal attitudes and subjective norms. Practical implications are discussed including how organizations considering adopting sustainability programs might use the model as a conceptual tool to help achieve and assess program success."
pub.1126576492,Business Analytics in Telemarketing: Cost-Sensitive Analysis of Bank Campaigns Using Artificial Neural Networks,"The banking industry has been seeking novel ways to leverage database marketing efficiency. However, the nature of bank marketing data hindered the researchers in the process of finding a reliable analytical scheme. Various studies have attempted to improve the performance of Artificial Neural Networks in predicting clients’ intentions but did not resolve the issue of imbalanced data. This research aims at improving the performance of predicting the willingness of bank clients to apply for a term deposit in highly imbalanced datasets. It proposes enhanced Artificial Neural Network models (i.e., cost-sensitive) to mitigate the dramatic effects of highly imbalanced data, without distorting the original data samples. The generated models are evaluated, validated, and consequently compared to different machine-learning models. A real-world telemarketing dataset from a Portuguese bank is used in all the experiments. The best prediction model achieved 79% of geometric mean, and misclassification errors were minimized to 0.192, 0.229 of Type I & Type II Errors, respectively. In summary, an interesting Meta-Cost method improved the performance of the prediction model without imposing significant processing overhead or altering original data samples."

These algebras, called multiplicative transition systems, are partial categories with respect to a partial binary operation called multiplication. They can be characterized by axioms such that their elements and operations can be represented by partially ordered multisets of a certain type and operations on such multisets. The representation can be obtained without assuming a discrete nature of represented elements. In particular, it remains valid for systems with elements which can represent continuous and partially continuous runs."

Yet they also contain many firms that have survived over generations. How are firms in weak institutional environments able to persist over time? Motivated by 69 interviews with leaders of emerging market firms with histories spanning generations, we combine induction and deduction to propose reputation as a meta-resource that allows firms to activate their conventional resources. We conceptualize reputation as consisting of prominence, perceived quality, and resilience, and develop a process model that illustrates the mechanisms that allow reputation to facilitate survival in ways that persist over time. Building on research in strategy and business history, we thus shed light on an underappreciated strategic construct (reputation) in an under-theorized setting (emerging markets) over an unusual period (the historical long run)."

As a method engineer it is essential to have conceptual constructs capable of reducing the burden of details during method configuration and thus make it possible to create a balance between precision and cost. In this paper we present the method component construct, which seems fruitful for method configuration and meta method development. Furthermore, by introducing an internal and an external view of this construct we can hide details of the method component during configuration work and connect method components to each other through use of interfaces expressing goals realized by the method components. The proposed concept and views can also be used in the process of developing tool-support for method configuration."
pub.1029623823,Innovation cooperative systems and structural change: An evolutionary analysis of Anecoop and Mondragon cases,"In a globalized world, clusters, or territorial production systems, need to evolve into innovation systems to retain their competitive advantages and be able to develop. This study analyzes the cooperative entrepreneurship model as a means of structural change for these clusters, constituting a third way between the private business way and the government-oriented way. Building on an evolutionist approach and a qualitative comparative methodology, the study analyzes two successful cooperatives: Mondragon and Anecoop. As a novelty, this article explains the innovation process from an institutional perspective, combining micro–meso–macro levels. The results confirm that cooperatives are able to articulate structural change processes at the meso-level and to give rise to meso-rules that are functional and determinant in the processes of structural change. The two factors that enable these processes are the cooperative Schumpeterian entrepreneurs and the Hayekian meta-institutions."
pub.1045301669,A weight and a meta-analysis on mobile banking acceptance research,"Following the globalization of business and systems, there is a pressing need to understand the main factors affecting mobile banking user acceptance. The increasing number of mobile banking studies and articles published in the last years, as well as conferences and workshops, has made the research process on this important subject more complex and time-consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to synthesize findings from existing research, seeking an update of the current state-of-the-art knowledge. A combination of weight and meta-analysis was chosen, in order to identify the frequency and relevance of the most used constructs and their most important relationships. A total of 57 articles were found in the literature, having the necessary quantitative statistical data to be considered. The best predictors of the intention to use the mobile banking services identified, simultaneously significant in the weight and in the meta-analysis, are: (i) attitude, (ii) initial trust, (iii) perceived risk, and (iv) performance expectancy. In terms of use of mobile banking, considering the same assumptions, the best predictors are: (i) intention, and (ii) performance expectancy. Facilitating conditions on attitude, task technology fit on performance expectancy, and performance expectancy on initial trust have the potential to be added to the list of the most important predictors, but they still need additional research. A theoretical model based on our results is presented, providing a means to support future mobile banking acceptance studies."
pub.1048387626,The case for process mining in auditing: Sources of value added and areas of application,"Process mining aims to extract knowledge from the event logs maintained by a company's ERP system. The objective of this paper is to make the case for why internal and external auditors should leverage the capabilities process mining offers to rethink how auditing is carried out. We do so by identifying the sources of value added of process mining when applied to auditing, which are as follows: 1. process mining analyzes the entire population of data and not just a sample; 2. critically that data consists of meta-data—data entered independently of the actions of auditee—and not just data entered by the auditee; 3. process mining allows the auditor to have a more effective way of implementing the audit risk model by providing effective ways of conducting the required walkthroughs of processes and conducting analytic procedures; 4. process mining allows the auditor to conduct analyses not possible with existing audit tools, such as discovering the ways in which business processes are actually being carried out in practice, and to identify social relationships between individuals. It is our argument that these sources of value have not been fully understood in the process mining literature, which has focused on developing it as a statistical methodology rather than on applying it to audit practice. Only when auditors and audit researchers appreciate what is new and unique about process mining will its acceptance in auditing practice become feasible."
pub.1009135259,IMSF: Infinite Methodology Set Framework,"Software development is usually an integration task in enterprise environment - few software applications work autonomously now. It is usually a collaboration of heterogeneous and unstable teams. One serious problem is lack of resources, a popular result being outsourcing, ‘body shopping’, and indirectly team and team member fluctuation. Outsourced sub-deliveries easily become black boxes with no clear development method used, which has a negative impact on supportability. Such environments then often face the problems of quality assurance and enterprise know-how management. The used methodology is one of the key factors. Each methodology was created as a generalization of a number of solved projects, and each methodology is thus more or less connected with a set of task types. When the task type is not suitable, it causes problems that usually result in an undocumented ad-hoc solution. This was the motivation behind formalizing a simple process for collaborative software engineering. Infinite Methodology Set Framework (IMSF) defines the ICT business process of adaptive use of methods for classified types of tasks. The article introduces IMSF and briefly comments its meta-model."
pub.1093244641,OntoMove: A Knowledge Based Framework for Semantic Requirement Profiling and Resource Acquisition,"The use of formal knowledge representation structures, or ontologies, has found immense applicability for the interoperability of software systems, e.g., alignment of software and business process models. Toward the management of such knowledge structures, an important foundational problem is that of ontology reuse - it is uncommon for new applications or for different components within one application to use an already available ontology in its entirety. Depending on component specific requirements, typical re-usages are restricted to refined versions of an existing ontology, with the refinement taking the form of a contraction of the knowledge contained therein. Furthermore, when the ontology is used to ascribe meaning to independently existing 'resources' (e.g., documents collections, source code, software manuals, process template repositories) by way of meta-data, there exists a direct mapping between different views/re-uses of an ontology and their respective semantic scopes within an annotated resource repository thereby leading to the concept of view/reuse dependent resource retrieval. We implement a framework that supports ontology reuse by way of a requirement driven sub-ontology extraction methodology. Additionally, based on this concept of a sub-ontology, we implement the idea of a user/component 'requirement profile' consisting of semantic descriptions of the user's interest within a 'resource repository' that has been annotated with semantic types from the ontology under consideration. A generic framework that implements these ideas and its application in the domains of medical information retrieval systems and business process management systems (BPMS) is presented."
pub.1005503136,Sequential Patterns for Maintaining Ontologies over Time,"Ontologies are known as a quality and functional model, allowing meta data representation and reasoning. However, their maintenance plays a crucial role as ontologies may be misleading if they are not up to date. Currently, this work is done manually, and raises the problem of expert subjectivity. Therefore, some works have developed maintenance tools but none has allowed a precise identification of the relations that could link concepts. In this paper, we propose a new fully generic approach combining sequential patterns extraction and equivalence classes. Our method allows to identify terms from textual documents and to define labelized association rules from sequential patterns according to relevance and neighborhood measures. Moreover, this process proposes the placement of the found elements refined by the use of equivalence classes. Results of various experiments on real data highlight the relevance of our proposal."

Of the different aspects to highlight in these environments, in this chapter we put our main attention on those that are more directly related to the goal of helping in the management of SM complexity: to approach the SMP from a wide perspective of business processes to integrate technological and management aspects; to define a Process-centered Software Engineering Environment (PSEE); and to use a multilevel conceptual architecture based on standards like MOF (Meta-Object Facility). The MANTIS proposal of integral environment for the management of SM projects is also presented, and the main components of this environment are commented: conceptual tools (multilevel architecture, ontologies, software processes models and metamodels); methodological tools (methodology, and interfaces with organizational and managerial processes) and technical tools (horizontal and vertical software tools, repository, and interaction with process enactment software tools)."
pub.1113643973,A Multi-criteria Evaluation Approach for Selecting a Sensitive Business Process Modeling Language for Knowledge Management,"In an organizational context, the modeling and representation of sensitive business processes (SBPs) have become an effective way of managing and developing organization’s knowledge that needs to be capitalized. These processes are characterized by a high complexity and dynamism in their execution, high number of critical activities with intensive acquisition, sharing, storage and (re)use of very specific crucial knowledge, large diversity of heterogeneous knowledge and information sources, high number of knowledge conversion actions and high degree of collaboration among experts. Thus, the specification of a precise conceptualization for SBPs, and the selection of an appropriate SBP modeling language that adequately characterizes and integrates all their relevant dimensions are of prime importance. We aim at improving the localization and identification of the crucial knowledge that are mobilized by and created by these processes. This paper proposes a multi-criteria-based approach for evaluating and comparing currently widely used modeling languages (process oriented and knowledge oriented) for the representation of SBPs, taking into account their specific modeling requirements. We consider guiding and justifying the choice of the most suitable SBP modeling language for knowledge identification purposes. The different modeling languages are originally assessed according to the ontological completeness of SBP modeling aspects (i.e., the coverage of the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge dimensions) based on the BPM4KI meta-model (as an SBP specification based on core ontologies). Secondly, they are evaluated according to several key requirement indicators (e.g., understandability, expressibility, complexity, level of adoption, tools availability and extendibility). Results show that none of the studied languages, individually, satisfies all the SBP modeling requirements. In this study, we choose the better one positioned nowadays, BPMN 2.0, as the best suited standard for SBP representation. Moreover, we develop a valid extension of BPMN 2.0 «BPMN4SBP» for integrating and implementing all relevant SBP modeling dimensions (the six BPM4KI dimensions), exploring the dynamic, interaction and knowledge aspects. The extension is then used to illustrate the representation of SBPs in a real case study in the healthcare domain."
pub.1163089071,An extended taxonomy of advanced information visualization and interaction in conceptual modeling,"Conceptual modeling is integral to computer science research and is widely adopted in industrial practices, e.g., business process and enterprise architecture management. Providing adequate and usable modeling tools is necessary to adopt modeling languages efficiently. Meta-modeling platforms provide a rich and mature set of functionalities for realizing state-of-the-art modeling tools. These tools, albeit their stability and rich set of features, often lack a modern look and feel considering ( i ) how they visualize the models, and ( i i ) how modelers interact with the models. Current web technologies enable much richer, advanced opportunities for visualizing and interacting with conceptual models. However, a structured and comprehensive overview of possible information visualization and interaction techniques linked to conceptual models and modeling tools must be established. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting an extended taxonomy of advanced information visualization and interaction in conceptual modeling. We present a generic taxonomy that is afterward contextualized within the specific domain of conceptual modeling. The taxonomy serves orientation in the vast developing field of information visualization and interaction and hopefully sparks innovation if future modeling tool development."
pub.1094107783,Study on a Flexible Workflow Technology and Its application,"The workflow technology has been widely used in enterprise business process management and developed very fast. Its main characteristic is to enable the process automation, which can coordinate persons or persons and application tools in order to complete a particular work. A flexible workflow technology is studied in this paper. Based on XML, a visual process definition tool is realized. According to the Petri-net model, workflow model was described and analyzed in detail. The flow engine design method was proposed and then realized. XML is a meta markup language, which can separate data from display format. Because of its superior characteristics such as robustness, self-description, expandability and easy use, XML is very suitable for this technology. By using the visual process definition tool, even non-professionals can define the desired process and modify it easily. Petri net both has rigorous mathematical formulation and has intuitive graphical expression. It not only has rich systematical description means and systematical behavior analysis technology, but also can provide a solid conceptual foundation for computer science. As a model of describing asynchronous and concurrent system, Petri net is one of main modeling techniques. The flexible workflow technology which can greatly support embranchment and parallel was proposed in this paper. When unexpected event happened, it is very convenient to control and adjust the flow without interrupting the execution, and therefore, it demonstrates a great flexibility of selectivity and adaptability. The technology also can be conveniently embedded into the web project which has greatly facilitated the project development. In this paper, the example of stuff demission is used to illustrate the application of this workflow."
pub.1006601458,Models of Interaction as a Grounding for Peer to Peer Knowledge Sharing,"Most current attempts to achieve reliable knowledge sharing on a large scale have relied on pre-engineering of content and supply services. This, like traditional knowledge engineering, does not by itself scale to large, open, peer to peer systems because the cost of being precise about the absolute semantics of services and their knowledge rises rapidly as more services participate. We describe how to break out of this deadlock by focusing on semantics related to interaction and using this to avoid dependency on a priori semantic agreement; instead making semantic commitments incrementally at run time. Our method is based on interaction models that are mobile in the sense that they may be transferred to other components, this being a mechanism for service composition and for coalition formation. By shifting the emphasis to interaction (the details of which may be hidden from users) we can obtain knowledge sharing of sufficient quality for sustainable communities of practice without the barrier of complex meta-data provision prior to community formation."
pub.1044126195,Beyond Workflow Mining,"In the domain of Business Process Management and Workflow Management Systems, the log of work transactions executed has been found to be a useful artifact. The ideas, work, and literature on workflow mining have been primarily concerned with examining the workflow event log to rediscover control flow. Workflow mining has generally been defined as “the process of extracting a workflow model from a log of executions of activities”. In fact, most of the literature specifically and narrowly is concerned with rediscovering the precedence relations amongst activities. It is generally a hidden assumption that all activities are known a priori because they are listed by label in the workflow event log. In this position paper, we explore the possibility of removing this assumption, and thus performing workflow discovery rather than precedence rediscovery. Workflow discovery does not assume that process structure or even activities are known a priori and is concerned with discovering a wholistic perspective of workflow.Workflow management systems are people systems that must be designed, deployed, and understood within their social and organizational contexts. Thus, we argue in this document that there is a need to expand the concept of workflow mining beyond the behavioral perspective to encompass the social, organizational, and activity assignment perspectives; as well as other perspectives. To this end, we introduce a general framework and meta-model for workflow discovery, and show one approach to workflow discovery in a multidimensional perspective."
pub.1173534365,Features and Opportunities of Companies Digitalization,"The economy and the society transformation caused by digitalization poses new challenges for organizations of all sizes, forms of ownership and industries. The digital age provides companies with access to new ideas, technologies, business models and markets. Companies will increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to perform basic routine tasks. The rapid change of customers’ needs leads to restructuring of value chains and market structures. At the same time, new strategic perspectives are emerging, the old business models becoming uncompetitive. The vast majority of Russian companies consider digitalization a priority in their activities because of financial benefits. Reducing transaction costs (the costs associated with finding and processing the necessary data) increases flexibility and efficiency of the economy. Digitalization stimulates innovation process in the service sector and allows opening completely new business lines and markets that were previously not available due to the lack of technical capabilities. Digital platforms are playing increasingly important economic role, and some of them have already gained very strong global positions (Google occupies 90% of the search engine, Meta accounts for two thirds of the global social media market, and 40% of online sales are carried out through Amazon). These trends can lead to increased inequality and concentration of wealth in the hands of small group of individuals. Therefore, the inclusiveness of the digital economy is unacceptable. The purpose of the study is to determine digitalization features and prospects of modern organizations business activities. Dialectical and logical methods were used in the article to form causal relationships in the processes of digital transformation of enterprises. As a result, the article reveals the economic features of digitalization, which are the drivers of scientific and technological progress at the present time. Attention is paid to the advantages that digital technologies bring to companies, starting from the possibility of maintaining their place in the market and ending with higher salaries for employees."
pub.1164761250,An ensemble learning approach for anomaly detection in credit card data with imbalanced and overlapped classes,"Electronic payment methods have become increasingly popular for business transactions, both online and in-person, across the globe. Anomalies like online fraud and default payments, which can result in substantial financial losses, have become more common as the usage of credit cards in online purchases has increased. To address this issue, researchers have explored various machine learning models and their ensemble techniques for detecting anomalies in credit card transaction data. However, detecting anomalies in this data can be challenging due to overlapping class samples and an imbalanced class distribution. Therefore, the detection rate of anomalies from minority class samples is relatively low, and general learning algorithms can be biased towards the majority class samples. In this paper, we propose a model called Credit Card Anomaly Detection (CCAD) that leverages the base learners paradigm and meta-learning ensemble techniques to improve the detection rate of credit card anomalies. We utilize four outlier detection algorithms as base learners and XGBoost algorithm as meta learner in the proposed stacked ensemble approach to detect anomaly in credit card transactions. We apply stratified sampling technique and k-fold cross-validation process to address the issues of data imbalance and overfitting. In addition, the discordance rate is calculated to enhance the accuracy of ensemble learning performances. The proposed model is trained and tested using two datasets: CCF (Credit Card Fraud) and CCDP (Credit Card Default Payment). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches, particularly in detecting anomalies from the minority class instances of these datasets."
pub.1094095006,A Programming Model for Context-Aware Applications in Large-Scale Pervasive Systems,"In recent years, new business and research opportunities have been increasingly emerging in the field of large-scale contextaware pervasive systems (e.g, pervasive health-care, city traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, smart grids). These largescale pervasive systems are characterized by the need to employ large number of context sources, process massive amounts of real-time context data, provide services to numerous context-aware applications, and cope with higher volatility of the environment. This paper proposes the Origins Model — a programming model for context-aware applications in large-scale pervasive systems. In the Origins Model, an origin is an abstraction of any source of context information. Origins are universal, discoverable, composable, migratable, and replicable components that are associated with type and meta-information. They create an adequate foundation for the development of context-aware applications. Based on them, four processing operations are defined in the Origins Model: filter, infer, aggregate, and compose. As such, these operations provide a powerful mechanism to express a rich set of processing schemes in context-aware applications. Based on the Origins Model, we present the Origins Toolkit - a proof-ofconcept implementation developed using the Scala programming language and the Akka toolkit to provide a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant solution."
pub.1026939813,A Web-enabled virtual repository for supporting distributed automotive component development,"This paper describes a web-enabled repository system that has been designed for supporting distributed automotive component development. The repository is based on an integrated product and process life-cycle information model, derived from ISO standards and using EPISTLE generic entity modelling principles. This core model can be used with reference data libraries, such as for activities, components, documents and properties. The scope and characteristics of the model are described, along with its relation to standard product data models and classification schemes. Component design and analysis representational models are referenced as resources through document meta-data, with virtual access via the repository. The modelling approach is compatible with the current development of ontologies and topic maps for the Semantic Web, with an inter-operability route via the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The paper also provides an outline of the system architecture, the associated Web tools and the Business Object library for building client-server applications. An industrial application for fatigue studies is described, illustrating comparison of analysis and test data, repository search and provision of best practice advice. The aim is to produce a flexible system that can be populated and extended directly by engineers, shielding them from the details of the information model."
pub.1128105254,Optimal Key Generation for Data Sanitization and Restoration of Cloud Data: Future of Financial Cyber Security,"Cloud security in finance is considered as the key importance, taking account of the aspect of critical data stored over cloud spaces within organizations all around the globe. They are chiefly relying on cloud computing to accelerate their business profitability and scale up their business processes with enhanced productivity coming through flexible work environments offered in cloud-run working systems. Hence, there is a prerequisite to contemplate cloud security in the entire financial service sector. Moreover, the main issue challenged by privacy and security is the presence of diverse chances to attack the sensitive data by cloud operators, which leads to double the user’s anxiety on the stored data. For solving this problem, the main intent of this paper is to develop an intelligent privacy preservation approach for data stored in the cloud sector, mainly the financial data. The proposed privacy preservation model involves two main phases: (a) data sanitization and (b) data restoration. In the sanitization process, the sensitive data is hidden, which prevents sensitive information from leaking on the cloud side. Further, the normal as well as the sensitive data is stored in a cloud environment. For the sanitization process, a key should be generated that depends on the new meta-heuristic algorithm called crossover improved-lion algorithm (CI-LA), which is inspired by the lion’s unique social behavior. During data restoration, the same key should be used for effectively restoring the original data. Here, the optimal key generation is done in such a way that the objective model involves the degree of modification, hiding rate, and information preservation rate, which effectively enhance the cyber security performance in the cloud."
pub.1124881599,Design of a Domain-Specific Metamodel for Industrial Business Process Management,"Enterprises operate in fast-changing environments nowadays and experience the continuous need to adapt to changing circumstances and new strategical and technological developments. This observation impacts how enterprise information systems are analysed, designed, implemented and used. Focusing on the analysis and design phases, conceptual modelling methods in the field of enterprise architecture management experience a continuous evolution in research and practice. Existing methods are re-purposed for specific requirements, new methods are developed/evaluated in concrete industrial settings and coupling/integration techniques support holistic viewpoints. Nevertheless, current practices in the design and enactment of such methods, and more specifically their metamodels, are inefficient with respect to agile and iterative considerations. Within this paper, a novel design approach for modelling method engineering is discussed that builds on the notion of meta-models as conceptual structures. Syntactic and semantic operation on these structures aim to facilitate the design process following the design science research methodology. The approach is evaluated by introducing a case developed as part of the European research project GOOD MAN. In the context of the project an enterprise architecture metamodel has been designed, developed and deployed that supports an integrated viewpoint of conceptual model artefacts coupled with operational data visualisations to assess the effectiveness of design decisions."

Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial
characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for
conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process
includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding
and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five
meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept

                    To reduce the negative impact of knowledge loss and to improve knowledge reuse effectiveness in knowledge management in e-Enterprises, this paper presents a context-aware approach to facilitate managing various types of static enterprise information and dynamic process information. Proposed approach features representing and integrating information at different conceptual levels to present contextual knowledge in an open environment. In this paper, we redefine the concept of
                    context
                    in intelligent systems and propose a set of meta-information elements for context description in business environments. In realising the context-awareness in knowledge management, we present a context knowledge structure model and look into the corresponding context knowledge storage and reuse solutions. To enhance context-aware knowledge management for e-Businesses over the global network, we introduce a new concept of
                    Context Knowledge Grid
                    with a layered knowledge interoperation reference model, which are supposed to leverage the contextual knowledge in e-Enterprises and enable interoperation with other knowledge frameworks such as the Semantic Web and the Semantic Grid.

pub.1048432130,Modelling the evolution of legacy systems to Web‐based systems,"Abstract To advance operational legacy systems, with their out‐of‐date software, distributed data and entrenched business processes, to systems that can take advantage of current Web technologies to give consistent, customized and secure access to existing information bases and legacy systems is a complex and daunting task. The Institutionally Secure Integrated Data Environment (INSIDE) is a collaborative project between the Universities of St Andrews and Durham that is addressing the issues surrounding the development and delivery of integrated systems for large institutions, constrained by the requirement of working with the existing information bases and legacy systems. The work has included an exploration of the incremental evolution of existing systems by building Web‐based value‐added services upon foundations derived from analysing and modelling the existing legacy systems. Progressing from initial informal models to more formal domain and requirements models in a systematic way, following a meta‐process incorporating good practice from domain analysis and requirements engineering has allowed the project to lay the foundation for its development of Web‐based services.

and society. Despite its successes, mental frameworks to capture and represent
machine learning workflows in a consistent and coherent manner are lacking. For
instance, the de facto process modeling standard, Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN), managed by the Object Management Group, is widely accepted and
applied. However, it is short of specific support to represent machine learning
workflows. Further, the number of heterogeneous tools for deployment of machine
learning solutions can easily overwhelm practitioners. Research is needed to
align the process from modeling to deploying ML workflows.
  We analyze requirements for standard based conceptual modeling for machine
learning workflows and their serverless deployment. Confronting the
shortcomings with respect to consistent and coherent modeling of ML workflows
in a technology independent and interoperable manner, we extend BPMN's
Meta-Object Facility (MOF) metamodel and the corresponding notation and
introduce BPMN4sML (BPMN for serverless machine learning). Our extension
BPMN4sML follows the same outline referenced by the Object Management Group
(OMG) for BPMN. We further address the heterogeneity in deployment by proposing
a conceptual mapping to convert BPMN4sML models to corresponding deployment
models using TOSCA.
  BPMN4sML allows technology-independent and interoperable modeling of machine
learning workflows of various granularity and complexity across the entire
machine learning lifecycle. It aids in arriving at a shared and standardized
language to communicate ML solutions. Moreover, it takes the first steps toward
enabling conversion of ML workflow model diagrams to corresponding deployment
models for serverless deployment via TOSCA."

Defined by Kingdon (1995) as individuals willing to invest their resources—time, energy, reputation and sometimes money—in return for future policies which they favour, policy entrepreneurs are thought to play a pivotal role in policy change and diffusion. In Kingdon’s multiple streams model, the policy process is conceived as policy windows which open as a result of the coupling of three streams—problems, policy content, and politics (Kingdon, 1995). It is argued that such windows could be joined by chance or by an entrepreneurial leader with a strong desire to effect significant change to current ways of doing things in his or her area of policy interest (Mintrom & Norman, 2009)."

The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement process was followed and Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) sources were used for the document search. A total of 248 documents were found (Scopus = 110; WoS = 138), and the final selection was 34 papers. The GM practices found were placed in five categories: (a) Green products and services; (b) Green business image; (c) Green advertising; (d) Green purchasing experience; (e) Green marketing mix. The key variables of purchasing behavior that were found are: Environmental awareness, Green satisfaction, Green attitude, Green purchasing intention, Green purchasing preference, Word of mouth, Perceived value, Green experiential value, Responsible consumption, Green engagement, Green trust, Green loyalty, and Green purchasing decision. Finally, a sustainable value generation model called “Green consumption cycle for sustainable value” was presented."
pub.1037020769,On the Controlled Evolution of Access Rules in Cooperative Information Systems,"For several reasons enterprises are frequently subject to organizational change. Respective adaptations may concern business processes, but also other components of an enterprise architecture. In particular, changes of organizational structures often become necessary.The information about organizational entities and their relationships is maintained in organizational models. Therefore the quick and correct adaptation of these models is fundamental to adequately cope with changes. However, model changes alone are not sufficient to guarantee consistency. Since organizational models also provide the basis for defining access rules (e.g., actor assignments in workflow management systems or access rules in document–centered applications) this information has to be adapted accordingly (e.g., to avoid non-resolvable actor assignments). Current approaches do not adequately address this problem, which often leads to security gaps and delayed change adaptations.In this paper we present a comprehensive approach for the controlled evolution of organizational models in cooperative information systems. First, we introduce a set of operators with well-defined semantics for defining and changing organizational models. Second, we present an advanced approach for the semi-automated adaptation of access rules when the underlying organizational model is changed. This includes a formal part concerning both the evolution of organizational models and the adaptation of related access rules."
pub.1151709716,Rethinking Model Representation - A Taxonomy of Advanced Information Visualization in Conceptual Modeling,"Conceptual modeling is an integral part of computer science research and is widely adopted in industrial practices, e.g., business process and enterprise architecture management. Providing adequate and usable modeling tools is necessary for the efficient adoption of modeling languages. Meta-modeling platforms provide a rich set of functionalities and are mature in realizing state-of-the-art modeling tools. However, despite their maturity and stability, most of these platforms did not yet leverage the full extent of functionalities and the ease of exploitation and integration enabled by web technologies. Current web technologies now enable much richer, advanced opportunities for visualizing and interacting with conceptual models. However, a structured and comprehensive overview of possible information visualization techniques linked to conceptual models and modeling tools is lacking. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a taxonomy of advanced information visualization, albeit its generic nature, applicable to conceptual modeling. We believe this taxonomy greatly benefits researchers by providing a standard frame to position their works and for method and tool engineers to spark innovation."

As part of a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) project, six faculty members representing the university's Schools of Arts and Sciences, Business, Education and Professional Studies, and Engineering and Technology implemented the 4MAT model in their respective classes during the fall 2007 semester. 4MAT is a teaching methodology posited by Bernice McCarthy (1987) that is built upon the principles of learning styles and their relationship to the natural learning cycle. Use of the 4MAT Model in K–12 settings has been supported by research (Wilkerson & White 1988; Blair & Judah 1990). This article lends support to using 4MAT in a higher education setting. Faculty engaged in the SoTL project at the completion of the semester asked their students to complete a Likert scale survey comparing their redesigned courses to comparable college courses. A meta-analysis of these data indicated significant findings for six out of the eight comparative statements measured."
pub.1112983866,Performance-driven software development: an incremental refinement approach for high-quality requirement engineering,"By increasing the importance of the performance in industrial and business software systems, efficient approaches to model-based performance engineering are becoming an inherent part of the development life cycle. Performance engineering at abstract levels of the software development process has an important effect on concluding the success of the software by obtaining the knowledge of optimal alternative designs. This paper introduces the performance-driven software development approach and a prediction technique that regards performance quality attributes at the abstract levels of the software development in an incremental refinement manner. The approach provides Z-based specification formalism at the meta-model level in which its instance models are automatically transformed into the formal performance analytical model, called refinable state machine (RSM). This paper analyses the throughput of a RSM by performing an approximation algorithm on two experimental case studies to determine weights of subjective performance characteristics. The approach can use the inherent performance parameters according to product usage and derive an incremental probabilistic policy determination method under design decisions in the performance plan hierarchy. The results exhibit significant support of abstract level performance profiling in terms of the throughput values."

pub.1152125148,Energy communities as demand-side innovators? Assessing the potential of European cases to reduce demand and foster flexibility,"Energy communities (ECs) are widely recognised for their potential to generate renewable energy. By contrast, the capacity of ECs to reduce energy demand and foster flexibility has attracted little attention to date, despite their theoretical potential to do so. To address this gap, we apply three perspectives – social representations theory, actor-network theory, and business models – to the analysis of nine case studies based in six European countries (Germany, Italy, Slovenia, Sweden, Netherlands, and United Kingdom). The core of the article comprises analysis of the nine cases from each perspective. Our results highlight the (un)intended effects of ECs on the energy representations of members; the configurational work required by focal actors to assemble new socio-technical configurations; and the value creation and capture opportunities open to ECs in the creation of novel business models; These factors in turn impact whether and how ECs achieve demand reduction and flexibility. We summarise and discuss these results in a process of meta-theoretical triangulation to produce a multifaceted and relational account of the potential of ECs to develop demand-side solutions. This leads us to conclude that ECs have a distinct capacity to develop demand-side solutions, rooted in the creation of innovative socio-technical configurations; and that this distinct capacity of ECs has the potential to complement and extend the contemporary focus on the use of market mechanisms to achieve demand reduction and increase flexibility."

More than 100 books have been written about UML, and it is taught to students throughout the world. The de?nition of UML version 2 is well under way, and should be largely completed within the year. This will not only improve and enhance UML itself, including standard facilities for diagram interchange, but also make it fully integrated with other modeling technologies from the OMG, such as Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and XML Metadata Interchange (XMI). The Object Constraint Language, which has become an important vehicle for communicating detailed insights between UML researchers and practitioners, will have a much expanded speci?cation and be better integrated with the UML. The popularity of UML signi?es the possibility of a shift of immense prop- tions in the practice of software development, at least comparable to the shift from the use of assembly language to “third-generation” or “high-level” p- gramming languages. We dream of describing the behavior of software systems in terms of models, closely related to the needs of the enterprise being served, and being able to routinely translate these models automatically into executing p- grams on distributed computing systems. The OMG is promoting Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) as a signi?cant step towards this vision, and the MDA c- cept has received considerable support within the IT industry."
pub.1151220586,Hiding in the forest: Privacy-preserving process performance indicators,"Event logs recorded during the execution of business processes provide a valuable starting point for operational monitoring, analysis, and improvement. Specifically, measures that quantify any deviation between the recorded operations and organizational goals enable the identification of operational issues. The data to compute such process-specific measures, commonly referred to as process performance indicators (PPIs), may contain personal data of individuals, though, which implies an inevitable risk of privacy intrusion that must be addressed. In this article, we target the privacy-aware computation of process performance indicators. To this end, we adopt tree-based definitions of PPIs according to the well-established PPINOT meta-model. For such a PPI, we design data release mechanisms for the functions in a PPI tree. Using a probabilistic formulation of the expected result of a privatized PPI, we further show how to determine the combination of release mechanisms that inflicts the least loss in utility. Moreover, given a set of PPIs, we provide an algorithmic framework to manage an inherent trade-off: Privatization may strive for maximal utility of each single PPI or for maximal reuse of privatized functions among all PPIs to use a privacy budget most effectively. Results from experiments with synthetic as well as real-world data indicate the general feasibility of privacy-aware PPIs and shed light on the trade-offs once a set of them is considered."
pub.1029425639,Application of Model Driven Architecture to Development Real-Time System Based on Aspect-Oriented,"A way to specify Aspect-based software architectures for real-time systems is introduced. Component models are specified taking the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach, and employing UML notations. First, the principle of the developing process based on the Aspect-Oriented approach and the new concepts of UML-specified component architectures are addressed. Then, the conceptual framework architecture for the design of embedded real-time systems is presented, in which platform-independent component models are built. AOP is a new software development paradigm, which could attain a higher level of separation of concerns in both functional and non-functional matters by introducing aspect, for the implementation of crosscutting concerns. Different aspects can be designed separately, and woven into systems. This article introduces the technology of MDA, aspect-oriented, real-time systems. The paper takes the Aspect-oriented to the MDA modeling by the UML extension mechanisms, and presents a method, which is Aspect-Oriented MDA. In this article, UML profile is utilized to construct the meta-modal specifications respectively for common Aspect-Oriented and AspectJ. So the core business logic and the crosscutting aspects can be modeled as separate, modular Aspect-Oriented PIM’s and PSM’s."

Next, conditions are discussed whose purpose is to ensure that the reduced state space preserves the ordering of visible transitions, that is, transitions that may change the truth values of the propositions that the formula under verification has been built from. Finally solutions to the ignoring problem are analysed both when the purpose is to preserve only safety properties and when also liveness properties are of interest."
pub.1116808599,イノベーションプロセスとガバナンス,"In a changing society characterized by increasing changes in a wide array of science, technology and market areas, innovation is critical to the continued growth of the technology-based company. It is essential for management to recognize the process in which innovation is created through company activities and diffused into society. A novel framework is needed for the management of technical innovation in the technology-based business organization.While a variety of models for the innovation process have been studied, a cyclic model is proposed which consists of two phases, ""differentiation"" and ""homogenization"", and is based on the concept of governance which considers managerial issues. Although many conventional management concepts stress the present and the internal company structure, ""governance"" is a meta concept which focuses on the future and on the external environment. This study attempts to show that the innovation process is relevant to governance rather than to conventional daily management. The conceptual framework of management for the innovation process is proposed from this governance framework. Managerial problems are discussed as these relate to basic research activities. As example of governance in the introduction of new systems technology in an electric power system is also presented.This paper concludes by stressing that innovative fluctuations stimulated from a changing society result in the introduction of new ideas by researchers. These fluctuations are amplified through operational management and finally a new order is created as these fluctuations are organized through governance. The collaboration or synergism of these three functions; research, management, and governance are the intrinsic ingredients to successful innovation."

Integration platforms are tools that develop and execute integration processes. This execution is done by a key component of the platforms called run-time system; that said, the performance from integration processes heavily depends on the efficiency of the run-time system. The task-based execution model implemented by the run-time system can use a strategy based on local pools to store computational threads associated with each task that make up the workflow of the integration process, in order to execute them. The challenge in this strategy is to evenly distribute the threads in each pool, minimising the makespan. We propose an experimental study, which uses two meta-heuristics to find the best distribution with the optimal number of threads. We compared both Particle Swarm Optimisation and Cat Swarm Optimisation, with the latter showing better results."

It is also a profitable business for the large players hence many providers are coming forward to facilitate the cloud provider solutions for their customers. Since many providers are enabling such services to their customers, selecting the best one is a multi-criteria selection problem and needs to be carried out. This paper proposes a mathematical model for constrained multi-criteria federated cloud provider selection. The HHO meta-heuristics algorithm is discussed and compared with TLBO and Jaya. For the comparison, robust design method of Taguchi's was used for selecting the algorithm parameters, feasible solution is rendered by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a widely used technique for solving the problem of cloud provider selection in a federated cloud. Results show that HHO, TLBO Algorithm, Jaya improved the AHP solution by 68.8%, 61.43%, and 62.02%, respectively."

pub.1006699732,Implication of Knowledge Transfer on Task Performance in ERP System Usage,<p>The level of success of Information Systems (IS) implemented in various organizations depends on several factors and is better measured through process metrics than project metrics. It is believed that innovative and increased use of the system (deep structure usage) and learning lead to internalization of knowledge. This in turn ensures that IS continuance (post implementation system usage) becomes more dynamic and effective contributing to enhancement in task performance resulting in better business value. A theoretical framework has been proposed based on previous theories and observations from a case study. An approach of mixed method research using multiple case studies and an empirical survey in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) domain has been used to validate a conceptual model. The findings use meta-inference to offer a new dimension in the area of system usage and learning which could be useful to IS practitioners and researchers.</p>

In our work, we are interested in extending existing approaches for the description of Semantic Web Services. Previously, we have extended the W3C recommendation on Semantics for Web Services (SAWSDL) and have proposed the use of two types of ontologies: a Technical Ontology type containing concepts defining semantics of services, their QoS, etc. and a Domain Ontology type containing the concepts defining the semantics of the business domain. The aim of this paper is to present Yet Another Semantic Annotation for WSDL (YASA4WSDL) and define a technical service ontology for YASA4WSDL. This ontology integrates useful concepts of WSDL meta-model, and OWL-S and WSMO ontologies. The integration of these ontologies is based on different matching techniques according to an ontology mapping process. The resulting ontology covers specific Web services semantic concepts."

These issues push firms to have effective and efficient green supply chain management. One of critical aspect in green supply chain management is green supplier selection. Choosing suitable supplier is an important part in procurement activity. Almost 70% of the total production cost is derived from raw material purchasing cost. This research proposes two phase meta-model for supplier selection and order allocation that takes into consideration environmental criteria besides traditional criteria such as quality, cost and delivery. For the purpose, fuzzy set and analytical hierarchical process (AHP) were combined. AHP was used to allow uncertainties and vagueness due to human decision making and subjective criteria. For order allocation phase, multi-objective mathematical programming method (MOMP), the augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON) method was used to find Pareto optimal solutions for multiple sourcing. These proposed methods were tested in one of tire manufacturing company in Indonesia. The results show that the methods gave a 0.16% of the total cost lower than the existing one as addition to fulfilling green criteria."
pub.1000871761,Object-Oriented Analysis Using Event Patterns,"Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) of requirements has always been the most difficult, critical and an important step in developing applications using object-oriented paradigm. Identification of types of objects from the requirements is the primary goal of every OOA. Most commonly recommended approach to identify objects is to search for nouns directly from the requirements or indirectly from the Use Cases derived from requirements. Experience has shown that both these approaches are inefficient in their own ways. In this paper, we have proposed a new approach of capturing Object Oriented requirements based on analysis of events and actions occurring in the system and then identify all static and dynamic components of the system from it. Our approach captures requirements in the form of Event Patterns that are templates in our Event-oriented approach analogous to Use Cases in the conventional Object-orientation. These templates are used in finding out object oriented components of the system during the process of OOA. We have also proposed an Event Meta-model that forms the basis of our event based class identification process."

Since such kind of transfer process has to involve both, teachers and learners, it requires the support of different perspectives on material as well as interaction features for self-directed learning and context-sensitive interaction. In order to implement a proper solution, we have developed a didactic scheme for self-managed content transfer. Subsequently, we have embedded that framework into meta-models of course material. In doing so, elements of the didactic framework have been mapped to courseware features. Finally, we designed features for collaboration. As result, a generic architecture for self-managed and context-driven CAT/CAL can be defined. We exemplify our solution through a corresponding development project targeting to support academic education in the field of Business Information Systems."
pub.1163488164,A skills‐matching perspective on talent management: Developing strategic agility,"Abstract Despite two decades of evolution as an area of research and practice, talent management faces ongoing criticism for being overly static in its approach, offering little in terms of enabling strategic agility. This is problematic as organizations increasingly rely on strategic agility to manage their dynamic business operations. Drawing on matching theory and adopting an agility lens, we explore the link between talent management and strategic agility. Through a qualitative research design, encompassing 34 interviews in 15 organizations, we explicate a skills‐matching perspective on talent management, including initial and dynamic skills‐matching in external and internal labor markets. Through this process, organizations can build a set of dynamic capabilities, underlying two meta‐capabilities, strategic sensitivity and resource fluidity, which enable strategic agility. In doing so, we portray skills‐matching as an illustration of a processual view on talent management and create a model of developing strategic agility through skills‐matching, responsive to external and internal demands."
pub.1091858095,Formal Modelling and Analysis of Distributed Storage Systems,"Distributed storage systems are nowadays ubiquitous, very often under the form of a hierarchy of multiple caches. While a lot of effort has been dedicated to design, implement and optimise such systems, there exists to the best of our knowledge no attempt to use formal modelling and analysis in this field. This paper proposes a formal modelling framework to design distributed storage systems, with the innovating feature to separate the various concerns they involve like data-model, operations, policy, consistency, topology, etc. A model can then be analysed through model-checking to prove properties, or through simulation to assess its performance. In this paper, we define the framework and focus on performance analysis. We illustrate this on a simple yet realistic example, a LRU cache (least recently used, possibly the most known cache algorithm), showing that our proposal has the potential to be used to make design decisions before the real system is implemented."
pub.1147921226,Selection of Production Reliability Indicators for Project Simulation Model,"Due to technological enhancements, traditional, qualitative decision-making methods are usually replaced by data-driven decision-making even in smaller companies. Process simulation is one of these solutions, which can help companies avoid costly failures as well as evaluate positive or negative effects. The reason for this paper is twofold: first, authors conducted a Quality Function Deployment analysis to find the most vital reliability indicators in the field of production scheduling. The importance was acquired from the meta-analysis of papers published in major journals. The authors found 3 indicators to be the most important: mean time between failure (MTBF), mean repair time and mean downtime. The second part of the research is for the implementation of these indicators to the stochastic environment: possible means of application are proposed, confirming the finding with a case study in which 100 products must be produced. The database created from the simulation is analyzed in terms of major production KPIs, such as production quantity, total process time and efficiency of the production. The results of the study show that calculating with reliability issues in production during the negotiation of a production deadline supports business excellence."

 The article discusses modelling and implementing a new product design coordination module at several levels of a small enterprise’s infrastructure. Specific methods for managing the built infrastructure include business process automation, vulnerability analysis, information security, monitoring and managing changes. Examples of infrastructure management at different levels are considered, as well as the methods for implementing a new module and controlling it based on standards. To create a new module, a model development was carried out at the hardware level, which made it possible to optimise the system structure and reduce the load on the servers. Such standards as GOST R ISO / IEC 27001-2013 and GOST R ISO / IEC 27002-2015 were used, which ensured the security and protection of company data, as well as the Meta Object Facility (MOF) standard was applied, which made it easy to integrate the new module into the existing infrastructure. The study results show that introducing a new module can improve the enterprise’s information infrastructure, reduce the time for approval and improve the product quality, as well as decrease the likelihood of errors and information leaks and diminish the enterprise’s costs. It is recommended to use ISO/IEC and ITIL standards for efficient management of the enterprise’s information infrastructure."

This information is required to make investments, policy formation, and to take other crucial decisions to increase profits. Huge volume of financial documents makes it very difficult and time taking process to extract useful information. Question answering is a powerful way to extract relevant information quickly. Recent research has demonstrated that the large language models (LLMs) give state-of-the-art results for various natural language processing tasks such as question answering, document classification, sentiment analysis, and many more. Extracting relevant details from financial documents is different from getting answers from general document corpus. Mathematical and logical reasoning is also required to retrieve information from financial documents. In this paper we present a comparative analysis of two popular LLMs for question answering from financial documents: OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta AI’s LLaMA. While ChatGPT API is propriety in nature, LLaMA’s model weights are available freely for research. The experimental results show that the performance of LLaMA is comparable with ChatGPT for question answering from financial documents."

It enables organizations to generate software processes with better quality software, the productivity increase of the development team, and minimal risk of failure. The idea behind combining the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Agile aims to create a software development procedure that is stable and continues to improve while also providing agility for dealing with dynamic business needs. This research compiles the experiences of combining both software and identifies challenges for the collaborative implementation process. This study also highlights the extent of the compatibility of CMMI and Agile Development. This research followed a standardized Systematic Literature Review procedure and used the approach known as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses or PRISMA. The findings indicate that the main challenges with regard to combining CMMI and Agile are the lack of relevant knowledge and experience and the culture of CMMI, Agile, or sometimes both. The limited scope of Agile itself poses another considerable challenge. Agile focuses on software development projects, while CMMI has a broader range, from project-level development to organization-level process improvement. This review also finds that Agile Development is compatible with CMMI at a maturity level of 2 and 3. Future studies should determine the optimal method for overcoming the obstacles associated with combining CMMI and Agile."

 The article discusses modelling and implementing a new product design coordination module at several levels of a small enterprise’s infrastructure. Specific methods for managing the built infrastructure include business process automation, vulnerability analysis, information security, monitoring and managing changes. Examples of infrastructure management at different levels are considered, as well as the methods for implementing a new module and controlling it based on standards. To create a new module, a model development was carried out at the hardware level, which made it possible to optimise the system structure and reduce the load on the servers. Such standards as GOST R ISO / IEC 27001-2013 and GOST R ISO / IEC 27002-2015 were used, which ensured the security and protection of company data, as well as the Meta Object Facility (MOF) standard was applied, which made it easy to integrate the new module into the existing infrastructure. The study results show that introducing a new module can improve the enterprise’s information infrastructure, reduce the time for approval and improve the product quality, as well as decrease the likelihood of errors and information leaks and diminish the enterprise’s costs. It is recommended to use ISO/IEC and ITIL standards for efficient management of the enterprise’s information infrastructure."

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative meta-analysis was conducted using data from a three-year study of Lean manufacturing in Sweden using the Shingo business excellence model as an analytical framework.   Findings This study demonstrates that leaders can develop value-based leadership to support Lean manufacturing by defining and articulating the organization’s values and accompanying behaviors that are needed to support the strategic direction; creating forums and time for leaders to identify the why behind decisions and reflect on their experiences to be able to lead a transformative process; and using storytelling to create a coaching culture to connect values and behaviors, to the processes and systems of work.   Research limitations/implications This paper contributes insights for developing value-based leadership to support a systemic approach to sustainable quality development in lean manufacturing. Findings are based on a limited case sample size of three manufacturing companies in Sweden.   Originality/value The findings were derived using a unique methodological approach combining storytelling, appreciative inquiry and coaching with traditional data collection methods including surveys and interviews to identify, define and shape value-based leadership in Lean manufacturing.

pub.1156202257,Multi-Task Deep Learning with Task Attention for Post-Click Conversion Rate Prediction,"Online advertising has gained much attention on various platforms as a hugely lucrative market. In promoting content and advertisements in real life, the acquisition of user target actions is usually a multi-step process, such as impression→click→conversion, which means the process from the delivery of the recommended item to the user’s click to the final conversion. Due to data sparsity or sample selection bias, it is difficult for the trained model to achieve the business goal of the target campaign. Multi-task learning, a classical solution to this problem, aims to generalize better on the original task given several related tasks by exploiting the knowledge between tasks to share the same feature and label space. Adaptively learned task relations bring better performance to make full use of the correlation between tasks. We train a general model capable of capturing the relationships between various tasks on all existing active tasks from a meta-learning perspective. In addition, this paper proposes a Multi-task Attention Network (MAN) to identify commonalities and differences between tasks in the feature space. The model performance is improved by explicitly learning the stacking of task relationships in the label space. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, experiments are conducted on Alibaba Click and Conversion Prediction (Ali-CCP) dataset. Experimental results show that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods."

pub.1155645661,Under the Hood of Social Media Advertising: How Do We use AI Responsibly for Advertising Targeting and Creative Evaluation,"Digital Advertising is historically one of the most developed areas where Machine Learning and AI have been applied since its origination. From smart bidding to creative content generation and DCO, AI is well-demanded in the modern digital marketing industry and partially serves as a backbone of most of the state-of-the-art computational advertising systems, making them impossible for the AI tech and the programmatic systems to exist apart from one another. At the same time, given the drastic growth of the available AI technology nowadays, the issue of responsible AI utilization as well as the balance between the opportunity of deploying AI systems and the possible borderline etic and privacy-related consequences are still yet to be discussed comprehensively in both business and research communities. Particularly, an important issue of automatic User Profiling use in modern Programmatic systems like Meta Ads as well as the need for responsible application of the creative assessment models to fit into the business etic guidelines is yet to be described well. Therefore, in this talk, we are going to discuss the technology behind modern programmatic bidding and content scoring systems and the responsible application of AI by SoMin.ai to manage the Advertising targeting and Creative Validation process."
pub.1127361038,A Meta-Model for Automated Black-Box Testing of Visualization Based Software Applications,"Visualization of data is a new field that is increasingly gaining popularity in both scholastic and modern conditions. The need of data visualization in market is increasing day by day for the management of big companies which have massive data related to their business operations. For effective and properly analyzed data visualizations involved the formulas to calculate the results or for analyzing and filtering the data on any required basis. The more data, formulas and complex information is involved in the creation of a visualization, the more it is difficult to test or evaluate the correctness of that visualization for and software tester. It is difficult for testers to look into different modules for every single test, as it is a time consuming process. In past, most of the research work is done only on creation of test cases for visuals or interactive diagrams (Visualizations). Therefore, in this paper a hybrid approach (combination of both manual and automation testing) is proposed to provide automated black-box testing of Visualizations on the basis of configurations (settings), rules (business logics), used library, transformation and information provided for the transformation of data into visuals. The output of proposed approach provides results of testing for each test-case as a report. For the validation of this approach, a case study of Supply Chain domain problem is taken into consideration."
pub.1158575265,A New Model-Based Approach for Migrating Health 2.0 to Health 3.0 Applications,"Over the past few years, several desktop and web-based applications, have been designed and developed for use by both doctors, healthcare professionals and patients. Indeed, the healthcare sector can benefit from the solutions offered by modern technologies. Web 3.0 in health will have the same characteristics as other platforms (connected database, interoperability between web apps, etc.). In fact, Web 3.0 is considered to be the combination of artificial intelligence and the semantic web. It is therefore essential to migrate legacy healthcare applications to the Web 3.0 platform. The migration of these applications to a new technology requires three main aspects: data access, business logic and graphical user interface (GUI). To address this need, we propose a reverse engineering approach to transform web apps into modern applications that meet current requirements especially the electronic medical record management systems. The MDD process incorporates standard meta-models which represent the information in a platform-independent way, and it integrates the technologies whose role is to add the modern aspects supported by the Web 3.0 platform."
pub.1051459938,The Systems Integration Architecture: an Agile Information Infrastructure,"The Systems Integration Architecture project is taking a fresh approach to integration with special emphasis on supporting Agile, Virtual enterprises and their unique need for reconfigurable, de-centralized information systems. SIA is based on a different conceptual model of integration — called the TAR model — one which allows higher level integration than the traditional common, neutral format, shared database. The basic concept is that all information processing consists of a series of transformations of data sets called “Aspects” into other “Aspects”. The transformations are effected by what are called Functional Transformation Agents which provide a single function and have a well defined interface structure which allows them to be integrated in a variety of ways. The Systems Integration Architecture provides three high level services which allow FTA’s to be defined, combined into diverse networks which provide transformations of aspects in a manner transparent to the user and executed under a variety of control algorithms in a heterogeneous, de-centralized environment. These are: an Executive--to provide business control services; a Librarian--to act as somewhat of a meta data dictionary, keeping track of FTA’s and their input and output Aspects; and a Network--which is based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture to facilitate communication between objects on a heterogeneous network. An extended entity relationship diagram is provided and each of the objects in the system is described. A simple example of its use is provided."
pub.1014145515,Modularity and Dynamic Adaptation of Flexibly Secure Systems: Model-Driven Adaptive Delegation in Access Control Management,"Model-Driven Security (Mds) is a specialized Model-Driven Engineering (Mde) approach for supporting the development of secure systems. Model-Driven Security aims at improving the productivity of the development process and quality of the resulting secure systems, with models as the main artifact. Among the variety of models that have been studied in a Model-Driven Security perspective, one canmention access control models that specify the access rights. So far, these models mainly focus on static definitions of access control policies, without taking into account the more complex, but essential, delegation of rights mechanism. Delegation is a meta-level mechanism for administrating access rights, which allows a user without any specific administrative privileges to delegate his/her access rights to another user. This paper gives a formalization of access control and delegation mechanisms, and analyses the main hard-points for introducing various advanced delegation semantics in Model-Driven Security. Then, we propose a modular model-driven framework for 1) specifying access control, delegation and the business logic as separate concerns; 2) dynamically enforcing/weaving access control policies with various delegation features into security-critical systems; and 3) providing a flexibly dynamic adaptation strategy.We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed solution through the proof-of-concept implementations of different component-based systems running on different adaptive execution platforms, i.e. OSGi and Kevoree."
pub.1045500082,Towards an Interaction Protocols Adaptation and Management System for Coordination in Crisis Business Processes,"This work addresses the Interaction Protocols (IP) adaptation issue for coordination in the context of Crisis Management Processes (CMP). CMP refers to the coordination of different activities performed by involved actors in a dynamic and unstable context. Using interaction protocols (such as contract net, negotiation or vote) is one possible way to deal with this coordination. In order to guarantee an efficient use of IP, we need to adapt them. In our previous work, we proposed an MDA (Model Driven Architecture) framework to support the IP adaptation. More precisely, we proposed the conjointly use of version and context notions to model the IP versions and their contexts (the CIM level). We also proposed an extension of AUML sequence diagram meta-model to specify graphically the contextualized versioned interaction protocols (the PIM level). In this paper, we propose an Interaction Protocols Adaptation and Management System (IPAMS) that supports the previous contributions. This IPAMS ensures the IP adaptation at run time. Finally, we propose a well-known crisis scenario called “Air Crash Management Process” in order to illustrate the proposed solution."
pub.1169483907,4 Work in digital capitalism,"In the digital age, markets become property. Today’s most powerful companies are internet giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Tencent. The dominant platforms now control digital ecosystems that represent a fundamental transformation of capitalism. Liberalism imagined the market as a free space dedicated to the exchange of goods and services, a creator of knowledge and innovation. The internet meta-platforms have transformed the marketplace into a set of tightly controlled domains. This book examines the historical roots of this phenomenon and outlines its contemporary manifestations. It shows how digital surveillance and algorithmic management are employed to control entire markets, and how the same methods appear in the digital labour process. Widening social inequality is one inevitable outcome. What is specific to digital capitalism, the book argues, is the emergence of ‘proprietary markets’. This signals not only an end to the liberal notion of the economy. The conflicts over its future trajectory will be decisive for life chances in digital capitalism. Chapter 5 examines the consequences of proprietary markets for labour. Two points in particular are stressed: first, market-owning companies use their power to extract value from the economy and especially from the supply side of proprietary markets. Producers within these systems come to depend more and more on the market-like meta-platforms, which can then increase the proportion they extract. As a consequence, the share taken by the meta-platforms for market participation is missing on the external provider’s revenue income side and cannot be distributed in wages. Digital capitalism’s accumulation model is thus a driver of social inequality. Second, the chapter uses material case studies and the broader literature to demonstrate how algorithmic management methods are applied to expand control and exploitation in the digital labour process. The digital tracking, performance rating, scoring technologies and information asymmetries employed for labour control are captured as filiations of the control strategies developed for proprietary markets. The chapter elaborates their dissemination through new business models and in particular the ‘gig economy’, through corporate software and through wearable technologies in manufacturing. While the bottom line is that the new means of control are again drivers of social inequality, day-to-day resistance strategies and the limitations of digital control are also discussed."
pub.1121647239,Process-Based Quality Management in Care: Adding a Quality Perspective to Pathway Modelling,"Abstract
Care pathways (CPs) are used as a tool to organize complex care processes and to foster the quality management in general. However, the quality management potentials have not been sufficiently exploited yet, since the development, documentation, and controlling of quality indicators (QIs) for quality management purposes are not fully integrated to the process standards defined by CPs. To support the integration of a quality perspective in CPs, the paper addresses the questions which and how quality concepts can be integrated into the process documentation in order to support managers, health service providers, and patients. Therefore, we extended the widely accepted modelling language “Business Process Model and Notation” (BPMN) with a quality perspective. The conceptualization is grounded on a systematic literature review on (quality) indicator modelling. Together with previous work on the conceptualization of QIs in health care, it provided the basis for a comprehensive domain requirements analysis. Following a design-oriented research approach, the requirements were evaluated and used to design a BPMN extension by implementing the quality indicator enhancements as BPMN meta model extension. All design decisions were evaluated in a feedback workshop with a domain expert experienced in quality management and certification of cancer centres on national and international level. The approach is demonstrated with an example from stroke care. The proposed language extension provides a tool to be used for the governance of care processes based on QIs and for the implementation of a more real-time, pathway-based quality management in health care."
pub.1053463870,Organizational learning with flexible workflow management systems," The research activities on which the following hypotheses are based are concerned with the social implications of workflow management systems (wms) and with the question of how the necessary extent of autonomy of workers can still be guaranteed under the conditions of wms [Herrmann, 95]. We have learnt that the ability of workers for autonomy and improvisation cannot evolve if wms are not adaptable. If wms are adapted by workers, it might be sensible that the result of the adaptation is stored for further application. Consequently, the organization of business processes is changed if their workflow models are adapted. We understand that this is a specific version of organizational learning, because more than one member of an organization as well as the coordination between them is affected. The adaptation of a wms includes organizational learning under three perspectives:• before a suggested adaptation has reached a state of maturity and is accepted by the members of an organization, a process of learning is required• people must be trained to carry out their tasks in accordance with the adaptation - this requires another kind of learning• the experience with those two aspects above can be used to facilitate the next process of adaptation - this is a kind of organizational learning on a meta-level.We focus on the first perspective. Since nearly every adaptation affects other cooperators the necessity for negotiation between them is obvious. We realized that the course of negotiation can be understood as a process of organizational learning . Where as, the adapted workflow model can be considered as a kind of organizational memory . "

From 57 primary studies found 26 observed variables for aggregation of effect size in the using ""Fixed Effect Model"" on this mata-analysis. The article also links the theories that are used in the literature, not considered in the most of primary studies, to the empirical results and recommends global management strategy which is needed for business practical affairs. According to the result, the meta-analysis suggests that the number of employees of a MNC, the geological and cultural differneces between the host country and home country, the country-specific international experience of the MNC and export intensity, the international product diversification, the market growth and the market size of the foreign operations, and resource intensity of the foreign operations, the legal restrictions in the host country and the country risk of the home country do exert a significant effect on the decision between cooperative arrangement and a wholly-owned subsidiary. Conversely, for a large number of variables, no significant relationship seems to exist based on the combined results. This is the case, for example, for factor specificity, the r&d-intensity, the subsidiary size, the assets of the MNC and the sales volume of the MNC."

In an era where new concepts and techniques are introduced continuously, there is a lack of systematic literature review (SLR) on identifying main dimensions, levels, methods to assess the maturity and readiness level toward I4.0. To address this gap, we have chosen our primary objective to provide a critical review of existing literature on dimensions, methods, levels, and current trends to evaluate the I4.0 maturity and readiness models. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology was adopted to make sure that there is no replication and to maintain complete transparency in the review process. A total of 53 papers were deemed relevant for thematic analysis. From the literature, we have found and proposed 10 main dimensions — Strategy and Organization, Manufacturing and Operations, Supply Chain, Business Model, IT, People, Customers, Product, Services, and Culture, to assess the I4.0 maturity and readiness levels of an organization. Further, a conceptual framework was proposed for the same. This study contributes theoretically to the development of I4.0 maturity and readiness models. So far, this is the first review paper on dimensions of I4.0 maturity and readiness models and is expected to give future researchers and practitioners a holistic guideline to design and develop I4.0 maturity and readiness models."
pub.1152950112,Methodology for Selecting Scenarios in Improvement Process with Multiple Performance Measures,"The Research group in Acquisition and representation of knowledge through expert systems and simulation “ARCOSES” (for its acronym in Spanish) developed a hybrid methodology composed of several techniques of Industrial Engineering to select the best scenario in a simulation process when there are multiple performance measures. This situation is typically presented in case of business improvement processes, where is necessary to balance different performance measures and in some cases, these are possibly in conflict. When these cases of multiple performance measures occur, it is possible to use different techniques such as design of experiments (DOE), simulation optimization (SO), meta models (MM) or the response surface methodology (MSR). These consist of a set of mathematical and statistical tools; their goal is to select the best solution. However, it has been found that these techniques can be difficult to implement because the analyst or decision-maker does not always have the mathematical bases or enough time for their execution. Therefore, a methodological proposal was developed, presented an implemented in a case of processes of improvement where the best solution is calculated through a standardized homogeneous rating based on the different goals to be achieved."
pub.1122049100,A Scalable Business Intelligence Decision-Making System in the Era of Big Data,"Transformation presents the second step in the ETL process that is responsible for extracting, transforming and loading data into a data warehouse. The role of transformation is to set up several operations to clean, to format and to unify types and data coming from multiple and different data sources. The goal is to get data to conform to the schema of the data warehouse to avoid any ambiguity problems during the data storage and analytical operations. Transforming data coming from structured, semi-structured and unstructured data sources need two levels of treatments: the first one is transformation schema to schema to get a unified schema for all selected data sources and the second treatment is transformation data to data to unify all types and data gathered. To ensure the setting up of these steps we propose in this paper a process switch from one database schema to another as a part of transformation schema to schema, and a meta-model based on MDA approach to describe the main operations of transformation data to data. The results of our transformations propose a data loading in one of the four schemas of NoSQL to best meet the constraints and requirements of Big Data."
pub.1156184355,Synthesis and Evaluation of Engineering Processes for the Development of Airborne Electronic Equipment,"In this chapter, the design of a new framework for developing airborne electronic equipment is presented. Classical development standards and methods in the avionics space were reviewed and improved using principles obtained from modern development methods. Airworthiness and procurement considerations were considered in the new framework. A Design Science Research paradigm was used pragmatically to develop a new framework for platform-specific airborne electronic equipment. Quality Research Management was applied to align real-world requirements with research objectives, while Action Design Research was applied to ensure the practice-inspired research effort improved the theoretical knowledge base. Prior cases in the avionics development environment were used to inform a real-world case study. A qualitative meta-analysis of standards and academic literature, combined with an evolutionary (longitudinal) approach, produced a theoretical process model that was used to underpin detailed development processes at different levels in the hierarchy. The development of prototype constructs, in the form of evolutionary (emergent) models, allowed the incremental and iterative design of the new framework. Final validation of the new framework was achieved when a review committee evaluated and accepted the new framework as a valid procurement process to be implemented in practice."

The management of evolution and change and the ability for database, information and knowledge-based systems to deal with change are an essential component in developing and maintaining truly useful systems. Many approaches to handling evolution and change have been proposed in various areas of data management and this forum seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners both from more established areas and those from emerging areas to look at this issue. The fourth ECDM workshop (the first three ECDM workshops were held with ER 1999 in Paris, France, with ER 2002 in Tampere, Finland, and with ER 2004 in Shanghai, China) dealt with the manner in which change can be handled, and the semantics of evolving data and data structure in computer-based systems, including databases, data warehouses and Web-based information systems."
pub.1112242070,Computer mediated communication in a context of modern organization: a scoping review,"Purpose - The present article aims to reveal and summarize key points of the application of information and communication technology (ICT) and Internet technology in the context of modern organization communication, related management processes. Design/methodology/approach - methods of meta-analysis, comparative analysis and systemizing-synthesis are used in this article. A scoping review methodology was chosen as dominant for the research with the purpose of assessing key points in the context of Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) usage in modern organizations. The research is based on a qualitative paradigm. Findings – Results of the scoping review suggest that ICT and CMC are compatible and can be successfully applicable to solve the main challenges in management and control contexts of inter-organizational, organizational, group (team) and inter-personal communication and related processes. In addition, this new combination of management methods and technological innovations has a great impact on opinion and behavior of customers and overall society, process improvement in business organizations, and change management. Research limitations/implications - Firstly, a limited scope of organizations especially in Public and Non-governmental sector use CMC in everyday duties. Nevertheless, a usage of ICT and CMC requires not only the understanding of the theoretical background but also strict practical implication guidelines as well as measurement and evaluation indicators, targets, and an overall model for analyzing. Since this article is based on the scoping review where main findings and conclusions are outlined from a meta-analysis, case studies and comparative analysis towards a practical implication are not sufficiently elaborated. The second limitation which can also be called a future implication might be a wide scope and content of the CMC concept as well as the dynamics of the communication process in organizations, increasing demand from business organizations. Practical implications -The research may serve as a starting point to a further scientific discussion regarding the usage ICT and CMC both separately and as a part of other hybrid project and process methods, optimization and continuous improvement of communication, learning, control and other related processes and systems in organization management. Originality/Value - The main value of the presented article can be described as underlying spheres where CMC has the major impact in management of modern organizations: it takes effect in a wide field of internal and external processes as well as in overall process optimization activities and change management.

pub.1173726035,Performance Evaluation and Optimization of 3D Models from Low-Cost 3D Scanning Technologies for Virtual Reality and Metaverse E-Commerce,"Virtual Reality (VR) is and will be a key driver in the evolution of e-commerce, providing an immersive and gamified shopping experience. However, for VR shopping spaces to become a reality, retailers’ product catalogues must first be digitised into 3D models. While this may be a simple task for retail giants, it can be a major obstacle for small retailers, whose human and financial resources are often more limited, making them less competitive. Therefore, this paper presents an analysis of low-cost scanning technologies for small business owners to digitise their products and make them available on VR shopping platforms, with the aim of helping improve the competitiveness of small businesses through VR and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The technologies to be considered are photogrammetry, LiDAR sensors and NeRF.In addition to investigating which technology provides the best visual quality of 3D models based on metrics and quantitative results, these models must also offer good performance in commercial VR headsets. In this way, we also analyse the performance of such models when running on Meta Quest 2, Quest Pro and Quest 3 headsets (Reality Labs, Reality Labs, CA, USA) to determine their feasibility and provide use cases for each type of model from a scalability point of view. Finally, our work describes a model optimisation process that reduce the polygon count and texture size of high-poly models, converting them into more performance-friendly versions without significantly compromising visual quality."

                    Design/methodology/approach
                    To analyze nation branding academic literature, this paper used a systematic literature review approach to investigate academic studies related to nation and country branding. All relevant studies on the nation and country branding between 1996 and mid-2021 were extracted from six selected databases, including Elsevier’s Science Direct, Emerald, Sage, Wiley, Springer and Jstor, by using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis process. The reviewed papers were coded and analyzed to extract themes and concepts.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results of this paper show that nation branding is influenced by six main factors, namely, business and marketing, political, social and cultural, economic and labor, international and environmental factors; it comprises one key component, that is, nation branding; it results in five major consequences, including social, economic and financial, business, international and political consequences, and is moderated mainly by socio-demographic variables. Additional contributions of this paper are the proposal of a comprehensive definition of nation branding based on the extant literature and identifying nation branding differences with other constructs that sometimes have been previously used interchangeably with nation branding. This paper concludes with suggestions for future research in the field.

pub.1164796951,Assessing the Climate Performance Potential of Start-ups: Insights and Guidance on Environmental Sustainability Assessment of Young Ventures,"The role of early-stage venture capital (VC) investment in financing for ambitious climate action is often overlooked. In the developing field of climate-tech investment, one of the biggest challenges is to identify the start-ups and business models that contribute to climate change mitigation. The potential of a start-ups business model to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is defined as the start-ups climate performance potential (CPP). The assessment of a start-up’s CPP could enable start-ups and VC investors to invest in a more informed way with greater precision, impact, and purpose. The objective of this paper can be expressed in two steps: First, to gain insights into and identify the potential for improvement in the environmental sustainability assessment practices of VC firms through an exploratory case study. Second, to provide life cycle-based guidance on environmental sustainability assessment of innovative products offered by start-ups to determine their CPP, by eliciting appropriate criteria and procedures for directionally sound assessment. For this, the assessment approach developed by the climate-tech VC firm World Fund was used for the exploratory case study. In a first step, the CPP assessment process was described, based on document review and observation. Next, the CPP carbon footprint method was compared with ISO standardizations of life cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprint (CF) along eight criteria. Development potential was identified and discussed for seven of the eight criteria, including, for example, the use of scenarios, the complexity of meta-analyses, and the need to avoid misleading incentives."
pub.1146353689,The impact of decision-making styles (effectuation logic and causation logic) on firm performance: a meta-analysis,"
                    Purpose
                    As two essential styles of firm decision-making, the relationships among effectuation logic, causation logic and firm performance are unclear. It is helpful to deepen the understanding of reasoning theory and the process of decision-making. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between effectuation logic, causation logic and firm performance.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Based on 31 independent empirical studies (including 11,600 samples) published by predecessors, meta-analysis is used to systematically integrate the impact of two decision-making styles on firm performance and explore the potential factors affecting their relationship.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results show a positive correlation between two decision-making styles and firm performance and the influence of effectuation decision-making style in firm performance is slightly stronger. However, the application environment is different: in the emerging market, the causation decision-making style is more effective for firm performance management. When the firm chooses the effectuation decision-making style, it is more effective for performance management in the emerging market. In addition, the industry type, firm performance evaluation tools, national development level and firm scale and firm age can significantly moderate the impact of two decision-making styles on firm performance.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    Both decision-making logics are possible ways for firm to success. Still, the future needs to dig deeper into the black box that can unlock the decision-making styles to achieve firm performance or competitive advantage based on other factors of the decision-behavior-outcome business model, more longitudinal data and experiments.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of decision-making styles (effectuation logic and causation logic) on firm performance using a meta-analysis.

pub.1175050040,Real-Time Context Monitoring and Analysis for Detecting Process Adaptation Needs,"The increasingly dynamic and changing environment in which business processes are evolving requires companies to adapt them frequently. Thus, we deal in this paper with an adaptation engine ensuring the adaptation need detection of running processes, and more precisely of its first two components: the Monitor (M) and Analyze (A) components. This adaptation engine implements the MAPE-K loop and uses a contextual approach for the detection of the adaptation needs. It is based on a model that enables a complete representation of the process operating environment (OE) using the context notion. More precisely, this paper presents the architecture of the MAPE-K-based adaptation engine and introduces the BPMN4Context meta-model, which supports the modeling of the operating environment using the context along with the model of all processes and their use conditions. In addition, the paper introduces the recommended context-based approach that advocates (i) a filtering activity to select only significant context changes in the monitored data, considered as low-level context parameters, (ii) a reasoning activity to deduce high-level context parameters from filtered low-level ones, enhancing the current situation of running processes and (iii) the examining of the current situation before its analysis in order to resolve problems related to the used units and synonym values. Our approach is implemented as a system that instantiates the M and A components of MAPE-K loop. The feasibility and applicability of this approach is demonstrated by a case study from the crisis domain, a set of criteria and two performance tests."
pub.1034894409,P150 Translating Recommendations Into Clinical Decision Support: Cancerlinq Prototype Experience," Background The Guideline Elements Model (GEM) has been widely used to translate natural language clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) into clinical decision support (CDS) using a highly replicable, guideline-centric approach. A CPG recommendation-to-CDS translation process, which uses GEM-processed content to support an oncology rapid learning system (RLS) prototype, is examined here.   Objectives To develop rules for a breast cancer-specific CDS prototype using GEM-processed guideline content.   Methods We created five breast cancer patient scenarios with expert input from oncologists based on nine published CPGs. Using the Yale Center for Medical Informatics-developed GEM Cutter III editor, we parsed the narrative CPG recommendations into an XML-based, machine-readable format. GEM-processed content was then encoded into a Drools business rule management system to develop an integrated platform prototype for rules, workflow, and event processing. We used meta-tags to create value sets for key components of each recommendation by selecting terms from UMLS vocabularies, including SNOMED CT and LOINC.   Results Forty-five recommendations spanning nine CPGs were processed and converted into Drools rules. We identified 138 decision variables and 91 actions within the selected recommendations. From these, we encoded 148 concepts associated with value set meta-tags and 238 decision rules.   Discussion The level of difficulty required to encode the recommendations was directly related to the specificity, complexity, and decidability of each recommendation; there was significant variability among the recommendations.   Implications for Guideline Developers/Users CPG developers may need new processes in order to optimise recommendations for incorporation into CDS systems. "
pub.1030894675,Evidence Based Management,"In their managerial roles, clinicians face the challenge of how to access, assess and deploy the most relevant and current management knowledge. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that the management discipline is a relative latecomer to the evidence-based paradigm. Although the research-based model of business education can be traced back to the 1950’s, the management discipline is still characterized by a multiplicity of theoretical perspectives, the lack of consensus on a hierarchy of evidence, and the lack of point-of-use tools that translate scientific results into protocols. As a result, popular claims based on anecdotal evidence often compete with rigorous empirical studies for the manager’s attention. In the last decade, however, a small but growing evidence-based management (EBMgt) movement has taken shape. EBMgt’s influence can be seen in the increasing numbers of meta-analyses, a greater interest in experimental studies, the newfound acceptance of replication studies, and practical approaches such as fact-based consulting. This chapter provides an overview of EBMgt along with a practical resource list of evidence-based sources in three key areas: managing people, managing process and systems, and managing strategy."
pub.1091862050,Decomposed Replay Using Hiding and Reduction as Abstraction,"In the area of process mining, decomposed replay has been proposed to be able to deal with nets and logs containing many different activities. The main assumption behind this decomposition is that replaying many subnets and sublogs containing only some activities is faster then replaying a single net and log containing many activities. Although for many nets and logs this assumption does hold, there are also nets and logs for which it does not hold. This paper shows an example net and log for which the decomposed replay may take way more time, and provides an explanation why this is the case. Next, to mitigate this problem, this paper proposes an alternative way to abstract the subnets from the single net, and shows that the decomposed replay using this alternative abstraction is faster than the monolithic replay even for the problematic cases as identified earlier. However, the alternative abstraction often results in longer computation times for the decomposed replay than the original abstraction. An advantage of the alternative abstraction over the original abstraction is that its cost estimates are typically better."
pub.1131952728,A multi-objective privacy preservation model for cloud security using hybrid Jaya-based shark smell optimization,"The rising volume of sensitive and personal data being harvested by data controllers has increased the security essentials in the cloud system. The cloud module is not used just to store the data, but also to process them on cloud premises. Security for the cloud premises is essential as the cloud has lot of outsourced, unprotected sensitive data for the public access. This has resulted repeated data violations, and thus there is a need for the advanced legal data protection constraints. Various studies were conducted to adopt the privacy preservation in the cloud, and most of the state-of-the-art techniques fail to handle the optimal privacy when dealing with sensitive data, as it requires separate data sanitization and restoration models. To overcome this challenge, this paper tempts to develop the privacy preservation model in the cloud environment using the advancements of artificial intelligent techniques. Artificial Intelligent capabilities are working in the business cloud computing environment to make organizations more efficient, strategic, and insight-driven. However, by hosting the data, cloud computing offers businesses high flexibility, agility, and cost savings. The two main phases of the proposed privacy preservation system are the data sanitization and restoration. Moreover, the proposed sanitization process depends on the optimal key generation, which is performed by the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm. This hybrid algorithm merges two well-performed algorithms, such as Shark Smell Optimization (SSO) and Jaya Algorithm (JA), and thus termed as Jaya-based Shark Smell Optimization (J-SSO). The optimal key generation is accomplished by deriving a multi-objective function that involves the parameters, such as the degree of modification, hiding ratio, and information preservation ratio. Finally, the performance analysis has proved the efficiency of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art models in enhancing cloud security."

pub.1126886618,KIPO Opportunities for Interoperability Decisions in Systems-of-Information Systems in the Domain of Environmental Management,"Abstract
Considering the increasing exchange of information among systems, the design and development of Information Systems (IS) must guarantee high levels of interaction, communication, and connectivity. To supply the society and organizations demands, IS have been forming an arrangement called Systems-of-Information Systems (SoIS), in which constituents are IS that cooperate with each other to achieve a main goal. Interoperability in this context is a key issue mainly due to the characteristic of managerial and operational independence of these IS. Strategies are necessary to deal with the understanding of the processes involved among IS, people, and organizations that need to interoperate. Since SoIS presents a strong business nature and it has dynamic characteristics, knowledge-intensive processes can emerge around this structure. This study aims to represent interoperability decisions among IS in the environmental management domain through the Knowledge Intensive Process Ontology (KIPO), a meta-model for Knowledge Intensive Process (KIP) modeling. KIPO was chosen due to it capable of making relevant knowledge embedded in a KIP explicit, also, the specialized literature addresses the need for exploring new modeling’s in the SoIS domain. As a result, we investigate which processes and interoperability decisions in this context can be modeled with the Knowledge Intensive Process Notation (KIPN), a notation for KIPO. We evaluated the perceived usefulness of KIPN with experts on environmental management and SoIS domain. We concluded that KIPO can be a metamodel alternative of processes in a SoIS. As contribution, we present KIP modeling as an efficient and didactic approach to represent processes that involve interoperability decisions in SoIS."
pub.1046124960,Conceptual Modeling Method for Separation of Concerns and Integration of Structure and Behavior,"<p>Identification of discontinuities, separation of concerns, and dealing with the evolutionary changes of requirements is difficult in conceptual modeling. The limited human mind allows focusing on one particular requirement at a time in isolation. One fundamental problem is that all conventional conceptual modeling techniques deal with collections of loosely linked meta-models, which are defined by different types of diagrams. Typically, system development methods project interactive, behavioral, and structural aspects of information systems’ conceptual representations into disparate views. Therefore, the semantic integrity of various architecture dimensions is difficult to achieve. The difficulties stem from the paradigmatic mismatch between static and dynamic constructs. The advantage of the conceptual modeling approach presented in this paper is flexibility. It is demonstrated by case study examples that sequential, underlying, enclosing, overriding, and overlaying interaction loops between actors provide the foundation for the composition of complex scenarios, which span across organizational and technical system boundaries. The presented semantic integration and system decomposition principles target business process modeling experts and information system designers, because they are essential for introducing evolutionary changes and managing complexity of information system conceptualizations.</p>"
pub.1125632936,Interplay of Technology and Labour Productivity: Emerging Story of Consumer Electronics in India,"During last two decades, consumer electronic industry in India appears to have been treading through a nonlinear path that has been shaped by changes in trade policies, globalisation of disruptive technologies, strands of product and process innovations, location of investments and the dynamics of consumption. This industry faces an interesting conundrum. On the one hand, the market for consumer electronics in India has been growing exponentially over the years, thanks to discernably lower penetration rates compared to that of developed countries. On the other, despite the growth in market being a regular phenomenon and ensuing business interest shown by prominent multinational enterprises, domestic production system appears to have been inheriting a gene of not so evolved technological capabilities, thus capital accumulation not translating into gains in productivity. We unravel this dilemma by analysing the unit records of Annual Survey of Industries, covering the data from 2000–2001 to 2013–2014. We use descriptive and inferential methods to unravel the data, while being complemented by the meta-content made of media coverage on consumer electronics in India. In our empirical exploration, we resort to both single and simultaneous equation models for gauging the link between the productivity and the technology. We conclude that while the market has been expanding in India, this growth has not translated to technological capabilities for the domestic industry."
pub.1041858965,A ONCE-Updating Approach on Moving Objects,"Indexing methods that manage current states of moving objects in a database are confronted with keeping their indexes up to date. Numerous objects that move continuously can invoke many their updates at a time constantly. R-tree based indexing methods promise to be efficient and easy to be implemented and deployed to real applications. Nevertheless, recent updating improvements for R-tree have been not either designed or appropriate to a moving object environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a ONCE-Updating approach applied for indexing methods developed from the R-tree. The idea is that instead of incurring the high cost of updating an indexed data on many new states at a timestamp one by one, an indexing method can easily update the data on all the states just once. In our experiments, in addition to much improving update performance, the approach even increases quality of queries extracted from indexed data. This approach can be used to support methods managing data from traffic surveillance systems."

Workflow systems are widely used in project management, earthquake analysis, genome processing, large business applications, IT industries, supply chain management, and many other areas. It has already been established that load-balanced workflow process allocation in cloud is NP-hard problem. In this work, a novel method for solving the load balancing problem in the cloud environment is proposed offering an appropriate allocation plan by using meta-heuristic algorithms, namely, grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) to maximize the resource utilization. This approach is employing the multi-population (MP) policy for exploring more diversity in the solution space to reduce the load imbalance on virtual machines. The scheduling workflow load balancer is simulated in the MATLAB to accomplish the performance analysis. The results show that the proposed MPGOA outperforms PSO in all the task and VM sets considered in the performance evaluation."
pub.1119422986,A Unified Access Control Model for Calibration Traceability in Safety-Critical IoT,"Calibration plays an important role in ensuring device accuracy within
safety-critical IoT deployments. The process of calibration involves a number
of parties which must collaborate to support calibration. Calibration checks
often precede safety-critical operations such as preparing a robot for surgery,
requiring inter-party interaction to complete checks. At the same time, the
parties involved in a calibration ecosystem may share an adversarial
relationship with a subset of other parties. For instance, a surgical robot
manufacturer may wish to hide the identities of third-parties from the operator
(hospital), in order to maintain confidentiality of business relationships
around its robot products. Thus, information flows that reveal
who-calibrates-for-whom need to be managed to ensure confidentiality.
Similarly, information about what-is-being-calibrated and
how-often-it-is-calibrated may compromise operational confidentiality. For
example, calibration-verification of connected medical devices may reveal the
timing of surgical procedures and compromise PII when combined with other meta
information. We show that the challenge of managing information flows between
the parties involved in calibration cannot be met by any of the classical
access control models, as any one of them or a simple conjunction of a subset
such as the lattice model fails to meet the desired access control
requirements. We demonstrate that a new unified access control model that
combines BIBA, BLP, and Chinese Walls holds rich promise. We study the case for
unification, system properties, and develop an XACML-based authorisation
framework which enforces the unified model. Upon evaluation against a baseline
simple conjunction of the three models individually, our unified model
outperforms this, demonstrating it is capable of solving the novel access
control challenges thrown up by digital-calibration supply chains."
pub.1146367991,In Search of Corporate Brand Alignment,"In order to successfully manage corporate brands, there must be coherency between internal and external corporate brand constituents. The philosophical foundations of corporate brand alignment theory are explored by devoting attention towards the ontological and epistemological underpinnings of different paradigms, the functionalist and interpretivist. The importance of bridging the boundaries between paradigms is presented by taking a meta-paradigm perspective. A novel conceptual model is offered that frames the mutual relationship between paradigms into a circular process that simultaneously considers the objectified corporate brand and the corporate branding process in two stages. Corporate brand alignment plays a key role to evolve across stages, as it triggers a virtuous process of value creation and co-creation by fostering connections between various stakeholders. Conversely, the absence of alignment can create relational bottlenecks in progressing from one stage to the other. Hence, it represents a strategic enabler to develop a coherent representation of multiple corporate brand symbolisms. This is followed by the development of corporate brand aligned relationships to successfully co-create value with multiple stakeholders. Internally, employees are called to live the corporate brand and coherency helps in achieving a mutual understanding that enhances the co-creation of authentic corporate brand values. For external alignment, most scholars are suggesting it is crucial to achieve successful value co-creation focused on brand communities. Scholars are also drawing their attention to the crucial importance of B2B (business-to-business) relationships, which include a wide range of stakeholders, such as business clients, suppliers, and distributors. We conclude this chapter by highlighting its main contributions, the related implications and by proposing avenues for future research. This chapter discusses the corporate branding domain by offering knowledge on corporate brand alignment theory. In order to successfully manage corporate brands, there must be coherency between internal and external corporate brand constituents. The philosophical foundations of corporate brand alignment theory are explored by devoting attention towards the ontological and epistemological underpinnings of different paradigms, the functionalist and interpretivist. The functionalist paradigm is grounded on objective ontology and positivistic epistemology. Corporate brand research in the functionalist paradigm has been developed through the scientific method, thus testing hypotheses based on previous theories through quantitative analyses. Drawing on the key tenets of the interpretivist paradigm, the aim of corporate brand alignment is to enquire into relational gaps as a means to achieve corporate brand symbolic connections, especially related to shared responsibility, participation, and conversations and dialogue between internal and external corporate brand stak"
pub.1143591856,A Hybrid Mathematical and Decision‐Making Model to Determine the Amount of Economic Order considering the Discount,"Suppliers are one of the most important parts of the supply chain, whose performance indirectly has a significant impact on customer satisfaction. Because customer demands are different from organizations, organizations have to consider different criteria for selecting their suppliers. In recent years, many studies in this field have been conducted using various criteria and methods. The main purpose defined in this research is to develop a model for simultaneous item ordering systems in real business conditions. In this research, a model is developed by considering the two objectives of minimizing overall costs and maximizing the amount of products ordered from different suppliers based on their weight value. Weights are calculated based on different criteria using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method for each supplier in different periods. Then, due to the multiobjective nature of the model, the proposed model has been solved by using the epsilon constraint in GAMS and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II in MATLAB software. Considering the simultaneous order of inventory of multiproduct with several suppliers in several periods of time in discrete space with discount is one of the contributions of this research. To validate the proposed model, the results of the exact solution are compared with the meta-heuristic solution. Comparison results and assessment metrics indicate that the results of the proposed solution approach with an error of less than 1% had good performance. The results show that the system cost increases, by increasing the amount of discount, because of the increase in the amount of demand. Therefore, with a 30% increase in the discount, the system costs will increase to 36,496 units. Also, with a 20% reduction, the cost reduction will be reduced to 14,170 units."

In A. Deserti & F. Celaschi (Eds.), Design e Innovazione. Strumenti e pratiche per la ricerca applicata (pp. 1–50). Roma: Carocci Editore (Italian Edition only), 2007) – emerge as the most relevant tools that create, transfer, and allow sharing ideas of the futures within the design process.Literature offers many definitions of future scenarios within the design field. They are considered as business prognostication tools (Schwartz, The art of the long view: Planning for the future in an uncertain world. New York: Currency Doubleday, 1991) or as strategic tools “to inform, validate and endorse design decisions, to define a strategy and to help decision makers” (Evans & Somerville, Designing tomorrow: A methodology for future orientated product design. Global Chinese industrial design conference 2005, Chang Gung University, Taiwan, Nov 2005. http://www.academia.edu/203838/Evans_M_and_Sommerville_S_2005_Designing_Tomorrow_A_Methodology_for_Future_Orientated_Product_Design._Global_Chinese_Industrial_Design_Conference_2005_Chang_Gung_University_Taiwan_November_2005. Accessed 10 Sept 2016, 2005).The chapter offers a theoretical overview on scenarios literature, then focusing on design scenarios characteristics and application and offering a reading model of their objectives and outputs along a design process, thanks to the presentation of case studies from different productive fields – transportation, electronics and home appliances, and fashion, as emblematic cases. In particular, the discussion highlights stakeholders, approaches, and tools that shape typologies and functions of scenarios within the different design sectors and that articulate different perspectives on the anticipatory value of the design practice."
pub.1155978040,"Solutions for the commercialization challenges of Horizon Europe and earth observation consortia: co-creation, innovation, decision-making, tech-transfer, and sustainability actions","European Community (EC) Horizon-funded projects and Earth Observation-based Consortia aim to create sustainable value for Space, Land, and Oceans. They typically focus on addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many of these projects (e.g. Commercialization and Innovation Actions) have an ambitious challenge to ensure that partners share core competencies to simultaneously achieve technological and commercial success and sustainability after the end of the EC funds. To achieve this ambitious challenge, Horizon projects must have a proper governance model and a systematized process that can manage the existing paradoxical tensions involving numerous European partners and their respective agendas and stakeholders. This article presents the VCW-Value Creation Wheel (Lages in J Bus Res 69: 4849–4855, 2016), as a framework that has its roots back in 1995 and has been used since 2015 in the context of numerous Space Business, Earth Observation, and European Community (EC) projects, to address complex problems and paradoxical tensions. In this article, we discuss six of these paradoxical tensions that large Horizon Consortia face in commercialization, namely when managing innovation ecosystems, co-creating, taking digitalization, decision-making, tech-transfer, and sustainability actions. We discuss and evaluate how alliance partners could find the optimal balance between (1) cooperation, competition, and coopetition perspectives; (2) financial, environmental, and social value creation; (3) tech-push and market-pull orientations; (4) global and local market solutions; (5) functionality driven and human-centered design (UX/UI); (6) centralized and decentralized online store approaches. We discuss these challenges within the case of the EC H2020 NextLand project answering the call for greening the economy in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We analyze NextLand Online Store, and its Business and Innovation Ecosystem while considering the input of its different stakeholders, such as NextLand’s commercial team, service providers, users, advisors, EC referees, and internal and external stakeholders. Preliminary insights from a twin project in the field of Blue Economy (EC H2020 NextOcean), are also used to support our arguments. Partners, referees, and EC officers should address the tensions mentioned in this article during the referee and approval processes in the pre-grant and post-grant agreement stages. Moreover, we propose using the Value Creation Wheel (VCW) method and the VCW meta-framework as a systematized process that allows us to co-create and manage the innovation ecosystem while engaging all the stakeholders and presenting solutions to address these tensions. The article concludes with theoretical implications and limitations, managerial and public policy implications, and lessons for Horizon Europe, earth observation, remote sensing, and space business projects."

There is a gap about the reasons for using the budget in the context of a family business succession process, whose characteristics and purposes of the budget reflect their need depending on the antecedents the reasons for use. The relevance of the theme lies in understanding the intergenerational succession as a part of the life cycle in family companies and the interface with the management control system (MCS) from the need of the budget with a planning and control tool. As an impact on the area, this study broadens the field of research on budget considering its characteristics and purposes in a context of organizational transition that involves succession in a family business. We adopted the single case study with data collected through semi-structured interviews, observations, and documents. Data were analyzed from the discursive textual analysis whose focus is the contents related to succession from the organizational life cycle, changes in the MCS, and budget need. The results showed that changes resulting from the succession process on the strategies of its planning (professionalization of management, creation of the holding company, and governance) interact and influence the need of the budget. This stems from the reasons for operational planning and strategic training from its antecedents associated with the organizational characteristics of the success and renewal phase of the life cycle. The contribution of the study is based on the combination of succession in family business and budget by making it possible to reflect on the need for a specific tool (the budget) to support goal setting and decision-making in this context. It will contribute to the MCS and family business by understanding the need for budgeting in the succession process. In addition, it will validate the three-phase model of the succession process in a family business as part of the organizational life cycle.

In the context of the impact of digitalization processes on the transformation of behavioral models within the existing economic relations in the VUCA world, new requirements and ways of interaction of subjects of the triple helix model are considered. The article analyzes the main existing and prospective forms of cooperation between universities and business structures. The detailed description of barriers and difficulties on the way of digitalization of enterprises and scientific organizations is given. For employees of scientific and commercial enterprises in the conditions of digitalization and General increased uncertainty, recommendations are formulated for the choice of a behavior model that adapts their professional identity based on the principles of a proactive position and knowledge and skills at the intersection of different technological directions. Under the conditions of variability and uncertainty of the environment, a scientific problem has been identified, there is a high interest in collaboration between universities and businesses, but there is no mechanism that allows this interaction to be carried out with a high degree of efficiency. A set of mechanisms that help reduce the level of uncertainty is proposed, as well as a project method of interaction within the framework of the digital meta-University technology platform model is described. The article provides recommendations for the full implementation of human capital in the new technological conditions of economic and social development, in the so-called VUCA-world, which is characterized by the lack of a developed digital infrastructure, as well as a high level of transaction costs. A new approach is proposed, based on which participants will interact on the basis of shared access to information and digital resources and the ability to combine the development of innovative projects and training of personnel necessary to unite the University, enterprises and scientific organizations to reduce transaction, fixed and variable costs of participants in the process."
pub.1170644130,Enhancing supply chain resilience in offsite construction through the procurement strategy: a systematic literature review," Purpose Offsite construction (OC) is an efficient method to reduce waste in the construction industry from a circular economy perspective. Yet, its uptake is subdued by the ambiguities around its supply chain. Hence, the purpose of this study is twofold: to identify the OC project delivery models, the limitations in their procurement approach to facilitate the resilience of the supply chain and interventions to promote supply chain resilience (SCR) and to identify the gaps in the existing procurement process and propose further research areas that implement strategies to improve SCR.   Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted as a systematic literature review. In total, 41 peer-reviewed research papers published between 2013 and 2023 were shortlisted through the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. A descriptive analysis was conducted, followed by a thematic analysis.   Findings The descriptive analysis reveals that the emphasis on digitising OC has shifted to transforming the business model, procurement and supply chain with a human-centric view. In thematic analysis, the predictability of the SC partners and the probabilities of evaluating the prospects are revealed as arbitrary characteristics in the current procurement strategies. Rewarding collaborative relationships among SC partners and incorporating provisions to postpone the module delivery are some interventions to promote flexibility. Drafting comprehensive and effective contracts that address transparency issues and facilitating the need for continuous development of capabilities through procurement are among the further research avenues proposed.   Originality/value This study is a precursor demonstrating the potential of the procurement process to implement the decrees of SCR for better goal congruence of the OC supply chain. "
pub.1182007631,Oil and Gas Field Digital Twin Full Lifecycle Management Platform and Application Based on Meta-Universe Technology,"Abstract Oil and gas fields are often characterized by wide distribution of facilities and equipment, harsh natural environments, difficulties in engineering construction and production operation and maintenance management, and increasingly severe risks of violence and terrorism. There is an urgent need to build a unified management platform covering the engineering construction, production and operation phases, and to carry out unified control over the whole life cycle process of oilfields. This paper takes meta-universe technology as the core to construct a virtual reality environment for oil and gas field production and office facilities. It integrates the static data in the engineering construction process, such as engineering design, procurement, construction, commissioning, and startup, with the dynamic data and business processes in the production and operation process, such as Internet of Things (IOT) production, sales and procurement, and comprehensive office, to build a digital twin full life cycle management platform for oil and gas fields, and applies it to an oil field in West Africa. Aiming at the problem of poor network transmission conditions, this paper researches the adaptive dimensionality reduction algorithm for digital twin high-dimensional animation data, improved Forward Error Correction coding (FEC) and Automatic Retransmission Request (ARQ) algorithms, and adaptive transmission algorithms based on active sampling of the ""protagonist aura"" model. This ensures stable operation of the twin platform and its applications in restricted and highly unstable network environments. In terms of equipment dynamic fault identification and predictive maintenance, this paper adopts high-fidelity modeling and multi-case simulation technology to realize the modeling and simulation of reciprocating compressors, and establishes a fault diagnosis model based on machine learning and deep learning, which is capable of accurately identifying and classifying different types of faults and providing early warning, with a fault identification accuracy rate of up to 95% and an early warning accuracy rate of up to 90%. In general, the working mode of the oilfield is transformed from ""labor-intensive, stationed on duty, regular inspection"" to ""fewer or unmanned, centralized monitoring, on-demand inspection"". The management mode changes from""manual judgment + experience analysis"" to ""automatic warning + intelligent analysis"". The abnormality handling mode is transformed from ""real-time alarm and post-disposal"" to ""pre-warning and mid-control"". Through the construction of the platform, it improves the company's data governance capability, optimizes the operation and management process, improves the production operation efficiency, directly reduces the labor cost and operation cost by about 37%, improves the efficiency of production operation fault disposal to 75%, reduces the number of production emergencies by more than 30%, and realizes the full life-c"

The rapid development of technologies in various fields of business, including in telecommunications requires an increasing level of service provision, because the formation of a market for network communication services has increased attention to issues of quality control, both by regulators and by the providers themselves. In order to meet a given level of quality of service, telecommunication operators develop algorithms and solutions for providing quality control services based on various criteria. However, these solutions are not universal for different types of indicators (quantitative, qualitative, etc.) of quality of service. Objective. The paper presents the approach to automating workflows and their components (functional services, connections and rules of interaction) by designing processes based on computer-aided generation of both a set of services that are components of workflows and the sequence of their execution using ontologies. Ontology serves as meta-model of the workflow, services, subject domain and logical rules that establish relationships between functional services. Methods. The implementation of the proposed approach was realized using an ontological modeling, workflow modeling standards and methods of computer-aided designing. Results. An ontological model of service quality indicators was developed, as well as dynamically changing workflow that guarantees the quality of service control universality was designed. For computer-aided workflows generation the software environment has been developed, the performance of which is tested on the example of workflow designing tool IT TODOS for developing and modifying ontologies and generating workflow scheme using BPMN. Conclusions. The proposed approach makes the process of quality of service control more transparent and reduces the involvement of analysts in this process. Such an approach is flexible and universal for usage in any subject domain by uploading relevant data to the registers. It also provides the process of the quality of service control automation and the solution encapsulation enabling employees to use the solution provided at any level without the expert analyst involvement."
pub.1151448373,What is an AI engineer?,"Recently, the job market for Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineers has exploded. Since the role of AI engineer is relatively new, limited research has been done on the requirements as set by the industry. Moreover, the definition of an AI engineer is less established than for a data scientist or a software engineer. In this study we explore, based on job ads, the requirements from the job market for the position of AI engineer in The Netherlands. We retrieved job ad data between April 2018 and April 2021 from a large job ad database, Jobfeed from TextKernel. The job ads were selected with a process similar to the selection of primary studies in a literature review. We characterize the 367 resulting job ads based on meta-data such as publication date, industry/sector, educational background and job titles. To answer our research questions we have further coded 125 job ads manually. The job tasks of AI engineers are concentrated in five categories: business understanding, data engineering, modeling, software development and operations engineering. Companies ask for AI engineers with different profiles: 1) data science engineer with focus on modeling, 2) AI software engineer with focus on software development, 3) generalist AI engineer with focus on both models and software. Furthermore, we present the tools and technologies mentioned in the selected job ads, and the soft skills. Our research helps to understand the expectations companies have for professionals building AI-enabled systems. Understanding these expectations is crucial both for prospective AI engineers and educational institutions in charge of training those prospective engineers. Our research also helps to better define the profession of AI engineering. We do this by proposing an extended AI engineering life-cycle that includes a business understanding phase."

Design/methodology/approach The institutional mapping approach has been used to analyze Iran’s OSN multilevel policymaking system. A combination of two matrices, including institutions-institutions and institutions-functions, was used to perform the institutional mapping. Two main steps were taken to draw the mentioned matrices. First, a review of related studies in Iran’s OSN policymaking system was conducted and the policy functions mentioned in these studies were identified and categorized using the meta-synthesis. Second, based on analyzing two policy documents of Iran’s OSN, institutions and their interactions were identified and policy functions were allocated to institutions.   Findings Based on the results, the most important policy functions in the current OSN policymaking system in Iran are support, regulatory, monitoring and evaluation, business environment development, culture building and promotion, organizing licenses and permissions, policymaking and legislation. Also, the results show that there are shortcomings in this system, some of the most important of which are lack of transparency in regulatory, little work in culture building and promotion, neglect of the training of specialized human resources and research and development, slow development of the business environment and neglecting the role of nongovernmental organizations in policymaking.   Originality/value By examining and analyzing how different institutions operate within a multilevel policymaking system, the policymaking process and its overall effectiveness can be enhanced. This analysis helps identify any inconsistencies, overlaps or conflicts in the roles and policies of these institutions, leading to a better understanding of how a multilevel policymaking system is organized.

pub.1083763670,Overcoming Institutional Voids: A Reputation‐Based View of Long‐Run Survival,"Research summary: Emerging markets are characterized by underdeveloped institutions and frequent environmental shifts. Yet, they also contain many firms that have survived over generations. How are firms in weak institutional environments able to persist over time? Motivated by 69 interviews with leaders of emerging market firms with histories spanning generations, we combine induction and deduction to propose reputation as a meta‐resource that allows firms to activate their conventional resources. We conceptualize reputation as consisting of prominence, perceived quality, and resilience, and develop a process model that illustrates the mechanisms that allow reputation to facilitate survival in ways that persist over time. Building on research in strategy and business history, we thus shed light on an underappreciated strategic construct (reputation) in an undertheorized setting (emerging markets) over an unusual period (the historical long run). Managerial summary: Why are some firms able to persistently survive in challenging, uncertain, and underdeveloped business environments? To explore this question, we analyze in‐depth interviews with leaders of emerging market firms that have survived over decades and even centuries. We find that firm reputation is a key strategic driver, and propose new ideas about the ways through which reputation facilitates survival. We elaborate how a favorable reputation allows a firm to more fully utilize its existing resources by decreasing uncertainty. We also propose that reputation has offensive and defensive properties that make it valuable to firms during both positive and negative economic cycles. Finally, we discuss why a reputation‐based source of competitive advantage is hard to imitate, and outline three general approaches for building reputation. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

pub.1005571975,Rethinking institutional excellence in Ethiopia: adapting and adopting the balanced scorecard (BSC) model,"This paper intends to outline an academic scorecard that serves as a strategic framework for measuring institutional performance in Ethiopia. It gives major emphasis for producing initial portfolio of key performance indicators that will serve as a springboard for measuring performance in academic institutions. The study relied on meta-analysis of existing BSC-related literature in business and mission-driven organizations across the globe with an intention of benchmarking the best practices in the area. A comprehensive analysis and synthesis of an extant literature resulted in an architectural blueprint of BSC for academic institutions operating in Ethiopia. This has been built around five strategic themes that serve as pillars of excellence for HEIs (viz., academic excellence, diversity of student community, outreach and engagement, resource management, and networking and partnership) and four perspectives, which are different views of what drives the institution and those which provide a framework for measurement of its performance. The identified perspectives include the stakeholders, the internal business process, financial stewardships, and learning, innovation and development (LID). A number of strategic objectives and measurement metrics have been forwarded under each perspective in line with the HEI’s mission. The researcher expects that such BSC framework will arouse a great deal of interest in opening discussions and debates among academics, HEIs officials, policy makers, reform consultants and others in a way they serve as a good ground for developing common understanding and outlining a skeleton of academic scorecard to be standardized for more or less uniform application in the Ethiopian HEIs.

Companies like Facebook moderate content posted by users on their platforms through a mixture of automated decision making and human moderators. In this content moderation process, human rights play an ambiguous role: those who struggle with marginalization may find a space for expression and empowerment, or face exacerbation of pre-existing bias. Focusing on the role of human rights in Meta's content management, this essay explores how the protection of speech on social media platforms disadvantages the cultural, social, and economic rights of marginalized communities. This is not to say that speech on social media platforms is devoid of emancipatory potential, but that this potential is not uniformly or equally accessible. We see the incorporation of human rights considerations into decision-making processes as an avenue for alleviating this challenge. This approach faces obstacles from the platforms’ business models, which decenters human rights concerns, and from the limitations of liberal accounts of human rights. From within and against these constraints, human rights can be mobilized as emancipatory power in an effort to decrease marginalization."

pub.1053140411,VTPR-Tree: An Efficient Indexing Method for Moving Objects with Frequent Updates,"Moving object databases are required to support queries on a large number of continuous moving objects. Indexes for moving objects must support both query and update operations efficiently. In previous work TPR-tree is the most popular indexing method for the future predicted position, but its frequent updates performance is very poor. In this paper we propose a novel indexing method, called VTPR-tree, for predicted trajectory of moving objects. VTPR-tree takes into account both the velocity and space distribution of moving objects. First the velocity domain is split, and moving objects are classified into different velocity buckets by their velocities, thus objects in one bucket have similar velocities. Then we use an improved TPR-tree structure to index objects in each bucket. VTPR-tree is supplemented by a hash index on IDs of moving objects to support frequent updates. Also an extended bottom-up update algorithm is developed for VTPR-tree, thus having a good dynamic update performance and concurrency. Experimental results show that the update and query performance of VTPR-tree outperforms the TPR*-tree."
pub.1181793241,Platform power and regulatory capture in digital governance,"Abstract  Digital governance is a public concern, yet under private control. After numerous scandals, all stakeholders in the European Union (EU) agreed to establish a “novel constitution for the internet” that would effectively constrain the power of large platforms. Yet the Digital Services Act (DSA) ultimately legitimized and institutionalized their position as the gatekeepers of the internet. Why? We argue that platforms prevailed thanks to their ability as intermediaries to quietly shape the available policy options. Our “ platform power mechanism” combines institutional and ideational sources of business power to show how big tech drew on its entrenched position as an indispensable provider of essential services and promulgated the idea of itself as a responsible and neutral intermediary. We follow the unfolding of platform power through a process-tracing analysis of Google and Meta’s activities with respect to DSA legislation from its announcement (2020) to its adoption (2022). Besides contributing a reconceptualization of the DSA as a regulatory capture, we integrate the notion of platform power into a “regulator–intermediary–target” model and demonstrate how gatekeepers have exploited information asymmetries to share “the public space.” Our analysis thus supplements established approaches that have derived regulators’ deference to platforms from the tacit allegiance of consumers.

It is asserted that the existing methodologies (DEMO - Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations, BORM - Business Object Relation Modeling and OntoUML) provide tools for analysis of the organization and its business processes through different ways. They lead to different results and make the process of organization modeling complicated. There is no software to support work with these methodologies together. The purpose of this research is to create a unified meta-model (within the Eclipse EMF technology) for a new methodology based on the existing ones and to analyze the completeness of these methodologies for describing enterprise architecture. It will serve as a basis for a new open software platform for multifaceted modeling of the organization. In this research, we have compared the above-mentioned methodologies and concluded that despite the fact that these methodologies provide an analysis of different aspects of organizational structure, they have a common basic set of concepts. This study demonstrates the implementation of the Ecore model that is built on the basis of the selected group of common elements of these methodologies. We have also found that the combination of the considered methodologies contains all the concepts inherent in the systematic approach to the modeling of organizational structure. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the aspects of the organization that can be modeled by the methodologies considered. Using the Zachman framework, it was shown that: the DEMO, BORM and OntoUML methodologies allow us to describe in detail the business processes that take place at different levels of the organization, from the ontological to the datalogical, and therefore provide comprehensive information for the multifaceted modeling of an organization. However, none of the existing methodologies takes the time component and goal-setting into consideration."

On the other hand, GIS data are abundant and readily available on the Internet for either on-line viewing or direct downloading. We present a software tool which exploits emerging P2P technologies in order to retrieve what is already available on the Internet, thus reducing the data collection cost. In the proposed Map2Share system, two aspects are of special interest, namely the platform which manages access and communication over the network and the retrieval methods to discriminate geographical data. Access and communication management is ensured by the JXTA platform, which is a set of protocols allowing to develop interoperable, platform-independent and ubiquitous P2P architectures. As for the retrieval methods, a minimal set of metadata, on which users may perform efficient retrieval tasks, has been identified on the basis of the well-established ISO/FDIS 19115 and Dublin Core standards. The visual environment characterizing Map2Share is described showing some of its advanced search functionality for geographical data retrieval and sharing."
pub.1008090989,A critical analysis of Lean approach structuring in hospitals,"
                    Purpose
                    – As reimbursements fall and costs for services climb, organizations are forced to follow the painful motto of doing more with less. A solution could be the adaptation of industrial business process improvement (BPI) methods such as Lean to the hospital setting (HS). The purpose of this paper is to analyze if Lean approaches related in the literature provide sufficient methodological support for other practitioners to reproduce the reported results.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    – The authors analyzed the published Lean literature in the HS using a methodological maturity-level framework and what the authors defined as the 11 characteristic activities of BPI.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    – The literature analysis reveals that a Lean approach with a high-methodological maturity level that includes the 11 characteristic activities of BPI has never been reported. Considering this, the paper suggests a meta model for a high-methodological maturity-level Lean method based on the characteristic activities of BPI.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    – This is the first study on the Lean approach in the HS that evidences the absence of a robust Lean methodology in the literature. For Lean to be adopted and implemented by hospital practitioners a structured robust method should be provided.

pub.1036924762,Software architecture challenges in evolvable systems,"Today it is a well known fact that majority of our communication and computing applications are encapsulated in software. The majority of systems evolve with basic requirements toward system stability. When we add to the system some new properties, or functionalities, we are mainly changing the software. Transition from the functional requirements to the system development and deployment passes through the software architecture mapping process. The question is what happens if we avoid systematic approach for architecture mapping, how to fulfill non-functional requirements, and still stay in system stable environment. Many of proposed methods and tools start from the environment for system development from the scratch or at most from similar development environment, reusable components, what in evolvable systems are rare cases. Sometimes it is hard to take into consideration proprietary systems and components that are the basic building elements during development of evolvable systems. The functional success and quality parameters of the new system depend on the process of software architecture evolution. In an industrial practice system architects relay on the prototype execution that can be costly and often is time consuming. The system interaction modeling on the higher abstraction level can improve architectural decisions and propose better components selection process. In such a case the main problem is proper artifacts collection in the environment of black box or gray box modeling, which is based on the meta level of system description. This meta level of system description requires essential architectural concepts that are suitable to replace the reverse engineering activities which in some cases requests a lot of effort with very low performance, and can be very costly. Second problem is how to define atomic executable component in black box modeling to have the fine grained component selection. These architecture correlation facts are the main challenges in evolvable system development. Some analysis shows that commercial companies don't, or rarely, use models and tools for systematic architecture analysis and deployment well accepted in research community. Practical examples will stress the fact that reality is somewhere in between. The systematic implementation of architecture evolution tool chain with existing development and business processes can improve the overall system quality and reduce the development time."
pub.1166392840,Investigating critical success factors and risks of construction technology startups: a systematic literature review,"The construction industry has been strongly embracing innovation and technology in the past few years. Along with emerging technologies, many entrepreneurs have started to play a vital role in this process by providing solutions for specific problems in the construction sector through startups. However, the development of a construction technology (Contech) startup and the factors affecting its success are still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate critical success factors and risks of Contech startups by utilizing the systematic approach of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. Forty-five (45) articles were included and analysed, and a total of 18 critical success factors were identified under (i) organizational capability, (ii) market strategy, and (iii) ecosystem engagement categories. Additionally, five (5) factors were presented under the risk factors category. The results showed that business model innovation, entrepreneurial support organization, founding team’s prior professional experience, and collaboration and inter-organizational learning, while uncertainty and marketing are the most highlighted risk factors in the selected articles. The study’s findings make a valuable addition to the existing body of knowledge, as they address the gap in understanding the factors and risks that contribute to the success of Contech startups."

pub.1147465155,Stacking Machine Learning Model for the Assessment of R&D Product’s Readiness and Method for Its Cost Estimation,"The modern technology universities have the necessary resource and material base for developing and transferring R&D products. However, the cost estimation process is not formalized. There are many methods of estimating the cost of R&D products’ commercialization processes. However, in some cases, we cannot consider any single technique to be the best one as each of them has advantages and disadvantages. In such conditions, all efforts should be made to use a combination of the estimation techniques to arrive at a better cost and quality estimate. The effectiveness of the valuation of R&D products is of particular importance in today’s economy and due to the need to analyze large data sets prepared for transfer from universities to the business environment. This paper presents the model, two methods, and general information technology for R&D products’ readiness level assessment and R&D products’ cost estimation. The article presents the complex method for determining the cost of R&D products, which will allow: increasing the efficiency of the transfer, commercialization, and market launch of R&D products, and promoting the interaction of all components of the national innovation infrastructure, innovations, etc. The need to consider many different indicators when evaluating R&D products has determined the need to use machine learning algorithms. We have designed a new machine learning-based model for the readiness assessment of R&D products, which is based on the principle of “crowd wisdom” and uses a stacking strategy to integrate machine learning methods. It is experimentally established that the new stacking model based on machine learning algorithms that use random forest as a meta-algorithm provides a minimum of a 1.03 times higher RMSE compared to other ensemble strategies."
pub.1181492608,Causal Economic Machine Learning (CEML): “Human AI”,"This paper proposes causal economic machine learning (CEML) as a research agenda that utilizes causal machine learning (CML), built on causal economics (CE) decision theory. Causal economics is better suited for use in machine learning optimization than expected utility theory (EUT) and behavioral economics (BE) based on its central feature of causal coupling (CC), which models decisions as requiring upfront costs, some certain and some uncertain, in anticipation of future uncertain benefits that are linked by causation. This multi-period causal process, incorporating certainty and uncertainty, replaces the single-period lottery outcomes augmented with intertemporal discounting used in EUT and BE, providing a more realistic framework for AI machine learning modeling and real-world application. It is mathematically demonstrated that EUT and BE are constrained versions of CE. With the growing interest in natural experiments in statistics and causal machine learning (CML) across many fields, such as healthcare, economics, and business, there is a large potential opportunity to run AI models on CE foundations and compare results to models based on traditional decision-making models that focus only on rationality, bounded to various degrees. To be most effective, machine learning must mirror human reasoning as closely as possible, an alignment established through CEML, which represents an evolution to truly “human AI”. This paper maps out how the non-linear optimization required for the CEML structural response functions can be accomplished through Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) and applied to data sets through the S-Learner CML meta-algorithm. Upon this foundation, the next phase of research is to apply CEML to appropriate data sets in various areas of practice where causality and accurate modeling of human behavior are vital, such as precision healthcare, economic policy, and marketing."
pub.1169263949,Comparative analysis of machine learning techniques in optimal site selection,"The criticality of selecting an appropriate site in business is undeniable, as a company’s location plays a pivotal role in determining its performance. In recent times, the adoption of machine learning techniques for aiding in optimal site selection has gained popularity, thanks to their ability to make data-driven predictions about the suitability of different locations. In this research, we delve into the efficiency of various machine learning and Deep Learning algorithms by leveraging data from Open Street Map (OSM), WorldPop population statistics, and Bing satellite imagery. We utilized a targeted dataset from Yelp, focusing on restaurant check-ins, to gauge the rate of human interaction with businesses in various locations. Our analysis employed a range of methods, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, XGBoost, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and ElasticNet. Additionally, we used Bing maps’ satellite imagery to train different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models like VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, DenseNet, and InceptionV3. The efficacy of these models were evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Median Absolute Error (MedAE), Max Error (ME), and Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). The selection of these algorithmic strategies was based on their successful performance in previous studies. This study also incorporated a stacking ensemble learning technique to develop a meta-model. After analyzing the error rates of these models, the most effective one for the collected data was identified. The purpose of this study is to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and provide useful insights for those considering the integration of machine learning in the process of site selection."
pub.1169619101,TRAD: Enhancing LLM Agents with Step-Wise Thought Retrieval and Aligned Decision,"Numerous large language model (LLM) agents have been built for different
tasks like web navigation and online shopping due to LLM's wide knowledge and
text-understanding ability. Among these works, many of them utilize in-context
examples to achieve generalization without the need for fine-tuning, while few
of them have considered the problem of how to select and effectively utilize
these examples. Recently, methods based on trajectory-level retrieval with task
meta-data and using trajectories as in-context examples have been proposed to
improve the agent's overall performance in some sequential decision making
tasks. However, these methods can be problematic due to plausible examples
retrieved without task-specific state transition dynamics and long input with
plenty of irrelevant context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
(TRAD) to address these issues. TRAD first conducts Thought Retrieval,
achieving step-level demonstration selection via thought matching, leading to
more helpful demonstrations and less irrelevant input noise. Then, TRAD
introduces Aligned Decision, complementing retrieved demonstration steps with
their previous or subsequent steps, which enables tolerance for imperfect
thought and provides a choice for balance between more context and less noise.
Extensive experiments on ALFWorld and Mind2Web benchmarks show that TRAD not
only outperforms state-of-the-art models but also effectively helps in reducing
noise and promoting generalization. Furthermore, TRAD has been deployed in
real-world scenarios of a global business insurance company and improves the
success rate of robotic process automation."
pub.1005191256,Model Driven Security for Agile SOA-Style Environments,"There is evidence that many IT security vulnerabilities are caused by incorrect security policies and configurations (i.e. human errors) rather than by inherent weaknesses in the attacked IT systems. Security administrators need to have an in-depth understanding of the security features and vulnerabilities of a multitude of ever-changing and different IT “silos”. Moreover, in complex, large, networked IT environments such policies quickly become confusing and error-prone because administrators cannot specify and maintain the correct policy anymore. Agile service oriented architecture (SOA) style environments further complicate this scenario for a number of reasons, including: security policies may need to be reconfigured whenever the IT infrastructure gets re-orchestrated; security at the business process management layer is at a different semantic level than in the infrastructure; semantic mappings between the layers and well-adopted standardised notations are not available. This paper explores how the concepts of security policy management at a high, more intuitive (graphical) level of abstraction and model-driven security (tied in with model driven software engineering) can be used for more effective and simplified security management/enforcement for the agile IT environments that organisations are faced with today. In this paper, we illustrate in SecureMDA™ how model driven security can be applied to automatically generate security policies from abstract models. Using this approach, human errors are minimised and policy updates can be automatically generated whenever the underlying infrastructure gets re-orchestrated, updated etc. The generated security policies are consistent across the entire distributed environment using the OpenPMF policy management framework. This approach is better than having administrators go from IT system to IT system and change policies for many reasons (including security, cost, effort, error-proneness, and consistency). The paper also outlines why meta-modelling and a flexible enforcement plug-in model are useful concepts for security model flexibility."
pub.1133449512,Cocreating resilient hybrids: the bridging power of social enterprises' organizational logics," Purpose This study investigates (1) the processes through which social enterprises develop resilient organizational logics and (2) the key resilience factors in the organizational logics of successful social enterprises. The organizational logic is conceptualized here as the dynamic system of roles, rules and social expectations that result from the organization's business model, impact model and organizational form.   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts an inductive approach to identify emerging resilience factors and processes in an exemplary case of social entrepreneurship (a work integration venture). The longitudinal data collection on this case took place from 2011 to 2016, based on approximately 440 h of participant observation and 10 semi-structured interviews.   Findings The inductive analysis suggests that social enterprises develop resilient organizational logics through multi-level recursive processes of bridging institutional work. These processes enable the development of an organizational logic that is internally robust while linking distant practices, needs and expectations. The authors conceptualize these characteristics into a novel construct, the organizational logic's bridging power, which is operationalizable through two dimensions (hybridity-based and cocreation-based bridging power) and five sub-dimensions.   Research limitations/implications Like in all inductive studies, further research is needed to validate the proposed model. The new proposed construct “organizational logic's bridging power” is, interestingly, a meta-theoretical concept encouraging cross-fertilization between the literature on institutional logics and that on value cocreation.   Originality/value The process development model proposed by this study highlights the importance of network-level institutional work for developing cocreation-based resilience. Furthermore, this study shows how institutional theories could be complemented with other bodies of knowledge in order to understand social enterprise resilience. "
pub.1129822355,Technology transfer in the construction industry,"The demand for affordable, high-quality homes and premises has increased as society has evolved. Construction companies have shown that an industrialised housebuilding (IHB) platform strategy is an effective way of meeting exacting customer requirements. We decided to apply a managerial perspective and consider the IHB platform as a technological solution when investigating technology transfer (TT) in a construction context. Drawing on a meta-analysis of the literature and a qualitative case study at an IHB company, this work examines how two construction companies participate in TT. The results show that the IHB platform strategy can help a company overcome uncertainties associated with the TT process. Furthermore, the platform strategy supports the transferability of IHB to different markets, which, in turn, provides unique opportunities for companies from other contexts to enter the construction market. Our findings also revealed that CEOs from three construction companies were not only interested in TT due to potential profit improvements, but also considered how the process could benefit their employees and the community. This may be a result that is specific to Nordic culture or insight into a unique characteristic of the broad construction industry. This study contributes knowledge to the scarce research field of TT in a construction context. It provides evidence for how further cases of TT may disrupt the construction industry in terms of new business models or companies from the diverse field entering the market."

The work organisation has changed considerably, with online lectures and classes coming in daily. Many more technologies and solutions are involved in preparing the subject and the study process. The study’s design shows the general strategy chosen by the authors to integrate the latest theoretical findings and components of the study coherently and logically - structured observations, structured interviews, system analysis, meta-analysis and approbation.The exchange of experience allows for further development by increasing the number of asynchronous study courses (learning takes place through online channels). A degree of maturity in using digital tools has been reached, allowing the student to learn the subject whenever and wherever he or she wishes. The experience gained in the USA shows that in the case of successful development of an asynchronous course, in combination with really extended feedback, even content-compliant courses can be acquired in this way very successfully.A complete cycle of “learn by doing” and “do by learning” approaches are being implemented for the first time. The described methods have been tested, initially with the teaching staff in the role of a student in full-time studies in the classroom. After that, the existing study courses are improved and modernised, and new digitally implemented study courses are developed.The practical part is based on experience. Implementing the Erasmus + project “Inclusive Digital Education – a Tool to Understand Circular Economy” (2020–1-LV01-KA226-HE-094519), which focuses on circular economics and circular business model topics and will help educational institutions to implement digital education solutions in their curricula.The project is developing an innovative, asynchronous online course on the topic of Circular Economy and will seek to improve teachers’ digital pedagogical competencies by enabling them to provide a high-quality learning process."
pub.1165793367,Circular Economy and Solid Waste Management: Connections from a Bibliometric Analysis,"The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of the research published between 2012 and 2022 on solid waste management (SWM) and the circular economy (CE) using bibliometrics. To this end, the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases were used as sources of publications. Processing was conducted using the R language version 4.2.2 and the Bibliometrix software package version 4.1.2. A theoretical basis was built on the terms in order to present their interactions in the context of scientific debate. The results show that there is a need to create indicators to facilitate the evaluation of SWM. They can be identified from the data collected during the management process. Examples include the volume of material collected, operating costs, and recycling rates. Indicators are important in the waste management process because they help quantify the effectiveness of the management practices adopted, help to identify areas that need improvement, and make it possible to monitor the progress of work over time and the achievement of previously set targets. Two other important results are the maximization of the use of resources by increasing the useful life of the product and the emergence of new sustainable business models with recycling as a driving force. Finally, and perhaps the most disruptive discovery, is the integration of SWM and CE with blockchain technology to reduce the levels of waste production. This shows how new technologies can be used as partners in solving complex problems, such as solid waste (SW)."
pub.1176131700,The Adaptive Assessment of Financial Security of Retail Industry Entities in the Context of Active Development of Meta-Spatial Business Collaborations,"The article examines the relationship between the development of metaspatial business collaborations in the sphere of retail and the financial security of economic entities (FSEE), which is defined as a state characterized by: balance and quality of financial instruments, technologies and services; resilience to internal and external threats; the ability of the financial system to ensure the achievement of financial goals. An improved methodology for adaptive assessment and analysis of the FSEE has been proposed, which includes three blocks: a block for assessing the state of the FSEE, a block for threat analysis and a block for the development of managerial influences. The FSEE assessment block includes the following four stages: formation of the FSEE scorecard; comprehensive assessment of the level of the FSEE; assessment of the state of individual groups of the FSEE; identification of the FSEE states. The model of formation of the system of indicators is the initial model of the block, the purpose of which is to form and filter preliminary financial indicators that are most significant for such an assessment. The formation of indicators is possible, depending on information security, by expert and statistical methods. The model of integral assessment of the level of the FSEE allows to build an integral indicator that reflects the general level of the financial component of economic security. Its value is computed using the method of constructing a taxonomic indicator of the level of development, which is one of the methods of multivariate analysis. The model for assessing the state of individual groups of the FSEE includes the formation of values of local levels of financial security for certain groups of financial indicators and even an assessment of the impact of these indicators on the corresponding local level of financial security. The developed set of models allows to obtain forecast assessmets that can be used both in the development of the strategy of economic security of enterprise and in the process of operational management of the FSEE. The proposed set of models has been approbated to assess the level of financial security on the basis of data on the activities of 20 retailers in Ukraine. To assess and analyze financial security, neural network models were used, which, due to the property of generalization, insensitivity to small changes in input signals, the ability to learn and abstract, made it possible to solve the problems of the amount of computing resources, as well as the lack of complete information. The use of a neural network approach to the assessment and analysis of the financial component of economic security made it possible to better present a model of the joint influence of factors and threats on the level of the FSEE. In the context of the active development of metaspatial business collaborations, especially in the field of retail, the proposed methodology for adaptive assessment and analysis of financial security"
pub.1015498793,A modelling framework for complementary design of production planning and control systems,"In a business era characterized by a dazzling rate of change, the improvement of production planning and control begins to be a main objective for manufacturing industries. This paper postulates four main statements to be considered for the design of production planning and control systems (PPC-systems) comprising human and technical sub-systems. The first is that production models required for the design of PPC-systems (i.e. design models) cannot be identical to production models required for planning and control of production systems (i.e. regulatory models). The design of PPC-systems must primarily focus on the quality of interaction between the regulatory models. This insight supports the second statement, which postulates that the design of PPC-systems requires a complementary design approach. Complementary design means to take explicitly into account that human and technical sub-systems- based on the differences in strengths and weaknesses of both- can achieve through their interaction a new quality, possible neither to human nor technical sub-systems alone. The third statement is that a complementary design of PPC-systems will only be possible if a fundamental change of mind from a static to a dynamic as well as from a technical to a socio-technical perception (i.e. a complete perception) of production systems takes place. Without a complete perception of production systems, designed PPC-systems will not be sufficiently reliable, maintainable and flexible, will be difficult to comprehend, and their elements will not be re-usable for further applications. The fourth statement is that the integral support of the design process requires a dual modelling framework comprising a meta- and an object-model. Considering these fundamental insights that were confirmed by a practical case study, a dual modelling framework for the design of PPC-systems which incorporates criteria for complementary design is outlined."
pub.1033856226,Knowledge Acquisition from Semantically Heterogeneous Data,"Recent advances in sensors, digital storage, computing and communications technologies have led to a proliferation of autonomously operated, geographically distributed data repositories in virtually every area of human endeavor, including e-business and e-commerce, e-science, e-government, security informatics, etc. Effective use of such data in practice (e.g., building useful predictive models of consumer behavior, discovery of factors that contribute to large climatic changes, analysis of demographic factors that contribute to global poverty, analysis of social networks, or even finding out what makes a book a bestseller) requires accessing and analyzing data from multiple heterogeneous sources. The Semantic Web enterprise (Berners-Lee et al., 2001) is aimed at making the contents of the Web machine interpretable, so that heterogeneous data sources can be used together. Thus, data and resources on the Web are annotated and linked by associating meta data that make explicit the ontological commitments of the data source providers or, in some cases, the shared ontological commitments of a small community of users. Given the autonomous nature of the data sources on the Web and the diverse purposes for which the data are gathered, in the absence of a universal ontology it is inevitable that there is no unique global interpretation of the data, that serves the needs of all users under all scenarios. Many groups have attempted to develop, with varying degrees of success, tools for flexible integration and querying of data from semantically disparate sources (Levy, 2000; Noy, 2004; Doan, & Halevy, 2005), as well as techniques for discovering semantic correspondences between ontologies to assist in this process (Kalfoglou, & Schorlemmer, 2005; Noy and Stuckenschmidt, 2005). These and related advances in Semantic Web technologies present unprecedented opportunities for exploiting multiple related data sources, each annotated with its own meta data, in discovering useful knowledge in many application domains. While there has been significant work on applying machine learning to ontology construction, information extraction from text, and discovery of mappings between ontologies (Kushmerick, et al., 2005), there has been relatively little work on machine learning approaches to knowledge acquisition from data sources annotated with meta data that expose the structure (schema) and semantics (in reference to a particular ontology). However, there is a large body of literature on distributed learning (see (Kargupta, & Chan, 1999) for a survey). Furthermore, recent work (Zhang et al., 2005; Hotho et al., 2003) has shown that in addition to data, the use of meta data in the form of ontologies (class hierarchies, attribute value hierarchies) can improve the quality (accuracy, interpretability) of the learned predictive models. The purpose of this chapter is to precisely define the problem of knowledge acquisition from semantically heterogeneous data and summariz"
pub.1005673811,"Inclusive Organizational Transformation, An African Perspective on Human Niches and Diversity of Thought","Globalization, consumerism, legislation and human rights issues impact on workplace demographics, changing the very nature thereof. It is of strategic importance to ensure that the benefits of diverse viewpoints and stakeholders are leveraged. However the underlying worldviews of economists, business leaders and consultants are often informed from a Western paradigm and solutions proposed and interventions facilitated are not integrated, integral, systemic or congruent with the containing environment or ecology. In Inclusive Organizational Transformation, Dr Rica Viljoen acknowledges that diversity of thought presents both gifts and challenges to leadership in multi-national organizations. The existential question with which an individual is confronted impacts on his or her worldview. By continuously applying a specific worldview, certain gifts manifest. These are called Human Niches. Here, Inclusivity is positioned as a radical transformational methodology with the purpose of unleashing the benefits of engagement and diversity of thought. The process of Inclusivity enables organizations to optimize the gifts of and contributions from a diverse workforce and unleash tacit knowledge. Case studies from Ghana, South Africa, and one where the same strategy had to be implemented in Australia, Peru and Tanzania are included and insights gained from the dynamics observed are shared. A synthesis of Inclusivity is presented in a model, meta-insights are derived and the prerequisites for Inclusivity on individual, group and organizational domain are illustrated."
pub.1129372313,Chocolate Consumption and Purchasing Behaviour Review: Research Issues and Insights for Future Research,"Chocolate is consumed all over the world. Since its origin, it has undergone many transformations to meet changing market demand. A better understanding of consumer behaviour is a key objective of any business, and so it is for chocolate businesses. In order to fulfil this aim, the current study presents a systematic literature review of consumers’ consumption and purchasing behaviour towards cocoa and chocolate. Two databases have been used to collect the literature: Scopus and Web of Science. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram was used to identify the articles through the process of data screening and extractions. A total of sixty-four scientific articles have been selected. Research topics, methodological approach and data collection method were identified for each article selected. Then, the identified topics were grouped into four categories in order to obtain a model of major determinants in chocolate consumption: personal preferences, product attributes, socio-demographic factors and economic attributes. Results show that there is a strong focus on Fair Trade in chocolate. Moreover, the current literature review supports the fact that the price and promotion are under-investigated issues. This research represents a valuable tool, especially from a marketing point of view, by creating new channels and new sales opportunities for chocolate products."
pub.1166405592,Impact of Awareness on the Adoption of Electric Vehicles: A Systematic Literature Review,"Despite efforts to reduce environmental pollution and wasteful fossil fuel use, electric vehicles (EVs) are still rare on the road. Why is it so challenging to get widespread EV adoption? One significant factor on which it heavily depends is one's awareness and understanding of EVs. However, due to an absolute lack of knowledge on the part of the populace, this factor becomes a huge impediment to the uptake of EVs. A systematic review of the electronic database Scopus for the years 2003–2022 was carried out on ‘EV awareness and adoption of EV’ while considering the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis’ (PRISMA) standards. A three-step identification process resulted in the ultimate detection of 41 papers, which were then thoroughly examined. A conceptual framework that encompasses the three key awareness aspects that influence EV adoption is developed. To encourage greater uniformity among EV researchers, this study's conclusions serve as a foundation for operationalising upcoming research efforts within a predetermined framework. The authors must therefore be optimistic that lingering technological, legislative, cultural, behavioural and business-model barriers may be overcome over time through widespread dissemination of knowledge and awareness related to EVs, making it possible for everyone to switch to greener, more economical and more efficient transportation solutions."

In particular, business models are progressing away from one-off cost towards longer term cost as represented by shared services utilizing kick-boards or bicycles and subscription services for vehicle software. Advances in shared mobility services as described are calling for solutions that can enhance reliability of data aggregate by users leveraging mobility services in the next-generation mobility areas. However, mining process to renew status, ensures continued network communication and block creation demands high performance in public block chain. This thesis proposes random certificate node selection mechanism in block network that creates blocks via node that has tokens issued for block creation and lets only specific nodes selected by encrypting token information acquires token. In the proposed mechanism, all clients belonging to the block network can have the authority to create blocks, and block creation can be performed only through an authentication means called a token, preventing indiscriminate block creation.

Beyond its utilitarian function of connecting billions of people, Facebook is a global advertising machine that basically functions by commodifying users’ information and monetising their behavioural data. But are users aware of this? While studies have examined youth’s awareness of risks in online engagements, there are limited studies on youth’s awareness of the commodification of their information and target advertising directed at them as a trade-off for ‘free’ access to online platforms. This study investigated if educated youth with Facebook accounts in South Africa were aware of this commodification process and that Facebook uses their information for advertising revenue. Drawing theoretically from discourses on commodification and digital capitalism, we examined youth’s media literacy awareness about Facebook’s commercial operation. We conducted a survey of 103 university students and employed online ethnography to elicit responses from a community of university students. The online ethnography generated 24 comments. Findings showed that the majority of participants were unaware of this basic critical media literacy fact about the commercial operations of Facebook. This inspired the recommendation for a broader focus on critical media literacy for youth, whose sociability and sense of citizenship are increasingly shaped by engagements on digital platforms.  "
pub.1102361736,Responsibility and Economics,"Empirically, responsibility is a concept increasingly made use of in order to address societal issues. The debate on corporate social responsibility and corporate citizenship is a case in point. At the same time, it is a concept mainstream economics has, so far, hardly touched on. The paper shows that the application of economic reasoning to the responsibility concept can instruct a twofold learning process: First, the very tradition of economics allows to better understand and elaborate the semantics of responsibility. Here, the paper develops the concept of ordo-responsibility that differentiates between the initial basic game and the related meta-games. The focus thus shifts to the rule-setting processes and rule-finding discourses for which the actors can accept governance responsibility and discourse responsibility, respectively. Second, the rational-choice analysis of the responsibility concept also produces important insights for main-stream economic theory. Building on a simple model that delineates the responsibility aptitude of an actor, the paper explains why standard economics tends to attribute the rule-setting function exclusively to state actors. Yet, as the underlying nation-state paradigm depends on social determinants that are not universally given, such economic theory shows a double blind spot. Against this backdrop, the paper sketches out how to broaden the conventional perspective and identifies policy recommendations for state actors and business corporations."

Currently, the organization of industrial enterprises digital production that produce complex science-intensive products is complicated by the differently of semantic data, the discrepancy of software systems, and requires a uniform integrated data management platform. Aim. The purpose of the article is to consider a systematic approach to the formation of a metaarchitecture of an information platform for the researched problem area with contradictory relations (a priori undetermined). Materials and methods. It is necessary to apply and to form certain sequence application of system modeling metalanguages, high-level programming according to the hierarchy rules of Chomsky’s generating languages and semantic logic (ontology) of the researched problem area. That provides a consistent reduction of the semantic properties of the problem area in their syntactic representations. It is proposed to use mathematical methods, system engineering methods, and Teamcenter PLM software for system modeling of approving design and technological documentation business process to CALS methodology. Results. The paper proposes a conceptual approach for the construction and development of a subject – oriented meta-architecture of the digital platform UIS. It is shown that to exclude existing contradictions in the problem area, it is necessary to design direct and reverse “workflows” models in the digital document management system. The results of the existing CASE methodology analysis for effective integration with the Teamcenter PLM system are presented. Conclusion. The system modeling proposed methodology extends the application of the metaarchitecture of the digital model UIS and allows evaluating of the software effectiveness."
pub.1173699272,TRAD: Enhancing LLM Agents with Step-Wise Thought Retrieval and Aligned Decision,"Several large language model (LLM) agents have been constructed for diverse purposes such as web navigation and online shopping, leveraging the broad knowledge and text comprehension capabilities of LLMs. Many of these works rely on in-context examples to achieve generalization without requiring fine-tuning. However, few have addressed the challenge of selecting and effectively utilizing these examples. Recent approaches have introduced trajectory-level retrieval with task meta-data and the use of trajectories as in-context examples to enhance overall performance in some sequential decision making tasks like computer control. Nevertheless, these methods face issues like plausible examples retrieved without task-specific state transition dynamics and long input with plenty of irrelevant context due to using complete trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (TRAD) to tackle these problems. TRAD first employs Thought Retrieval for step-level demonstration selection through thought matching, enhancing the quality of demonstrations and reducing irrelevant input noise. Then, Aligned Decision is introduced to complement retrieved demonstration steps with their preceding or subsequent steps, providing tolerance for imperfect thought and offering a balance between more context and less noise. Extensive experiments on ALFWorld and Mind2Web benchmarks demonstrate that TRAD not only surpasses state-of-the-art models but also effectively reduces noise and promotes generalization. Furthermore, TRAD has been deployed in real-world scenarios of a global business insurance company and yields an improved success rate of robotic process automation. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/skyriver-2000/TRAD-Official."

As a result, there is a requirement to safeguard data from being attacked in order to ensure secure data transfer through the network. Cryptography has been discovered to be a simple and efficient method for safeguarding healthcare big data. At the same time, in cryptography, the best key generation process is viewed as an optimization issue that may be addressed with meta-heuristic algorithms. As a result, the main focus of this research is on the investigation of health care data security in IoT using the ASS-JFO-DHEA model, which combines an innovative hybrid Artificial Shuffle Shepherd Integrated Jellyfish optimization (ASS-JFO) algorithm with Digital Homomorphism Elgamal Algorithm (DHEA) encryption for data security. MATLAB software is used to carry out the execution and experiments for this research. On different benchmark images from a healthcare dataset, the ASS-JFO-DHEA model is experimentally validated. The peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, encryption time, mean square error, and other metrics are used to assess the findings.The findings are compared and contrasted as a consequence of this execution, and a variety of encryption algorithms with their optimization techniques from the literature are recognized as having the most intense PSNR values, i.e., 74 dB, generated by the suggested approach."

pub.1155864521,Academic Publishing – An Annotated Inventory of Challenges and Chosen Pathways,"Context and Purpose: The increased focus of higher education institutions on research and – lately – on societal challenges and real-world problems, the importance of academic rankings for financing and international competitions and the research and publication oriented professional advancement criteria transformed academics into publishing hunters. The world of academic publishing is wild and dangerous, due to the massification of research. Aims and objectives are often confounded with means, quantity and quality (already difficult to assess) don’t always walk together, stakeholders have conflicting interests, the old linear models of publishing are replaced with intricate looped and interconnected ones, leading to academics publishing more and achieving less – especially from a societal perspective. The aim of the present study is to summarize the main challenges of the publishing process, together with the pathways chosen by academics to overcome these difficulties. Design/methodology: A meta-analysis of recent studies on academic publishing was performed, together with a nethnographic exploratory approach on publishing patterns in economics and business; informal talks with academics from business and economics fields from several Eastern EU higher education institutions were used, as well. Findings: The inventory of challenges includes individual factors (personality and individual morale, goals, knowledge and status, preferences and habits), institutional factors (university and strategy level), social structures and infrastructural level factors (open access, technological disruptive innovations, new social contract for research, preprints), as well as professional culture type of factors (peer-review issues and various biases, alternative research assessment methods, predatory journals, predatory informal rules). Several pathways chosen by academics were observed, leading to hypotheses formulation for future research.Limitations: The study is exploratory, based on a conventional sample of academics for the empirical part and has an emic, potentially subjective approach. Originality/value: The study touches a delicate and controversial subject – academic publishing – and brings together both positive and negative aspects for existent pathways, offering a ground for future research."

With over four billion pieces of content being created each day, keeping abreast of all that is happening far exceeds our capacity to do so. The business models of social media organizations and news outlets have been increasingly focused on giving people more of what they like, leading to echo chamber effects and making it easy to lose sight of the big picture [10].” In recent decades a shift to the knowledge society has been acknowledged, characterized by its ability to identify, create, process, transform, disseminate and use information to generate and use knowledge for the development of individuals [2]. In such a society, intellectual capital is considered to be the most important indicator of wealth, ahead of assets. The acquisition, application and creation of knowledge is more important to the knowledge society than the creation and consumption of information. In regards to knowledge society requirements this paper presents a conceptual knowledge discovery framework: User Interaction and Response-based Knowledge Discovery Framework – UIS-KDF. The framework introduces a meta-level approach for knowledge discovery system design principles."

pub.1132277477,Closing the gap between designers and developers in a low code ecosystem,"Nowadays, going digital is a must for a company to thrive and remain competitive. The digital transformation allows companies to react timely and adequately to the constantly evolving markets. This transformation is not without challenges. Among these is the growing demand for skilled software developers. Low-code platforms have risen to mitigate this pressure point by allowing people with non-programming backgrounds to craft digital systems capable of solving business relevant problems. Professional development teams are composed of many different profiles - product owners, analysts, UX and UI designers, front-end and back-end developers, among others. Market competition puts unprecedented demands on the collaboration of these professionals. Current methodologies provide tools and approaches for many of these types of collaboration. However, the reality of established industry practices for UX and UI designers collaborating with front-end developers, still leaves a lot to improve in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. This work developed an innovative approach using model transformation and meta-modelling techniques that drastically improves the efficiency of transforming UX/UI design artefacts into low-code web-technology. The approach has been applied to a recognized and established enterprise-grade low-code platform and evaluated in practice by a team of professional designers and front-end developers. Preliminary practical results show savings between 20 and 75% according to the project complexity in the effort invested by development teams in the above mentioned process."

pub.1053053503,Industrializing Data Integration Projects using a Metadata Driven Assembly Line,"Abstract Data integration is essential for the success of many enterprise business initiatives, but also a very significant contributor to the costs and risks of the IT projects supporting these initiatives. Highly skilled consultants and data stewards re-design the usage of data in business processes, define the target landscape and its data models, and map the current information landscape into the target landscape. Still, the largest part of a typical data integration effort is dedicated to the implementation of transformation, cleansing, and data validation logic in robust and highly performing commercial systems. This effort is simple and doesn´t demand skills beyond commercial product knowledge, but it is very labour-intensive and error prone. In this paper we describe a new commercial approach to data integration that helps to “industrialize” data integration projects and significantly lowers the amount of simple, but labour-intensive work. The key idea is that the target landscape for a data integration project has pre-defined data models and associated meta data which can be leveraged for building and automating the data integration process. This approach has been implemented in the context of the support of SAP consolidation projects and is used in some of the largest data integration projects world-wide.
Zusammenfassung Bei vielen Umstrukturierungsprojekten in Unternehmen spielt die Datenintegration eine entscheidende Rolle. In den zugehörigen IT Projekten sind ein signifikanter Teil der Kosten sowie des Projektrisikos auf Datenintegration zurückzuführen. Hochdotierte Berater und Datenverantwortliche gestalten die Verwendung der Daten in Geschäftsprozessen neu, definieren die zukünftige IT Landschaft und deren Datenmodelle, und erstellen Abbildungsvorschriften zwischen alten und neuen Anwendungssystemen. Trotzdem steckt ein Großteil des Aufwands von Datenintegrationsprojekten immer noch in der Implementierung von Transformationsvorschriften, Datenaufbereitungs- und Validierungslogik in hochperformanten kommerziellen Systemen. Diese Tätigkeiten sind relativ einfach und verlangen nur Kenntnisse in der eingesetzten Basissoftware. Jedoch sind diese Tätigkeiten arbeitsintensiv und fehleranfällig. In diesem Artikel beschreiben wir einen neuen kommerziellen Ansatz für Datenintegrationsprojekte, welcher diese “industrialisiert” und dabei die einfachen, aber fehleranfälligen Arbeitsschritte signifikant reduziert. Der Ansatz basiert auf der Ausnutzung von Datenmodellen und Metadaten der neuen Anwendungssysteme zur Automatisierung der Datenintegrationsprozesse und zur Generierung der den Prozessschritten zu Grunde liegenden Artefakte. Dieser Ansatz wurde zur Unterstützung von SAP Konsolidierungsprojekten entwickelt und wird derzeit in einigen der weltweit größten Datenintegrationsprojekten eingesetzt."
pub.1164873379,Houston We Have a Problem: How Debriefing Method Impacts Open Communication and the Depth of Team Reflexivity,"Team debriefings are structured interventions in which teams reflect on their past performance, adapt, and plan for future events. Results from meta-analyses indicate that team debriefings are effective in improving task performance (Keiser & Arthur, Journal of Applied Psychology, 106(7), 1007–1032, 2021, Journal of Business and Psychology, 37(5), 953–976, 2022; Tannenbaum & Cerasoli, Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 55(1), 231–245, 2013). Although far less often studied, there is also some evidence to suggest that team debriefings (compared to no debriefings) can be used to develop norms for open communication (Jarrett et al., Human Performance, 29(5), 408-427, 2016; Villado & Arthur, Journal of Applied Psychology, 98(3), 514-528, 2013). However, there is currently a dearth of quantitative evidence to guide practitioners in selecting from the myriad methods available to achieve this purpose. Grounded in theory and research on episodic models of team performance (Marks et al., Academy of Management Review, 26(3), 356-376, 2001) and the Motivated Information Processing in Groups model (MIP-G) (De Dreu et al., Personality and Social Psychology Review, 12(1), 22–49, 2008), we conducted a quasi-experiment which compared two debriefing methods. The first, a chronological debriefing, emphasizes outcome accountability and makes competitive interdependence salient, whereas the second method, Team Dimensional Training (TDT), emphasizes process accountability and makes cooperative interdependence salient. Data from 76 flight controllers at Johnson Space Center indicated that the communication climate in TDT debriefings was perceived to be more open than was the climate in chronological debriefings. Analyses of coded transcripts from 69 debriefings revealed that teams engaged in deeper reflexivity when the TDT method was used than they did when the chronological method was used."
pub.1170640363,Submission to Senate Judiciary Committee (June 2023) re Journalism Competition and Preservation Act,"Small, struggling, rural news publishers face serious difficulties, but JCPA is not the answer. It will not help the publishers that need it, and in the process it would terribly harm both our national commitment to competition and internet policy.First, news publishers’ problems have nothing to do with a lack of competition, and there is no monopsony at work here. It is fairly clear that the real problem is that new competition has been unkind to legacy business models. This is competition at work, not an anticompetitive practice.Second, Google and Meta are not linking and previewing news websites for free because the platforms are “news monopsonists” extracting infracompetitive prices for a good. They link and preview news websites for free because everyone can link and preview websites for free under our property laws. No website owner has a property right to prevent, or tax, linking to their website.Third, JCPA’s solution has nothing to do with the promotion of competition. It looks superficially like collective bargaining: a mechanism Congress has very occasionally and cautiously permitted. I do not think that Congress should hand out a cartel permit—antitrust’s equivalent of a license to kill—to some of the nation’s largest media conglomerates. Moreover, as JCPA now stands, the collective bargaining mechanism is an illusion. The real mechanism of action is an “arbitration” mechanism structured to produce a vast payment from Google and Meta (Facebook) that has nothing to do with any market outcome. That mechanism is troubling in many respects. Perhaps most shockingly, the arbitration payment will primarily be allocated to large media conglomerates, not to the struggling or rural news publishers that have been front and center in public campaigns for the bill. It is also worth noticing that the presence of an arbitrator completely eliminates the rationale previously offered for including big media companies in this bill at all.Ultimately, if Congress wants to subsidize local or failing news publishers, there are ways in which Congress might do so without giving a huge cash handout to successful media conglomerates."
pub.1110961946,Analysis of critical IT infrastructure designing problems for a ministry,"The problems of creating a critical IT infrastructure of the ministry are analyzed. The classic model of cloud services, which consists of three layers, is considered. It has been shown that the specificity of the tasks performed by the ministries (departments) puts the developer with increased requirements for reliability, safety, availability in the automation of their processes. As a result, it has been shown that the use of only these three layers to create a critical IT infrastructure of ministries (departments), even as a private cloud, is no longer sufficient. Several additional layers are proposed for the classical cloud service model, such as BaaS and XaaS. The first layer, Business as a Service (BaaS), includes automation of process management at the organizational level, including monitoring of performance indicators, analytical reports, data consolidation and centralized enterprise level integration. The second layer - everything as a service (XaaS), provides total automation of the industry level, including the introduction of industry standards, the automation of cross-integration of many enterprises. A further analysis of the developed model has been carried out and it has been determined that in order to create a single information space of the ministry (agencies) as an object of informatization with a critical IT infrastructure, it is necessary to put in its implementation a number of new possibilities. They stipulate the need to upgrade both the hardware infrastructure, both system and application software. Therefore, the creation of critical IT infrastructure with these capabilities requires the implementation of new specialized means of data transmission and storage of information. These tools are characterized by a number of key characteristics such as interactivity, multi-tieredness, heterogeneity, distribution, and dynamic modification of data structures during the lifecycle of critical IT infrastructure information systems in accordance with meta-models of the subject area based on metadata interpretation. All of the above points to the need to put into the model another GaaS last layer (the transition to global integration as a service). The last part of the article provides an analysis of the requirements for constructing a critical IT infrastructure."

But canvas are not considered in the stan-dard pre-defined development process but are considered in a special event-competition for rapid design in so-called Hackathon-competition, for example, in the Global Game Jam competition (GGJ) with a 48-hour game development cycle. A short period of time to design a game requires the same operational verification of the canvas of ethical dilemmas to reduce the risk of incorrect content of the game among beginner development teams. The analysis of the ethical dilemmas of the game was based on logic of the semiotic chain (sign - context - meaning - addressee), where each game object is a sign that in the specific context of the game narra-tive and player experience expresses meaning (meaning different connotations in terms of additional emotional, estimated, stylistic value of an object or phenomenon). The authors described GGJ-features in the form of diversifiers – optional restrictions that can be used by participants in their work so that their implementation in various variations can often create an innovative game. At the same time, it is noted that in research on design of computer games diversifiers are not given due attention as indicators of consumer requirements. Therefore, the purpose of the article was the inclusion of diversifiers in a canvas-oriented game design approach, which will take into account the effect of the short duration of the competition for the stability of the game design process. The proto-types of diversifiers in Hackathon-conditions of computer games design are presented. The structure of the diversifiers presented at two Hackathon contests (GGJ 2018 and GGJ 2019) was analyzed: five groups of diversifiers (sponsor, accessibility, art, sound, and design, narrative) with 64 diversifiers which were suggested to be grouped according to the “Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics” model and copyrighted works on the design of the game. It is shown that the use of canvas structures the development process, re-ducing the time to generate design ideas in the process of inventing game mechanics and dynamics, when the canvas can become a roadmap for making creative decisions when designing a game. They can be a convenient basis for automating the process of design-ing a paper prototyp"

The aim of the article is to study the forms of consumer integration in the new product development and commercialization process, particularly, systematize the forms of consumer interaction with the organization depending on the stage of new product development and commercialization process and continuity of interaction. The results of the analyses. Development of Internet technologies lead to the growing role of consumer in any organizational activity, making it more active and influential figure, even in the new product development and commercialization process. The study showed that involvement of consumers in the innovation process enable organization to create new products, which meet the needs of target audience better. Depending on the stage of new product development consumers can play different roles, facilitating decision-making process in the organization on each stage of the innovation process. However, the intensity of consumer integration still vary depending on the stage of innovation process, maximizing at the beginning and at the end of new product development. Proposed classification of the forms of consumer integration in the new product development and commercialization process may allow organization to gain valuable input from consumer depending on the duration of the interaction and the NPD stage. Provided digital tools may simplify the interaction process with consumer to transfer his explicit and implicit knowledge to innovation team of the organization. As a result, with the help of digital tools organization may closely listen to consumer while developing new products. At the same time, consumer will become co-creators of new products, fulfilling their inner needs. Conclusions and perspectives for  further research. The obtained results allow comprehensively assess the interaction between consumer and organization during new product development and commercialization process. This knowledge can serve as a basis for making informed decision about advisability of engaging consumer into the innovation process and supporting organisation to involve consumer with the help of innovative digital tools. A perspective area of further research suppose to be the systematization of digital tools to facilitate interaction between consumers and organization through innovation process. Also, potential scientific and practical interest would be found in improvement of the innovation process models, taking into account the new opportunities of involving consumers.

pub.1160225850,Towards a Metamodel for Service-Oriented Value Creation,"Today, the economy, society and politics are confronted with multiple challenges regarding the future of value creation. These challenges are: The simultaneity of hyper-individualized demand patterns, global challenges such as climate change, food shortage or energy security as well as opportunities and risks through digitalization. Available and sustainable service offerings that create value-in-use are one way to develop solutions towards these challenges. Yet, due to the challenges, their design is characterized by high complexity and requires a new quality of collaboration in multi-responsible actor constellations. Thus, we pose the following research question: How can we succeed in supporting the invention, innovation, and reliable delivery of smart service offerings in complex service-product systems?Modelling is a well-known approach to reduce complexity and enforce understanding as well as innovation in socio-technical systems. As such, our approach aims at developing a formal mathematical model of service-oriented value creation. It allows to model and subsequently simulate new service-oriented and sustainable value creation configurations. It supports strategic management decisions like partner selection but also helps to identify operational design tasks of the system (e. g., interface compatibility).We draw on three concepts as a bases for our model about service oriented value creation:1.A Service has three dimensions: Potential, process and output/outcome2.Complex service-product-system appear, when digital smartness is added. Digital service-product-systems encompass four layers: Infrastructure respectively products and database, digital service, personal service and coordination in the system.3.Business Modelling is oriented in three dimensions: Value proposition (promis making), value creation (promis keeping) and value capture (producing value as well as splitting costs and benefits) Framed by these concepts we locate the space where service-oriented value creation can enfold. The methodological approach to generate the formal model from these concepts combines grounded theory and practice research. Theoretical literature review in the field of service-oriented value creation provides a deductive way to identify model elements and mathematical relationships between them. Practice research follows an inductive argumentation to tune the model towards real-world requirements and challenges (e. g., data availability). Thereby, it relies on discursive transdisciplinary workshop procedures to fuse both parts. The project consortium includes social scientists, industrial engineers and computer scientists. Companies from three industries are involved as practical partners with their service offers or innovation ideas: Services for local public transport in rural areas, services to promote transparency in project management in the construction industry and services to place additive manufacturing products as a service in medical markets."

The “Apple(s) from the Alpes” case presents a constructivist experiment This research which aims looks for to provide conceptual research and operational concepts. Research took place in thought and action in a complex environment dealing with small farm-firms and their business partners. The strategic small farm-firm is a project oriented model of the agronomic meaning of farm-firm. The product/territory couple is a project oriented model of local produce which results from interactive links between human beings work, soil and climate in order to obtain an agricultural product. The farm-firm attempts to overcome the crisis affecting its objectives and legitimacy. Because small-firms do not have enough resources they are obliged to cooperate. The product/territory couple illustrates a strategic approach representing a cohesion process between individual and collective projects. This strategic process between individual and collective projects. This strategic process is based on “meta-rules”.

Over the past decades the construct of learning agility has attracted considerable attention from human-resource professionals and consultants interested in talent identification. Organizations have then incorporated the construct into their model of high-potential selection and leadership development, and the term is becoming embedded into the talent-management (TM) lexicon. The specific contribution of the current systematic review is to provide a rigorous critique of the existing literature about learning agility and its applications to talent management, focusing on definition, measurement, and operationalization of the construct. In addition, the relationships between learning agility and other talent management constructs have been also investigated. A literature search on Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was performed. The review process has followed the international Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. The initial search identified 250 titles. Fifty-two studies were assessed, and 10 empirical studies (qualitative and quantitative) were considered eligible. Despite the extensive usage of learning agility in organizations, the academic community only recently has become interested in studying the construct. TM research reinforced the importance of learning agility as a key indicator of potential, highlighting learning and growth competences as central components of potential. Nevertheless, a scientific approach to the concept remains still limited. Limitations, practical implications, and directions for future research are also discussed."

Business incubators established by European Space Agency (ESA) and similar entities are evidence of the need of moving initiatives to small companies characterized by greater flexibility to develop specific activities. Software is a key component in most aerospace projects, and the success of the initiatives and projects usually depends on the capability of developing reliable software following well-defined standards. But small entities face some difficulties when adopting software development standards that have been conceived thinking on larger organizations and big programs. The need of defining software development standards tailored to small companies and groups is a permanent subject of discussion not only in the aerospace field, and has led in recent years to the publication of the ISO/IEC 29110 series of systems and software engineering standards and guides, aimed to solve the issues that Very Small Entities (VSEs) () – settings having up to twenty-five people -, found with other standards like CMMI® or SPICE. This paper discusses the tailoring defined by different aerospace organizations for VSEs in the aerospace industry, and presents a conceptual arrangement of the standard based on meta-modeling languages that allow the extension and full customization with the incorporation of specific software engineering requirements and practices from ECSS (European Cooperation for Space Standardization)."
pub.1040529325,An Epistemology of Organizational Emergence: The Tripartite Domains of Organizational Discourse and the Servitization of IBM,"This paper draws from 21 years of discourse to examine a narrative about IBM’s transition to a service-oriented company. Covering three leadership eras during a period of sweeping change for IBM and the information technology industry, this discourse, found in the IBM Corporation’s annual reports, in illustrates the emergence of policy, technology, and business models in one of the largest and most influential IT companies in the world. Our purpose in drawing from these texts is twofold: (1) to provide a more thorough discussion of the notion of “emergence” in IT organizational settings, and (2) to introduce a fuller process model of how emergence is manifest in organizational discourse than is currently present.In much of the information systems literature, the term emergence has been informally used in describing organizational contexts and the process of IS development (Markus and Robey 1988; Orlikowski 1996; Pfeffer and Leblebici, 1977). In three papers, Truex and his colleagues formally describe and situate a theory of emergence in the discourse on ISD methods (Truex and Baskerville 1998, Truex, Baskerville, and Klein 1999; Truex, Baskerville, and Travis 2000). They liken ISD to “emergent grammars” in a linguistic system. However, they stop short of developing a full epistemology of the notion and provide little more than analogical and descriptive examples grounded in linguist Paul Hopper’s (1987, 1988) emergent grammar hypothesis. The incomplete development of the epistemology and an ontology of the emergence construct has proven problematic for scholars attempting to apply emergence theory in practice (Bello et al. 2002). While researchers or practitioners might find the idea of emergent organizations inviting, without descriptive and explanatory models, the concept is difficult to use in the practice or study of information systems. Accordingly, this paper seeks to contribute to the development of a theory of emergence.We draw from the organizational communication and organizational discourse literature. In a subset of this community, scholars have advanced theories on the nature of organization as a discursive construction. For them, discourse is the very foundation on which “organization” is built (Fairhurst and Putnam 2004; Heracleous 2006; Heracleous and Barrett 2001; Taylor and Robichaud 2004; Taylor and Van Every 2000). Using this meta-theoretical framework, we explore how emergence arises through an examination of IBM’s annual reports and industry-level discourses, which were, in turn, influenced in part by the IBM declarations and subsequent behavioral changes.We introduce a new process model of organizational emergence by extending and addressing shortcomings in a set of current perspectives in the literature. The tripartite domain model identifies three domains—context, task, and negotiation-at-hand—as integral components of any concrete occurrence of discourse. To test its efficacy, we apply the tripartite domain model post ho"

Longevity requires sustainability - economically, environmentally and last but not least in terms of usability. Sustainability therefore requires continuous change. In this talk we look at handling requirements, models, and implementations in a model-driven formal way that lends itself to a more systematic change tracking than 'traditional' software development approaches and languages, but that also crosses boundaries of software-controlled physical equipment models (so-called cyber-physical systems), distributed digital control (networked systems) and software services. The industry is currently seeing a rapid development of cyber-physical system products. The systems that are developed have increasing demands of sustainability, dependability and usability. Moreover, lead time and cost efficiency continue to be essential for industry competitiveness. Extensive use of modeling and simulation - Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools - throughout the value chain and system life-cycle is one of the most important ways to effectively target these challenges. Simultaneously there is an increased interest in open source tools that allow more control of tool features and support, and increased cooperation and shared access to knowledge and innovations between organizations. In this talk we briefly present technology and open source tooling for MBSE based on the Modelica and UML standards, supported by tools such as OpenModelica and Papyrus respectively. Modelica is a modern, strongly typed, declarative, equation-based, and object-oriented language for modeling and simulation of complex cyber-physical systems, whereas UML is a wide-spread industrial standard for software modeling. We present the OpenModelica open source MBSE environment including the ModelicaML Eclipse plug-in integrating Modelica and UML, covering the development process starting from business processes, via requirements, to models, which can be compiled to simulations or to product code. An important question is whether a particular system design fulfills or violates requirements that are imposed on the system under development. We give examples of case studies starting with natural-language requirements and show briefly how they are translated into models. Then, designs and verification scenarios are modeled, and simulation models are composed and simulated automatically. The simulation results produced can then be used to draw conclusions on requirement fulfillment. Other features of the environment are meta modeling for efficient model transformations, the Functional Mockup Interface for general tool integration, model-based optimization, as well as generation of parallel code for multi-core architectures."

Towards imperfect “communitarian capitalism”","We consider the nature of local production systems as a complex institutional form of coordination of the division of labor between firms as growing interrelations mediated by cognitve resources transferable by sharing internal/external competences. In this way emerge a process of internalization of competences thorought an evolutionary networking oriented to the efficiency of the system and not simply of single units. Our analysis is oriented to describe the peculiarity of the institutional system in the case of North East industrial districts. We assumes the North East industrial economy evolves on the basis of differentiated learning capacities, according to a complex system of economic and social relations encouraging the circulation of useful knowledge and information for economic growth and expanding both base of industrial leadership and spillover chain. The North East economy is well described in terms of a Multilevel Neural Network. This approach tends to revaluate local contexts as specific and active box of innovation resources, over simple considerations as factors of localisation, in other words a bridge between local and global resources. Learning processes and institutional contexts are variables that often seem to bind together economic and social factors. The orientation towards growth and innovation is due to the peculiarity of relationships based system existing in the district area, regarding the prevalent system (albeit incomplete) of learning strategies of both firms and institutions. This system is multi-purpose and oriented to produce through processes of both activities, self-coordination and self-learning. We have identified the “generator” of growth as meta-organisers. They comprise two classes of co-operators, not necessary alternative: innovative firms (as specialists, connectors, generators) and local institutions (private and public agents, or sub-systems of institutions), involved directly or indirectly in the process of innovation and/or to reduce costs of operations. In the last part of work we will show a simple model of differentiation of some industrial districts in North East of Italy: more efficient is the district with high level of intermediate institutions (private as firms and public as local authority and infrastructure) and with more large base of SMEs leadership. Two main forms of district emerge: the evolutionary district (for example, as Montebelluna specialised on ski-shoes business) and non evolutionary ones (adaptive district) (for example, as Maniago specialised on knives business), where we find a really limited base of leadership and constraints to enlarge division of labor between firms. We shall consider some elements related to district economies and their evolution as far as regulations are concerned, in order to show that the North East’s model of development is a peculiar form of “communitarian or social capitalism” for some aspects analogous to that of the Rhine area (a clear form of “c"

With the rapid development of technologies associated with the IRS, there is a need to examine the extant literature related to its advancement. This study reviewed the literature on the IRS, particularly on the methods and gaps in developing the IRS. Specifically, it aimed to synthesize IRS methods implementation, including frameworks and recommendations for future studies from articles ranging from 1997 to 2022 using a methodological review. The methodological review followed the 2020 Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and only considered indexed articles from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). The publications showed momentum in 2018 onwards. The authors working in IRS were mainly from China, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. Besides the IRS, the recent leading theme is its application in the medical field. However, it should be noted that most articles mentioned that the IRS’s applications cut across other areas, including business and social sciences. Regarding the query presentation and indexing methodology, though the Vector Space was the most frequently used method, the probabilistic approach was the most widely used method for different applications. Meanwhile, for the matching process, the leading techniques were ranking-based, semantic approach, and ontology-based. For future works, researchers can work on checking assumptions, model or method accuracy, and parameter tuning for enhancement of IRS. Integrating user information, domain knowledge, rich thesauri, and other contextual information was strongly recommended by existing research."
pub.1136819983,An effective meta-heuristic based multi-objective hybrid optimization method for workflow scheduling in cloud computing environment,"Cloud computing is an emerging distributed computing model that offers computational capability over internet. Cloud provides a huge level collection of powerful and scalable computational resources for computation and data-intensive large scale workflow deployment. For business as well as scientific applications, optimal scheduling of workflow is emerged as a major concern. Optimization of scheduling process leads to the reduction of execution time, cost, etc. So, this paper presents an enhanced recent ant-lion optimization (ALO) algorithm hybridized with popular particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize a workflow scheduling specifically for cloud. A security approach called Data Encryption Standard (DES) is used for encoding the cloud information while scheduling is carried out. The research aims to contribute an enhanced workflow scheduling more safely than the existing frameworks. Enhancement procedures are evaluated in terms of cost, load, and makespan. The simulation procedures are done by utilizing the CloudSim tool. The proposed hybrid optimization results contrasted with well-known existing approaches. The existing round-robin (RR), ALO and PSO methods are selected to compare and identify the potency of the proposed system. The outcomes indicated that the proposed technique minimizes the cost by 9.8% of GA-PSO, 10% of PSO, 20% of ALO, 30% of RR and 12% of GA. Load balancing and makespan of the proposed method reduces by 8% than GA-PSO, 10% than ALO, 20% than PSO, 35% than RR and 45% than GA.

With the substantial increase in scale and complexity of network-based information systems, the uncertain user requirements from the Internet and personalized application requirement result in the frequent change for the software requirement. Meanwhile, the software system with non self-possessed resource become more and more complex. Furthermore, the interaction and cooperation requirement between software units and running environment in service computing increase the complexity of software systems. The software systems with complex system characteristics are developing into the “Networked Software” with characteristics of change-on-demand and change-with-cooperation. The concepts “programming”, “compiling” and “running” of software in common sense are extended from “desktop” to “network”. The core issue of software engineering is moving to the requirement engineering, which becomes the research focus of complex system software engineering.In this paper, we present the software network view based on complex system theory, and the concept of networked software and networked requirement. We propose the challenge problem in the research of emergence computation of networked software requirement. A hierarchical & cooperative unified requirement modeling framework URF (Unified Requirement Framework) and related RGPS (Role, Goal, Process and Service) meta-models are proposed. Five scales and the evolutionary growth mechanism in requirement emergence computation of networked software are given with focus on user-dominant and domain-oriented requirement, and the rules and predictability in requirement emergence computation are analyzed. A case study in the application of networked e-Business with evolutionary growth based on State design pattern is presented in the end."
pub.1158631895,Meta-heuristic endured deep learning model for big data classification: image analytics,"Image processing is currently developing as a unique and the inventive field in computer research and applications in the modern area. Most image processing algorithms produce a large quantity of data as an outcome, which is termed as Big-data. These algorithms process and store bulky information either as structured or unstructured data. The use of big data analytics to mine the data produced by image processing technology has huge potential in areas like education, governments, medical establishments, production units, finance and banking, and retail business centers. This paper well defined the innovations made in Big Data analytics and image processing. In this study, a novel data classification approach especially for image analytics is proposed. To improve image quality, pre-processing is applied to huge data that has been gathered. Then, most relevant features like spatial information, texture GLCM, and color and shape features are extracted from the pre-processed image. Since the dimensions of the features are huge in size, an adaptive map-reduce framework with Improved Shannon Entropy has been introduced to lessen the dimensionality of the extracted features. Then, in the big data classification phase, an optimized deep learning classifier deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is introduced to classify the images accurately. The weight function of the DCNN is fine-tuned using the newly proposed dragonfly updated mothsearch (DAUMS) Algorithm to enhance the classification accuracy and to solve the optimization problems of the research work. The moth search algorithm and dragonfly algorithm are both concepts in this hybrid algorithm DAUMS."
pub.1148454276,Multi-strategy hybrid heuristic algorithm for single container weakly heterogeneous loading problem,"Three-dimensional single container weakly heterogeneous loading problem is one of the most classical tasks which has various applications in manufacture and logistics industry. Solving this problem could improve transportation efficiency to bring great benefit to shipping customers. During the last two decades, many heuristic, meta-heuristic and hybrid algorithms have been proposed to maximize container volume utilization to reduce the waste of container space significantly. Despite their success in many real-world applications, it is still a challenging task to recommend satisfactory loading levels within a limited time frame when clients approach for options of different combinations of shipping items. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-strategy hybrid heuristic algorithm to achieve timely planning for clients in a required short time frame. In specific, a probabilistic model is used to combine the strength of two optimization strategies, i.e. an ant colony method and a constructive greedy method, to speed up the optimization process and ensure better convergence. In addition, a tree pruning strategy is designed to further improve the efficiency of the hybrid heuristic algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of both volume utilization rate and algorithm processing speed compared to state-of-the-art methods. Based on the comparison results by using BR dataset, we achieved averagely 94.31% volume utilization rate and 50.16 s processing speed, which is the best performance by considering both algorithm effectiveness and efficiency. Further, our proposed method has been deployed in a real business case to provide plan solutions to individual customer shipping requests and achieved high customer satisfaction rate."

They encourage them to search for new effective management tools and change the management paradigm in general. Under these circumstances, managing the development of an enterprise is an extremely challenging task for managers at all levels of management, as only those enterprises that are able to adapt their management system to new challenges and opportunities to improve performance will be able to survive. The modification of the basic elements of the management process is closely of the fundamental change in the defining parameters of the environment and the formation of new realities of business. The BANI world order requires the management of enterprises to develop new management models that would ensure rapid adaptation to new circumstances. The BANI world is an extremely unstable world order in which changes are chaotic under the influence of global systemic changes, and technology development is occurring at an extremely rapid pace. In order to survive in the BANI world, a business entity needs to adapt and reorient quickly, be flexible and anti-fragile, think non-linearly, and form emotional supports, including developing empathy and emotional intelligence. In this regard, the modern management paradigm should be based on a systemic and situational approach to management and managerial art. The main principles of effective work of a modern manager in the BANI world are: flexibility and adaptability; innovation; risk-orientation; dynamism; efficiency; complexity; stress resistance; care for the interests of society and environmental protection; impartiality of thinking. The most effective tools for ensuring the effective functioning of enterprises in the BANI world order are the Agile-approach, design thinking technology, and value approach. Changing business conditions require modern managers to have not only traditional ""hard skills"" and ""soft skills"" but also ""meta skills"". The main qualities required of a modern manager are adaptability; critical and creative thinking; empathy; high emotional and social intelligence; creativity; ability to build horizontal relationships with employees; and the ability to make informed management decisions in the face of limited information.

pub.1119399168,Traceability as an integral part of supply chain logistics management: an analytical review,"Purpose: Supply chain has become very complex today. There are multiple
stakeholders at various points. All these stakeholders need to collaborate with
each other in multiple directions for its effective and efficient management.
The manufacturers need proper information and data about the product location,
its processing history, raw materials, etc at each point so as to control the
production process. Companies need to develop global and effective strategies
to sustain in the competitive market. Logistics helps companies to implement
the effectiveness across the business supply chain from source to destination
to achieve their strategic goals. Traceability has become one of the integrated
parts of the supply chain logistics management that track and trace the
product's information in upstream and downstream at each point. All the
stakeholders in the supply chain have different objectives to implement the
traceability solution that depends on their role (e.g. manufacturers,
distributers or wholesalers have their own role). The information generated and
needed from all these actors are also different and are to be shared among all
to run the supply chain smoothly. But the stakeholders don't want to share all
the information with other stake holders which is a major challenge to be
addressed in current traceability solutions. The purpose of this research is to
conduct thorough study of the literatures available on the traceability
solutions, finding the gaps and recommending our views to enhance the
collaborations among the stakeholders in every point of the business supply
chain. The study will be helpful for further researchers to propose a
traceability meta-model to address the gaps. Design/methodology/approach: The
relevant literatures with keywords supply chain management, traceability,
logistics management are searched from the trusted database. The scope and the
objectives of the research is set based on which the papers are filtered as per
the titles and abstract. Proper analyses of the screened papers are done and
the recommendations are given. Findings: Traceability solution is popular among
the industries since a long for their supply chain management. After proper
analysis of the available literatures about the traceability solution the
industries use, this research will identify the gaps based on which we give the
proper recommendations and perspectives of our work."

However, contemporary academic bias towards a particular aspect of port sustainable governance practice leads to publication results fragmentation and difficulty in a collective assessment of the conclusions. The lack of holistic research endeavors to port sustainable governance practices hinders the identification of organized, specific, and goal-oriented factors indispensable for coherently directing ports to sustainable and green transitions. In order to bridge the identified gap, this paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of 278 scientific articles on the emerging green port governance concept in the maritime industry, published in 113 academic outlets, authored by 695 scholars, and obtained from the world’s most reputable scientific database—ISI Web of Science. The conducted meta-analysis via HistCite software revealed the most prestigious academic institutions, the most prominent scientific journals, the most impactful scientific articles, and the most influential scholars. The bibliographic coupling methodology via Bibliometrix tool in R software indicated five concurrent research streams on the basis of the top 10% of the scientific articles: (1) Adoption of contextualized models of port governance reform as a consequence of port multi-scalar embeddedness forces and institutional stretching; (2) Fostering port sustainability competitiveness via extended resource pools in terms of dry ports coupling; (3) The digitalization role of information systems regarding the interaction between transport, infrastructure, and institutional management in ports; (4) Assessment and innovation in seaport competition policies for the integration of green and sustainable operations; and (5) Conceptual development and awareness raising of port management practices on account of CO2 evidence-based policies regarding port terminals. The application of co-citation analysis methodology revealed future research directions within the five concurrent research streams on the basis of the top 5% trending scientific articles. The detailed content analysis assesses the scientific mapping of future research directions via the structural associations of the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. The cause-and-effect relationships of the structural associations of the DPSIR framework possess the possibility of providing substantial insights into the most influential factor identification regarding the development of green port governance models and self-assessment toolkits."
pub.1002572264,"Policy, entrepreneurship, creativity and sustainability: The case of ‘Principi Attivi’ (‘Active Ingredients’) in Apulia Region (southern Italy)","The present work assesses the case of ‘Principi Attivi’ (‘Active Ingredients’). This is a policy initiative of the Apulia Region in southern Italy to support new start-ups of young entrepreneurs. Since 2010, the year of green revolution 2.0, entrepreneurship remains active and competitive in the globalised world through sustainable innovation initiatives. If innovation is the successful implementation of new ideas, then creativity can be seen as the seed of innovation. Inspired by these arguments and the case of Principi Attivi (‘Active Ingredients’), the present work adds new insights to the current debate and investigates the relationships between creativity and sustainability from supply and demand side perspectives. In particular, this paper addresses the following aims: i) On the demand side, we question how creativity relates to sustainability through entrepreneurship. To reach this aim we employ a cluster analysis and a network meta-analysis (NMA) approach to determine the existence of latent relationships between creativity and sustainability within the project proposals submitted to ‘Principi Attivi’ (‘Active Ingredients’). ii) To understand, on the demand side, what are the main factors affecting the allocation of regional funding for young entrepreneurs; and iii) To determine, on the supply side, to what extent creativity and sustainability proposals influence the outcome of the selection process. To reach aims ii) and iii) we use a probabilistic model to infer data on the probability of project proposals to be admitted to regional funding. Main results suggests: (i) the existence of latent relationships between creativity and sustainability in business initiatives; (ii) the potential propensity of the decision maker to support ‘green’ entrepreneurship and larger groups of young entrepreneurs; (iii) the limited influence (almost non-existent) on the decision maker of creativity and sustainability proposals during the evaluation process. The present work point us to assert the persistence of asymmetric information between the young entrepreneur and the policy maker. Adequate initiatives are needed to close this gap to help foster creativity and sustainability-driven entrepreneurship."

pub.1147243567,Patent Trolls: In Search of Efficient Regulatory Standards,"
                    Current concerns about the growth of patent assertion entities (PAEs) are typically related to their presumed anti-competitive behaviour and negative impact on innovation in product and technology markets. Regulators, required to balance the legitimate interests of patent holders and licensees, call for evidentiary standards to efficiently appraise, and for the purpose of policy formulation, prejudge the reasonableness and welfare consequences of these undertakings. And yet, recent economic analyses still seem far from offering operational criteria that could translate into enforceable, let alone efficient, regulatory norms.
                  
                  
                    And so, case analysis, particularly in the US context, turns into an ordeal trying to tweak the facts of these fairly new business models to suit time-honoured legal principles. Plainly, PAE efforts in general do not seem to be easily caught by US competition rules that assign antitrust liability based on harm to competition and the competitive process. This is not to suggest that they are pro-competitive per se but, rather, that any attack on them may give rise to ‘administratively hopeless, but generally exculpating, rule of reason defence’. It may be for that reason that US judicial, federal and state reforms – for better or for worse – have begun to target some of the leverage points and key drivers of the PAE business model.The welfare consequences of reduced IP enforcement will still need to be established.
                  
                  
                    The EU Commission expects PAEs to be less active in Europe because of the loser pays principle in European courts, the smaller damage awards offered in successful cases, and because of the higher degree of predictability of outcomes in European specialist patent courts. Yet, similar to the US context, EU regulators are faced with the dilemma of devising standards that fit a variety of circumstances and yet can be easily applied. In both cases, regulatory delegation avoids the pitfalls of ordering complexities centrally. But it requires a set of simple meta-rules to guide lower-level decisions, adjust principles to circumstance and keep matters predictable. Delegation in the area of competition policy is limited by the adequacy of the economic reference that it employs. At this stage, in dealing with outsourced patent assertion and related licensing conditions, economic theory offers a wide yet insufficient menu of advice.
                  
                  
                    The article has four parts: Section 1 discusses patent trends, actors, rights and obligations, and the nature of current regulatory concerns. Section 2 reviews the scant empirical analyses and model work on patent trolls. Section 3 examines regulatory concerns in view of US antitrust standards and lists alternative remedies. Section 4 concludes and offers some considerations related to the European context. "
pub.1159787704,The establishment of transactive memory system in distributed agile teams engaged in AI-related knowledge work," Purpose As a kind of knowledge-intensive team coordinated across physical distance, it is necessary to construct a meta-knowledge driven transactive memory system (TMS) for the knowledge management of distributed agile team (DAT). This study aims to explore the comprehensive antecedents of TMS establishment in DATs and considers how TMS establishment is affected by herding behavior under the artificial intelligence (AI)-related knowledge work environment that emerges with technology penetration.   Design/methodology/approach The data derived from 177 students of 52 DATs in a well-known Chinese business school, which were divided into 26 traditional knowledge work groups and 26 AI-related task groups to conduct a random comparative experiment. The ordinary least squares method was used to analyze the conceptual model and ANOVA was used to examine the differences in herding behavior between the control groups (traditional knowledge work DATs) and treatment groups (DATs engaged in AI-related knowledge work).   Findings The results showed that knowledge diversity, professional knowledge, self-efficacy and social system use had significantly positive effects on the establishment of TMS. Interestingly, the authors also find that herding behavior may promote the process of establishing TMS of the new team, and this effect will be more significant when AI tasks are involved in team knowledge work.   Originality/value By exploring the comprehensive antecedents of the establishment of TMS, this study provided a theoretical basis for knowledge management of DATs, especially in AI knowledge work teams. From a practical perspective, when the DAT is involved in AI-related knowledge works, managers should appropriately guide the convergence of employees’ behaviors and use the herding effects to accelerate the establishment of TMS, which will improve team knowledge sharing and innovation.

pub.1019170250,A Harmony Search Approach for the Selective Pick-Up and Delivery Problem with Delayed Drop-Off,"In the last years freight transportation has undergone a sharp increase in the scales of its underlying processes and protocols mainly due to the ever-growing community of users and the increasing number of on-line shopping stores. Furthermore, when dealing with the last stage of the shipping chain an additional component of complexity enters the picture as a result of the fixed availability of the destination of the good to be delivered. As such, business opening hours and daily work schedules often clash with the delivery times programmed by couriers along their routes. In case of conflict, the courier must come to an arrangement with the destination of the package to be delivered or, alternatively, drop it off at a local depot to let the destination pick it up at his/her time convenience. In this context this paper will formulate a variant of the so-called courier problem under economic profitability criteria including the cost penalty derived from the delayed drop-off. In this context, if the courier delivers the package to its intended destination before its associated deadline, he is paid a reward. However, if he misses to deliver in time, the courier may still deliver it at the destination depending on its availability or, alternatively, drop it off at the local depot assuming a certain cost. The manuscript will formulate the mathematical optimization problem that models this logistics process and solve it efficiently by means of the Harmony Search algorithm. A simulation benchmark will be discussed to validate the solutions provided by this meta-heuristic solver and to compare its performance to other algorithmic counterparts."
pub.1175984458,Examination of the Role of Ethics-Based Auditing in the Development of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (Case Study: Auditing Firms in Tehran),"Objective: The study aims to examine the role of ethics-based auditing in the development of trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) within auditing firms based in Tehran. Methodology: The research is applied in its objective and descriptive-survey in its execution. The study utilizes thematic content analysis to identify the necessity and importance of the research. A meta-analysis is conducted to review the literature. In-depth interviews with experts were carried out until theoretical saturation was achieved, followed by data coding. The model was tested using structural-interpretive equations and a questionnaire as tools to apply the research findings to the studied population. The sample includes managers of auditing firms in Tehran, selected using the snowball sampling method. Data were collected using both open and closed questionnaires and structured interviews. Findings: The study identified 14 key indicators of ethics-based auditing influencing the development of trustworthy AI, including technical issues, organizational complexity, legal issues, increased transparency, reduced information asymmetry, stakeholder participation and cooperation, decentralization, ease of traceability, trustworthiness, infrastructure, real-time accounting, audit data security, flexibility, and cybersecurity. These indicators were categorized into four groups based on their influence power and dependency: independent, linkage, autonomous, and dependent variables. Conclusion: The findings suggest that ethics-based auditing can significantly influence the development of trustworthy AI in auditing firms. From an agency theory perspective, blockchain technology and AI increase the difficulty of data manipulation and enhance process automation, improving transparency and reducing fraud. From a stakeholder theory perspective, blockchain technology promotes an open and inclusive environment, enhancing collaboration and business opportunities. The integration of blockchain and AI in accounting practices can meet the diverse needs of different users, improving trust and reliability in financial reporting."
pub.1054063484,"Indian Companies in Overseas Markets: Perspectives, Patterns, and Implications","During the previous decade, the nature and dynamics of Indian companies' engagement with the overseas markets have gone through a shift. Overseas expansion and competitiveness are increasingly dependent on firm level capabilities rather than on national endowments in traditional products or commodities. Two meta-trends are driving the presence, growth, and competitiveness of Indian companies in overseas markets. One, the process of liberalization and globalization of Indian economy has led to the development of competitive capabilities by Indian companies and has brought about intensive interaction with global corporations, professionals, capital, ideas, and practices. Two, the transforming impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on the world of business has resulted in the emergence of new types of businesses and new ways of organizing. The context and timing bestow Indian companies with a set of advantages and challenges. This panel discussion has the benefit of six cogent contributions-from academics who have intimately researched the phenomenon to practitioners who have led their organizations and have created substantial presence in overseas markets. Some of the major patterns and conclusions that the colloquium converges upon are as follows: From comparative to competitive advantage: With shift towards advantages based on availability, lower cost and skills of the technical and scientific manpower, Indian companies' need to create complementary skills and the success are governed by competencies developed within a company and aspirations of its top management. Favourable ‘push’ and ‘pull’ conditions for overseas successes: For an increasing number of industries, Indian companies are reaching the point of having global advantages-favourable factor conditions, domestic demand characteristics comparable to that overseas, presence of ancillary and supportive skills, and pervasive confidence for looking beyond domestic markets. On the ‘pull’ side, from the situation of Indian origin being a handicap, the world has come to acknowledge ‘India advantage.’ Three strategy types for Indian companies in overseas markets: ‘Outsourcing,’ where the domestic market is either very small or unattractive; ‘Internationalization,’ where companies are aiming to expand market or balance business downturns and risks of domestic market; and, ‘Multinationalization,’ where companies are aiming to create sustainable competitive position in several geographies. Differing requirements of the institutional and the retail customers: Joint ventures are generally not viable for institutional customers, while being a useful option for reaching the latter-with benefits related to local knowledge, capital, brand, and distribution. Organizing for growth and capability building: Structure for the three strategy types is different and a ‘dual-core’ model could balance requirements of risk-taking in new areas with efficiency in stabilized activities.

pub.1000188430,"Knowledge investments, business R&D and innovativeness of countries: A qualitative meta-analytic comparison","The relationship between knowledge investments, innovation and competitiveness is an important topic in both academic research and economic policy and has been studied extensively over the past decades. Nowadays, investments in private and public R&D are believed to make up the heart of a modern knowledge economy. The present paper adopts an evolutionary economics perspective and investigates whether, in addition to private R&D activities, also institutional support systems and policy interventions play a role in inducing innovation initiatives and creating impacts on the performance and competitiveness of industries. We aim to find support for the hypothesis that the competitiveness of industries in the international arena is sustained by the dynamic interaction between national, regional and sectoral innovation systems. This may provide stakeholders with a better understanding of the context in which they operate. Since according to the evolutionary metaphor, the growth of an innovation system follows complex dynamics that cannot simply be analysed within a static quantitative equilibrium framework, we use here an alternative approach based on qualitative pattern recognition analysis originating from artificial intelligence analysis. Besides R&D expenditures, human capital expenditures are regarded as the major input in the knowledge creation process in our analytical framework. To this end, in our paper a qualitative causal model that maps out conditional relations between key factors in national innovation systems will be described. The focus of our investigation is on systematic patterns in the competitiveness of the EU Member States, using statistical information on innovation input and output data from the European Innovation Scoreboard. In our analysis we find support for the hypothesis that there are indeed significant interactions between distinct institutional levels, which may provide guidance to the strategic orientation of nations and the European Union in terms of the emphasis on competitiveness vis-à-vis cohesion."

pub.1138641060,On Sustainability,"This thesis studies sustainability at the organizational level in the field of business and management research. It explores different aspects of the subject with two complementary essays: the first essay develops a theoretical model to explicate the interactions on the environmental-economic intersection of sustainability in the private sector; the second essay designs a strategic supply chain framework to enable sustainable practices for social value creation in the humanitarian sector. The purpose that motivates both essays is to ground the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in contexts and develop practically relevant knowledge in sustainability research that is readily translatable into actionable solutions.Essay 1, Green Competitiveness, studies the environmental-economic intersection of corporate sustainability. It develops an intermediate theory of green competitiveness (GC) on the nexus’ context-contingent interactions. The rationale underpinning the study is that a pragmatic approach aligning environmental protection with business’ economic logic can be more effective in driving and sustaining corporate green practices. The project’s mixed-methods design takes three phases: (1). Phase 1 – systematic literature review retrieves and identifies 171 relevant and quality academic articles on the topic of GC; (2). Phase 2 – quasi meta-analysis codes and categorizes the dataset by research characteristics to quantify empirical evidence for data-driven theorizing; (3). Phase 3 – abductive reasoning develops progressively six moderated-mediated propositions through a rigorous and replicable process of hypothesis generation, refinement, evaluation, and acceptance. Also proposed in conjunction with the preliminary GC theoretical model are a new green typology, an intermediate construct of GC, and four concepts of key contextual contingencies. Together, they elevate the GC research stream from a nascent to an intermediate theory. During the theory development process, the essay also makes three peripheral contributions that address the following research gaps in the existing literature: (1). The G-C logic chain designed to support abductive reasoning can serve as a coherent framework to integrate fragmented studies on different subdimensional environmental-economic (G-C) relations; (2). The extensive list of measures for green and competitiveness can be used to improve consistency and validity of construct operationalization in future GC studies; and (3). The holistic organizational performance framework (HOPF) designed for hypothesis evaluation can be refined into a theoretical model for sustainability research. Academics interested in furthering GC research may consider the essay’s recommendations to (1). Go beyond the construct level to examine specific G-C subdimensional links with strong theoretical matching and proximal causal connection; (2). Limit the study to a single sector or region if the key contextual contingencies cannot be measure"

pub.1172828828,A Systematic Review of the UTAUT and UTAUT2 Among K-12 Educators,"Aim/Purpose: The purpose of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the application of UTAUT and UTAUT2 frameworks in K-12 education. Background: This study included an analysis of peer-reviewed empirical studies that use the UTAUT and UTAUT2 frameworks to understand the factors that influence technology adoption among K-12 educators. New constructs were identified, and core determinates of the models were studied. Methodology: The researchers used a systematic literature review. Inclusion criteria required articles to be written in English, non-duplicate, peer-reviewed, focused on K-12 educators, and employing quantitative methods to test or extend the UTAUT or UTAUT2 models. We used a strategic search string to conduct standardized searches across multiple databases in education, psychology, business, engineering, and multi-disciplinary publications. We conducted a screening process on the initially identified 98 articles. We kept 14 articles for final analysis, as they met the inclusion criteria. Contribution: This study contributes to the fields of (a) information science, (b) information technology (IT), and (c) education by offering a more detailed analysis and understanding of the use of UTAUT and UTAUT2 in studying technology adoption among K-12 educators. Findings: The results show performance expectancy and social influence are the most used core factors. A total of 27 new variables were identified and organized into a taxonomy. Discrepancies in the application of the models were identified and further discussed. The use of UTAUT and UTAUT2 in K-12 education is minimal. Recommendations for Practitioners: Findings inform stakeholders in education (e.g., directors of technology operations, administrators, educators) and educational technology businesses (e.g., software engineers, interface and content designers, and user experience designers) how to create and integrate products that fit the true needs of the end-users. Technology must align with the tasks needed to accomplish educational objectives (performance expectancy), and certain environmental conditions are needed to support technology usage. Educators should also be aware their decisions regarding technology adoption are influenced by social factors, such as their superiors and peers. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers need to conduct more studies using UTAUT and UTAUT2 within K-12 education. It is likely that teachers are influenced by their students, although little research exists to study this relationship through the lens of these models. Moreover, consideration should be given when renaming variables, using certain relationships, and developing research models. Impact on Society: Findings support our understanding of educational technology adoption, which benefits our education system, especially teachers and students alike, when done successfully. Future Research: Future research should include a meta-analysis exploring the statistical extent of relations"
pub.1152263805,A Novel Hybrid Approach for Intent Creation and Detection Using K-Means-Based Topic Clustering and Heuristic-Based Capsule Network,"Background: The social media revolution has offered new facilities and opportunities to the online community to communicate their intentions, opinions, and views regarding products, services, policies, and events. The identification of intent focuses on the detection of intents from user reviews, that is, whether the specific review of the user includes intention or not. Intent mining is also named intent identification which helps business organizations to identify the purchase intentions of users. However, detecting user intentions encoded in text queries is a complicated task in several Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as robots, smart agents, personal assistants, and search engines. The existing research works have discovered the utilization of several machine learning techniques to detect the intents from queries of users. Most works consider intent detection as a classification problem, with utterances as predefined intents. Research question: Whether the researcher resolves the detection of user intentions encoded in text queries? How the researcher solves the existing challenges based on intent mining? Purpose: The main contribution of the research is to design and implement intent detection using topic clustering and deep learning. Methodology: Initially, the dataset related to diverse queries is gathered. Then, the label creation is performed by clustering. The clustering is performed by a k-means clustering model with a cosine similarity function. Once the clustering is performed for different queries, the label is created, which is used to train the network under the detection process. For the detection, this paper uses a Heuristic-based Capsule Network (H-CapNet) that could perform the intention for a new query. The hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm with Escaping Energy searched Grey–Harris Hawks Algorithm (EEG-HHA) is used for improving the capsule network. Validation: Experimental analysis shows that the developed method has superior performance in evaluating standard datasets with other approaches. Results: From the simulation results, the accuracy of the developed EEG-HHA-CapNet for dataset 1 is secured at 3%, 1.6%, 2%, and 1.1% increased than PSO-CapNet, WOA-CapNet, HHO-CapNet, and GWO-CapNet. Conclusion: Thus, the designed user intent detection models reveal their more advanced performance based on the diverse performance and error metrics for datasets 1 and 2."

                    Purpose
                    The objective of the present research was to carry out a scientific map about life cycle assessment (LCA) and triple bottom line (TBL) at slaughterhouse areas, looking for Cleaner Production practices aiming at recognizing strategic themes for maintaining the sustainability of productive systems, according to the development of sustainable practices and production evolution in slaughterhouse areas.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The literature analysis was based on general approach, with steps adapted of study phases and activities of preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) recommendation guide to do systematic literature review. Activities were subdivided to discuss the results in two kinds of analysis: quantitative and qualitative.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The main findings of our study reinforce the LCA importance in slaughterhouses to promote Cleaner Production, so that the main measures suggested and/or adopted by different authors include the substitution of raw materials by feeding, with the adoption of grains, protein supplements with less environmental impact in the composition of the feed and changes in the processes seeking for better energy efficiency and optimization of water consumption in meat processing.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    There is another action of sustainability considering LCA and Cleaner Production practices in the industrial meat area that should also be considered. These actions are restricted to documents of business circulation, with limited access since they involve issues regarding innovations in economic and technological aspects of slaughterhouses, as well as industrial confidentiality. Furthermore, in patent bases it is possible to advance the studies looking for how the digital transformation has been carried out in this industrial branch, since the 4.0 transformation industry tends to use clean technologies.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    There are LCA models with a systemic approach to measure the level of sustainability of a process, comprising analysis of impacts related to different areas: environmental, social and economic although in terms of the meat production chain, the impact analysis focuses mainly on the environmental area. So, future works should be developed in meat production chain to assess social and economic impacts, i.e. a sustainable LCA addressing the three areas to consolidate models and standardize metrics with a scientific basis.

Phase 1: Preunderstanding,"IntroductionIn 2020, the National Rehabilitation University Hospital (NRH) a complex  specialist rehabilitation facility, moved to its new building providing a state-of-the-art physical infrastructure for patients and service users. This development presented a once in a lifetime opportunity to investigate and understand team dynamics, relationships within and between interdisciplinary teams and decision-making practices of senior management teams for successful ways to enhance team effectiveness and successfully navigate transition to a new hospital. Part of a larger project, this paper presents the results of phase 1 of one of the team interventions.Aims and objectivesTo evaluate the value of co‐operative inquiry as a vehicle for supporting learning.  The specific questions to be addressed were:•           How can we as medical leaders facilitate transition to the new hospital with an improved staff and patient experience?•           How do we develop the leadership skills to do this?MethodologyAction research (AR) was chosen as the methodology for this research. Cooperative inquiry (CI) (one articulation of action research) was chosen as it is in keeping with the philosophy of the hospital, the biopsychosocial model of rehabilitation and because it has a solid evidence base in professional development in healthcare. CI is a way of working with other people who have similar concerns and interests in order to understand and make sense of a problem and to develop new and creative ways of examining it. This approach draws on lived experience and expertise. Ethical approval was obtained from Henley Business School, NRH and UCD. Phase 1 is preunderstanding which refers to people’s knowledge, insights and experience before they engage in a research programme. This applies, not only to the theoretical understanding of organizational dynamics, but also to the lived experience of the organization and includes both explicit and tacit knowledge. Data generation •           Semi structured qualitative interviews (n=12)•           Insider AR Fieldnotes •           Data mining from documents and artefacts •           Workshop with colleagues The 6 phases of thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarke were observed and the results were triangulated with the findings from the other data sources.ResultsKey themes: Collaboration, patient centred care, governance, funding models and knowledge mobilisation.DiscussionThe results were shared with colleagues at a participatory workshop and through a process of abductive reasoning, a shared understanding of issues was reached and agreement to proceed with a co-operative inquiry.ConclusionPreunderstanding allowed assimilation of knowledge, insights and experience before commencing phase 2 enabling the meta learning of content, process and premise.Lessons learnedPreunderstanding helped develop a shared understanding of issues and a shared desire to address them.LimitationsOnly Consultants with admitting privileges w"
pub.1134926039,The challenge of forecasting the role of biofuel in EU transport decarbonisation at 2050: A meta-analysis review of published scenarios,"The European New Green Deal and the REDII set ambitious targets, aiming to achieve a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. The transport sector is the most critical area to decarbonize, given the rigidity of both infrastructure and end-use technologies, as well as the challenge of reaching cost-effective production of sustainable advanced renewable fuels. Several researchers, stakeholders and groups of interest, such as international and governmental organisations, NGOs, business analysists, scientists and other actors elaborated scenarios on biofuels market penetration by 2050. These studies are largely used by policy makers, even if not necessarily were subject to a rigid peer review and verification process. This work presents an extensive literature review of the main published investigations, to assess and quantify the authors' different visions. These forecasts intend to evaluate the possible future development of the sector based on current and foreseeable policies, as well as industry and investors’ business plans; at the same time, these estimates should also provide policy makers with a sound base for policy development towards achieving climate goals. Through preliminary screening, based on a methodology of a set of ex-ante conditions, this work identified the most relevant publications and structured the analysis of the collected data. A total of 18 publications were selected from the literature review, resulting in 56 scenarios to be examined. This work allowed to achieve a comprehensive and quantification of the selected scenarios, all of which focus on biofuel contribution to transport decarbonisation in the period 2030–2050. Given the occurrence of several factors, as the ongoing and future technological development, the adoption of more efficient mobility models, the hybridization and electrification of transports, the Total Fuel Consumption for the transport sector is expected to reduce in Europe: averaged projections from the analyzed scenarios account for 312.8 Mtoe in 2030 and 274.2 Mtoe in 2050. Biofuels are expected to significantly contribute to achieve the EU targets, with a progressive shift towards advanced feedstock: on average, their total contribution is expected to account for 24.5 Mtoe in 2030, and for 48.3 Mtoe in 2050, while advanced biofuels are projected for an average contribution of 8.7 Mtoe in 2030 and 36.5 Mtoe in 2050. This work analysed pre-pandemic published scenarios: the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global as well as EU economies are uncertain, but there is a serious risk of hampering and postponing investment decisions in the whole energy area, making the achievement of RED and EU Green Deal targets even more challenging in this historical moment."
pub.1120106385,MMCNet: deep learning–based multimodal classification model using dynamic knowledge,"Because of the growth of the business sector dealing in the distribution of movies, software, music, and other contents, a very large amount of contents has accumulated. Accordingly, recommendation systems for inducing user requests for contents are more important. In distribution businesses, accurate content recommendations are required to secure and retain users. To establish a highly accurate recommendation system, the recommended contents must be accurately classified. As classification methods, mainly techniques such as naive Bayes, SGD (stochastic gradient descent), and SVM (support vector machine), are utilized. If all of the information on recommended subjects is applied in the classification process, high-level accuracy can be expected, but heavy calculation, a long service time, and low scalability are incurred. Given this inefficiency, effective classification in which the metadata of contents are used is required. Metadata are expressed in the forms of the domain concept, relation, type, and attribute to allow the complicated relations between multimodal data (text, images, and video) to be processed efficiently. Most classification systems use single modal data to express one piece of knowledge for an item in a domain. Single modal data are limited in terms of improving classification accuracy, because they do not include the useful information provided by different knowledge types. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MMCNet, a deep learning–based multimodal classification model that uses dynamic knowledge. The proposed method consists of a classification model that applies the human learning principle-based CNN (convolution neural network) to multimodal data in combination with text and image knowledge. By using a Web robot agent, multimodal data are collected from the TMDb (The Movie Database) data set, which includes a variety of single modal data. In the preprocessing procedures, knowledge integration, knowledge conversion, and knowledge reduction are performed to create a quantified knowledge base. To handle text data, sentences are refined through morphological analysis and converted to numerical vectors by using word embedding. Image data are converted to numerical vectors using the library related to vector conversion. The converted feature vectors are utilized to create multimodal learning data and the classification model is used for learning. To solve the problem of memory operation resources, vector model-based meta-knowledge is expanded through expression, conversion, alignment, inference, and deep learning. To evaluate its performance, the proposed model was compared with conventional classification methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. According to this evaluation, the proposed classification model improves the accuracy, recall, and F1-score rates more than the conventional methods. In addition, the proposed model was implemented as a deep learning–based multimodal classification system in a graphical us"

The aim of the research is to present the theoretical essence of the social competence and try the method of forming the social competence of teenagers out in practice. It is stated that the formation of the personal social competence is one of the key tasks of the present-day school due to the main school documents and the guidelines for the schoolchildren education in educational institutions. It is justified that social competence is an acquired skill that can be formed and developed throughout the person’s life. The developed social competence determines the status of an individual in society and affects personal success in further professional activities.In the study, the social competence is presented as universal personal qualities, knowledge, skills, behavioural models, which are required for person’s successful socialization. The key features of social competence are: 1) recognition of the person’s value-motivational sphere; 2) readiness to solve complex tasks (state of internal psychological mobilization); 3) persistence of the manifestation of this quality. It was found that important components of social competence for today’s adolescence are: the ability to find constructive models of behaviour in various problem situations; navigate in the information space; apply the acquired theoretical knowledge in practice; the ability to work in groups, to cooperate with peers and older people; the ability to resolve productively conflict situations, based on the understanding of mental, ethnic, and cultural characteristics of different social strata of the population; the ability to conduct business electronic correspondence with various recipients, etc.Diagnostics for determining the manifestation of social competence of schoolchildren is presented, which is based on Doll’s theory of social competence. The study describes the method of forming the social competence of teenagers by means of the case method. The didactic requirements for the use of the case method in order to form the researched quality are revealed, namely: saturation of the content of the cases with a meta-subject social context, multi-problems; connection of tasks with life priorities, interests, values of teenagers; the use of cases, that involves a combination of curricular and extracurricular activities, actualization of interdisciplinary knowledge, social experience of students; use of cases based on group work; implementation of the principle of cooperation in the process of solving cases, performance by the teacher of the role of moderator.  "
pub.1084846560,Object,"The Internet connectivity of client software (e.g., apps running on phones and PCs), websites, and online services provide an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate ideas quickly using controlled experiments, also called A/B tests, split tests, randomized experiments, control/treatment tests, and online field experiments. Unlike most data mining techniques for finding correlational patterns, controlled experiments allow establishing a causal relationship with high probability. Experimenters can utilize the scientific method to form a hypothesis of the form “If a specific change is introduced, will it improve key metrics?” and evaluate it with real users. The theory of a controlled experiment dates back to Sir Ronald A. Fisher’s experiments at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in England in the 1920s, and the topic of offline experiments is well developed in Statistics (Box et al., Statistics for experimenters: design, innovation, and discovery. Wiley, Hoboken, 2005). Online-controlled experiments started to be used in the late 1990s with the growth of the Internet. Today, many large sites, including Amazon, Bing, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and Yahoo!, run thousands to tens of thousands of experiments each year testing user interface (UI) changes, enhancements to algorithms (search, ads, personalization, recommendation, etc.), changes to apps, content management system, etc. Online-controlled experiments are now considered an indispensable tool, and their use is growing for startups and smaller websites. Controlled experiments are especially useful in combination with Agile software development (Martin, Clean code: a handbook of Agile software craftsmanship. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, 2008; Rubin, Essential scrum: a practical guide to the most popular Agile process. Addison-Wesley Professional, Upper Saddle River, 2012), Steve Blank’s Customer Development process (Blank, The four steps to the epiphany: successful strategies for products that win. Cafepress.com., 2005), and MVPs (minimum viable products) popularized by Eric Ries’s Lean Startup (Ries, The lean startup: how today’s entrepreneurs use continuous innovation to create radically successful businesses. Crown Business, New York, 2011). Online learning and its variants are one of the main models of computational learning theory, complementing statistical PAC learning and related models. An online learner needs to make predictions about a sequence of instances, one after the other, and receives feedback after each prediction. The performance of the online learner is typically compared to the best predictor from a given class, often in terms of its excess loss (the regret) over the best predictor. Some of the fundamental online learning algorithms and their variants are discussed: weighted majority, follow the perturbed leader, follow the regularized leader, the perceptron algorithm, the doubling trick, bandit algorithms, and the issue of adaptive versus oblivious instan"
pub.1155722195,HOW IT IS LIKE TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR? A FRAMEWORK TO ANALYSING MULTIVOICEDNESS OF MEANING IN GAMIFIED LEARNING PLATFORMS,"In this paper, we consider the potential of gamified platforms to teach young people entrepreneurial values. We start from exploring a specific learning environment, #ritmdebusiness (Eng. #businessrhythm), designed to increase visibility of self-driven careers, while promoting the diversity of trajectories, motivations and models in successful Romanian businesses. The environment is supported by a digital platform used to assemble stories of leading entrepreneurs whose experience and products are made to account as subject of discussion. The gamified component of the platform consists in a competition organized to award users who propose valuable improvements and extensions of the presented products. Therefore, #ritmdebusiness also functions as a campaign developed both to enrich public discourse around the values of business creation and to increase awareness on the role of IT instruments in developing successful entrepreneurial projects.
The digital platform unfolds a jointly constructed culture in which different actors collaboratively establish entrepreneurship as the referential system of ongoing interactions. The platform facilitates actions in which the meaning of entrepreneurship is socially defined and negotiated through locally orchestrated modes of engagement. In this sense, #ritmdebusiness becomes a medium to invite questioning on how entrepreneurship might be known, approached and learned, and on what type of resources might be integrated in the process. We consider that analytically employing the concept of voices, understood as an accountable embodiment of ""perspective, conceptual horizon, intention and worldview"" (Engestrom, 1995, p. 199) represents an effective practice in the design and implementation of powerful learning environments.
By exploring different interactional patterns and discursive episodes in the production, use and evaluation of #ritmdebusiness digital environment, we propose a framework to analyse multivoicedness (Wertsch, 1991) in gamified learning platforms. We claim that voices are embedded in the design and rhetoric of the digital medium, becoming a function of framing discourse, positioning actors, mediating actions, and building technological infrastructure. Accordingly, we develop a typology that differentiate between (1) discursively-framed voices (voices that are intentionally introduced to stage subjective positions of various actors), (2) relationally-emergent voices (voices that arise in sequences of interactions and relations between various actors), (3) action-based voices (voices that develop in processes of acting upon the platform and engaging with it), (4) objectified-constructed voices (voices of objects, digital artefacts and technological infrastructure integrated within the platform), and (5) performative meta-voices (voices resulting in how the platform acts in the world as an independent reality).  We illustrate how these types of voices operate in achieving the meaning of entrepreneurshi"
pub.1131720059,The Alchian-Allen Theorem and the Economics of Internet Animals,"Economics of Cute            There are many ways to study cute: for example, neuro-biology (cute as adaptation); anthropology (cute in culture); political economy (cute industries, how cute exploits consumers); cultural studies (social construction of cute); media theory and politics (representation and identity of cute), and so on. What about economics? At first sight, this might point to a money-capitalism nexus (“the cute economy”), but I want to argue here that the economics of cute actually works through choice interacting with fixed costs and what economists call ”the substitution effect”. Cute, in conjunction with the Internet, affects the trade-offs involved in choices people make. Let me put that more starkly: cute shapes the economy. This can be illustrated with internet animals, which at the time of writing means Grumpy Cat.      I want to explain how that mechanism works – but to do so I will need some abstraction. This is not difficult – a simple application of a well-known economics model, namely the Allen-Alchian theorem, or the  “third law of demand”. But I am going to take some liberties in order to represent that model clearly in this short paper. Specifically, I will model just two extremes of quality (“opera” and  “cat videos”) to represent end-points of a spectrum. I will also assume that the entire effect of the internet is to lower the cost of cat videos. Now obviously these are just simplifying assumptions “for the purpose of the model”. And the purpose of the model is to illuminate a further aspect of how we might understand cute, by using an economic model of choice and its consequences. This is a standard technique in economics, but not so in cultural studies, so I will endeavour to explain these moments as we go, so as to avoid any confusion about analytic intent. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a way that a simple economic model might be applied to augment the cultural study of cute by seeking to unpack its economic aspect. This can be elucidated by considering the rise of internet animals as a media-cultural force, as epitomized by “cat videos”.   We can explain this through an application of price theory and the theory of demand that was first proposed by Armen Alchian and William Allen. They showed how an equal fixed cost that was imposed to both high-quality and low-quality goods alike caused a shift in consumption toward the higher-quality good, because it is now relatively cheaper. Alchian and Allen had in mind something like transport costs on agricultural goods (such as apples). But it is also true that the same effect works in reverse (Cowen), and the purpose of this paper is to develop that logic to contribute to explaining how certain structural shifts in production and consumption in digital media, particularly the rise of blog formats such as Tumblr, a primary supplier of kittens on the Internet, can be in part understood as a consequence of this economic mechanism.  There are three key assumption"

The main factors that stimulate the development of e-commerce may be the natural desire of mankind to use time more efficiently. It is important to note that the volume of transactions in the e-commerce segment varies significantly across industries. One of the main reasons for this is the level of development of e-commerce technologies, which can be divided into two areas: the level of convenience of product selection and the level of convenience of the purchase process. In order to increase the share of on-line sales, it is advisable to conduct a study of the use of digital marketing tools and formulate recommendations for their effective use. Increasing the company's gross profit and reducing the cost of marketing activities is a systematic and important process. Due to the beginning of the development and implementation of Metaverse technologies, the marketing activities of enterprises require a reassessment of the strategic concept of development, taking into account the fundamental changes in the interfaces of interaction with users in VR (virtual reality) and changes in the level of detail of BI (business intelligence) tools. Given the dynamic development of the competitive environment and digital marketing technologies, it is necessary to develop effective models for the use of digital marketing tools. According to the growth forecast for e-commerce “E-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales worldwide from 2021 to 2027 [5], available on statista.com, the volume of e-commerce transactions as a percentage of total retail sales will increase from 20.1% in 2024 to 22.6% in 2027. According to the report “Google's Advertising Revenue from 2001 to 2023” [5], the growth of Google's revenue from advertising activities since 2019 has been 176.44%. Since 2019, Meta Platforms' advertising revenue has increased by 189.43% [5]. As a result of the introduction of VR (Virtual Reality) technologies, the methods of advertising will be significantly changed, and it is now possible to start working with these technologies using Internet marketing tools: use 3D product models on websites and mobile applications, optimizing the models (in terms of detail, perception, and work speed) and working to increase the conversion rate from page view to order; use 3D models for advertising on the Google platform (currently, this technology is available only in the US for the categories of household goods and shoes). According to the Eurostat report “Internet purchases by individuals” [8] for 2023, it is possible to see that the level of retail on-line sales is declining from West to East. This circumstance indicates additional potential in the E-commerce sector for the EU and partner countries, which can be realized in the form of additional migration of sales from the off-line segment to the on-line one.

Over time, this persistent danger has prompted a transition from heuristic hazard management strategies towards a more quantified risk culture. Since quantitative risk assessment heavily relies on understanding the occurrence frequency of the hazard processes under consideration, knowledge about past events and their characteristics becomes pivotal, thereby shaping the effectiveness and broader applicability of methodological workflows employed in this context. We present challenges, and insights gleaned from the research project “gAia”, focusing on a data-driven susceptibility assessment for shallow landslides in Austria. The identified challenges mainly revolve around the quality of landslide inventories, which is influenced by factors like underreporting, inconsistent documentation, and lack of standardized data management practices. We thus recommend adopting FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) principles and developing Data Management Plans to address these issues, and propose a general data management workflow: Identify data sources and contents: Collect information about data sources and characteristics in a (machine-readable) DMP to obtain an overview of all data sources and most important characteristics (e.g. format, size, license, context, bias limitations). This should support the contextualization and ability to reuse this data. Define processing activities: Explicitly define processing workflows to enhance reproducibility and transparency, using established standards such as Business Process Management (BPMN) or semantic web technologies to represent complex processes formally and make them more comparable and accessible to users. Define (meta)-data and process activities trace templates: Provide metadata templates for datasets and trace processing activities to improve interoperability and reusability. Define domain-specific vocabularies and use concepts such as datasheets, model cards, ML experiment tracking and model registry tools as well as task orchestration platforms for data engineering pipelines to make results more traceable and reviewable.  Monitoring processes for natural hazard event data: Implement processes to ensure adherence to quality metrics, with results published in machine-readable formats. We detail the implementation of these steps using established concepts of traceability and provenance, and encourage to implement workflow tasks using common open source programming languages. In addition, we endorse the use of Git for version control and GitLab/GitHub as tools for facilitating collaboration and structuring technical tasks. The benefits of the proposed data management strategies for enhancing quality and reliability of data as well as increasing overall transparency of processes are showcased in the gAia project. The project workflow, represented as a P-Plan, demonstrates the application of t"
pub.1169483905,2 Financial capitalism online,"In the digital age, markets become property. Today’s most powerful companies are internet giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Tencent. The dominant platforms now control digital ecosystems that represent a fundamental transformation of capitalism. Liberalism imagined the market as a free space dedicated to the exchange of goods and services, a creator of knowledge and innovation. The internet meta-platforms have transformed the marketplace into a set of tightly controlled domains. This book examines the historical roots of this phenomenon and outlines its contemporary manifestations. It shows how digital surveillance and algorithmic management are employed to control entire markets, and how the same methods appear in the digital labour process. Widening social inequality is one inevitable outcome. What is specific to digital capitalism, the book argues, is the emergence of ‘proprietary markets’. This signals not only an end to the liberal notion of the economy. The conflicts over its future trajectory will be decisive for life chances in digital capitalism. Chapter 3 takes up the links between digital technology and broader capitalist developments by exploring the systemic ties between financial capitalism and the digital economy. It starts with the direct interactions: the IT industry as the main supplier of technology used for ‘innovation’ in the financial sector (high-frequency trading, data-based asset management, etc.) and Wall Street as the main supplier of investment capital for the digital economy. The argument then turns to more indirect similarities and filiations. Both the banking sector and the internet industry deal, on an ontological level, with goods that are not scarce (to them). They make money by selling access to virtual goods that can be produced at very low cost. Banks create money by issuing credit essentially with a keystroke; internet companies distribute non-rival digital goods that they can multiply without relevant costs. This leads to similar business practices appearing in both fields. The chapter explores these in depth and frames them analytically, concluding that the most successful digital corporations owe their accumulation practices to role models in the financial sector. The chapter identifies venture capital as a specific type of financial capital that has been essential to the growth of digital capitalism. It explores its rise throughout the dotcom boom of the 1990s, analyses it as a strong driver of economic crisis and shows how the period after the financial and debt crisis of 2008/09 (roughly the past ten years) resembles the 1990s."

The public service personnel should ensure the effectiveness of activities based on compliance with European democratic principles and standards of social development. Analysis of recent research and publications Though many scientists highlighted theoretical approaches to defining staffing peculiarities in the public sphere, the training of public sphere specialists remains topical and requires constant thorough research due to present challenges and time-stipulated requirements. Separation of previously unsettled parts of the general problem This paper aims to substantiate current approaches to training public sphere specialists. Presenting main material Given the need to increase the efficiency of public administration and develop competencies of public authorities, modern realities set new requirements for the training of public sphere specialists. The specialist training reform in the public sphere should be based on the New Public Management (NPM) concept. This concept declares the possibility of training public servants by applying approaches used in the business environment. The training of specialists, able to effectively perform the functions assigned to them in the public sphere, should ensure not only the acquirement of certain knowledge related to the specifics of future activities but also their development of personal skills. These meta-competencies can be considered more relevant for managers in the context of ensuring their professionalism. They are also regarded by scientists as the main impetus for the career promotion of public sector workers in the future. A set of educational programs for cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union within the framework of projects of European educational initiatives, which allow to effectively implement internationalization policies through student mobility, promote the development of educational initiatives by rendering grants for student mobility and infrastructure support, being based on the principles of partnership among scientific institutions, higher establishments, the public, business and the state. To harmonize education with the requirements of the modern world, educational institutions need to take the following steps: focusing on real staffing needs and requests of public authorities at various levels; annual modernization of educational programs in the field of public administration; participation of academic staff in European programs, projects, internships aimed at enhancing the quality of the educational process; close cooperation with leading experts in the field of public administration. For Ukraine, the most acceptable is the option of the optimal combination of approaches of the American and European models, according to which specialis"

Widening social inequality is one inevitable outcome. What is specific to digital capitalism, the book argues, is the emergence of ‘proprietary markets’. This signals not only an end to the liberal notion of the economy. The conflicts over its future trajectory will be decisive for life chances in digital capitalism. This chapter describes the rise of leading digital corporations as an attempt to cope with long-term economic stagnation and the surfeit of surplus capital emerging in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008/09. After a brief introduction to the topic of the book and its main arguments, Schumpeter’s classic theory of capitalist monopolies (Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy) is established as a central point of reference. This contextualises digital capitalism in the historical perspective of concentration of economic power and the emergence of monopolies. The chapter also briefly introduces one of the concluding arguments: in digital capitalism, we are dealing with a post-neoliberal practice in the sense of the market itself being privatised – which is unthinkable in neoliberal economic theory. The chapter concludes with a brief introduction to the following six chapters. Chapter 2 describes the historical background of digital capitalism. It starts by drawing a broader picture of the post-Second World War political economy, where the 1970s saw the OECD world stumbling into the current situation of long-term stagnation. Digital technology emerged as an outlier, securing consistent growth through successive capitalist crises. The chapter describes the emergence and growth of the digital technologies as an effect of multiple strategies for capitalist rejuvenation: automation intensified from the 1970s onwards, boosting demand for digital equipment. Globalisation and financialisation of production caused demand for digital information and communication technologies to surge, spurring growth for the leading digital companies of the time. On the more political side, military Keynesianism and the deregulation of telecommunications paved the way for the rise of big tech. The chapter pays particular attention to the different national trajectories of privatisation in the 1990s. These help ex"

Es por esta razón, que el papel del capital humano en todo proceso de cambio organizacional, se enmarca en una visión centrada en analizar, prever y potencializar el comportamiento, así como en las dinámicas internas de las relaciones, el conocimiento y el que hacer de las personas en su contexto.El propósito principal de este estudio consistió en comprender cómo los procesos de capacitación y de desarrollo de competencias se convierten en factores clave para la transformación organizacional en un grupo empresas de la ciudad de Bogotá, desde la visión de los líderes de Gestión Humana. La metodología se basa en un estudio de tipo exploratorio - descriptivo con un alcance correlacional ya que pretende entender mejor aún el fenómeno que se está estudiando. Para tal fin se realizó el diseño y aplicación de entrevista semiestructurada y encuesta como instrumentos para la recolección de la información, mediante los cuales se obtuvieron resultados de una muestra intencional por conveniencia de 81 empresas de Bogotá que han implementado modelos de desarrollo de personal. El resultado esperado es identificar cómo estos programas se han constituido en un factor clave para el desarrollo organizacional.AbstractOrganizational development has been a movement that emerged after 1962 as an educational mechanism that attempts tomodify the structures, beliefs and values of individuals within organizations, since the groups are inevitably subject to a process of rapid change in all areas (College of Bachelors, 2005). Moreover, this is the result of organizational change that emerges froman identified need, which occurs in the interest of changing a management strategy focused on processes or goals, improve organizational climate, transform culture, and reduce the impact of processes of division or business fusion and among other aspects, the effective participation of its members in organizational goals. It is for this reason that the role of human capital in all processes of organizational change is framed within a analysis vision, anticipate and potentiate behavior, as well as internaldynamic relations, knowledge and the what to make of people in context.

pub.1140612499,Reframing Architecture through Design,"Re-Framing Participation in the Architecture Studio Recently, within design literature, significant attention has been given to collaboration across different disciplines (see for instance, Nicolini et al.; Carlile), as well as consideration of the breakdown of traditional disciplinarity and the corresponding involvement of users in co-generation (Sanders and Stappers, “Co-Creation” 11–12) through the development and deployment of structured methods and toolkits (Sanders et al., “Framework”; Sanders and Stappers, “Probes”). Relatively less attention has been paid to the workings of the “communities of practice” (Wenger) operating within the disciplinary domain of architecture. The discourse around concept design in architecture has tended to emphasise individualist approaches driven by personal philosophies, inspirations, imitation of a more experienced designer, and emphasis on latent talent or genius (for instance, Moneo). This can be problematic because without a shared language and methods there are limited opportunities for making meaning to facilitate participation between collaborators in architectural studio settings. It is worth asking then: are there things that “Architecture” might learn from “Design” about the deployment of structured methods, and might this interdisciplinary exchange promote participatory practices in studio-based cultures? We address this question by connecting and building on two important concepts relevant to design methods, meta-design as described in the open design literature (De Mul 36–37), and design frames as described by Schön and formalised by Dorst (‘Core’; Frame; see also Weedon). Through this combination, we propose a theory of participation by making shared meaning in architectural design. We animate our theoretical contribution through a design toolkit we have developed, refined, and applied over several years in typologically focused architectural design studios in Australian university contexts. One important contribution, we argue, is to the area of design theory-building, by taking two previously unrelated concepts from the design methods literature. We draw them together using an example from our own design practices to articulate a new term and concept for making shared meaning in design. The other contribution made is to the translation of this concept into the context of studio-based architectural practice, a setting that has traditionally struggled to accept structured methods. The existence of other form-metaphor design tools available for architecture and the theoretical basis of their development and connection to design literature more broadly has not always been clearly articulated (see for example Di Mari and Yoo; Lewis et al.). The rationale for giving an account of the construction and deployment of our own toolkit is to illustrate its theoretical contribution while providing the basis for future field testing and translation (including by other researchers), noting the established tr"
pub.1117872981,"Interventions to improve the labour market outcomes of youth: A systematic review of training, entrepreneurship promotion, employment services and subsidized employment interventions","  This Campbell systematic review examines the impact of youth employment interventions on the labour market outcomes of young people and business performance. The review summarises findings from 113 reports of 107 interventions in 31 countries. Included studies had to: (1) evaluate an active labour market programme (ALMP) which was designed for ‐ or targeted primarily ‐ young women and men aged between 15 and 35; (2) have an experimental and quasi‐experimental design; and (3) report at least one eligible outcome variable measuring employment, earnings, or business performance. The evidence base covers 107 interventions in 31 countries, including 55 using skills training, 15 with entrepreneurship promotion, ten using employment services and 21 using subsidized employment. Overall, youth employment interventions increase the employment and earnings of those youth who participate in them. But the effect is small with a lot of variation between programmes. There are significant effects for entrepreneurship promotion and skills training, but not for employment services and subsidised employment. Impacts on earnings were also positive but small and highly variable across programmes. Entrepreneurship promotion and skills training were effective in increasing earnings, while effects of employment services and subsidised employment were negligible or statistically insignificant. There is limited evidence of the effects of youth employment programmes on business performance outcomes, and the effect size was not statistically significant. In addition to the variation in impact across different types of programmes, some variation can be explained by country context, intervention design, and profile and characteristics of programme beneficiaries. The impacts of ALMPs are greater in magnitude in low‐ or middle‐income countries than in high‐income countries. Programmes targeting the most disadvantaged youth were associated with bigger programme effects, particularly for earnings outcomes, and effects were slightly larger for women than for men.   Plain language summary  Active labour market programmes for youth increase employment and earnings. Effects vary between programmes and context The evidence suggests that investing in youth through active labour market measures, such as offering skills training and entrepreneurship promotion, may pay off with higher earnings.   The review in brief Youth are disproportionately victims of unemployment and low‐quality jobs. Active labour market programmes increase earnings and employment. But the effects vary greatly between programmes’ type, design and context.   What is this review about? Youth unemployment is much greater than the average unemployment rate for adults, in some cases over three times as high. Today, over 73 million young people are unemployed worldwide. Moreover, two out of five young people in the labour force are either working but poor or are unemployed. The youth employment challenge is not only abo"
pub.1131719648,A Cappella and Diva: A Collaborative Process for Individual Academic Writing,"Picture this: Five academic women are sitting at a round table in an elegant nineteenth century room located in a rural landscape in regional NSW. Sometimes with coffee, sometimes over lunch, the conversation ranges broadly across the spectrum of the personal, policy and university politics. Having traversed the terrain in which they work—workload, juggling the responsibilities that traditionally fall to women—the talk comes round to the business of the day: writing for publication. Here is how a typical meeting unfolds: they provide updates on their research successes, and then proceed to the discussion and critical response to a current piece of writing by one or two members of the group. While the rest of the group may not be familiar with the content or discipline area, they nevertheless are able to provide a meta-analysis of the structure and resultant clarity of the work using an agreed process.  When the discussants—“the Divas”—talk about their posters or papers, “the a cappella group” analyses key structural features including the question posed, the main message to be conveyed, how the research was conducted and the scholarly contribution it makes to the field.  

	Overture

	This “collaboration” theme prompted us to unpack and reflect on our mode of collaboration, something we had discussed informally but not written about in any structured way. We have a successful mode of collaboration that offers individual benefits as well as enhancing the research output of the university. 

	In this paper we reflect on how our collaborative process benefits us individually and seek to make sense of our collaborative practice. Through this reflexive process we have identified six aspects of our interaction and collaboration (motivation to translate our research into publications; training in the template; multidisciplinary feminist consciousness; a negotiated process; commitment to practice on a regular basis; and trust and reciprocity) that have contributed to the success of our practice. 

	Our roundtable discussions provide a space in which the distinct but complementary disciplinary a cappella voices come together. Each of us arrives with an individual piece of research (our solo performance) and then through a group process of questioning and reflection we rehearse and refine our arguments. As a result of this process, each returns to her individual research context better equipped to perform as a Diva. We have come to conceptualise this process as one in which a poststructuralist writing self is created. It is as if, as we sit around the table, we create a discursive space at the centre of the table from which a “voice” emerges with a greater level of clarity and confidence—one attuned to its audience. This writing subject is, as a result of the process, self-reflexive and more responsive to a diverse range of contexts and audiences than we were as individual, isolated writers. This has strengthened our individual research publications.

pub.1068818649,"Intelligent Systems: Methodology, Models, and Applications in Emerging Technologies","From year to year the number of investigations on intelligent systems grows rapidly. For example this year 245 papers from 45 countries were sent for the Second International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Systems (www.ieee-is.org; www.fnts-bg.org/is) and this is an increase of more than 50% by all indicators. The presented papers on intelligent systems were marked by big audiences and they provoked a significant interest that ultimately led to the formation of vivid discussions, exchange of ideas and locally provoked the creation of working groups for different applied projects. All this reflects the worldwide tendencies for the leading role of the research on intelligent systems theoretically and practically. The greater part of the presented research dealt with traditional for the intelligent systems problems like artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, intelligent agents, neural and fuzzy networks, intelligent data processing, intelligent control and decision making systems, and also new interdisciplinary problems like ontology and semantics in Internet, fuzzy intuitionistic logic. The majority of papers from the European and American researchers are dedicated to the theory and the applications of the intelligent systems with machine learning, fuzzy inference or uncertainty. Another big group of papers focuses on the domain of building and integrating ontologies of applications with heterogeneous multiagent systems. A great number of papers on intelligent systems deals with fuzzy sets. The papers of many other researchers underscore the significance of the contemporary perception-oriented methods and also of different applications in the intelligent systems. On the first place this is valid for the paradigm of L. A. Zadeh 'computing with words'.  The Guest Editors in the present specialized journal volume would like to introduce a wealth of research with an applied and theoretical character that possesses a common characteristic and it is the conference best papers complemented and updated by the new elaborations of the authors during the last half a year.  A short description of the presented in the volume papers follows. In 'Combining Local and Global Access to Ontologies in a Multiagent System' <B>R. Brena and H.

The theoretical model proposes that teachers' self-efficacy and burnout mediate the relationship between school managers' empowering behavior and teachers' positive voice behavior. Based on 351 samples from primary schools in Shenzhen, China, the findings support the mediating role of teachers' self-efficacy in partially explaining the effect of school managers' empowering behavior. This study elucidates the psychological process through which delegative leadership influences teachers' positive voice behavior and provides practical suggestions for school leaders/managers to deepen their understanding of how to help employees express their opinions in organizations.

pub.1172539493,Teachers as curriculum leaders. What does this mean to school principals?,"School leadership and accountability are usually the responsibilities of principals. Principals are expected to lead and manage in matters such as instructions, finance, staff development and community engagement. This solo leadership model is challenge by increasing pressure for high student achievement. The advent of teacher leadership presents teachers as valuable contributors in curriculum matters. Principals’ understanding of teachers as curriculum leaders (TCL) is important if teachers are to provide the much-needed assistance. The current research adopted a multiple-site case study design to explore principals’ understanding of the concept of TCL in schools. Eight participants were purposefully selected; open-ended, semi structured interview guides were piloted prior to data collection. Observation of school meetings provided additional data. The data were thematically analysed and anchored on Grant’s model of teacher leadership. The findings reveal that, to school principals, TCL means teachers performing the roles of curriculum leaders and managers, decision makers, designers of learning programmes and materials, facilitators, assessors, lifelong learners, models, and pastoral caregivers. The findings further express the frustration of principals on the exclusion of teachers from curriculum decision making at the macro and meso levels. The findings are relevant in the advocacy of distributed leadership as they provide practical reasons for principals to create opportunities for teachers to lead in curriculum matters.

On the one hand, measurement could translate theoretical concepts into observable quantitative characteristics, which contributes into more reasonable and prepared management of economy. On the other hand, many approaches to measurement complicate this process since they call for sufficient preparedness to analyze, select, and use a huge number of methods, approaches, and methods of measurement. The purpose of this study is to analyze approaches to measuring sustainable development, arrange them by features, and then combine them into a conceptual model that reflects their place and role in the overall system of knowledge about measuring sustainable development. This research refers to a review of scientific papers on sustainable development, comparative analysis, generalization, systematization, and conceptual modeling as the main research methods. The research originally 1) updates the existing classification of measurement methods; 2) describes and visualizes the conversion of diverse statistical data, qualitative evaluative opinions, theoretical hypotheses, etc. into a quantitative information basis for well-informed managerial decisions. As a result, the study considers the key approaches to the development of systems for measuring sustainable development, their main advantages and disadvantages. Alternative logical groupings of indicators of sustainable development are looked at. An algorithm for index measurement and index classification by principles are given. The most common and theoretically substantiated indices are systematized. A logical-semantic model of the methodological relationship of approaches to measuring sustainable development has been developed. The methodological apparatus for processing the measurement results is examined. The paper visualizes and describes a mechanism of transformation of scientific and socio-economic assessment into a quantitative information basis to be applied by stakeholders, including decision makers, the public, researchers, etc. The study theoretically and practically systematizes, refines many approaches and concisely presents them with visualization elements that significantly simplify the perception of complicated information.

        Free trade and the resultant economic ‘globalisation’ have had mixed results for many countries and groups within countries and has incited a complex, inarticulate, and sometimes contradictory debate across all segments of our society. Some groups and geographical locales have benefited handsomely from the structural changes that we generally understand as globalisation, whilst other groups and geographical regions have become economically marginalised through disconnectedness from global flows of money and goods and services. Rural and regional Australia, for instance, has experienced a steady decline in recent years and in fact in rural Victoria, a gloomy report from the Bureau of Statistics, suggests that not one new full-time job has been created in more than thirteen years (Colbatch).
        In other parts of the country, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, things could not seem better; property values have doubled, unemployment is at record lows, and the new middle classes cram the cafés of the gentrified inner-cities. Wages have risen by up to fifty percent in many of Australia’s inner cities during the late 1990s (Birnbauer and Gurrera).
        By the end of the 1990s, in response to some of the inequalities of globalisation—particularly between developed and developing countries—a large globally-linked protest movement arose out of Seattle in the United States. The movement formed as a protest against the policies of the WTO and was an eclectic arrangement of political groups who believed that free trade was not the answer to a more equitable world. The problem was that some of the leading thinkers of the movement—in a movement that claimed to have no leaders—were far too short-sighted to see beyond the popular zeitgeist of the time. The turn of the century zeitgeist was based on a well-meaning utopian-libertarian vision of a frictionless and equitable world. The problem was that this vision had no place for nations and thus citizen-based democratically elected national governments. There had apparently been a coup and governments were now captured by shoe manufacturers.
        One of the best-known authors of the turn of the century globalisation protest movement was the inner-city Canadian journalist Naomi Klein with her popularly acclaimed book No Logo (Klein). Although shrewdly timed, there was nothing particularly ground-breaking about Klein’s work; anxieties about corporate power, exploited workers, and the power of the ideologically potent media industries have for most of the Twentieth Century been the focus of relations between governments and the private sphere everywhere"

Econ Hunt ini amat penting terutama sekali apabila Econ Hunt dilaksanakan di luar kampus yang mana ia turut memberikan pendedahan kepada pelajar terhadap dunia makroekonomi sebenar. Justeru, kajian ini dijalankan bertujuan untuk mengenalpasti persepsi pelajar terhadap penggunaan gamifikasi dalam Econ Hunt yang dilaksanakan di luar kampus. Seramai 258 pelajar prasiswazah Fakulti Ekonomi dan Pengurusan (FEP) dilibatkan dalam kajian ini dan data dikumpul menggunakan Google Form dalam bentuk soalan tertutup. Menerusi analisis faktor dengan menggunakan perisian Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), terdapat lima komponen faktor penting yang mempengaruhi persepsi pelajar terhadap Econ Hunt iaitu kefahaman maklumat, tarikan subjek, pengurusan, sikap pelajar dan kesesuaian tempoh masa. Rentetan itu, terbukti bahawa gamifikasi digital yang dilakukan di luar kampus seperti Econ Hunt ini mampu memberi kesan yang baik terhadap proses pembelajaran pelajar. Kata kunci: Econ Hunt; gamifikasi; digital; pembelajaran; analisis faktor Abstract: The application of Econ Hunt which arose from a mixture of gamification and digital elements into the Macroeconomics 1 course which is a compulsory course of the faculty has been able to increase students' understanding of macroeconomics and increase student involvement in macroeconomics classes. Econ Hunt is very important especially when Econ Hunt is conducted outside the campus where it also gives students exposure to the real world of macroeconomics. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify students' perceptions of the usage of gamification in Econ Hunt held off campus. This study involved 258 respondents who were undergraduate students of the Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP) and data is collected using Google Form in the form of closed questions.Through factor analysis conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, there are five important factor components that influence students' perception of Econ Hunt, namely information comprehension, subject attraction, management, student attitude and appropriateness of time period. Therefore, it has been proven that digital gamification done outside the campus such as Econ Hunt can have a good effect on the learning process of students.

pub.1092325930,"Meaning, Context and Methodology","Many of the terms of our language, such as “jar”, are open-textured in the sense that their applicability to novel objects is not entirely determined by their past usage. Many others, such as the verbs “use” and “have”, are schematic in the sense that they have only a very general meaning although on any particular occasion of use they denote some more particular relation. The phenomena of open texture and schematicity constitute a sharp challenge to referential semantics, which assumes that every non-logical term has a definite extension. A different, non-referential approach to formal semantics defines truth as relative to a context and defines contexts as built up from exclusively linguistic entities. For any given utterance of a sentence, there will be one of these contexts that pertains to it. In this framework, open texture and schematicity can be understood as consequences of the complex nature of the pertaining relation between contexts and utterances. On the issue of how much pragmatics has to do with what is said, philosophers and linguists divide into the minimalist and contextualist camps. Most members of both camps agree that in utterance comprehension, there are clear cases of “pragmatic intrusion.” The consensus is practically universal, when it comes to utterances containing indexicals, demonstratives and context-sensitive expressions in general. The basic idea is that without pragmatic provision of appropriate referents, no proposition is determined, so the hearer cannot very well understand what the speaker said (the proposition expressed or the explicature). Even “radical” minimalists like Cappelen and Lepore (2005) concede this. Recanati (2004) calls such pragmatic intrusion into the business of reference, “saturation”. Saturation is a mandatory primary pragmatic process. It is primary, in contrast with secondary processes of implicature inference. It is mandatory, in contrast with optional primary processes such as free enrichment. We will argue that the mandatory nature of saturation is a myth. Saturation is not needed to determine a truth-evaluable proposition. Indeed, at times it is not even required for an adequate understanding of what a speaker means by her utterance. We will offer several examples involving context‐sensitive expressions that make perfect sense of an unsaturated but truth-conditionally complete propositional content. Despite being a pragmatic theory of language, Searle’s theory of speech acts is methodologically based on semantic analysis. The properties of speech acts are supposed to be examined by analysing sentences whose literal utterance is sufficient to constitute a specific speech act by virtue of their semantic meaning. Searle’s method thus presupposes the concept of fixable, constant semantic content. Searle also advocates a very radical hypothesis about the dependence of the meaning of a speech act on the mental context of a speaker. The aim of the paper is to show that there is a serious clas"

However, this Program has not been scrutinized for the modern economic theories and inner conceptual inconsistencies. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to identify the Program’s conceptual uncertainties which could give rise to the alternative scenarios of the economic development of Russia and to inconsistent managerial decisions resulted in the dramatic differences in unfolding the digital economy in different regions and industries. It has been found that the Program contains three definitions for the digital economy – declared (with the focus on the digital data), latent (with the focus on the digital platforms), and promising (with the focus on the artificial intelligence) ones. The Program’s content was compared with the modern economic theories, which revealed five levels of strategic uncertainty: 1) cluster or platform economy; 2) dispersed or agglomeration economy; 3) linear or circular economy; 4) homogeneous or heterogeneous economic landscape; 5) smart cities, smart agglomerations or smart regions. The reviewed Program lacks a clearly defined priority in the development of the cluster or post-cluster (platform) economy in Russia, which creates the theoretical (conceptual) and practical (connected with the development of the social and economic strategy) uncertainties for the industries and regions. With a stronger focus on the latent definition of the Program, there is a risk of extreme monopolization of the digital markets in Russia by the platform leading companies which are mainly located in Moscow and established with the public support under this Program implementation. The article offers to expand the concept of platform economy with a new type of digital ecosystem – a territorial digital platform to construct regional digital platforms and to develop business-ecosystems around them. It has been found that the digital economy in Russia is developed together with the implementation of the previously adopted spatial development strategy aimed to diminish the inter-regional differences, therefore, the dispersed digital economy should be seen as a promising approach. At the same time, there is a risk to activate the process of extreme territorial concentration of digital economic activities as the reviewed Program contains no measures aimed to disperse the agents of digital economy with any financial and other public mechanisms. One more strategic uncertainty induced by the fact that the Program lacks any priorities in preserving or expanding value chain is connected with linear or circular economy dichotomy. This uncertainty misinforms the domestic economic agents and could lead to the technological retardation of Russia from the leading countries in the circular digital economy. The advent of the artificial intelligence gives rise to the debate about the alternative routes of developm"
pub.1121549809,Moving from Strategy to Corporate Communication,"The concept of strategy has evolved substantially in the past thirty years. Organisations have learned to analyze their immediate competitive environment, define their current position, develop competitive and corporate advantages, and understand weaknesses and threats to sustaining advantage in the face of challenging threats. Different approaches including industrial organization, the resource-based view, dynamic capabilities, and game theory have helped academics and practitioners understand the dynamics of competition and develop recommendations on how organisations should redefine their competitive and corporate strategies, corporate communication included. However, drivers such as globalization, deregulation, or technological change, just to mention a few, are profoundly changing the competitive game. Scholars and practitioners agree that the fastest growing organisations in this new environment appear to have taken advantage of these structural changes to compete “differently” and innovate in their business models. What about the Douala Stock Exchange? His Excellency Mr. Paul BIYA, President of the Republic, in ordering the creation of a financial market in Cameroon, endowed the financial system, which was until then composed of banks, financial establishments and microfinance institutions, with a modern tool to finance the economy. Thus by rationalising the economic system and putting the country on course to become an emerging nation by 2035. The ambitions of the Douala Stock Exchange (D.S.X) are: To establish the DSX as an attractive place for savers and to introduce the idea of Stock Market finance into the managerial culture of companies in Cameroon; To make the DSX an essential component of the economy of Cameroon; To make a contribution to the growth and development of Cameroonian companies by allowing them to adopt and implement wider ambitions and achieve more quickly their objectives of development into international markets; To participate in the wider diffusion of a culture of transparency and sound corporate governance; To make a contribution to the dematerialisation of financial assets; To make a contribution to increase awareness of Cameroon on international markets.

Social and Personality Psychology Compass 5/6 (2011): 333–345, doi: 10.1111/j.1751‐9004.2011.00357.x    Authors’ Introduction Social psychology is concerned with people interacting as members of social groups. Corporate mergers provide an interesting field to apply social psychological theory in practice and also provide a context for the test and development of such theories. Mergers and acquisitions have been shown to often fail their financial and other strategic aims – one key reason for this failure is that human resources, that is, the needs of employees involved in the merger, are often considered less important than legal, technological or other factors by senior managers. In particular, it is often the merger’s impact on employee identities as members of the pre‐merger organizations and its consideration by change leaders that determines the merger’s failure or success. The article ‘Social Identity and Corporate Mergers’ utilizes a social identity approach to analyze the problem zones of mergers and we provide research suggesting how to lead a merger into success. In particular, leaders should provide reasons for why the merger is necessary, they should demonstrate actual and future continuity to reduce uncertainties due to the merger situation and leaders should pay attention to status differentials (e.g., between employees of the acquiring versus the acquired organization) as employees of the lower status merger partner have different concerns than employees of the higher status merger organization.

pub.1131718841,Spreadsheets and the Violence of Forms: Tracking Organisational and Domestic Use,"IntroductionWith its capacity for modelling and “what if” logic, the spreadsheet operates as a media of beginnings and possible futures. It has proved indispensable in organisational life and labour, its failures the stuff of enduring legend about the Global Financial Crisis and the excesses of Wall Street. Indeed, the “European Spreadsheet Risk Interest Group” maintains an archive devoted to cataloguing public “horror stories” of legal actions, business failure and government enquiries due to errors in spreadsheet calculations (EuSpRIG Horror Stories). One such tale of spectacular failure occurred in 2012 when a coding error was revealed in a spreadsheet formulae used by economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart to argue for the implementation of harsh austerity measures following the GFC. The spreadsheet purported to demonstrate that when debt levels exceed 90% of the size of GDP then national economies cease to grow, thereby justifying the reduction of public infrastructure and services. To substantiate the argument the data mapped worldwide national levels of debt for the period 1945-2009. However, the authors mistakenly omitted key countries from their spreadsheet – those from the start of the alphabet namely Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark. When these countries were included, the data showed economies can actually grow despite high levels of public spending (Yglesias). As Mike Konczal explains, the “core empirical points providing the intellectual foundation for the global move to austerity in the early 2010s was based on someone accidentally not updating a row formula in Excel”.In this paper I track the history and affect of spreadsheet use across organisational and domestic settings. Expanding upon the insights of Lisa Gitelman, JoAnne Yates and Ben Kafka, who focus on paperwork’s materialities to excavate the labour of bureaucratic media, I report on the early findings of a project exploring the role of the spreadsheet in everyday life. One of the interesting threads I pursue is how the spreadsheet becomes imbricated in the contours and vicissitudes of the home managing and recording its daily practices. Although spreadsheet applications have been extensively studied in business and engineering literatures there has been scant attention paid in the fields of cultural studies, media or, surprisingly, software studies and media archaeology. In the journal Computational Culture where one expects to see finely grained analyses of the algorithms and design decisions underpinning the spreadsheet it has not turned out to be a major concern. This isn’t to say that spreadsheets are omitted from discussions exploring the materiality of digital culture particularly from those interested in institutional life and “evil media” (Fuller and Goffey) but these are often references in passing to broader arguments. As this paper shows, the pervasive nature of spreadsheet use often eclipses its central role in our lives. In order to coun"

Roberts, Carolyn MacCann, Gerald Matthews and Moshe Zeidner, ‘Emotional Intelligence: Towards a Consensus of Models and Measures’. Social and Personality Psychology Compass 4/10 (2010): 821–840, doi: 10.1111/j.1751‐9004.2010.00277.x The article, and a proposed course around which it might coalesce, covers different ways that emotional intelligence (EI) has been conceptualized, measured, and applied. It begins with an examination of research on early antecedents of emotional abilities (e.g., facial expression) and moves right on through to cover multi‐media assessment paradigms. Models describing EI as a character trait are compared and contrasted with those that view EI as a form of information‐processing or knowledge. It is concluded that the latter type of model, exemplified by the four‐branch hierarchical model of EI, is the only logical concept that might bear the label “emotional intelligence”. Potential emendations to the way EI is currently conceptualized and measured are covered, including emotion recognition assessments, situational judgment tests, and the empathic agent paradigm. Armed with knowledge of new assessments, the article (and resultant course) also suggests an agenda for future research in the field to provide better understanding of emotional intelligence. The course differs somewhat from the article, however, by including how emotional intelligence might be applied to social life, schooling, clinical psychology, and the workplace. This teaching and learning guide begins with an annotated bibliography of some of the key books and research articles in the area of emotional intelligence. We follow this section with a list of websites that may be of interest to students, along with a capsule description of the content on these websites. Next, we present a sample syllabus on the topic of emotional intelligence, with emphasis on theory, measurement, and applications. Finally, we list a series of questions that can be used to motivate classroom discussion, and present project ideas that allows students to integrate their own experiences, observations, and knowledge with research in the area of emotional intelligence.

In this paper, the authors describe the development of an instrument to objectively measure emotion recognition ability. The assessment makes use of actor portrayals of dynamic expressions of emotions. The task requires recognition accuracy in four presentation modes combining visual and auditory modalities (audio/video, audio only, video only, static picture). Data from the study indicate that the measure relates meaningfully to indicators of emotion perception. Factor analysis of the data also suggests two separate emotion recognition abilities based on modality (i.e., visual a"

Since November 2011, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) has supported Lesotho Ministry of Health to roll out Family Health Days (FHDs), an innovative strategy to increase community access to integrated health services, with a focus on hard‐to‐reach areas where immunization coverage, HIV service uptake, and screening and treatment for chronic diseases are low. Services were provided at mobile service delivery points from 17th October to 25th November 2011. Delivery points located in rural setting were staffed by multi‐disciplinary teams of doctors, nurses, community workers, nutritionists, AIDS officers, and pharmacists (30‐40 health professionals present). During this campaign, 8,396 adults were tested for HIV (67.3% female; 32.6% male). In all, 588 (7%) tested HIV‐positive (6.7% female; 7.1% male). Among those testing HIV‐positive, 68.5% (403) received CD4 testing and 36.6% were enrolled into HIV care at their nearest clinics. A total of 324 ART defaulters were identified and linked back to care. Follow‐up with referral facilities showed 100% of patients (defaulters and newly enrolled) linked to care were enrolled at a facility. Standard immunizations were administered to 990 children. 4,454 adults (24.7% male; 75.3% female) were screened for hypertension, and of those screened, 24.2% had elevated blood pressure and were linked to care centers. Addtitionally, 3,045 adults had blood sugar tests (27.0% males; 73.0% females); 3.1% had elevated blood sugar and were linked to care facilities. Offering integrated services within hard‐to‐reach communities can increase access to a variety of critical health services, including those for non‐communicable diseases, and can link ART clients lost to follow‐up back to facilities. This approach will be scaled up throughout Lesotho as a strategy to reach all populations in the country. The high burden of undiagnosed HIV in sub‐Saharan Africa limits treatment and prevention efforts. Community‐based HIV testing campaigns can address this challenge and provide an untapped opportunity to identify non‐communicable diseases (NCDs). We tested the feasibility and diagnostic yield of integrating NCD and communicable diseases into a rapid HIV testing and referral campaign for all residents of a rural Ugandan parish. A five‐day, multi‐disease campaign, offering diagnostic, preventive, treatment and referral services, was performed in May 2011. Services included point‐of‐care screening for HIV, malaria, TB, hypertension and diabetes. Finger‐prick diagnostics eliminated the need for phlebotomy. HIV‐infected adults met clinic staff and peer counselors on‐site; those with CD4≤100/µL underwent intensive counseling and rapid referral for antiretroviral therapy (ART).

The aim of this paper was to explore teachers’ views on the teaching of writing skills in English First Additional Language specifically of grade 4 learners. The study sought to ascertain strategies used by teachers in teaching writing skills in selected EFAL grade 4 classrooms in uMkhanyakude District in the KwaZulu Natal province. A descriptive multiple case study design was adopted for this paper. Qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews and classroom observation were adopted, interpretive paradigm, purposive sampling, and thematic analysis were used. Findings revealed that teachers use various teaching strategies depending on the type of writing genre taught, needs of their learners, availability of resources and their context.  Findings also indicated that teachers face challenges when teaching writing, they lack pedagogical knowledge on how to effectively teach writing and the support received is inadequate to enhance their pedagogy of writing skills especially for English First Additional Language. The paper concludes that there is a need for significant improvement on specific content and pedagogical knowledge that teachers possess to teach writing. Thus, this paper provides recommendations which emphasises the improvement of Initial Teacher Education in the writing domain by specifying the content and pedagogical knowledge to be taught, and ensuring adequate time dedicated to writing and writing instruction. Therefore, the paper advocates towards deep knowledge and understanding on how teachers can use a variety of strategies in trying to reinforce teaching of writing skills.

pub.1131719523,Open Content Communities,"In this brief essay I sketch the characteristics 
of an open content community by considering a number of prominent examples, 
reviewing sociological literature, teasing apart the concepts of open and 
voluntary implicit in most usages of the term, and I offer a definition in which 
the much maligned possibility of 'forking' is actually an integral aspect of 
openness.
Introduction
 What is often meant by the term 'open' is a 
generalization from the Free Software, Open Source and open standards movements. 
Communities marshaling themselves under these banners cooperatively produce, in 
public view, software, technical standards, or other content that is intended to 
be widely shared.
Free Software and Open Source
 The Free Software movement was begun by Richard 
Stallman at MIT in the 1980s. Previously, computer science operated within the 
scientific norm of collaboration and information sharing. When Stallman found it 
difficult to obtain the source code of a troublesome Xerox printer, he feared 
that the norms of freedom and openness were being challenged by a different, 
proprietary, conceptualization of information. To challenge this shift he 
created the GNU Project in 1984 (Stallman 1998), the Free Software Foundation 
(FSF) in 1985 (Stallman 1996), and the authored the GNU General Public License 
in 1989.
The goal of the GNU Project was to create a free 
version of the UNIX computing environment with which many computer practitioners 
were familiar with, and even contributed to, but was increasingly being 
encumbered with proprietary claims. GNU is playful form of a recursive acronym: 
GNU is Not Unix. The computing environment was supposed to be similar to but 
independent of UNIX and include everything a user needed including an operating 
system kernel (e.g., Hurd) and common applications such as small utilities, text 
editors (e.g., EMACS) and software compilers (e.g,. GCC).
The FSF is now the principle sponsor of the GNU 
Project and focuses on administrative issues such as copyright licenses, policy, 
and funding issues; software development and maintenance is still an activity of 
GNU. The GPL is the FSF's famous copyright license for 'free software'; it 
ensures that the 'freedom' associated with being able to access and modify 
software is maintained with the original software and its derivations. It has 
important safeguards, including its famous 'viral' provision: if you modify and 
distribute software obtained under the GPL license, your derivation also must be 
publicly accessible and licensed under the GPL.
In 1991, Linus Torvalds started development of 
Linux: a UNIX like operating system kernel, the core computer program that 
mediates between applications and the underlying hardware. While it was not part 
of the GNU Project, and differed in design philosophy and aspiration from the 
GNU's kernel (Hurd), it was released under the GPL. While Stallman's stance on 
'freedom' is more ideological, Torvalds approach is more pr"

As excellent as the tremendous benefits that technology has afforded these generations of youths raised in a wired world, some have decided to engage in the dark side of computer technology. The main aim of the study is to explore the how problematic internet use can influence development of delinquent behaviour among emerging adults in higher school of learning. It also explored the role of household financial capabilities of the emerging adults. The study adopted convenient sampling method to select n=386; (50.5% males and 49.5% females) who were aged between 16-27 years from University of Lagos. This cross-sectional study administered standardized instruments to examine the variables (Problematic internet use questionnaire, Disciplinary and delinquent behaviour survey) Result showed no significant difference between problematic internet use and emerging adult delinquency (t(384) = -1.29 P> .05), also, no significant difference between the delinquency of participants from high or low income earners, t(373) = -1.93, P> .05). Therefore, it is expedient to develop safety guidelines that will serve as interplay between digitalization and delinquency in which emerging adults must exercise restraint and broader range of delinquency can be confirmed among other samples.

And that's a thing that's routinely being done, and it's the source of the failure of technocratic dreams that if only we introduced some fantastic new communication machine, the world will be transformed. Where what happens is that the object is made at home in the world that has whatever organisation it already has.
        
        -- Harvey Sacks (Lectures on Conversation Vol. 2., 548-9)
        Chatting, or having a conversation, has long been a favourite activity for people. It seemed so ordinary, if not to say trivial, that it has for almost equally long not been studied in any dedicated way. It was only when Harvey Sacks and his early collaborators started using the tape recorder to study telephone conversations that 'conversation' as a topic has become established (cf. Sacks, Lectures Vol. 1). Inspired by Harold Garfinkel, the perspective chosen was a procedural one: they wanted to analyse how conversations are organised on the spot. As Sacks once said: 
      The gross aim of the work I am doing is to see how finely the details of actual, naturally occurring conversation can be subjected to analysis that will yield the technology of conversation. (Sacks, ""On Doing 'Being Ordinary'"" 411)
      Later, Sacks also started using data from audio-recorded face-to-face encounters. Most of the phenomena that the research on telephone conversation unearthed could also be found in face-to-face data. Whether something was lost by relying on just audio materials was not clear at the beginning. But with video-based research, as initiated by Charles Goodwin in the 1970s, one was later able to demonstrate that visual exchanges did play an essential role the actual organisation of face-to-face conduct. When using telephone technology, people seemed to rely on a restricted set of the interactional procedures used in face-to-face settings. But new ways to deal with both general and setting-specific problems, such as mutual identification, were also developed. Now that an increasing number of people spend various amounts of their time 'online', chatting with friends or whoever is available, it is time to study Computer-Mediated Conversation (CMC), as we previously studied face-to-face conversation and Telephone (Mediated) Conversation, using the same procedural perspective. We may expect that we will encounter many phenomena that have become familiar to us, and that we will be able to use many of the same concepts. But we will probably also see that people have developed new technical variations of familiar themes as they adapt the technology of conversation to the possibilities and limitations of this new technology of communicative mediation. In so doing, they will make the new technology 'at home in the world that has whatever organisation it already has.' 
      Space does not allow a full discussion of the properties of text-based CMC as instantiated in 'chat' environment"
pub.1150878089,‘Creative City’ R.I.P.?,"The Creative City Unlike the terms ‘creative industries’, which nobody ever quite understood, and ‘creative class’, about which actual ‘creatives’ were always ambiguous, the ‘creative city’ has been an incredibly successful global policy meme, to which cities across the world continue to aspire. From the early 1990s, faced with de-industrialisation, rising unemployment, and the increased global mobility of capital, professionals, and consumer-tourists, the ‘creative city’ became an essential part of the new urban imaginary for politicians, planners, local growth coalitions, and advocates and practitioners in art and culture.  In the later 1980s and early 1990s, much of this policy and practice work had progressive intent; as decaying parts of the city acquired new artistic and cultural uses, and neo-bohemian lifestyles and pop-cultural aspirations seemed to provide the grounds for future-oriented urban identities. Whilst investment in iconic cultural buildings and refurbished heritage sites repositioned cities as destinations for global tourism and finance (Peck et al.), new forms of creative production would provide employment and catalyse the wider urban economy. The creative city was to be a benign economy of innovative small businesses, working in projects and acting in symbiosis with the transformed urban landscape of the city (Pratt; Scott). If at first such a “creativity fix” (Peck, Creativity) was permeable to new actors and radical visions, it rapidly became a codified “cookie cutter” approach (Oakley), primarily concerned with revalorising decaying urban built stock as ‘vibrant’ spaces for upmarket urban consumption. This has stretched from visual arts to popular music (Bennett; O’Connor Music). The “creative imaginary” of entrepreneurial subjects—working in flat networks clustered around zones or milieux of intensified creativity (O’Connor and Shaw; O’Connor and Gu)—was quickly localised in spaces of real estate-led consumption, with production corralled into the ‘managed workspace’ whose image value—a shiny ‘creative hub’—was usually worth far more than any actual production taking place inside of it (O’Connor, Art). From the turn of the millennium, this global “fast policy” flowed through elite circuits of ‘policy transfer’ (Peck, Scale): unevenly distributed nodes assembling politicians, public administrators, planners, ‘cool’ developers, cultural consultants, branded arts institutions, and creative ‘thought-leaders’ (De Beukelaer and O’Connor). Global agencies such as UNESCO, through its Creative Cities Network, or consultancies such as Charles Landry and BOP, have attempted to frame this in a benign narrative of ‘hands across the ocean’ cultural globalisation. But we now know from two decades of creative economy proselytising that culture is a “driver and enabler” of development, not a normative standard against which it might be judged. And however inclusive ‘culture’ is made to sound, the creative city agenda remains firmly in t"
pub.1131718826,Exploring a Curatorial Turn in Journalism,"Introduction   Curation-related discourses have become widespread. The growing public profile of curators, the emergence of new curation-related discourses and their proliferation beyond the confines of museums, particularly on social media, have led some to conclude that we now live in an age of curation (Buskirk cited in Synder). Curation is commonly understood in instrumentalist terms as the evaluation, selection and presentation of artefacts around a central theme or motif (see O’Neill; Synder). However, there is a growing academic interest in what underlies the shifting discourses and practices. Many are asking what do these changes mean (Martinon) now that “the curatorial turn” has positioned curation as a legitimate object of academic study (O’Neill).   This article locates an exploration of the curatorial turn in journalism studies since 2010 within the shifting meanings of curation from antiquity to the digital age. It argues that the industry is facing a Foucauldian moment where the changing political economy of news and the proliferation of user-generated content on social media have disrupted the monopolies traditional news media held over the circulation of knowledge of current affairs and the power this gave them to shape public debate. The disruptions are profound, prompting a rethinking of journalism (Peters and Broersma; Schudson). However, debates have polarised between those who view news curation as symptomatic of the demise of journalism and others who see it as part of a wider revival of the profession, freed from monopolistic institutions to circulate a wider array of knowledge and viewpoints (see Picard). This article eschews such polarisations and instead draws on Robert Picard’s argument that journalism is in transition and that journalism, as a set of professional practices, is adapting to the age of curation but that those traditional news providers that fail to adapt will most likely decline.   However, Picard’s approach does not address the definitional problem as to what distinguishes news curating from other journalistic practices when the commonly used instrumental definition can apply to editing. This article aims to negotiate this problem by addressing some of the conceptual ambiguities that arise from wholly instrumental notions of news curation.  From “Cura” to the Curatorial Turn and the Age of Curation   Modern instrumentalist definitions are necessary but not sufficient for an exploration of the curatorial turn in journalism. Tracing the meanings of curation over time facilitates an expansion of the instrumental to include metaphoric conceptualisations. The term originated in a Latin allegory about a mythological figure, personified as the “cura”, translated literally as care or concern, and who created human beings from the clay of the earth. Having created the human, the cura was charged by the gods with the lifelong care of the human (Reich) and at the same time became a symbol of curiosity and creativit"
pub.1164718773,ChatGPT Isn't Magic,"Introduction Author Arthur C. Clarke famously argued that in science fiction literature “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic” (Clarke). On 30 November 2022, technology company OpenAI publicly released their Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer), and instantly it was hailed as world-changing. Initial media stories about ChatGPT highlighted the speed with which it generated new material as evidence that this tool might be both genuinely creative and actually intelligent, in both exciting and disturbing ways. Indeed, ChatGPT is part of a larger pool of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that can very quickly generate seemingly novel outputs in a variety of media formats based on text prompts written by users. Yet, claims that AI has become sentient, or has even reached a recognisable level of general intelligence, remain in the realm of science fiction, for now at least (Leaver). That has not stopped technology companies, scientists, and others from suggesting that super-smart AI is just around the corner. Exemplifying this, the same people creating generative AI are also vocal signatories of public letters that ostensibly call for a temporary halt in AI development, but these letters are simultaneously feeding the myth that these tools are so powerful that they are the early form of imminent super-intelligent machines. For many people, the combination of AI technologies and media hype means generative AIs are basically magical insomuch as their workings seem impenetrable, and their existence could ostensibly change the world. This article explores how the hype around ChatGPT and generative AI was deployed across the first six months of 2023, and how these technologies were positioned as either utopian or dystopian, always seemingly magical, but never banal. We look at some initial responses to generative AI, ranging from schools in Australia to picket lines in Hollywood. We offer a critique of the utopian/dystopian binary positioning of generative AI, aligning with critics who rightly argue that focussing on these extremes displaces the more grounded and immediate challenges generative AI bring that need urgent answers. Finally, we loop back to the role of schools and educators in repositioning generative AI as something to be tested, examined, scrutinised, and played with both to ground understandings of generative AI, while also preparing today’s students for a future where these tools will be part of their work and cultural landscapes. Hype, Schools, and Hollywood In December 2022, one month after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Elon Musk tweeted: “ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI”. Musk’s post was retweeted 9400 times, liked 73 thousand times, and presumably seen by most of his 150 million Twitter followers. This type of engagement typified the early hype and language that surrounded the launch of ChatGPT, with reports that "
pub.1131719173,"Cars, Climates and Subjectivity: Car Sharing and Resisting Hegemonic Automobile Culture?","Al Gore brought climate change into … our living rooms. … The 2008 oil price hikes [and the global financial crisis] awakened the world to potential economic hardship in a rapidly urbanising world where the petrol-driven automobile is still king. (Mouritz 47)   Six hundred million cars (Urry, “Climate Change” 265) traverse the world’s roads, or sit idly in garages and clogging city streets. The West’s economic progress has been built in part around the success of the automotive industry, where the private car rules the spaces and rhythms of daily life. The problem of “automobile dependence” (Newman and Kenworthy) is often cited as one of the biggest challenges facing countries attempting to combat anthropogenic climate change. Sociologist John Urry has claimed that automobility is an “entire culture” that has re-defined movement in the contemporary world (Urry Mobilities 133). As such, it is the single most significant environmental challenge “because of the intensity of resource use, the production of pollutants and the dominant culture which sustains the major discourses of what constitutes the good life” (Urry Sociology 57-8). Climate change has forced a re-thinking of not only how we produce and dispose of cars, but also how we use them. What might a society not dominated by the private, petrol-driven car look like?   Some of the pre-eminent writers on climate change futures, such as Gwynne Dyer, James Lovelock and John Urry, discuss one possibility that might emerge when oil becomes scarce: societies will descend into civil chaos, “a Hobbesian war of all against all” where “regional warlordism” and the most brutish, barbaric aspects of human nature come to the fore (Urry, “Climate Change” 261). Discussing a post-car society, John Urry also proffers another scenario in his “sociologies of the future:” an Orwellian “digital panopticon” in which other modes of transport, far more suited to a networked society, might emerge on a large scale and, in the long run, “might tip the system” into post-car one before it is too late (Urry, “Climate Change” 261). Amongst the many options he discusses is car sharing. Since its introduction in Germany more than 30 years ago, most of the critical literature has been devoted to the planning, environmental and business innovation aspects of car sharing; however very little has been written on its cultural dimensions. This paper analyses this small but developing trend in many Western countries, but more specifically its emergence in Sydney.    The convergence of climate change discourse with that of the global financial crisis has resulted in a focus in the mainstream media, over the last few months, on technologies and practices that might save us money and also help the environment. For instance, a Channel 10 News story in May 2009 focused on the boom in car sharing in Sydney (see: http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=EPTT8vYVXro). Car sharing is an adaptive technology that doesn’t do away with the car altogether"
pub.1164700003,Metamodern Spell Casting : The Blockchain as a Conceptual Medium for Contemporary Visual Artists,"There are spells in the world: incantations that can transform reality through the power of procedural utterances. The marriage vow, the courtroom sentence, the shaman’s curse: these words are codes that change reality. (Finn 90) Introduction As a child, stories on magic were “opportunities to escape from reality” (Brugué and Llompart 1), or what Rosengren and Hickling describe as being part of a set of “causal belief systems” (77). As an adult, magic is typically seen as being “pure fantasy” (Rosengren and Hickling 75), while Bever argues that magic is something lost to time and materialism, and alternatively a skill that Yeats believed that anyone could develop with practice. The etymology of the word magic originates from magein, a Greek word used to describe “the science and religion of the priests of Zoroaster”, or, according to philologist Skeat, from Greek megas (great), thus signifying ""the great science” (Melton 956). Not to be confused with sleight of hand or illusion, magic is traditionally associated with learned people, held in high esteem, who use supernatural or unseen forces to cause change in people and affect events. To use magic these people perform rituals and ceremonies associated with religion and spirituality and include people who may identify as Priests, Witches, Magicians, Wiccans, and Druids (Otto and Stausberg). Magic as Technology and Technology as Magic Although written accounts of the rituals and ceremonies performed by the Druids are rare, because they followed an oral tradition and didn’t record knowledge in a written form (Aldhouse-Green 19), they are believed to have considered magic as a practical technology to be used for such purposes as repelling enemies and divining lost items. They curse and blight humans and districts, raise storms and fogs, cause glamour and delusion, confer invisibility, inflict thirst and confusion on enemy warriors, transform people into animal shape or into stone, subdue and bind them with incantations, and raise magical barriers to halt attackers. (Hutton 33) Similarly, a common theme in The History of Magic by Chris Gosden is that magic is akin to science or mathematics—something to be utilised as a tool when there is a need, as well as being used to perform important rituals and ceremonies. In TechGnosis: Myth, Magic & Mysticism in the Age of Information, Davis discusses ideas on Technomysticism, and Thacker says that “the history of technology—from hieroglyphics to computer code—is itself inseparable from the often ambiguous exchanges with something nonhuman, something otherworldly, something divine. Technology, it seems, is religion by other means, then as now” (159). Written language, communication, speech, and instruction has always been used to transform the ordinary in people’s lives. In TechGnosis, Davis (32) cites Couliano (104): historians have been wrong in concluding that magic disappeared with the advent of 'quantitative science.’ The latter has simply substituted itse"
pub.1131719865,Measurable Progress? Teaching Artsworkers to Assess and Articulate the Impact of Their Work,"The National Cultural Policy Discussion Paper—drafted to assist the Australian Government in developing the first national Cultural Policy since Creative Nation nearly two decades ago—envisages a future in which arts, cultural and creative activities directly support the development of an inclusive, innovative and productive Australia. ""The policy,"" it says, ""will be based on an understanding that a creative nation produces a more inclusive society and a more expressive and confident citizenry by encouraging our ability to express, describe and share our diverse experiences—with each other and with the world"" (Australian Government 3).   Even a cursory reading of this Discussion Paper makes it clear that the question of impact—in aesthetic, cultural and economic terms—is central to the Government's agenda in developing a new Cultural Policy. Hand-in-hand with the notion of impact comes the process of measurement of progress. The Discussion Paper notes that progress ""must be measurable, and the Government will invest in ways to assess the impact that the National Cultural Policy has on society and the economy"" (11). If progress must be measurable, this raises questions about what arts, cultural and creative workers do, whether it is worth it, and whether they could be doing it better.  In effect, the Discussion Paper pushes artsworkers ever closer to a climate in which they have to be skilled not just at making work, but at making the impact of this work clear to stakeholders. The Government in its plans for Australia's cultural future, is clearly most supportive of artsworkers who can do this, and the scholars, educators and employers who can best train the artsworkers of the future to do this.   Teaching Artsworkers to Measure the Impact of Their Work: The Challenges  How do we train artsworkers to assess, measure and articulate the impact of what they do? How do we prepare them to be ready to work in a climate that will—as the National Cultural Policy Discussion Paper makes clear—emphasise measuring impact, communicating impact, and communicating impact across aesthetic, cultural and economic categories? As educators delivering training in this area, the Discussion Paper has made this already compelling question even more pressing as we work to develop the career-ready graduates the Government seeks.   Our program, the Master of Creative Industries (Creative Production & Arts Management) offered in the Creative Industries Faculty at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, is, like most programs in arts and cultural management in the US, UK, Europe and Australia, offering a three-Semester postgraduate program that allows students to develop the career-ready skills required to work as managers of arts, cultural or creative organisations.

pub.1131719592,Freedom from Choice,"On May 18, 2003, the Australian Minister for Education, Brendon Nelson, appeared on the Channel Nine Sunday programme.  The Yoda of political journalism, Laurie Oakes, attacked him personally and professionally.  He disclosed to viewers that the Minister for Education, Science and Training had suffered a false start in his education, enrolling in one semester of an economics degree that was never completed.  The following year, he commenced a medical qualification and went on to become a practicing doctor.  He did not pay fees for any of his University courses.   When reminded of these events, Dr Nelson became agitated, and revealed information not included in the public presentation of the budget of that year, including a ‘cap’ on HECS-funded places of five years for each student.  He justified such a decision with the cliché that Australia’s taxpayers do not want “professional students completing degree after degree.”  The Minister confirmed that the primary – and perhaps the only – task for university academics was to ‘train’ young people for the workforce.  The fact that nearly 50% of students in some Australian Universities are over the age of twenty five has not entered his vision.  He wanted young people to complete a rapid degree and enter the workforce, to commence paying taxes and the debt or loan required to fund a full fee-paying place.

	Now – nearly two years after this interview and with the Howard government blessed with a new mandate – it is time to ask how this administration will order education and value teaching and learning.  The curbing of the time available to complete undergraduate courses during their last term in office makes plain the Australian Liberal Government’s stance on formal, publicly-funded lifelong learning.  The notion that a student/worker can attain all required competencies, skills, attributes, motivations and ambitions from a single degree is an assumption of the new funding model.  It is also significant to note that while attention is placed on the changing sources of income for universities, there have also been major shifts in the pattern of expenditure within universities, focusing on branding, marketing, recruitment, ‘regional’ campuses and off-shore courses.  Similarly, the short-term funding goals of university research agendas encourage projects required by industry, rather than socially inflected concerns. There is little inevitable about teaching, research and education in Australia, except that the Federal Government will not create a fully-funded model for lifelong learning.  The task for those of us involved in – and committed to – education in this environment is to probe the form and rationale for a (post) publicly funded University.

pub.1131719144,"“Damn I Didn’t Know Y’all Was Sad? I Thought It Was Just Memes”: Irony, Memes and Risk in Internet Depression Culture","Depression memes are a widespread phenomenon across all social media platforms. To get your hit of depression memes, you can go to any number of pages on Facebook, the subreddit “2me4meirl”, where the posts that are “too real” for more mainstream subreddits go, but nevertheless counting over one million subscribers or, on Instagram, and find innumerable accounts dedicated to “sad memes”, many with tens to hundreds of thousands of followers. In a recent study, depression memes were found to be responsible for 35 per cent of the content researchers analysed in the “#depressed” hashtag on Instagram (McCosker and Gerrard). As a subculture, it is one that has truly embraced the polyvocality of memes, allowing many voices to speak at once through their lack of fixed meaning (Milner). In depression memes, polyvocality allows the user to identify with any number of anxieties affectively represented by the memes without being authentically tied to them, under the guise of irony. Therefore, depression memes find themselves being used in a myriad of ways that do not refer to a stable structure of meaning. This allows me to problematise their roles as both masks and intimate texts within an ironic meme culture.Drawing on traditional readings of irony such as Wayne C. Booth but also contemporary approaches to authenticity, mask cultures and meme culture (de Zeeuw; Tuters), this article situates depression memes specifically within neoliberal regimes of feeling, manifested both in online practices of authenticity and the subject of value (Skeggs and Yuill) and in discourses of resilience and accountability surrounding mental health (Fullagar et al.; James; McCosker). It argues that an internet depression culture based on the principles of dissimulation serves both the purpose of protection from recuperation by dominant narratives but paradoxically creates an ambiguity that generates that risk. In this way, I speak to current anxieties surrounding memes, including ambiguity, irony, and identity formation.Internet Depression Culture Intrinsic to their nature as memes, depression memes can be found in a variety of spaces, formats and platforms. The ones below (Figure 1) circulate on mainstream social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram through accounts dedicated to “sadposting” or the sharing of mental illness memes. They refer to overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a lack of will to live and a desire to recover. In their recent study on hashtagging depression on Instagram, McCosker and Gerrard found memes to be responsible for a wide range of content in the “depressed” hashtag on the platform. They argue that the use of the hashtag “depressed” is primarily as a “memetic device, often with a sense of irreverence, subversiveness and pathos, but in an effort to use the connective power of the popular tag to gain attention and Likes” (McCosker & Gerrard 9). Intimacy and memes as identity performance are therefore intimately intertwined, espousing the memetic l"

Paolo Hospital –“Università degli Studi”) Differently to locomotion, chewing movements have a kinesiotopic representation in the sensorymotor cortex of some species. Nevertheless the basic pattern of chewing are present also in decerebrated animals and are controlled by a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) in the brainstem. Direct stimulation of many subcortical areas (amygdala among others) may evoke a chewing pattern. Amygdala has direct connections that end on masticatory motoneurons. Automatisms in the International Glossary are defined as: “A more or less coordinated, repetitive, motor activity usually occurring when cognition is impaired and for which the subject is usually amnesic afterward. This often resembles a voluntary movement and may consist of an inappropriate continuation of ongoing preictal motor activity” (1). Oroalimentary automatisms are: lip smacking, lip pursing, chewing, licking, tooth grinding or swallowing. The localizing effort for different ictal symptoms should always be contextualized into the individual seizure, but we could grossly subdivide in a localizing effort: ‐ visceral‐vegetative movements (suprasilvian region): swallowing (especially as an isolated symptom), spiting (for an excess of saliva), licking, chewing with more mechanical characteristics. ‐ictal chewing (food crushing and grinding) (amygdala) Oroalimentary automatisms may be present also as a post‐ictal phenomenon. Recently Meletti et al.(2) reported a case of ictal rhythmic teeth grinding In particular, these data suggest that brainstem central pattern generators for masticatory activity can be set in motion in different conditions to generate rhythmic jaw muscle activities that share similar EMG and autonomic features. The trigger event can be an increased level of arousal, as occurs in sleep bruxism, or an epileptic discharge, as observed in this particular patient.

pub.1139029999,Room without Room,"Not only is it weirdly hard to evaluate what you yourself look like … but it turned out that consumers’ instinctively skewed self-perception, plus vanity-related stress, meant that they began preferring and then outright demanding videophone masks that were really quite a lot better-looking than they themselves were in person. High-def mask-entrepreneurs were ready and willing to supply not just verisimilitude but aesthetic enhancement. — David Foster Wallace, Infinite Jest (148) To combat the physical and emotional effects of Zoom Face, “cosmetic injectables … give a natural, rejuvenated appearance.” — Stacey Leasca, Forbes (quoting medical aesthetician Gabby Garritano) Technological forms of life are disembedded, they are somehow “lifted out”. As lifted out, they take on increasingly less and less the characteristic of any particular place, and can be any place or indeed no place. This lifted-out space of placelessness is … characterised not so much by a multiple of identities, but by an absence of identity. Its context is no context at all … . In all cases, social interaction is on a different level from ordinary forms of life.   — Scott Lash, Critique of Information (21) Introduction: Communication-Image To zoom, in its original verb form, describes a decisive movement of a body through space, as in the abrupt upward climb of an aircraft, or a modulation of the space between two bodies, as in the play between the film camera and its subject (“Zoom”). The term carries connotations of speed, distance, proximity; it is suffused with kinetic energy and intensified affection. Zoom, Inc.—the pandemic era’s prevailing video communications platform—inverts these received senses of the word, as it liquidates the body, prunes away affective charge, and promotes an insipid aesthetic of atomised talking heads, rigid grids, noise suppression, and facile customisation. Along the way, the screen experience becomes increasingly dominated by a preponderance of talk. As we acclimate more to the look and feel, and to the attendant routines of working and learning and socialising from home, the platform refashions the screen from an aesthetic surface to a channel of multimodal communication, from a vehicle for the circulation of affect to one for the circulation of verbal, visual, and text-based information. This essay takes aim at Zoom in its principle, normative form, as enterprise software developed for professional and educational uses. The ensuing critique is thus not directed at art and craft adoptions, at hobbyists, or at the many creative, experimental, or otherwise alternative deployments of the software. Rather, in enumerating some of the more numbing, oppressive features and effects of the Zoom standard, I hope to supply some basic benchmarks for what such alternative uses might strive for, beginning with a resuscitation of affect, embodiment, and aesthetic experience. For Massumi, affect derives from movements of and in the body, circumscribing a “re"

Since a high proportion of seizures may be subclinical, diagnosis requires continuous electroencephalography (EEG). We hypothesized that (i) EEG seizures are common during therapeutic hypothermia following CA and (ii) the background patterns would evolve during hypothermia and re‐warming, and (iii) the background abnormalities would be associated with survival and short‐term outcome. Methods: As part of a feasibility study of therapeutic hypothermia in children, we performed a prospective, pilot, observational study of 10 consecutive children undergoing continuous EEG monitoring during epochs of hypothermia (24 hrs), re‐warming (12–24 hours), and an additional 24 hrs. EEG seizures were identified and the background during each epoch was described in a standardized manner. A standardized neurological exam was performed on day 5–7 to provide a cerebral injury score (CIS), rated from normal to profoundly abnormal. Results: Ten patients were studied from March to December 2007 with a mean age 19.9 ± 17.5 mo (range 2.2–51.2 mo). EEG monitoring began within 4 hours of hypothermia initiation in all. Over 720 hours of EEG were reviewed. Electrographic seizures occurred in 5/10 (50%) patients and began during the second 12 hours of hypothermia in 3 and during re‐warming in 2. Most seizures were subclinical and electrographically generalized. Eight patients with initially mild/moderate EEG background abnormalities (discontinuity, slowing, attenuation) improved during warming; 2 patients with initially severe background abnormalities (burst suppression) had EEG worsening (longer duration suppression and status epilepticus). Background abnormalities did not predict seizures. Of the two patients with severe background abnormalities, one survivor had a severely abnormal CIS and one died. Of the eight patients with initial mild/moderate background abnormalities, 2 survivors did not have a CIS, 3 had a mild/moderate CIS, and 2 had a severe CIS (1 died). Thus, 1 of 2 (50%) with severe background abnormalities died while 1 of 8 (13%) with mild/moderate background abnormalities died. Also, death or severe CIS occurred in 2 of 2 (100%) with severely abnormal EEG background but only 2 of 6 (33%) with mild/moderate background abnormalities. Conclusions: Seizures occurred in half of those undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after CA and were mostly subclini"

Methods: All children with epilepsy ages 3–17 whom had a non‐epileptic sibling in same age group seen thru the Neurology Clinic at the Alberta Children's Hospital were identified as potential participants for the study. Parents were asked to complete Global Quality of Life Linear scales for both children and Hague Restrictions in Epilepsy Scales and Impact of Child Neurologic Disability Scales for the child with epilepsy. Results: Fifty children with epilepsy (age range 3–17, gender M 25, F 25) and Fifty siblings who acted as the controls (age range 3–17 gender M 20 – F 30) participated in the study. Quality of life measurement using the Global Quality of Life Linear Scale was significantly different (p < 0.0001) betwen children with epilepsy (4.57 ± 0.92) and their siblings (5.30 ± 0.71). The HARCES found the average score of 18.89 Of the 49 children who completed this scale 3 (6%)scored 10 (no disability) 23 (47%) scored 11–15 (slight disability) 13 (26%) scored between 16–25,Mild 4 (8%) 26–30 moderate 6 (12%) 31–40 severe disability. On the ICNDS average was 40 with a range of (0–108) 14 scored than 20 (less impact), (28%) 20 scored 21–50 (40%) (moderate impact),with 16 scoring 50–108 (32%) (severe impact). Conclusions: Epilepsy has a negative impact on the quality of life of children, children in the same family with the same parents have statistically significant differnces in quality of life scores.

 5W Neuro/ENT, Mayo Clinic Hospital, Arizona, Phoenix, AZ Rationale: Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB) is a nation‐wide research initiative, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ) and supported by the Institute for Health Care Improvement. The overall aim of TCAB is to help hospital based nurses redesign delivery of work processes to improve patient care. Outcomes are assessed through comparison of baseline and ongoing measures including: work environment and culture; patient centeredness; number and types of innovations tested and sustained; and nursing variables that include, but are not limited to, adverse events (drug events, patient falls, and pressure ulcers) Patients admitted to the EMU are at greater risk for falls and injury than the general medical surgical patient population therefore any initiative to enhance an already comprehensive safety protocol for EMU patients is welcomed. Methods: 5W a medical‐surgical unit with an integrated EMU embraced the TCAB philosophy in June 2007. As just one TCAB innovation, RN Hourly Rounds specifically pertains to the iss"

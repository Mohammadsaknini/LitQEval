Rice farmers have the option to choose what application to use in their field to control insect pests. In this, they have to consider the cost, availability, field and hazardous conditions. However, to get a better result, this experiment should be repeated during suitable seasons."
pub.1135235186,Exploring the Challenges Posed by Regulations for the Use of Drones in Agriculture in the African Context,"Global food demands have led to the rapid introduction of Information Communication Technology (ICT) innovations in the agriculture sector—one such innovation is drone technology. Drones are used in precision agriculture, including aerial observation, sensing, and the spraying of pesticides. Regulations on the use of drones are necessary because drones can violate privacy rules, data protection rights, and public peace. However, many African countries have either very restrictive regulations, or no proper regulation in place, making the process of acquiring a license for drone operation cumbersome. In this study, we present the results of a literature review that explores the current drone regulations in Sub-Saharan Africa and the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) and survey study whereby we have interviewed the relevant stakeholders, in order to understand the challenges posed by the regulations to the effective use of drones for agriculture. The results indicate that the regulations contain about 40 to 85 per cent of the provisions of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) manual on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPASs). In addition, whilst the SLR focused on the technology, safety, ethics and regulatory hurdles towards drones, the interviewees focused on the need for skill and awareness among the responsible authorities to enforce regulations, and the need for sustainability and participatory process in defining regulations."

A comprehensive review on automated weather stations, robotics and drones in agriculture will serve as a quick reference. The possibility of using open source micro controllers such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi are also briefly discussed. Practical experience on the design and fabrication of these components in Eritrea, a sub-Saharan African country is also shared in detail. One among the three developmental explorations was the design, fabrication, programing and evaluation of a sensor integrated, micro controller based, solar powered farm weather monitoring unit. Another investigation on the development of a rover type Agro-robot is narrated in detail giving the step by step procedure understandable to persons with a little bit of technical knowledge. The comprehensive account of methodologies for the crop monitoring drone will serve as a practical guide in utilizing the technology in low income countries. The book also provides information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on agriculture. A brief prognosticated analysis on possibilities of using robotics and automation in post COVID-19 agriculture is also done. As automated systems in agriculture are going to be more crucial in the coming days, this book can serve as a guide for a beginner, reference for a researcher and knowledge bank for an academician."
pub.1156031584,Evaluation of Spray Drift of Plant Protection Drone Nozzles Based on Wind Tunnel Test,"The use of drones in agriculture is expanding at a brisk pace in crop production due to the superiority in precision, efficiency, and safety of their applicators. However, their potential drift risk also raises concern for users and regulatory authorities. The method of wind tunnel research can effectively evaluate the weighted influence of each drift factor, especially the drift characteristics of the nozzle and spray solution. Based on the wind tunnel test results, centrifugal nozzles have a higher drift risk than hydraulic nozzles, even with a similar DV50. The cumulative drift rate of the centrifugal nozzle at 2 m downwind was 90.1% compared to the LU12001 nozzle’s 40.6% under the wind speed of 3.5 m/s. Compared with the same coding as the flat fan hydraulic nozzle, the IDK nozzle can effectively reduce the drift rate. For the tested nozzles, DV50 and wind speed had a linear relationship with drift rate, and the sampling location had an exponential or logarithmic relationship with drift rate. Spray adjuvants, especially modified vegetable oils, had a significant effect on reducing the amount of drift. The results of this experiment provide a reference for the selection of nozzles and the addition of spray adjuvants. Further clarifying the spray drift characteristics of drones until a drift prediction model is available is still the focus of research."

pub.1146096116,Sustainability in the Digital Farming Era: A Cyber-Physical Analysis Approach for Drone Applications in Agriculture 4.0,"This research introduces an integrated approach for the ex-ante analysis of technology innovations in agriculture, like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to foster the envisaged sustainable transformation in farming operations. The strategic foresight process of global institutions recognizes the beneficial role of “digital twins” in agriculture for ensuring natural resources’ stewardship and farmers’ livelihood. However, farmers often encounter ambiguities in comprehending the operationalization of digital technologies in agricultural fields as the related scientific and experimental evidence myopically focus on the technical specifications of the respective machinery. Indicatively, the adoption of UAVs for informing decisions related to precision irrigation is often overlooked, while the pertinent literature is sparse and dispersed. This research facilitates the adoption of UAVs for freshwater stewardship in farming operations by: (i) identifying and summarizing advantages and disadvantages related to the utilization of UAVs (commonly known as drones) in agriculture; and (ii) examining “digital twins” in agriculture by proposing a cyber-physical analysis approach for UAVs supporting precision irrigation activities. Specifically, this research develops an emulation model that helps interrogate a UAV’s operational aspects with regard to monitoring water stress levels in an orchard and then implements equivalent real-world intelligent aerial systems for the autonomous identification of the water status of plants to inform precision irrigation operations in an agricultural field."
pub.1156038299,Applications of Drones in Smart Agriculture,"The application of drones in agriculture has opened-up a new horizon to increase the agriculture outputs and real-time access to high-quality information. Crop monitoring has become a simple task with the emergence of drone-based data collection, replacing the traditional labor-intensive and time-consuming data collection. Drones can assist in precision agriculture by performing variety of agricultural tasks including soil health monitoring, seed planting, fertilizer application, crop stress management, irrigation schedule planning, weed management, crop yield management, and weather analysis. Drones with infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral sensors can analyze crop health and soil conditions precisely and accurately. Spraying drones can help to reduce operator exposure while also improving the capacity to distribute chemicals in a timely and spatially resolved manner. Farmers can save time and water by recognizing areas that need a lot of water. At the same time, precision farming techniques can increase crop yield and quality. Drones can offer various solutions in many areas of agriculture and allied sciences such as yield monitoring, scouting and bird scaring in horticulture, crop health monitoring, forest diseases mapping, monitoring fish farm and livestock population, and mapping feed and fodder grasses in livestock management. The plethoras of drone-based applications in agriculture on spatiotemporal scales make it a promising futuristic technology to address the challenge of growing food insecurity."
pub.1164167574,Drones in agriculture: Analysis of different countries,"This article provides an exhaustive, comparative study on the integration and utilization of drones in agricultural practices across various nations. The authors first illuminate the general applications of drones, highlighting their use in crop monitoring, health assessment, irrigation management, and precise pesticide application. The advantages of drone use, such as improved crop yields, reduced environmental impact, and economic efficiency, are discussed in detail. Subsequently, the authors embark on a country-wise analysis, examining the adoption rate and regulatory frameworks of drones in countries like the USA, China, Brazil, Australia, and several European and African nations. In the United States, for instance, drones are widely used and are supported by progressive regulations. China, in contrast, demonstrates a higher adoption rate but faces more significant regulatory challenges. The analysis also reveals how developing nations in Africa and South America, while presenting potential for agricultural drones, still grapple with infrastructural, economic, and knowledge barriers. The authors note that even though the use of drones is still relatively nascent, the technology has already made significant contributions to sustainable and efficient agricultural practices. They also contend that with further technological advancement and regulatory support, drones can revolutionize global agriculture. The article closes by advocating for policy changes that would encourage drone use in agriculture, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, it calls for research into affordable and easy-to-operate drone technology, suggesting that this could help overcome some of the adoption barriers faced by farmers in less economically advantaged regions."
pub.1157797576,Enabling Cost-effective Wireless Data Collection by Piggybacking on Delivery Drones in Agriculture,"
                    Drones have drawn considerable attention as the agents in wireless data collection for agricultural applications, by virtue of their three-dimensional mobility and dominant line-of-sight communication channels. Existing works mainly exploit dedicated drones via deployment and maintenance, which is insufficient regarding resource and cost-efficiency. In contrast, leveraging existing delivery drones for the data collection on their way of delivery, called
                    delivery drones’ piggybacking
                    , is a promising solution. For achieving such cost-efficiency, drone scheduling inevitably stands in front, but the delivery missions involved have escalated it to a wholly different and unexplored problem. As an attempt, we first survey 514 delivery workers and conduct field experiments; noticeably, the collection cost, which mostly comes from the energy consumption of drones’ piggybacking, is determined by the decisions on
                    package-route scheduling
                    and
                    data collection time distribution
                    . Based on such findings, we build a new model that jointly optimizes these two decisions to maximize data collection amount, subject to the collection budget and delivery constraints. Further model analysis finds it a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming problem, which is NP-hard. The major challenge stems from interdependence entangling the two decisions. For this point, we propose
                    Delta
                    , a
                    
                      \(\frac{1}{9+\delta } \)
                    
                    -approximation delivery drone scheduling algorithm. The key idea is to
                    devise an approximate collection time distribution scheme leveraging energy slicing, which transforms the complex problem with two interdependent variables into a submodular function maximization problem only with one variable
                    . The theoretical proofs and extensive evaluations verify the effectiveness and the near-optimal performance of
                    Delta

pub.1125082029,Smart Agriculture: The Age of Drones in Agriculture,"The purpose of this project is to provide a helping hand to our farmers in their difficult work of farming. The idea is to use swarm technology (one main drone rest 3–4 worker drones) in the agricultural field to solve problems related to farming. Today AI sensors have made the work for humans very easy. Similarly, in this project, drones will be equipped with different sensors like hyperspectral, thermal and LiDAR. These sensors will be used to solve problems like weed detection, drought condition detection, water stress, nitrogen content etc. Hyperspectral sensors are more precise and accurate than multispectral sensors in detecting minerals and vegetation, which will help in maintaining the plant nutrient status, identifying plant disease, water quality assessment and surface chemical composition. Thermal sensors measure the surface temperature of land and objects and create their thermal images for further analysis [1]. Then theses created thermal images are analyzed for identifying any heat stress, water stress, and plant metabolism from their canopy temperature. LiDAR sensors are laser equipped and use a laser beam to create 3D models of crops to identify drought stress and to optimize water use. LiDAR sensors are used to measure the vegetation level, the topography of the ground underneath. As an initiative, authors tried to apply this project in a small scale but if this initiative become successful, this can be applied in a large scale to provide more and more help to our farmers."
pub.1155397384,Drone for Agriculture: A way forward,"Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are most commonly associated with military, industrial, and other specialised operations. However, with recent developments in the areas of sensors and information technology in the last two decades, the scope of drones has been widened to include other areas such as agriculture. As the world’s population grows,it is expected to reach 9 billion people by 2055, resulting in increased agricultural consumption. It is critical to meet everyone’s eating needs. Agriculture is the most promising sector, but it is currently beset by a slew of issues, one of which is a labour shortage in the farming industry. Extreme weather events, insufficient fertilizer, poor fertilizer application, infection, diseases, allergies, and other health problems caused by chemical application (fungicide, pesticide, insecticide, etc.) or insect/animal bites are some of the additional challenges or difficulties. The application of sophisticated technologies in agriculture, such as drones, has the potential to confront a number of large and minor challenges. Irrigation, crop monitoring, soil and field analysis, and bird control are the most common uses of drones in agriculture.Drones are growing smarter as they incorporate open source technology, sophisticated sensors, greater integration, longer flight times, and the ability to hunt down criminals as well as to detect forests and other disaster regions. The purpose of this study paper is to highlight the importance of drones in agriculture and to go over the best drones on the market for agricultural monitoring and observation in order to improve crop quality and prevent damage to fields."
pub.1120645205,Affordable Broad Agile Farming System for Rural and Remote Area,"We develop a fast-deployed crop health monitoring system using state-of-the-art technologies to collect data from crop fields in order to take appropriate and timely actions. For the proposed resource optimized system, Saudi Arabian agriculture is taken as a case study. To achieve the desire goals, we harness IoT (Internet of Things) and drones in agriculture to establish rapid system deployment. This paper focuses on the data collection from crop field by organizing heterogeneous IoT devices in clusters and localise them for data harvesting. Clusters are formed by considering the path of UAVs, sensors heterogeneity, weather conditions, fluctuation of sensor nodes, and the communication cost of IoT devices. For localisation, carrying larger or heavier arrays of antennas and receivers with a small size UAV is also a major issue considered in this paper. Hence, we introduce a dynamic clustering and virtual antenna array to develop a complete data collection scheme supported by simulations and experimental tests with proof-of-concept devices. The results are analysed and found promising in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, ease of use, and deployment time. Whole the system is developed with the concept that it can install in rural and remote area with minimum deployment time and agile enough that can collect data in worst conditions (bad weather, hostile environment, fluctuating nodes, poor infrastructure, with or without an established network). In broader sense it can map easily in many similar applications where data is needed to be harvested from a wide range of heterogeneous sensors without existing any infrastructure and ground topology."
pub.1155374293,Trend in Sustainable Mechanization of Indian Agriculture,"Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the Indian economy contributing 18.5% of national income, about 15% of total exports and supporting two-thirds of the work force. At the same time, biotic and abiotic stresses, degrading and depleting land and water resources and climate change are major challenges for sustainable agricultural production and productivity. The small and marginal land holdings (less than 2.0 ha) account for more than 86% of land holdings. The labour availability in agriculture is expected to go down to 26% of total workforce by 2047. Mechanizing small and non-contiguous group of small farms is against ‘economies of scale’ for individual ownership of farm machinery. With no possibility of increase in net cultivated area and diminishing farm labour availability, intensive agriculture with higher input use efficiency is essential for the growth of Indian agriculture in near future. Farm power and agricultural machinery are essential inputs for sustainable agricultural production and productivity to feed India’s burgeoning population. The intensification of crop production must be sustainable with low environmental footprint. A holistic, value-chain approach is necessary for agricultural mechanization, going beyond green production  through precision agriculture and digital agriculture. Precision agriculture for region specific crop planning, controlled precision application of inputs (seeds, fertilisers, chemicals, water, etc), multi-functional farm equipment to conserve energy and to reduce turnaround time, application of drones in agriculture, application of sensors, micro-processor and computer in agriculture are some of the futuristic technologies that need more attention for sustainable agriculture in India. There is a need to simplify these technologies and make them cost-efficient for maximum adoption at the farmers’  level."
pub.1160583956,Evaluation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Precision Agriculture Based on Integrated Fuzzy Decision-Making Approach,"The drone, also known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), offers significant advantages for precision agriculture by reducing the need for conventional farming practices that require more manpower. The use of drones in agriculture offers significant economic and time-saving benefits. The evaluation of UAVs’ performance is urgently needed in light of their proliferation in agriculture during the past few decades. This evaluation falls under the complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem due to the existence of multicriteria, criteria importance, and trade-offs or conflicts amongst them. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to offer an integrated fuzzy MCDM approach based on two significant methods. The first method is the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) method for calculating the UAV criteria (i.e., payload, endurance, and dimensions) weight coefficients. The second method is the fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) for UAV alternative selection based on individual and group decision-making (GDM) settings. The decision matrix used in the selection approach of UAV categories is formulated based on the intersection of payload, endurance, and dimensions criteria and the UAV alternatives list. The findings show that (1) the FWZIC has effectively determined the criteria weights with a zero inconsistency rate. The maximum weight value is given to the payload criterion (0.428), whereas the dimension criterion was given the least value weight (0.199). (2) In the context of GDM, FDOSM is used to eliminate the dissimilarity between individual MCDM results across all categories of UAV. Finally, objective validation and sensitivity analysis were utilized to evaluate the strength of UAV selection results."

pub.1107389447,Drones-based sensor platforms,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aerial systems (UAS), better known as drones, in a technological context are unmanned aircrafts that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously. They work in conjunction with GPS and others sensors mounted on them. The total addressable value of drone-powered solutions in all applicable industries is significant – more than USD 127 billion, according to a recent PwC analysis. Drones have been mostly associated with military and warfare in the past but keeping pace with technological advancements, they have found application in a plethora of disciplines. With the world population projected to reach 9 billion by 2050 and agricultural consumption expected to increase by 70 percent over the same period, agri-producers need to embrace emerging technological advancements such as UAVs. Drones in agriculture are simply a low-cost aerial camera platform, equipped with an autopilot using GPS and sensors for collecting relevant data. They can be compared to a regular point-and-shoot camera for visible images, but whereas a regular camera can provide some information about plant growth, coverage and other things, a multispectral sensor expands the utility of the technique and allows farmers to see things that cannot be seen in the visible spectrum, such as moisture content in the soil, plant health, stress levels and fruits. These could help overcome the various limitations that hinder agricultural production. PwC estimates the potential market for drone-powered solutions in agriculture at USD 32.4 billion. UAVs application in agriculture opens the gateway to access real time information on the farm. It can be used at different stages throughout the cropping cycle"
pub.1155662990,ICT application for promotion of integrated farming system,"ICT is an umbrella term that includes communication devices like computer, mobile phone, radio, television, network hardware, satellite system etc. as well as services like audio and video call, text and multimedia messages. During first decade of twenty- first century, there had been spurt in experimentation of ICT in agriculture by the government, private, co-operative and non-government organizations (NGOs). The initiatives gave mixed result of success and failures. The initial challenges like lack of power back up, poor connectivity, high cost, lack of computer literacy and absence of digital content are disappearing at a faster rate. The growth in network infrastructure, cloud computing, decreasing price of computer and mobile phone and digital literacy have increased the internet access.  The present-day initiatives involve multiple channels like web, mobile app, SMS and IVR in multiple languages. At the same time the gamut of information has been increasing from crop specific information to value chain information. The emergence of social media has opened new vista for agricultural extension through which two-way information in multimedia format can be exchanged at virtually no cost.  These technologies can effectively be used for promotion of IFS. However, the response of research and extension system is not very encouraging. The extension professionals should gear up to develop technical competence and exposure so that content could be developed as per channel and in local language of the clients. The frontier technologies like sensor based diagnostic equipments, remote sensing and GIS, GPS technology as well as robotics and drone in agriculture are poised to change the landscape of agricultural extension."
pub.1158179367,Can Drones Help Smallholder Farmers Improve Agriculture Efficiencies and Reduce Food Insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa? Local Perceptions from Malawi,"Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa play a vital role in achieving food security and nutrition, yet they are often overlooked by development policies and lack access to the technology and information needed to increase their agricultural productivity. This is particularly true in Malawi, where smallholder farmers make up over 80% of the population and face a range of risks and challenges, including vulnerability to climate change, that threaten their livelihoods, food security, and nutrition. While drones and precision agriculture technology have had a significant impact on agriculture in high-income countries, their application by smallholder farmers in low-income countries is not well understood. This study, conducted in 2022, examines how drones can assist smallholder farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity and food security in Malawi. It explores how smallholders perceive the use of drones and the potential benefits and limitations of using drones in their farming operations. A unique aspect of this study aims to understand smallholders’ perceptions of open data and data privacy. The results show that when smallholder farmers interact with drone data, they have a better understanding of their farm and are able to make more informed decisions that use fewer inputs and reduce production costs. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for drones to assist smallholder farmers improve their on-farm knowledge, increase agricultural productivity, and mitigate the risks and challenges they face, leading to improved livelihoods and a more sustainable and secure food supply. Policymakers can promote the adoption of drone technology among smallholder farmers by developing policies that encourage public–private partnerships to create affordable, locally adapted drone technologies and programs that meet their unique needs, while also ensuring responsible use of drones in agriculture through regulations that address concerns about data privacy and security."
pub.1149579891,ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF DRONE USE IN AGRICULTURE,"The article analyzes the market of drones for agricultural activities as part of the concept of precision farming; the classification of agricultural drones by structure, use and cameras installed on them is given; the analysis of the world market of drones for today is carried out, and efficiency of introduction of drones in agriculture (on an example of plant growing) is calculated. To analyze the global market for agricultural drones, data were taken from analytical reports and reviews of companies such as: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Markets and Markets, Mordor Intelligence, Fortune Business Insider. The authors used the following research methods: observation method, index analysis, economic-mathematical modeling and deductive method for drawing conclusions. The study was conducted in several stages. First, the classification of drones by structure, use and type of video cameras was studied. At the second stage, on the basis of analytical reports of reputable international companies analyzed the current state of the agricultural drone market and its capacity; identified the prerequisites for the development of the agricultural drone market and the factors that have the greatest impact on the industry; the forecast on the future possible development of the agricultural drone market is analyzed, and the main market players are identified, indicating the country of origin of the companies. At the third stage, the analysis of the introduction of drone technology in crop production for aerial photography and fertilizer application was carried out. The article develops two possible scenarios of farmer's behavior in relation to agriculture: 1) monitor the condition of fields and crop growth with their own vehicle and apply fertilizers using specialized agricultural machinery; 2) perform similar work using drones. The average tariff for fertilizer application in Ukraine and the average salary of a drone operator were used for the calculation. Drones have been shown to be more cost-effective if they increase crop yields by more than 3.85% over five years of using the technology."
pub.1147273827,A Method of Encrypting the Traffic of Quadrocopters Through an A nalog Path During Monitoring of Agricultural Ground Objects,"The purpose of this work to developed a method for encrypting the traffic of quadcopters through an analog path throughout the monitoring of agricultural ground objects.  The use of unmanned aerial vehicles of a quadrocopter type for monitoring ground objects in agriculture is becoming more and more common practice and allows you to effectively solve a wide range of tasks. Technologically equipped drones in agriculture are capable of performing various monitoring operations, in particular: aerial photography, video filming, thermal filming, laser scanning, etc. Such monitoring makes it possible to assess the quality of crops and identify the fact of damage or death of crops, identify crop defects and problem areas, analyze the effectiveness of plant protection measures, check compliance with crop rotation plans, identify deviations and violations in the process of agrotechnical work, analyze the relief and create maps, conduct audit and inventory of land, carry out security measures and collect information for the security service, etc.  At the same time, drones are vulnerable to information attacks, which can be carried out for different purposes, in particular, to steal a drone, use it in a network of bots to attack other devices, or to intercept information that it collects for a device operator. All this necessitates the development of effective methods of information protection of drones from cyberattacks.  In this work, the Vernam cipher was used to encrypt the data, and a pseudo-random sequence generated using the Sinai mathematical billiard was used as the encryption key. Thus, an improved mathematical model for generating encryption keys based on the Sinai billiards has been proposed. On the basis of the proposed mathematical model, software was developed and working models of devices for conducting experiments were created. To create a layout, a module based on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller was selected, data between devices was transmitted via a radio module."

There are some critical moments for crop success; the establishment is one of those. In this paper, we present an initial approximation of a methodology that uses RGB images gathered from drones to evaluate the establishment success in legumes based on matrixes operations. Our aim is to provide a method that can be implemented in low-cost nodes with relatively low computational capacity. An index (B1/B2) is used for estimating the percentage of green biomass to evaluate the establishment success. In the study, we include three zones with different establishment success (high, regular, and low) and two species (chickpea and lentils). We evaluate data usability after applying aggregation techniques, which reduces the picture’s size to improve long-term storage. We test cell sizes from 1 to 10 pixels. This technique is tested with images gathered in production fields with intercropping at 4, 8, and 12 m relative height to find the optimal aggregation for each flying height. Our results indicate that images captured at 4 m with a cell size of 5, at 8 m with a cell size of 3, and 12 m without aggregation can be used to determine the establishment success. Comparing the storage requirements, the combination that minimises the data size while maintaining its usability is the image at 8 m with a cell size of 3. Finally, we show the use of generated information with an artificial neural network to classify the data. The dataset was split into a training dataset and a verification dataset. The classification of the verification dataset offered 83% of the cases as well classified. The proposed tool can be used in the future to compare the establishment success of different legume varieties or species."
pub.1169943242,Precision Agriculture: A Novel Approach on AI-Driven Farming,"One of these unusual countries with possible correlations is India. While maintaining our strong agrarian roots, we have advanced in technological terms. We do, meanwhile, wish to eliminate the gap that exists between our technological advancements and their uses in farming. Agriculture faces numerous obstacles when it comes to planning and harvesting. Farmers must formulate appropriate crops, starting with a study of the soils and land, fertilizer, seeding strategies, irrigation, pest control, monitoring for perfection, and ultimate harvesting. Inadvertent prepared plans no longer just reduce farmers’ profit margins but also undermine their livelihoods. For the first time in history, the Earth’s population will surpass eight billion by 2024, placing further strain on the world’s supply chain, which is already hampered by an unstable climate and a lack of water. Farmers are putting cutting-edge technological ideas into practice to meet future demands. For instance, IBM researchers are developing solutions that use cloud-connected devices, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) at every stage of the supply chain. In order to secure the security of the global supply, new IoT solutions are helping to monitor the health of beehives. Smart farming, robotic harvesters with AI-enhanced dexterity, diagnostic drones that can apply pesticides and fertilizer to rice fields, and other innovative technologies are also being used by farmers. In order to create and execute this plan, the farmers should accurately identify and assess their area. They can, however, be restricted by utilising the limited attainability and efficiency of guided surveying and surveillance. These regulations supply an upward push to making plans and projection errors, which develop into destiny losses. In order, drone-backed surveying, mapping, and surveillance tech are “ripe” for applications to fill this gap. Drones fill the gap in the analytics process. Elevated optical and thermal sensors can be carried by drones. Drones from Ideas Furnace can even carry both thermal and optical surveillance gear. This implies that each and every moment we fly they could perform more thorough and extensive surveys. Drones in agriculture are starting up new opportunities to boom their crop yield with higher farming applications and real-time access to information."

On the one hand, nearly all GNSS satellites (Global Positioning System (GPS), Glo bal Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), Galileo and Beidou) have become operational, thereby providing high-precision, continuous, all-weather and near real- time remote sensing multi-signals beneficial to environmental monitoring. On the other hand, the emerging challenges of precisely monitoring climate change and the demand for the production of sufficient food for ever-increasing populations are pushing traditional monitoring methods to their limits. In this regard, refracted GNSS signals (i.e., occulted GNSS signals or GNSS meteorology) are now emerging as sensors of climate variability, while the reflected signals (GNSS reflectometry or GNSS-R) are increasingly finding applications in determining, e.g., soil moisture content, ice and snow thickness, ocean heights, and wind speed and direction, among others. Furthermore, the increasing recognition and application of GNSS-supported unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAV)/drones in agriculture (e.g., through the determination of water holding capacity of soil) highlights the new challenges facing GNSS. As such, this new edition three new chapters address GNSS reflectometry and applications; GNSS sensing of climate variability; and the applications in UAV/drones. Moreover, it explores the application of GNSS to support integrated coastal zone management."

For ensuring a flight range of 10-12 km, the using of 44000 mAh battery and payload of 10-15 kg is recommended. It has been established that when building large-sized copters, before setting up the PID controller, it’s necessary to pre-configure the parameters that are used by the PID controller. The failure to do so will often cause the aircraft to crash on its first flight. These are motor thrust linearization parameters, acceleration values for different axes and filters that go to the input of the PID controller. Experimentally tested the stability of the quadrocopter’s flight in windy weather in navigation modes for firmware Arducopter ver.4.1.5. At wind speeds up to 10 m/s with gusts up to 14-15 m/s, the flight stability was noted in automatic mode and in automatic return to the starting point mode. The high accuracy of the operation of the Ardupilot firmware navigation system was established when the cargo drop point was reached in automatic mode. The error was no more than 1.0-1.5 m at wind speed of 6-7 m/s. The effectiveness of mechanical vibration isolation for flight controllers of the Pixhawk Cube family has been experimentally established. When installing them on the frame of the copter, there is no need to use mechanical vibration decoupling. However, taking into account the low frequency of the frame oscillations from the operation of the propeller group (about 30 Hz), it’s necessary to design the frame with the frequency of natural oscillations outside this range. The using of software dynamic notch filters to reduce the impact of vibrations from running motors on the readings of the accelerometer and gyroscope is considered. On the frame of 2000 mm quadrocopter, it’s shown that such filters significantly reduce the amplitude of not only the detected fundamental frequency, but also their harmonics. The various ways of setting up actuators controlled by servos and relays for dropping loads, switching operating modes by video systems, switching on and off spraying mechanisms when using such drones in agriculture are considered."

pub.1120139092,Software Process Definition using Process Lines: A Systematic Literature Review,"Software processes have been the focus of discussion in literature, but defining a software process remains a challenge. The Software Process Line (SPrL) technique offers a systematic process reuse approach that identifies processes' similarities and variability. This study aims to characterize the state-of-the-art of the software process definition using SPrL. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted and 26 papers were identified to be studied in depth. The results indicate a concentration of approaches that use mapping/rules techniques to support variability resolution and the need for integrated supporting tools. In addition, three problems that affect the software process definition using SPrL were observed: (1) low understanding of SPrL models complexity and their impact, (2) lack of understanding about the impacts of the defined software process, and (3) experts' knowledge dependence issues in decision-making to solve variability."
pub.1099918806,BPMN 2.0 Based Modeling and Customization of Variants in Business Process Families,"Business processes may accept variants based on specific business requirements of an organization, leading to the definition of a process family. There are many proposals for the modeling of the common and variable parts of a process family, as well as to support the customization of each process variant (i.e., process configuration or tailoring). In this article, we present the results of a detailed study about the modeling and customization of process families based on the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) standard, and we introduce BPMNext, a novel approach devised for this purpose. The language is an adaptation of BPMN 2.0 based on the ideas provided by vSPEM, a language for the modeling of software processes families. We also present a supporting tool and its application to a real case study about the assignment of positions in exchange programs."
pub.1095575837,Building Software Process Lines with CASPER,"Software product quality and project productivity require defining suitable software process models. The best process depends on the circumstances where it is applied. Typically, a process engineer tailors a specific process for each project or each project type from an organizational software process model. Frequently, tailoring is performed in an informal and reactive fashion, which is expensive, unrepeatable and error prone. Trying to deal with this challenge, we have built Casper, a meta-process for defining adaptable software process models. This paper presents Casperillustrating it using the ISPW-6 process. Caspermeta-process allows producing project specific processes in a planned way using four software process principles and a set of process practices that enable a feasible production strategy. According to its application to a canonical case, this paper concludes that Casperenables a practical technique for tailoring a software process model."
pub.1094563585,A megamodel for Software Process Line modeling and evolution,"Companies formalize software processes as a way of organizing development projects. Since there are differences in project contexts, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work well in practice. Some companies use a family of a predefined processes, but this approach has a high process maintenance cost. Instead, we define Software Process Lines (SPrL), where a general process with variability is tailored to project contexts. Model- Driven Engineering (MDE) provides a formal framework for defining the models and transformations required for automated SPrL tailoring. However, this approach requires the definition and co-evolution of various types of models and tool support beyond the skills of process engineers, making the industrial adoption challenging. This paper shares our experience using a megamodeling approach to the development of the back-end of our toolset. The megamodel provides a uniform mechanism for process definition, variability, tailoring and evolution, and we hide the MDE complexity through a user-friendly front-end. We report the application of our approach at Mobius, a small Chilean software enterprise."
pub.1094868807,A Comparative Study of Compositional and Annotative Modelling Approaches for Software Process Lines,"This paper presents a comparative study of compositional and annotative modeling approaches for software process lines. In our comparative study, OpenUP and Scrum based software process lines extracted from existing projects are modeled and implemented using an existing compositional approach - EPF Composer, and an annotative approach - GenArch-P, with the main aim to address a systematic variability management and automatic process derivation. In order to promote the analysis of the approaches were adapted some comparison criteria previously adopted in other studies. Our study results show that the annotative approach can bring many advantages to the modeling of software process lines considering our comparison criteria. On the other hand, our study also concludes that many existing compositional mechanisms should also be integrated with annotative approaches in order to improve the modularity of process elements associated to specific kinds of process variabilities."
pub.1094152822,An Approach to Software Process Design and Implementation Using Transition Rules,When software organizations adopt several best practices models into one single environment the number of activities and processes tends to increase. Managing effectively a large and complex system of processes requires process modeling capabilities at higher levels of abstraction. This paper presents a modeling approach for software process design and implementation to deal with the increasing size and complexity of large systems of processes. A model based on an extension of UML 2.0 Component Diagrams is used to develop a process architecture. A transition mechanism using Little-JIL process programming language is also proposed to support the refinement of a process architecture to a process implementation.
pub.1093480635,Variability in Software Process Models: Requirements for Adoption in Industrial Settings,"It is an increasing trend to apply Software Product Line (SPL) concepts and techniques for software process tailoring, generating a Software PRocess Line (SPrL). However, there are several aspects that must be addressed before SPrLs can be fully adopted by industry, a key aspect being how software process variability is specified and managed. In the literature, there are several general-purpose as well as domain-specific proposals for specifying process variability. In this paper, we analyze the benefits and drawbacks of two general-purpose (feature models and OVM) and two domain-specific (SPEM variability primitives and vSPEM) approaches, as well as discuss what hinders industry adoption in each case."
pub.1093832512,Leveraging CVL to Manage Variability in Software Process Lines,"Variability on project requirements often implies variability on software processes. To manage such variability, Software Process Lines (SPLs) can be used to represent commonality (i.e., common practices) and variability (i.e., differences) of a set of related software processes. To this end, some Software Process Modeling Languages (SPMLs) natively integrate variability mechanisms. Nevertheless, such a coupling between the SPML and the variability mechanisms i) requires to interpret the requirements variability in terms of the processes variability, ii) limits the reuse of the requirements variability for other purposes (e.g., the development itself), and iii) is a barrier to the use of advances from the field of variability management. In this paper, we propose an approach to apply the Common Variability Language (CVL from the OMG consortium) for requirement variability modeling and its binding to the processes. This work is illustrated on a family of industrial Java development processes. Our approach enables the definition of an SPL and the automatic derivation of a process from this SPL according to the requirements of a given project. The variability is managed separately from the process model and benefits from existing tools coming from the process modeling community and CVL."
pub.1094662511,Improving Reusability in Software Process Lines,"Software processes orchestrate manual or automatic tasks to create new software products that meet the requirements of specific projects. While most of the tasks are about inventiveness, modern developments also require recurrent, boring and time-consuming tasks (e.g., the IDE configuration, or the continuous integration setup). Such tasks struggle to be automated due to their various execution contexts according to the requirements of specific projects. In this paper, we propose a methodology that benefits from an explicit modeling of a family of processes to identify the possible reuse of automated tasks in software processes. We illustrate our methodology on industrial projects in a software company. Our methodology promoted both the identification of possible automated tasks for configuring IDEs and continuous integration, and their reuse in various projects of the company. Our methodology contributes to the companies' efficiency, including their agility and ability to experiment new practices, while remaining focused on solving business problems."
pub.1110365318,A Comparative Study for Scoping a Software Process Line,"Software process lines (SPrL) is an approach for facilitating the adaptation and evolution of a set of related software processes within a software organization. In order to correctly establish the processes and process assets to be reused as well as to typify the situations under which the processes will be used (the process demands) an implicit or explicit scoping activity that is normally performed. There are some methods oriented to support this activity. In this article we explore the definition of the scope of a SPrL of a software company focused on the software testing service through two methods: SCOPE and CASPER Scoping. The main goal of this work is to explore, through an empirical study, the advantages and disadvantages of scope determination in an industrial context by using two methods reported in the literature: SCOPE and CASPER. The developed study allows us to evidence some limitations of these methods in terms of (1) defining a suitable scope granularity level, (2) clarity to systematically conduct the methods (3) lack of an acceptable definition of what the scope of a SPrL is. We consider that it is very feasible to make a proposal that integrates these approaches so that the definition of scope in real contexts is more appropriate"
pub.1094407996,Supporting the Definition of Software Processes at Consulting Organizations via Software Process Lines,"Software Process Consulting Organizations (SPCOs) support other organizations to define, deploy, and improve their software processes. Usually they are requested to define similar processes to different organizations, leading to some process reuse opportunities. Software Process Lines (SPLs) are reusable process architectures that model similarities and variabilities among processes, and could be of great value for SPCOs to derive multiple processes based on the same original SPL. This paper presents a reuse-based software process definition approach that aims at making it easier for consulting organizations to define reusable processes. We describe the main concepts related to a SPL, and how to define and use them in this context. We also present a supporting tool to define SPLs and derive defined processes. Finally, we present a usage experience of the approach in the context of a SPCO in Brazil."
pub.1093352650,Towards a Safety-oriented Process Line for Enabling Reuse in Safety Critical Systems Development and Certification,"Safety standards define development processes by indicating the set of partially ordered tasks that have to be executed to achieve acceptably safe systems. Process compliance constitutes a fundamental ingredient in safety argumentation for certification purposes. Certification is a very expensive, time-consuming and quality demanding activity. To increase quality and reduce time and cost, reuse-based approaches are being investigated. In this paper, we adopt process line approach in the framework of safety processes. This means that we treat a family of processes as a product line, and we identify commonalities and variabilities between them. The resulting information guides developers in reusing parts of the process, the system and safety case, e.g. which parts to make more generic, isolating changes in others to avoid ripple effects etc.."
pub.1094575511,Teaching Software Process Modeling,"Most university curricula consider software processes to be on the fringes of software engineering (SE). Students are told there exists a plethora of software processes ranging from RUP over V-shaped processes to agile methods. Furthermore, the usual students' programming tasks are of a size that either one student or a small group of students can manage the work. Comprehensive processes being essential for large companies in terms of reflecting the organization structure, coordinating teams, or interfaces to business processes such as contracting or sales, are complex and hard to teach in a lecture, and, therefore, often out of scope. We experienced tutorials on using Java or C#, or on developing applications for the iPhone to gather more attention by students, simply speaking, as these are more fun for them. So, why should students spend their time in software processes? From our experiences and the discussions with a variety of industrial partners, we learned that students often face trouble when taking their first “real” jobs, even if the company is organized in a lean or agile shape. Therefore, we propose to include software processes more explicitly into the SE curricula. We designed and implemented a course at Master's level in which students learn why software processes are necessary, and how they can be analyzed, designed, implemented, and continuously improved. In this paper, we present our course's structure, its goals, and corresponding teaching methods. We evaluate the course and further discuss our experiences so that lecturers and researchers can directly use our lessons learned in their own curricula."
pub.1093783333,Integrating Software Process Reuse and Automation,"Reusing software processes from a Software Process Line (SPL, i.e., a set of software processes that captures their commonalities and variabilities) and automating their execution is a way to reduce development costs. However, to our best knowledge no approach integrates both aspects. The difficulty is to automate the execution of a process whose variability is only partially resolved (i.e., a value is not set to each variable part of the process). Indeed, according to projects' constraints, it is possible to start the execution of a part of a process whose variability is resolved, while postponing the resolution of the variability of other parts of this process. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported approach that integrates both aspects. It consists of reusing processes from an SPL according to projects' requirements. The processes are bound to components that automate their execution. When the variability of a process to execute is not fully resolved, our approach consists of resolving this variability during the execution of this process. We illustrate this work on a family of processes for designing and implementing modeling languages. Our approach enables both the reuse of software processes and the automation of their execution, while enabling to resolve process variability during the execution."
pub.1094703784,Definition of Software Process Lines for Integration of Scrum and CMMI,"The adoption of Agile Methods, like Scrum, in conjunction with maturity models, like Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), often leads to variation of process. Process definition is a complex and difficult task, requiring a lot of effort and experience. Software Process Line (SPrL) has been considered a suitable paradigm for software process tailoring and reuse; and there is a lack of approaches that use SPrL concepts for modeling these approaches in conjunction. This paper presents the definition of a SPrL considering Project Planning and Project Monitoring and Control process areas in processes using Scrum agile methodology together with CMMI maturity model. It is expected the presented SPrL assists software organizations to tailor processes that meet both approaches."
pub.1094372965,Applying AOSE Concepts to Model Crosscutting Variability in Variant-Rich Processes,"Software process models need to be variant-rich, in the sense that they should be systematically customizable to specific project goals and project environments. It is currently very difficult to model Variant-Rich Process (VRP) because variability mechanisms are largely missing in modern process modeling languages. Variability mechanisms from other domains, such as programming languages, might be suitable for the representation of variability and could be adapted to the modeling of software processes. Mechanisms from Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) and concepts from Aspect-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) show particular promise when modeling variability. This paper presents an approach that integrates variability concepts from SPLE and AOSE in the design of a VRP approach for the systematic support of tailoring in software processes. This approach has also been implemented in SPEM, resulting in the vSPEM notation. It has been used in a pilot application, which indicates that our approach based on AOSE can make process tailoring easier and more productive."
pub.1095765664,Modeling a Safety- and Automotive-Oriented Process Line to Enable Reuse and Flexible Process Derivation,"ISO 26262 is a recently introduced automotive functional safety standard. This standard imposes new requirements that must be fulfilled for conformance purposes. Thus, companies used to develop safety-related E/E systems in compliance with either only Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) or a combination of ASPICE and IEC 61508 have to quickly perform a gap analysis in order to introduce adequate changes in their way of working. Implementing such changes in a visionary way with expectations of a long-term payback is an urgent open issue. To contribute to addressing such issue, in this paper, we introduce a safety-oriented process line-based methodological framework to model commonalities and variabilities (changes) between the standards to enable reuse and flexible process derivation. To show the usefulness of our approach, we apply it to model a proc-ess-phase line for the development of safety-critical control units. Finally, we provide our lessons learned and concluding remarks."
pub.1094184369,Template-Based vs. Automatic Process Tailoring,"Software process lines (SPrL) is a trend in software companies for generating software processes adapted to specific project contexts, i.e., process tailoring. There are several strategies for process tailoring ranging from having a unique process always applied, to defining a specific process for each project, the former is inefficient while the latter is expensive. Two intermediate strategies used in industry and academia are template-based and automatic process tailoring. In this paper we present a case-study where we compare the productivity and quality of both strategies measured in terms of extra or missing process elements. We applied both strategies to the SPrL of a small Chilean company and we found that automatic tailoring is always more productive, but this difference is mitigated when the predefined processes are those more frequently applied."
pub.1093338787,Towards Process Lines for Agent-Oriented Requirements Engineering,"Agent-oriented software products are becoming increasingly complicated, and the competitive market is forcing the producers to reduce time-to-market and increase the quality of the software produced. Therefore, developers have come to realize the need for more reliable and efficient agent-oriented software development processes (methodologies) which address the specific needs of each and every project. Software Process Lines provide a solution to this problem by using Process Line Engineering concepts for instantiating bespoke software processes. This research focuses on developing a software process line for Requirements Engineering (RE) in the context of agent-oriented software development. Our proposed agent-oriented Requirements Engineering Process Line (AOREPL) incorporates a core base which can be directly used for instantiating an agent-oriented Requirements Engineering (AORE) process; it also defines variation points and variant method chunks to be added to the core base in order to create variant AORE processes. We also propose a step-by-step process line engineering method which enables process engineers to define and instantiate diverse AORE process lines."
pub.1093543111,Extending the Multiple Domain Matrix by Using Business Process Model and Notation for Business Process Analysis,"Effective business process management can reduce development cost, improve work efficiency, and reduce system errors. This paper defines multiple-domain matrix (MDM) extensions called the business process model and notation-MDM (BPMN-MDM) to analyze structures of and relations among processes modeled in the BPMN. The extensions were verified using workflow patterns, which are basic process elements to model processes and describe behaviors of business process executions. Most business processes can be transformed and described in the MDM by using activity and organization design structure matrices, which verify the effectiveness of the BPMN-MDM. A standard business process example was used and analyzed using the BPMN-MDM for illustration and validation purposes. By applying an organizational-activity MDM partitioning algorithm, coupled activities of each organizational member and coupled relations among members provide process structure information in a matrix perspective, which can serve as a basis to devise new methods and algorithms for process analysis and optimization."
pub.1094613034,"Organizational and Project Process Definition: A Lightweight Framework, Supporting Tool, and Industry Experience","Process definition is the pillar step towards process improvement. An mature (e.g., CMMI level 3 or above) software development organization should define organizational standard processes, and make their projects establish projects' defined processes through tailoring the organizational standard processes. Existing research has proposed various models and formalism for process definition and tailoring. In order to be effective and efficient in the industry fields, one approach needs to make a good balance between formality and usability. In this paper, we present a lightweight framework for establishing organizational and project processes. The framework has a concise set of notions and simple meta-models for the process definition and tailoring, and is compatible with most of the popular models and standards. We also implement a tool supporting process definition, and enactment of the project's defined process by automatically generating project plan template. We have applied the framework and tool in our company for years. The application experience shows that the framework fits the small and medium-sized organization and projects well."
pub.1094605361,Dynamic Process Adaptation: A Context-aware Approach,"Dynamism of day-to-day activities in organizations is inextricably linked and there is a variety of information, insight and reasoning being processed between people and systems, in carrying out a business process. We argue that flexibility in processes could be managed in real time, using context information collected in the work environment. This paper proposes a context management architecture approach that aims to improve and automate dynamic process adaptation. We explain how process adaptation may occur in real time and discuss a scenario for this proposal"
pub.1094495207,ALM Tool Data Usage in Software Process Metamodeling,"Project Management and Software Process Improvement (SPI) are essential parts of software engineering. A multitude of project management techniques and tools, such as Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) ones, are available, and there is an abundance of software methodologies, process metamodels and best practice descriptions. Despite the role of tools in enacting the processes, the underlying domain models used in these two fields – ALM tools and software process metamodels – often significantly differ. This hinders the project execution analysis using the data available from the tools, such as the verification of the project's alignment with a given methodology or the detection of bad practices (anti-patterns). In this paper we describe our work towards enabling such analyses. First we survey the domain models of major process metamodels and tools, and discuss the commonalities and open issues. We then propose a software process metamodel inspired by some of the established metamodels and reflecting the structures of data which can be mined from project management tools. The proposed metamodel is being validated by a prototype process data repository with import interfaces for major ALM tools."
pub.1131796694,A Modified Genetic Algorithm With New Encoding and Decoding Methods for Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling Problem,"Due to the complementarity of the process planning and shop scheduling, their integration can greatly facilitate the development of the intelligent manufacturing system. In the last decade, the integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) problem has become a research hotspot in the manufacturing system area. It is an NP-hard problem and is more complicated than the job shop scheduling problem. Although some progress has been obtained in the IPPS field, there are still many unsolved open problems. In this article, the novel integrated encoding and decoding methods are proposed by considering the OR-node of the process network graph. Moreover, a modified genetic algorithm (MGA) is designed based on the proposed coding methods. The process planning and the scheduling parts can be represented simultaneously in one individual. As for the precedence constraints between operations, the specifically designed operators are able to guarantee the feasibility of the operation sequence during the searching procedure. Then, the superiority of MGA is verified by updating nine new records on 37 well-known open problems, four of them reach their lower bounds. In addition, the proposed algorithm is also tested on a real-world case from a nonstandard equipment workshop in a Chinese machine tool company, which produces a common module of a packaging machine. The results show that the proposed MGA can solve the real-world case better than the comparative algorithms."
pub.1094126375,Towards a Design-Theoretic Characterisation of Software Development Process Models,"Context: Effective assessment, comparison, selection and adaptation of software development processes remain an acute problem in Software Engineering practice. The quest for a unified theory which might serve this purpose is ongoing. Objective: To take a first step towards such a theory, with focus on characterising and comparing features of software development process models. Method: We consider a theory of design as problem solving and investigate how it can be applied to characterise and explicate specific process features in well known process models from the literature. The intention is to characterise emerging trade-offs between resource expenditure and risk mitigation, which result from the interplay between process efforts into problem and solution exploration vs stakeholder validation. The analysis, at this point performed, is purely qualitative, and the treatment of resource expenditure and risk quite abstract. Results: We provide an initial characterisation and comparison of features found in a wide range of process models from the literature, within a design theoretic framework using a single building block – the Problem Oriented Engineering (POE) Process Pattern – that allows the characterisation of information flow, the relationship between actors, resource usage and developmental risk. Conclusions: The initial characterisation identifies repeated structure in diverse processes, which allows basic process comparison across models. The interpretations are modular, allowing the possibility of relationships between different process models to be explored. As such, the theory allows for a unified means to characterise and compare systematically key features of different process models. In being of an exploratory nature, the work has a number of limitations, which should be addressed by further research"
pub.1093698709,Deriving Project-Specific Processes from Process Line Architecture with Commonality and Variability,"Definition and utilization of project-specific processes is important for effectively conducting industrial information system development. Process tailoring is an approach of achieving processes optimized for the characteristics of a project. However, conventional tailoring techniques such as component-based ones and generator ones lack a way to address the overall consistency or reuse process fragments. In this paper, we propose a technique for establishing process lines, which are sets of common processes in particular problem domains, and process line architectures that incorporate commonality and variability. Process line architectures are used as a basis for deriving process lines from the perspective of overall optimization. The proposed technique includes some extensions to the Software Process Engineering Metamodel for clearly expressing the commonality and variability in the process workflows when modeling the workflows as UML activity diagrams. As a result of applying the proposed technique to hardware/software co-design processes in an embedded system development domain, it is found that the proposed technique is useful for defining consistent and project-specific processes efficiently."
pub.1131998331,Integrating PPI Variability in the Context of Customizable Processes by Extending the Business Process Feature Model,"While model support concerning the variability and customization of business processes has been studied extensively, related Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) have not been addressed similarly. An approach that helps PPI calculation and promotes reusability in this context is critical for organizations. A fast adaptation of their information system is needed, concerning new clients’ requirements, new policies or evaluations of audit entities. Business Process Feature Model (BPFM) is a well-known approach to support process variability by modeling all possible variants and generating process skeleton based on different customizations. However, this approach does not consider the PPI’s modeling and calculation variability. In this paper, we will talk about the thesis project concerning the extension of the BPFM approach in order to the integrate PPI variability. We present our first results relying on our experience in a real industrial case; a tree model of PPIs variability linked to the BPFM model facilitating the modeling, the customization and the reasoning about PPIs variants depending on the process customization and PPIs definitions."
pub.1093380764,A Tool for Modeling Software Development Contexts in Small Software Organizations,"Characterizing the software development context has been recognized as relevant for a variety of purposes, particularly for tailoring the organizational software processes according to the features of each project to be addressed. That tailoring activity makes the software processes more efficient and effective. However, formally modeling software development contexts, which is usually required to perform this tailoring activity, represents a challenge for many organizations; and particularly for small software companies, which usually have low expertise and resources to deal with formal methods and notations. This paper presents a usable software tool for defining the software development context for an organization and also for particular projects. Preliminary evaluations of the tool usability and usefulness have been performed. The obtained results indicate that the tool provides all the services required to model development context, and potential users found it easy to use."
pub.1095248133,The socio-cultural environment in the software process modeling,"With regard to the increasing complexity and heterogenization of organizations, the technological and organizational dimensions of software process modeling are passing through an integration period. In this paper, we present a methodological framework to analyze software construction models' cultural feasibility. A symbiotic multi-level software process cycle model (SMPCM) has been designed. This model inter-relates the socio-cultural, scientific/technological and paradigmatic environments. The authors describe the engineering-level processes and how these processes are developed and inter-related among themselves and with the SMPCM environments. Participative and symbiotic methodologies are described in order to model the organization and to reveal its culture, and in order to design and improve dynamic, flexible and evolutive software process models. The proposed methodologies are validated in a study prototype and preliminary results are analyzed."
pub.1095285212,Process lines: a product line approach designed for process model development,"Standard process models like RUP or the German V-Modell XT are developed to be used in an organizational environment. Yet introducing such a process model into an organization is no simple task. It is usually accompanied by either reorganizing internal processes to comply with a standard process model or by adaptation of the process model to organizational structures. The latter is an approach that can often be found in practice and is subject to this paper. The paper describes a generalization of the process model architecture of the V-Modell XT 1.3. Compared to the previous version 1.2.1.1, its metamodel has completely been revised with respect to a new adaptation concept. We will see how this concept allows the implementation of a so called process line. Software process lines are derived from software product lines and can be used for the adaptation of standard processes during process model development, project initialization and project runtime."
pub.1094723990,A Software Process Line Based on the Unified Process,"Unified Process - UP, is a prescriptive framework widely used by the software industry. Since the UP was developed under the assumption of a universal applicability, its definition is not match to every organization or project. Several proposals have been outlined to adapt this framework to the specific needs of organizations and projects. Although these adaptations have been applied in contexts, industry and research, they do not inelude systematic mechanisms and so, they are difficult to replicate. This paper applies a general strategy, but concrete to facilítate systematic adaptation of the Unified Process using a software process line approach. In order to evalúate this proposal, the UP implementation discipline has been modeled as a software process line using CASPER meta-process providing evidences about the advantages and disadvantages of approach."

This framework is based on the goal/question/metric paradigm and uses role definitions to state the assessment goals. The assessment goals are then used to identify the information that must be supplied by a formalism to support a project role. The feasibility of this framework is demonstrated using the ISPW-6 software process example. A number of example roles are identified, and example hypotheses are derived for some of the formalisms used.<>"
pub.1094561381,A Model-Driven Safety Certification Method for Process Compliance,"A safety case is a contextualized structured argument constituted of process and product-based sub-arguments to show that a system is acceptably safe. The creation of a safety case is an extremely time-consuming and costly activity needed for certification purposes. To reduce time and cost, reuse as well as automatic generation possibilities represent urgent research directions. In this paper, we focus on safety processes mandated by prescriptive standards and we identify process-related structures from which process-based arguments (those aimed at showing that a required development process has been applied according to the standard) can be generated and more easily reused. Then, we propose a model-driven safety certification method to derive those arguments as goal structures given in Goal Structuring Notation from process models given in compliance with Software Process Engineering Meta-model 2.0. The method is illustrated by generating process-based arguments in the context of ISO 26262."
pub.1137866075,Supporting Quality Assurance with Automated Process-Centric Quality Constraints Checking,"Regulations, standards, and guidelines for safety-critical systems stipulate stringent traceability but do not prescribe the corresponding, detailed software engineering process. Given the industrial practice of using only semi-formal notations to describe engineering processes, processes are rarely ""executable"" and developers have to spend significant manual effort in ensuring that they follow the steps mandated by quality assurance. The size and complexity of systems and regulations makes manual, timely feedback from Quality Assurance (QA) engineers infeasible. In this paper we propose a novel framework for tracking processes in the background, automatically checking QA constraints depending on process progress, and informing the developer of unfulfilled QA constraints. We evaluate our approach by applying it to two different case studies; one open source community system and a safety-critical system in the air-traffic control domain. Results from the analysis show that trace links are often corrected or completed after the fact and thus timely and automated constraint checking support has significant potential on reducing rework."

Thus, technical concerns along with its evolution are difficult to express. And it has been until recent time that has received increasing attention as an important sub-area of Software Process Engineering. This paper aims to briefly present main topics of software process architecture addressing three main issues: What is a software process architecture?, How it is created? And who is responsible for building it? (i.e. definition, process and role). It also identifies some challenges and research directions by delineating a roadmap to facilitate its understanding and growth."

Following an initial overview, the basic process concepts which underlie the definitions are outlined. The definitions are grouped in four sets: a framework for process definition, an engineering of process, an enactment of process, and process properties. The use of these concepts in several domains is illustrated. Some observations on the definition process are offered.<>"
pub.1061717955,Data-Based Hybrid Tension Estimation and Fault Diagnosis of Cold Rolling Continuous Annealing Processes,"The continuous annealing process line (CAPL) of cold rolling is an important unit to improve the mechanical properties of steel strips in steel making. In continuous annealing processes, strip tension is an important factor, which indicates whether the line operates steadily. Abnormal tension profile distribution along the production line can lead to strip break and roll slippage. Therefore, it is essential to estimate the whole tension profile in order to prevent the occurrence of faults. However, in real annealing processes, only a limited number of strip tension sensors are installed along the machine direction. Since the effects of strip temperature, gas flow, bearing friction, strip inertia, and roll eccentricity can lead to nonlinear tension dynamics, it is difficult to apply the first-principles induced model to estimate the tension profile distribution. In this paper, a novel data-based hybrid tension estimation and fault diagnosis method is proposed to estimate the unmeasured tension between two neighboring rolls. The main model is established by an observer-based method using a limited number of measured tensions, speeds, and currents of each roll, where the tension error compensation model is designed by applying neural networks principal component regression. The corresponding tension fault diagnosis method is designed using the estimated tensions. Finally, the proposed tension estimation and fault diagnosis method was applied to a real CAPL in a steel-making company, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

These process changes put new cognitive demands on the medical team and increase the likelihood of miscommunication, lapses in judgment, and medical errors. We describe two process model driven cognitive aids, referred to as the Narrative View and the Smart Checklist View, generated automatically from models of the processes. The immediate perceived utility of these cognitive aids is to support medical simulations, particularly when frequent adaptations are needed to quickly respond to changing operating room guidelines."
pub.1061153796,Software process model evolution in the SPADE environment,"Software processes are long-lived entities. Careful design and thorough validation of software process models are necessary to ensure the quality of the process. They do not prevent, however, process models from undergoing change. Change requests may occur in the context of reuse, i.e. statically, in order to support software process model customization. They can also occur dynamically, while software process models are being executed, in order to support timely reaction as data are gathered from the field during process enactment. We discuss the mechanisms a process language should possess in order to support changes. We illustrate the solution adopted in the context of the SPADE environment and discuss how the proposed mechanisms can be used to model different policies for changing a software process model.<>"

In particular, SPI often involves process reference models, process assessment methods and models that guide process improvement though specific standards such as the ISO and CMMI families. Recently, growing interest has been shown towards the need for harmonization of different improvement technologies with the aim of presenting an integrated vision about the standards. In this sense this paper presents a comparison between the process areas of CMMI-DEV and the processes described in the latest version of ISO/IEC 12207:2008. Based on these results we investigate the relationship between the CMMI-DEV and ISO/IEC 15504-7 models with the aim of identifying the degree of coverage of CMMI-DEV maturity levels in relation to ISOIIEC 15504-7."
pub.1094013259,CSEPM - A Continuous Software Engineering Process Metamodel,"Software engineers have to cope with uncertainties and changing requirements. Agile methods provide flexibility towards changes and the emergence of continuous delivery has made regular feedback loops possible. The abilities to maintain high code quality through reviews, to regularly release software, and to collect and prioritize user feedback, are necessary for continuous software engineering (CSE). However, there exists no software process metamodel that handles the continuous character of software engineering. In this paper, we describe an empirical process metamodel for continuous software engineering called CSEPM, which treats development activities as parallel running workflows and allows tailoring and customization. CSEPM includes static aspects that describe the relations between specific CSE concepts including reviews, releases, and feedback. It also describes the dynamic aspect of CSE, how development workflows are activated through change events. We show how CSEPM allows to instantiate linear, iterative, agile and continuous process models and how it enables tailoring and customization."
pub.1094964010,Process Model Engineering Lifecycle: Holistic Concept Proposal and Systematic Literature Review,"Organizations establish process models for different purposes and goals. However, they have in common issues concerning quality assurance and successful project management. Process models can be applied on different levels in process engineering, depending on whether processes are to be executed, defined or improved. Various individual methods and tools have been developed to help process engineers and members who are engineering and performing processes. These methods however do not support continuous integration into a process engineering lifecycle that consists of creating, defining, executing and improving processes. Therefore, we propose a holistic view of artifacts and activities in the process engineering lifecycle in an effort to create a consensus on what constitutes a process engineering lifecycle and take a look at recent research results covering the issues mentioned. We have identified approaches on process descriptions, on meta-models and on support in executing processes in the last years."
pub.1095785783,Mediating process adaptation through a goaloriented context-aware approach,"Complexity and dynamism of day-to-day activities in organizations are inextricably linked, one impacting the other, increasing the challenges for constant adaptation on the way to organize work to address emerging demands. Market is demanding systems that are aware of organizations processes and able to evolve and adapt to new situations in everyday working activities. We argue that flexibility in processes could be managed in real time, by PAIS (Process-aware Information Systems), using context information collected in the work environment. This paper proposes CGAdapt, a context management architecture approach that aims to improve and automate dynamic process adaptation. We explain how process adaptation may occur in real time through an existent scenario using this proposal and discuss the value of context-awareness to reason about process alternative adaptations in a goal oriented approach."

pub.1126910223,Automated generation of variants in business process families based on the Common Variability Language (CVL),"Business processes are carried out to achieve business objectives within an organization. Sometimes, such processes accept variants depending on specific business requirements. Several proposals have emerged to deal with the variability of business processes with focus on the modeling of process families with variants, avoiding modeling each variant separately, which implies duplication and maintenance of the common parts. One of these proposals is the Common Variability Language (CVL), which allows to represent variability transparently in a host language. Deriving a process variant from the definition of a process family is a central and complex task, which is done manually in most of the approaches. The aim of this article is to explore the use of CVL together with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) for modeling business process families, and the use of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques for the automatic generation of process variants. We also present a graphical tool supporting these ideas and a qualitative evaluation of the variability approach by using the VIVACE framework."

Various measurement issues such as validity, reliability, and other challenges in measuring process consistency at the project level are discussed. A measurement scale for software process consistency is introduced. An empirical study that uses this scale to measure consistency in achieving the CMM goal questions in various key process areas (KPAs) in 45 projects at a leading software vendor is reported. The results of this analysis indicate that consistent adoption of practices specified in the CMM is associated with a lower number of defects. Even a relatively modest improvement in the consistency of implementing these practices is associated with a significant reduction in field defects."
pub.1095253656,Implementing HOTs that Generate Transformations with Two Input Models,"Model-driven Engineering (MDE) is a paradigm that promotes the use of models and automatic model transformations to handle complex software developments. Model transformations promise to reduce the effort for manipulating models. However, building transformations themselves is not easy. Higherorder Transformations (HOTs) are a means for automatically building model transformations. Building HOTs is in itself a complex task mainly because there are no standard languages for implementing them, and there are not many HOTs available in the literature to learn from. This situation is even worse when more sophisticated HOTs are required with two input models. We consider a real application to generate transformations for tailoring software process, because the generated transformation needs to have two input models: the organizational process and the project context model. In this paper, we show three different techniques for implementing this HOT and discuss their benefits and limitations."
pub.1095739782,"Object-Business Process Mapping Frameworks: Abstractions, Architecture, and Implementation","The integration between enterprise architectures and Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) is currently based on low-level programming interfaces that expose accidental complexities typical of process implementations. This paper describes an approach for integrating software architectures and BPMSs, based on mapping frameworks. Our inspiration are the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks widely used to shield information systems from low-level structures exposed by relational database systems. The paper describes the central abstractions that should be provided by Object—Business Process Mapping Frameworks (OBPM). We also propose a reference architecture for implementing OBPMs and a concrete OBPM implementation, called NextFlow. We evaluated our approach by comparing two implementations of the same system, one using NextFlow and another using the native API supported by jBPM, a popular BPMS. By using NextFlow, we achieved a reduction of 30% in terms of lines of code, 35% in terms of number of classes, and 90% in terms of import statements, when implementing this system."
pub.1095083693,Development of Situational Requirements Engineering Processes: A Process Factory Approach,"The Software Product Line (SPL) approach is a paradigm for systematic reuse of software products, and a Software Factory is a SPL aimed at the industrialization of software development. Based on the notion that a software/RE process can be developed via an engineering process (much akin to engineering other types of software), this research aims to provide a feature-based RE process factory to develop RE processes based on the characteristics of the project at hand (project situation). In our approach, the project situation is modeled as the problem domain through using the ${\bf i}^{\ast}$ modeling language (resulting in a situation model). A feature model can encapsulate all the features in an SPL; therefore, the abundant riches of the RE field – results of decades of research – have been explored for extracting the variations and commonalities among existing RE processes, the results of which are represented in the form of a feature model, considered as a model of the solution domain. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed feature model, it has been compared against RE-related activities found in prominent software development methodologies. A mapping for translating the situation model to the RE process feature model is proposed with the specific aim of promoting traceability and rationality in the selection of RE process features. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through an RE process development example."
pub.1095398670,V-BPMI: a Variability-oriented Framework for Web-based Business Processes Modeling and Implementation,"This paper advocates a new paradigm, V-BPMI, for flexible web-based business processes modeling and implementation. This paradigm emphasizes both variability and composability, which are very important in large and evolving organizations. Through process modeling and process operationalization, it proposes to establish a real engineering phase of the process variability. It is based on concepts such as process lines, process variants, process fragments and contextualization that support adaptation and relevancy qualities. V - BPMI is also based on reuse of web-based business process fragments. Thus, we consider here business processes as large compositions of sub-processes or process fragments. Composition is realized on-the-fly according to the context constraints where the process is deployed. This paradigm is developed in AP-HM (Assistance Publique - Hiipitaux de Marseille) hospitals throughout process of circulation of the drugs. In this context, our objective is to improve the efficiency of such processes and also to increase their security level. Indeed, in such large establishments/enterprises as AP-HM, a business process can be performed in several medical units. Our approach allows deploying a business process in an adapted way in each one of these medical units."

Here the importance of integrating whole processes rather than simply integrate databases or software applications. Seeing the duality between products and processes, we propose to exploit flexibility provided by the product-line engineering approach for modeling business processes as a Business Process Line (BPL) in order to capture process variability, promote reuse and integration and provide the capacity to anticipate process changes. To support process evolution and consistency, we suggest the use of decision tables to elicit, track and manage all the emerging decision points during business process modeling, with the purpose of maintaining the relationships among business needs, environmental changes and process tasks. In a real case study we practiced the proposed methodology by leveraging the synergy of feature models, variability mechanisms and decision tables. The results prove that the BPL satisfies the requirements for business process flexibility."
pub.1093372217,Deriving Verification-Related Means of Compliance for a Model-Based Testing Process,"DO-331 is the supplement of DO-178C for model-based development. DO-331 is an objective-based guidance, which defines a set of objectives that have to be achieved for the model-based development of aeronautical software. The guidance also recommends the evidence in terms of activities and work products that should respectively be carried out and produced to meet the objectives. To explain why the evidence collected supports the claims concerning objectives achievement, manufacturers could adopt a safety case-based approach. Fail-SafeMBT is an academic, recently proposed, and potentially innovative model-based testing process, which needs compelling arguments to be adopted for the development of aeronautical software. To reduce the gap between industrial settings and academic settings, in this paper, we adopt the safety case-based approach and we explain how to semiautomatically derive means for compliance, aimed at arguing Fail-SafeMBT's compliance. Our focus is limited to the Verification Planning Process and we contribute to partially justify the adequacy of Fail-SafeMBT to act as process evidence by creating fragments of compelling arguments. To do that, we first manually check if Fail-SafeMBT includes DO-178C/DO-331-compliant process elements, then we model Fail-SafeMBT in compliance with Software Process Engineering Meta-model 2.0, then, we derive process-based arguments from the Fail-SafeMBT process model by using MDSafeCer, the recently introduced Model Driven Safety Certification method. By doing so, we provide a threefold contribution: we pioneer the interpretation of DO-331 in academic settings, we validate MDSafeCer in the avionics domain and we strengthen Fail-SafeMBT by providing suggestions aimed at increasing its maturity level."

A PSEE is a software engineering environment based on the explicit representation of the software process (the process model). Processes and process models are dynamic entities that need to evolve. Existing PSEEs offer limited capabilities to support process evolution. To address this issue, it is necessary to extend PSEEs with features that enable the process manager to effectively and consistently change the process. The design of these functionalities must be guided by a clear characterization of the evolution problem. In particular, it is necessary to understand what kinds of services a PSEE should offer as built-in mechanisms, and what kinds of functionalities have to be implemented by the process modeler as process-specific policies.<>"
pub.1168095867,A Novel Sequence-to-Sequence-Based Deep Learning Model for Multistep Load Forecasting,"Load forecasting is critical to the task of energy management in power systems, for example, balancing supply and demand and minimizing energy transaction costs. There are many approaches used for load forecasting such as the support vector regression (SVR), the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and neural networks, but most of these methods focus on single-step load forecasting, whereas multistep load forecasting can provide better insights for optimizing the energy resource allocation and assisting the decision-making process. In this work, a novel sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)-based deep learning model based on a time series decomposition strategy for multistep load forecasting is proposed. The model consists of a series of basic blocks, each of which includes one encoder and two decoders; and all basic blocks are connected by residuals. In the inner of each basic block, the encoder is realized by temporal convolution network (TCN) for its benefit of parallel computing, and the decoder is implemented by long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict and estimate time series. During the forecasting process, each basic block is forecasted individually. The final forecasted result is the aggregation of the predicted results in all basic blocks. Several cases within multiple real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the best accuracy compared with several benchmark models."
pub.1094205921,An optimization-based approach to software development process tailoring,"A major activity performed by the manager before starting a software project is tailoring its development process. Such activity requires information about the context under which the project will be executed, including organizational, project, and team characteristics. In addition, it also requires pondering many factors and evaluating all existing constraints. In this scenario, we claim that a balance between collaboration and discipline can be the drivers to tailor software development processes in order to meet project and organization needs. With the purpose of facilitating this balancing, it is possible to automate some of the steps to solve the problem, reducing the effort required to execute this task and improving the obtained process. Therefore, this work presents an optimization-based approach where the balancing in process tailoring is defined, modeled and briefly analyzed. This approach uses collaboration and discipline as utility functions to select the most appropriate process for a software development project, considering its current context."
pub.1095779195,A Proposed Value-Based Software Process Tailoring Framework,"Software process tailoring is the act of customising the existing software process to suit the specific software project. Current practices in software process tailoring consider project characteristics as the sole input to tailor the software process. In addition, it maintains the traditional approach whereby all the project characteristics factors are treated as being equally important. There is a need to shift the traditional software process tailoring approach to a value-centric approach by using a value-based software engineering concept. This study aims to propose a value-based software process tailoring framework to tailor the software process. A review was conducted to analyse the components embedded and input factors in the selected prior studies on software process tailoring. The framework proposed in this study uses value-based factors as input factors to tailor the software process. The framework also considers value prioritisation component, which rank the process elements according to value priority."

Outcomes from two large projects – the European CRYSTAL and the German SPES_XT – come to prove its worth and to indicate feasible ways of implementing different processes by means of software frameworks based on this specification and taking advantage of an existing conform tool, the Eclipse Process Framework Composer. In the first case, SPEM 2.0 was used as the baseline meta-model for the CRYSTAL Platform Builder, a software platform for integration of diverse software tools that composes the CRYSTAL Reference Technology Platform, this way improving interoperability while decreasing embedded systems design effort and cost. It was as well used for tailoring product development processes, which are the main input for the Platform Builder itself. In the second occasion, SPEM 2.0 was also employed as the baseline meta-model for the Design Space Exploration process, which finds optimized solutions for the deployment of logical components in terms of tasks or processes (software components) to technical components (hardware resources) with respect to a set of optimization goals and constraints. Furthermore, it is used in the generation of a supporting tool called the Architecture Wizard, which guides the system engineer during the Design Space Exploration process. We present achieved outcomes from both described cases, indicating similarities, differences and complementing ideas between each approach regarding SPEM 2.0 as baseline meta-model. We propose as well what we see as a natural continuation of the already developed work and how to achieve it: the integration of results from both use cases facilitated by the use of the same baseline meta-model and of the same process framework tool."
pub.1165986222,Injector and Extractor for transformations between business processes and business process models,"A business process is a set of tasks that allow users to offer a service or a product to a customer. Formalizing business process allows process engineers to analyze, simulate, evolve, and manipulate them for different purposes. Actually, there are several graphic tools to formalize business processes that apply the BPMN 2.0 standard, however the business processes generated by these tools are not interoperable with each other. During the last years, we have been working in tailoring business process models using an MDE approach, i.e. configuring general processes to particular contexts by applying models and transformations. However, the MDE approach requires a BPMN model in XMI format that is compatible with transformation tools and languages. Therefore, there is no bidirectional compatibility between BPMN and XMI processes and manual translation is hard and error prone. In this article we present a set of projectors: an injector that transforms the BPMN process into XMI model, and an extractor that transforms the XMI model into BPMN process. We conduct a set of experiments in four BPMN tools to verify the transformations between business processes and business process models."
pub.1094608678,Apto: A MDD-based Generic Framework for Context-aware Deeply Adaptive Service-based Processes,"Context-awareness and adaptability are important and desirable properties of service-based processes designed to provide personalized services. Most of the existing approaches focus on the adaptation at the process instance level [1] which involves extending the standard Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) and its engine or creating their own process languages (e.g. [2]). However, the approach proposed here aims to apply an adaptation to processes modeled or developed without any adaptation possibility in mind and independently of specific usage contexts. In addition, most of the existing approaches tackle the adaptation on the process instance or definition levels by explicitly specifying some form of variation points. This, however, leads to a contradiction between how the architect logically views and interprets differences in the process family and the actual modeling constructs through which the logical differences must be expressed. We introduce the notion of an evolution fragment and evolution primitive to capture the variability in a more logical and independent way. Finally, the proposed approach intends to support the viewpoint of context-aware adaptation as a crosscutting concern with respect to the core “business logic” of the process. In this way, the design of the process core can be decoupled from the design of the adaptation logic. To this end, we leverage ideas from the domain of model-driven development (MDD) and generative programming."

A major contributory factor to this state of affairs is that the majority of software metrics are developed, collected and applied in a haphazard fashion. The result is metrics that frequently are poorly formulated, inappropriate to the specific needs and environment of the using organisation and hard to analyse once collected. Over recent years a number of measurement methods-frameworks for developing and applying metrics-have been proposed and used to rectify this state of affairs.

pub.1094725521,Towards Enabling Reuse in the Context of Safety-Critical Product Lines,"In the context of safety-critical product lines, industries have to face an urgent challenge: reduction of time and cost for the creation of a safety case. A safety case is a contextualized structured argument constituted of process and product-based sub-arguments to show that a system is acceptably safe. Its creation is an extremely time-consuming and costly activity. To reduce time and cost, reuse capabilities are being investigated from different perspectives however currently no satisfying approach is available. In this paper, we propose a new methodological framework called Anti-Sisyphus. Anti-Sisyphus is aimed at enabling reuse by combining process lines, product lines and safety case lines. The systematization of what varies and what remains in common with respect to process as well as product elements in turns enables the systematization of what varies and remains in common in terms of process-based as well as product-based arguments within a safety case line. Anti-Sisyphus thus has the potential to enable a 3D reuse."

In this paper, we present a logical feature model which can model the variability of requirements, and introduce variant points in business process templates defined by petri nets to model dynamic processes. Then, we map compound features in a logical feature model to variant points in a template through propositional logics. At last, the configured process can be verified based on petri net theory."

However, this artifact is not commonly elaborated due to time and costs associated. Thus, it was observed the importance of the practice of reutilization of business process models, making use of specific techniques such as the Business Process Line (BPL) that was originated from concepts of Software Product Line (SPL). As seen in SPL, in order to aid the creation, instantiation and evolution of BPLs, the usage of computational tools is also very important in the context of BPL, due mainly to the complexity and dynamism from businesses. Despite the growing academic interest in the area, no specific tools with support to build and document BPLs using features model, BPMN and BPMN* notations were found in the literature. This paper presents an Eclipse plug-in that supports the creation and documentation of BPLs, named BPL-Framework, which uses the aforementioned notations. Based on an evaluation done by individuals with different levels of knowledge about BPL, the BPL-Framework was considered to be satisfactory in relation to functional suitability (accuracy), operability (ease of use, learnability and attractiveness) and transferability (portability, adaptability and installability) from the ISO/IEC 25010."
pub.1095820650,A Modeling Approach for Business Processes Based on Variability,"The business processes of an enterprise are its core asset, enabling a prompt and flexible response to business changes. Recently, business processes have attracted considerable interest with the emergence of service-oriented computing environments. In these environments, the business process acts as a connection point between the business and information technology. Therefore, a systematic and practical process model is required to develop business processes efficiently. We propose a process model that consists of a business definition and a business decision, and a process definition phase for developing a business process by combining product-line concepts. The proposed process model can facilitate the efficient development of a business process by providing explicit templates and supporting tools."

Conventional process modeling techniques are proven to be inefficient while dealing with non-repetitive, knowledge-intensive processes such as Case Management processes. In this work we use the MAP notation to model a Mortgage Approval Process as defined in Banking. To increase the navigability and practical value of map models, we extend the MAP notation with the concepts of Roles, Relations between roles, and Role Configuration Rules."
pub.1061788779,Exception Handling Patterns for Process Modeling,"Process modeling allows for analysis and improvement of processes that coordinate multiple people and tools working together to carry out a task. Process modeling typically focuses on the normative process, that is, how the collaboration transpires when everything goes as desired. Unfortunately, real-world processes rarely proceed that smoothly. A more complete analysis of a process requires that the process model also include details about what to do when exceptional situations arise. We have found that, in many cases, there are abstract patterns that capture the relationship between exception handling tasks and the normative process. Just as object-oriented design patterns facilitate the development, documentation, and maintenance of object-oriented programs, we believe that process patterns can facilitate the development, documentation, and maintenance of process models. In this paper, we focus on the exception handling patterns that we have observed over many years of process modeling. We describe these patterns using three process modeling notations: UML 2.0 Activity Diagrams, BPMN, and Little-JIL. We present both the abstract structure of the pattern as well as examples of the pattern in use. We also provide some preliminary statistical survey data to support the claim that these patterns are found commonly in actual use and discuss the relative merits of the three notations with respect to their ability to represent these patterns."
pub.1061600264,Process Platform Planning for Variety Coordination from Design to Production in Mass Customization Manufacturing,"The key challenge of implementing mass customization manufacturing lies in the variety dilemma exhibited by frequent design changes and recurrent process variations. A holistic view of variety handling gives rise to the importance of variety coordination from design to production. This paper proposes a concept of process platform for coordinating product and process variety. Fundamental issues of process platforms are studied regarding generic product and process structures, generic planning, and generic variety representation. Variety handlers and associated states are introduced to model the meta-structure inherent in variety coordination. A set of modeling formalisms are developed to provide a powerful syntactic model to support rigorous analysis and manipulation of process platforms, while facilitating the application of semantics to support process platform enactment and detailed observations from a number of perspectives involving customers, design and production. Also reported is a case study of mass customization manufacturing of vibration motors for mobile phone products. The managerial implications of process platform planning are further discussed."

We argue that families of business process models can facilitate the installation of situated models in different organizations. We propose a representation system called Map to capture variability in process models expressed in an intentional manner through business goals and strategies.

The kernel of an organizational level model is also introduced to allow the organizational implementation of each variant."
pub.1061718365,Mining Recurring Concepts in a Dynamic Feature Space,"Most data stream classification techniques assume that the underlying feature space is static. However, in real-world applications the set of features and their relevance to the target concept may change over time. In addition, when the underlying concepts reappear, reusing previously learnt models can enhance the learning process in terms of accuracy and processing time at the expense of manageable memory consumption. In this paper, we propose mining recurring concepts in a dynamic feature space (MReC-DFS), a data stream classification system to address the challenges of learning recurring concepts in a dynamic feature space while simultaneously reducing the memory cost associated with storing past models. MReC-DFS is able to detect and adapt to concept changes using the performance of the learning process and contextual information. To handle recurring concepts, stored models are combined in a dynamically weighted ensemble. Incremental feature selection is performed to reduce the combined feature space. This contribution allows MReC-DFS to store only the features most relevant to the learnt concepts, which in turn increases the memory efficiency of the technique. In addition, an incremental feature selection method is proposed that dynamically determines the threshold between relevant and irrelevant features. Experimental results demonstrating the high accuracy of MReC-DFS compared with state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of real datasets are presented. The results also show the superior memory efficiency of MReC-DFS. "

pub.1095446440,Thrust: A Method for Speeding up the Creation of Process-Related Deliverables,"Certification of safety-critical avionics systems is an expensive and time-consuming activity due to the necessity of providing numerous deliverables. Some of these deliverables are process-related. To reduce time and cost related to the provision of process-related deliverables, in this paper, we propose to combine three approaches: the safety-oriented process line engineering approach, the process-based argumentation line approach, and the model driven certification-oriented approach. More specifically, we focus on safety-related processes for the development of avionics systems and we define how these three approaches are combined and which techniques, tools and guidelines should be used to implement the resulting approach, called THRUST. Advantages and disadvantages of possible existing techniques and tools are discussed and proposals as well as conceptual solutions for new techniques are sketched. Based on the sketched conceptual solutions, we then apply THRUST to speed up the creation of process-related deliverables in compliance with DO-178B/C."

pub.1133748449,Workflow Recommendation Based on Graph Embedding,"In order to complete design and modeling of workflow more effectively, enterprises urgently need efficient workflow recommendation technology. At present, traditional recommendation algorithms based on process structure are widely used, yet tedious modeling operations and poor recommendation accuracy are noteworthy issues. To address the above problems, based on complex workflow relationships, we utilize graph embedding in workflow recommendation to provide convenience for business process operators. In this paper, we propose a Workflow Embedding Recommendation(namely WFER) method, which can deal with the adjacency matrix of complex process to obtain more detailed feature representation, so as to calculate the similarity accurately. Therefore, we implement efficient recommendation based on workflow semantics. Moreover, this recommendation tool is suitable for both transactional workflows and scientific workflows. Finally, based on real datasets and generated datasets, we carry out experiments to compare our method with other traditional algorithms and experimental results show its effectiveness and efficiency in practice."
pub.1094617404,A Multi-layered Architecture for Process Variation Management,Organizations and enterprises have to constantly re-engineer and customize business processes to stay competitive in their market. These modifications and customizations result in a large number of similar processes that lead to high costs of deployment and maintenance. This paper presents a multi-layer architecture for efficient management of process variations. The approach consists of organizing related processes into a Base layer and multiple Variation layers that separate the common fragment of the process from its customized parts. It avoids explosions of duplicate similar processes and allows business users flexible and easy change management of their processes. The implementation with the Eclipse modeling framework is also done to validate the proposed architecture.
pub.1061811667,Reconfigurable Mosaic Annular Arrays,"Mosaic annular arrays (MAA) based on reconfigurable array (RA) transducer electronics assemblies are presented as a potential solution for future highly integrated ultrasonic transducer subsystems. Advantages of MAAs include excellent beam quality and depth of field resulting from superior elevational focus compared with 1-D electronically scanned arrays, as well as potentially reduced cost, size, and power consumption resulting from the use of a limited number of beamforming channels for processing a large number of subelements. Specific design tradeoffs for these highly integrated arrays are discussed in terms of array specifications for center frequency, element pitch, and electronic switch-on resistance. Large-area RAs essentially function as RC delay lines. Efficient architectures which take into account RC delay effects are presented. Architectures for integration of the transducer and electronics layers of large-area array implementations are reviewed. "
pub.1140076524,Modeling Variability in the Performance Perspective of Business Processes,"The modeling and management of business processes often leads to the definition of several variants of the same process. This variability can be reflected in different process perspectives such as control-flow, data, resources or performance. The management of process variants can be a laborious, time-consuming and error-prone task since they require a high coordination in the management of each variant and in most cases this management is done manually. For this reason, many proposals have been developed to deal with the variability of business processes. However, none of them covers in detail the variability in the performance perspective, which is concerned with the definition of performance requirements usually specified as a set of Process Performance Indicators (PPIs). This variability can be reflected in the form of repetitive and redundant PPI definitions, and can lead to errors and inconsistencies in PPI definitions. To address this problem, in this article we propose a detailed PPI variability classification and a formalization of how PPIs can be modeled together with the variability of other process perspectives. To this end, we considered variability management approaches, called by restriction and by extension, and we illustrated our proposal by integrating it with existing variability modeling languages. An evaluation conducted in two scenarios shows the feasibility and usefulness of our proposal."

And with the development of economic and technology, the social division of labor intensifies and virtual organization emerged in the past years. Such organizations always have several transregional departments. Due to the characteristics of such organizations, the process management and improvement are different from traditional organizations. How to manage and improve process in these organizations is an important and difficult problem.

pub.1094015183,Design of an Order Acceptance and Scheduling Module in a Unified Framework with Product and Process Features,"In manufacturing industry, advanced production planning becomes challenging when collaborative manufacturing is involved. First, manufacturing tasks are driven by the customer's requirements which are constantly changing. Therefore, order acceptance becomes a complicated problem because it is difficult to answer whether the order can be fulfilled or not. Further, each contractor's capacity becomes a factor to be considered constantly in the overall dynamic planning and scheduling activities. Such effort requires the mapping exercise between manufacturing tasks and contractors' capabilities with some detailed optimization. On the other hand, engineering configuration solutions for customers are constantly updated, so are the manufacturing tasks, and then supplier/contractor jobs. Customer-oriented manufacturing demands full integration of engineering design and production planning in an integrated environment. This paper proposes a generic framework in an advanced Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for the unification of product and process models in order to fulfill the variety of customer orders. A feature-based production scheduling and capacity management data structure model is suggested accordingly. Based on the suggested framework, an order acceptance and scheduling (OAS) module within Visual Manufacturing (a commercial ERP system) is designed. Technologically, a new feature category, i.e. process features, including capacity and customer profile features, is introduced for further research and implementation."
pub.1093896721,Accomplishment of Quality-Based Objective for Social Integration and Regionalization in Minerva Academic Model,"Social Integration and Regionalization are two of six axes considered in the Minerva Academic Model (MAM) proposed by the “Benernérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla” (BUAP). This innovative collaborative academic model is a product of internal collective elaborations, considering the own previous experiences with the academic Fenix project, and international and national education trends. The MAM aims at reaching a strong relationship of the BUAP community with regional, national, and international communities. In this perspective, our research focuses in the structuration of effective process for the accomplishment of MAM objectives. For that, it is not enough the enunciation of objectives, strategies, and desirable quality attributes, but their translation in meaningful and manageable processes. In order to give complete sense to MAM expressions, in the work referred in this paper, the quality features included in propositions of Social Integration and Regionalization axes are converted in direct and expressive objectives. For an effective implementation of these objectives in social realities, this paper proposes pertinent, realistic, and manageable processes. The quality-based objectives constitute a way to concrete the effective contribution of Non-Functional Features of the Model and to offer an alternative for validating the explicit objectives proposed in the MAM formulation. The Construction of educational objectives derived from quality features of an academic model and the conversion of objectives in effective and manageable processes constitute a way to affront the changes in the context and to contribute to the development of the resilient engineering concept. The application of this concept in education matches the objectives and action axes of the MAM, and it aids also to introduce and to materialize particular exigencies, such as sustainability, innovation, etc. in education models."

pub.1061717992,Data-Based Robust Multiobjective Optimization of Interconnected Processes: Energy Efficiency Case Study in Papermaking,"Reducing energy consumption is a major challenge for ""energy-intensive"" industries such as papermaking. A commercially viable energy saving solution is to employ data-based optimization techniques to obtain a set of ""optimized"" operational settings that satisfy certain performance indices. The difficulties of this are: 1) the problems of this type are inherently multicriteria in the sense that improving one performance index might result in compromising the other important measures; 2) practical systems often exhibit unknown complex dynamics and several interconnections which make the modeling task difficult; and 3) as the models are acquired from the existing historical data, they are valid only locally and extrapolations incorporate risk of increasing process variability. To overcome these difficulties, this paper presents a new decision support system for robust multiobjective optimization of interconnected processes. The plant is first divided into serially connected units to model the process, product quality, energy consumption, and corresponding uncertainty measures. Then multiobjective gradient descent algorithm is used to solve the problem in line with user's preference information. Finally, the optimization results are visualized for analysis and decision making. In practice, if further iterations of the optimization algorithm are considered, validity of the local models must be checked prior to proceeding to further iterations. The method is implemented by a MATLAB-based interactive tool DataExplorer supporting a range of data analysis, modeling, and multiobjective optimization techniques. The proposed approach was tested in two U.K.-based commercial paper mills where the aim was reducing steam consumption and increasing productivity while maintaining the product quality by optimization of vacuum pressures in forming and press sections. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method."

pub.1093271941,Model Driven Process Engineering,"Within the domain of information systems, one of the main technological moves we may presently observe in industrial circles is the paradigm shift from object composition to model transformation. This is happening at a very fast pace. Among the concrete signs of this evolution one may mention the ongoing change at the Object Management Group from OMA (Object Management Architecture) to MDA (Model-Driven Architecture). A new information system landscape is emerging that will be more model-centered than object-oriented. Within this context, the information engineer will use and produce many models of low granularity and high abstraction. These models may describe static or dynamic aspects and may be accordingly qualified of product and process models. This paper focuses more particularly on the recent evolution of process models. It shows some aspects of the industrial state of the art in the domain and suggests some benefits that could be reaped from a well-mastered utilization of these techniques."

pub.1094827284,Product families and process families,"Product lines or families represent an important way of organizing software products. Product families might include, for example, successive revisions of a single application, versions of an application for different host platforms, or versions with varying features, e.g., different levels of security. A software product family can thus be viewed as a collection of products that are similar in some important respects yet systematically different in others. The family viewpoint emphasizes both the commonality among family members and the differences between them, and it draws attention to their interrelationships. Our work in software processes has lead us to conclude that software processes also can be usefully viewed in terms of families. As software process engineers, we also naturally view products in terms of the processes that create them and, conversely, we view processes in terms of the products they create. This suggests that product families and process families should be closely interrelated. Consequently, both products and processes may benefit from analysis in terms of families and family relationships. We begin to sketch out such an analysis and some of the issues that it raises."

As with generic products accommodating product family design, generic processes facilitate process family planning in producing the corresponding product families. In view of the fact that a production process is commonly represented as a tree, this paper puts forward an approach based on tree unification to construct generic processes from large volumes of data existing in companies' databases. The preliminary results of applying the proposed approach to electronic products have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of constructing generic processes based on tree unification."

The ability to decompose such IT services (defined by themselves or third party suppliers) into elemental service processes characterized by core function can benefit the providers by allowing them to identify alternative service processes of potentially lower cost and/or improved quality. This paper proposes an ontology-based hierarchical service decomposition and identification approach to support service providers in managing their operational service processes by the characterization and exploitation of such elemental service processes. We further demonstrate the feasibility and sample outcomes of the proposed approach an example.

Given the highly interdependent characteristics of software development tasks and the knowledge-intensive nature of SPT, this investigation focuses on the learning capabilities of absorptive capacity (AC) and transactive memory systems (TMS) to determine how a team creates and distributes knowledge to perform SPT efficiently and effectively. Moreover, concerning the collaborative yet conflictual environment of SPT, two associated team climates are considered to examine the moderating effects: innovation and performance. In the investigation, 116 Taiwanese software project teams were surveyed. An effectual knowledge-learning and sharing process featuring TMS and AC was identified, and the mixed influences of the two team climates on the process were revealed, along with several treatments discussed in the SPT context."
pub.1061786939,Facilitating Cloud Process Family Co-Evolution by Reusable Process Plug-in: An Open-source Prototype,"In a business cloud environment, a reference business process model needs to be customized in order to meet the individualized requirements of each organization. Consequently, a reference process model is generally evolved to a couple of process variants, known as a process family. Currently, there exist some approaches and tools that can efficiently configure a reference process model. However, a key issue is how to manage co-evolution appropriately within a family of process models if the base process model of a process family is changed. Contemporary process management tools do not adequately support the management of such co-evolution. Each process variant in the process family has to be changed as a separate process model which often leads to redundancies and inefficiencies. In this article, we propose a novel approach for managing co-evolution of process families based on an aspect-oriented approach. Change options on base process model are abstracted and extracted as a pluggable component, which can be selectively reused for all members, and consequently, guides the co-evolution for the whole process family. In particular, the control-flow and data-flow relations between process extension and a member of process families can be built by leveraging process extensibility patterns. The correctness of our extension approach is proved based on graph theory. The whole approach in this article have been implemented as a working open-source prototype and tested against a real case study from the city logistic distribution domain as well as real data set from SAP reference models."

Many improvement technologies have emerged as a response in a multimodel environment. The term improvement technology is used to refer in general to the long list of reference models, standards, best practices, regulatory policies and other types of practices that an organization may use simultaneously (i.e. CMMI, ISO 15504, ISO 9001, Bootstrap and others). The simultaneous use of multiple improvement technologies is causing many problems such as the handling of heterogeneous improvement technologies for deriving processes. Although process architecture has been considered as a means for harmonizing these technologies and assisting process stakeholders do their job, it is unclear how to design a process architecture that supports a multimodel environment.

Therefore, we apply a product-line technique to SOA. This allows us to generate various integrated services. The integrated services represent work processes of enterprises and they can be designed immediately as new requirements.

pub.1093946995,An Application of Six Sigma with Lean Production Practices for Identifying Common Causes of Software Process Variability,"Six Sigma emphasizes the variability causes search. The special causes are more evident, which favors their identification, while the common causes are more difficult to be identified and solved and, for that, they request a specialists' participation. Many software development process variability causes are common and it is not always possible to have Six Sigma specialists to identify them. An alternative might be the visibility criteria proposed by Lean Production. Instead of this criterion, software engineers are able to more easily notice the mistakes and their causes than Six Sigma specialists. This article verifies the advantages of using Lean Production practices, based on a Multiple Case Study on some software organizations that uses this methodology. The study shows that the projects were finished more quickly and they presented more effective results."
pub.1132058497,Context-Aware Querying and Injection of Process Fragments in Process-Aware Information Systems,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often customized to meet customer needs and, hence, exhibit a large number of hard-/software configuration variants. Consequently, the processes deployed on a CPS need to be configured to the respective CPS variant. This includes both configuration at design time (i.e., before deploying the implemented processes on the CPS) and runtime configuration taking the current context of the CPS into account. Such runtime process configuration is by far not trivial, e.g., alternative process fragments may have to be selected at certain points during process execution of which one fragment is then dynamically applied to the process at hand. Contemporary approaches focus on the design time configuration of processes, while neglecting runtime configuration to cope with process variability. In this paper, a generic approach enabling context-aware process configuration at runtime is presented. With the Process Query Language process fragments can be flexibly selected from a process repository, and then be dynamically injected into running process instances depending on the respective contextual situations. The latter can be automatically derived from context factors, e.g., sensor data or configuration parameters of the given CPS. Altogether, the presented approach allows for a flexible configuration and late composition of process instances at runtime, as required in many application domains and scenarios."
pub.1093714690,Guaranteeing Soundness of Configurable Process Variants in Provop,"Usually, for a particular business process a multitude of variants exist. Each of them constitutes an adjustment of a reference process model to specific requirements building the process context. While some progress has been achieved regarding the configuration of process variants, there exists only little work on how to accomplish this in a sound and efficient manner, especially when considering the large number of process variants that exist in practice as well as the many syntactical and semantical constraints they have to obey. In this paper we discuss advanced concepts for the context- and constraint-based configuration of process variants, and show how they can be utilized to ensure soundness of the configured process variants. Enhancing process-aware information systems with the capability to easily configure sound process models, belonging to the same process family and fitting to the given application context, will enable a new quality in engineering process-aware information systems."
pub.1095131906,A Manufacturing Perspective of Physical Design Characterization,"As semiconductor manufacturers continue to aggressively push technology and lithography, the traditional model of well-defined boundaries between development and manufacturing activities has blurred. Historically, physical design characterization (PDC) has been the focus of product or design engineers. Most manufacturers focus their resources and expertise upon process control and modification to achieve the anticipated or desired productivities, while the majority of the design and product engineers' responsibilities precede the qualification. This paper will introduce PDC from a manufacturing perspective and the value of design-specific information for successful process control. Several PDC tools will be described in terms of this integrated approach and the current embodiment at the IBM Microelectronics Vermont facility. Specifically, these tools include pattern density calculations, critical area extractions, and “swampfinding”, a method for locating specific design-process sensitivities. This paper will then develop both the technical and business strategies that leverage this information into the manufacturing processes. To clearly illustrate the concepts introduced, several examples of PDC results augmented with traditional characterization information, along with the ensuing manufacturing actions will be reviewed. Finally, the larger picture of physical design characterization in manufacturing, and the impact upon development, will be further developed."

This has limited the scope of workflow management. Moreover, the networked economy of the new millennium requires workflow management systems which are able to deal with dynamically changing workflow processes. The paper addresses two notorious problems related to adaptive workflow: (1) providing management information at the right aggregation level, and (2) supporting dynamic change, i.e., migrating cases from an old to a new workflow. These two problems are tackled by using generic process models. A generic process model describes a family of variants of the same workflow process. It is a first step in the direction of truly flexible workflow management systems and provides a handle to solve the two problems mentioned."
pub.1106089071,Advances in Wire Bonding Technology to Overcome Resonance Conditions,"Increasing number of semiconductor packages are using low modulus die attach adhesives. Low modulus adhesives can efficiently absorb and dissipate the mechanical and thermal stresses (e.g. due to CTE mismatch) than conventional adhesives resulting in better thermal performance and package reliability. However, wire bonding on a die attached with low modulus adhesive can be very challenging. Die attached with low modulus adhesive is more prone to die movement and vibration, which may lead to resonance condition. Resonance during bonding can cause low ball shear, low IMC, skidded and smashed bonds. This paper examines the challenges of wire bonding on devices attached using low modulus epoxy. A FEA model is developed to understand the effect of key factors such as die attach adhesive modulus, bond line thickness, die size and die thickness on different resonant modes that can occur during wire bonding. It is found that for a given die size, the die thickness, die attach modulus, and bond line thickness can significantly affect resonant modes. When a low modulus epoxy is used, a smaller and thinner die is prone to oscillation and resonance, and is more difficult to wire bond than a larger die. The results show that die and die attach system behaves similar to a mass-spring system, where the die is the mass and the die attach acts like the spring. The resonant frequency of such a system does not depend on an external applied force, but only on the mass and the spring constant (stiffness). Study results of wire bonding process on a device using low modulus adhesive are presented. The process parameters that are found to be most significant are ultrasonic (energy, frequency and control mode), bond force, and bond time. It is found that controlling the bond force and ultrasonic energy is key in optimizing the wire bonding process on these devices. If the force and ultrasonic are not controlled properly, a significant portion of the ultrasonic energy is lost in exciting the die and developing the resonance situation instead of bond formation. Since different devices can vibrate and resonate under different conditions, optimizing the bonding process can be tedious and time consuming. To simplify the process development, a response based process is developed with closed loop force and ultrasonic control. This new process feature helps control resonance issues such as smashed bonds while still achieving a robust process with good ball shear and IMC performance. Experimental results of the wire bonding process using the new process approach are presented."

While horizontal coupling of processes has been achieved through Business Process Management and Integrated Manufacturing Systems, vertical management and operation across organization layers still lack unifying approaches. In particular the vertical integration of business processes with production planning systems and production control systems is of crucial importance for agile business development.

There is an approach called Process Family Engineering (PFE) that tries to ease the design of BIS using ideas from the Software Product Lines (SPL) field. Roughly speaking, they propose to, first, study the variability of the system without entering into details by means of building a variability model (calledfeature model), that is used later for building the business process. However, in PFE the process of deriving the business process from the feature model is performed manually. Authors use feature models with a different meaning that is commonly accepted in SPL. In this paper, we provide a rigorous description for the new meaning of feature models, and a mapping relationship that defines how to use the information in the FM for obtaining the basic structure of the business process.

pub.1061786938,Search-Based Web Service Antipatterns Detection,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is widely used in industry and is regarded as one of the preferred architectural design technologies. As with any other software system, service-based systems (SBSs) may suffer from poor design, i.e., antipatterns, for many reasons such as poorly planned changes, time pressure or bad design choices. Consequently, this may lead to an SBS product that is difficult to evolve and that exhibits poor quality of service (QoS). Detecting web service antipatterns is a manual, time-consuming and error-prone process for software developers. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for detection of web service antipatterns using a cooperative parallel evolutionary algorithm (P-EA). The idea is that several detection methods are combined and executed in parallel during an optimization process to find a consensus regarding the identification of web service antipatterns. We report the results of an empirical study using eight types of common web service antipatterns. We compare the implementation of our cooperative P-EA approach with random search, two single population-based approaches and one state-of-the-art detection technique not based on heuristic search. Statistical analysis of the obtained results demonstrates that our approach is efficient in antipattern detection, with a precision score of 89 percent and a recall score of 93 percent."

Business processes are dynamic entities. At any given time, they must handle a variety of business situations that are changing over time. The business process model must be able to follow these changes, so it is necessary to support the systematic development of a set of similar business processes by understanding and controlling their common and distinguishing characteristics. Management of differences, which is called variability management, is considered the key in product-line development processes. That is, the methods of product-line engineering can be used to make the processes more responsive to changes in the business. This paper describes an approach for analyzing the variability of the business process. In developing the model for business process, variations are analyzed at different abstract levels in which the region of commonality is identified and the variations are refined. The model for business processes, explicitly representing commonality and variability, is described using UML activity diagrams."

Companies are in continuous evolution to adapt to market changes, thus, current process engineers redesign the processes every time that is needed using ad hoc techniques. This situation motivates that these changes, called runtime variability, must be managed. Some authors have used Software Product Lines (SPL) ideas to manage it. Current approaches for documenting runtime variability in SPL and BDD, proposes different model representations. Unfortunately, we have determined that the expressiveness level in BDD is not adequate, and that SPL solutions needs for adaptation to BDD context for describing under which circumstances a business evolves.

Moreover, many research works focus on the application of process mining techniques to manage configurable process models. To provide configurable process models with high quality and less complexity using process mining techniques, the preparation of event logs before discovering processes is strongly required. Therefore, various approaches have introduced semantics to derive knowledge from process execution traces. Although, this knowledge is used for discovering variability rules or deriving process variants. However, existing works lack the discovery of semantically enriched configurable process models from event logs. Since event logs are usually combined with semantics and domain ontology for optimizing process mining applications, it seems to be important to introduce a new approach of semantically enriched configurable process discovery. It will be helpful during configuration, validation, and enhancement of configurable processes that are extracted from event logs. In this paper, we present a new framework for event logs preprocessing using ontologies. Our aim is to enrich a collection of event logs with concepts from ontologies as a first step towards discovering a semantically enriched configurable process."

Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) supports modelling run-time adaptation of partially structured business process models, but does neither allow selection nor sequence of tasks. Objective: Our goal is to develop an approach that computes sequences of tasks such that a context-specific goal is satisfied. We apply the SMA * algorithm to support run-time planning of partly structured parts of a business process in order to find an appropriate sequence of tasks. Method: We perform a literature review in order to derive the most suitable heuristic search algorithm. To support the selection and specification of tasks, we extend the CMMN metamodel. A running example is presented to show practical applicability of the approach. Results: The extension of the CMMN metamodel reflects the requirements for serializing tasks at run-time.

Conclusion: Our approach allows to automatically derive execution plans for partly structured business processes depending on the context."
pub.1093189215,Configurable Process Models: A Semantic Validation,"Nowadays variability management has been introduced in the field of business process modeling by means of the configurable process models solution, with a view to resolving problems of redundancy and design time errors. Nevertheless, the existing approaches of variability modeling lack of semantic representation, and consequently, present many limits regarding automation of modeling, configuring and evolving configurable processes. Recently, semantic web technologies, especially ontologies, have been proposed in order to increase the level of automation and reduce human intervention in different domains. Business process management has benefited from the emergence of these technologies and the concept of semantic business process management appeared to make the whole business process accessible to intelligent queries as for machine reasoning. Whereas most approaches focus on providing mechanisms for modeling and configuring process models, their validation was treated syntactically rather than semantically. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach to enhance configurable processes validation using ontologies."

pub.1094123915,The Role of Service Abstraction and Service Variability and its Impact on Requirements Engineering for Service-oriented Systems,"The service-oriented paradigm typically separates the development of systems into service engineering and application engineering. In our opinion, these two disciplines cannot be completely separated, as otherwise, there is no assurance that services provided by service engineering can actually be used by application engineering. In this paper, we describe service-oriented requirements engineering (SORE) as an appropriate means for mediating between the two disciplines, and we identify the provision of service capabilities on the right level of abstraction and variability as the most crucial aspects SORE has to assure. For this purpose, we present the adoption of product line technology in service oriented architecture and its closer alignment with business process management as a promising approach, and list related principles as well as challenges we plan to address in our ongoing research."
pub.1143528562,Data-Driven Optimization Method for Aluminum Alloy Casting Process Parameters and Alloy Composition,"Melting and casting are important parts of aluminum alloy production, in which process parameters and alloy composition are key factors in determining ingot performance and are essential to aluminum alloy product quality. In this paper, a data-driven method for in-depth optimization of process parameters and alloy composition in an aluminum alloy casting process is presented, which can automatically optimize the process parameters and alloy compositions to improve the ingot performance. The method includes three parts: data pre-processing, relational model construction, and process parameters/alloy composition optimization. At the data pre-processing stage, feature engineering, outlier handling, and missing value handling are used in turn to obtain a high-quality dataset. At the relational model construction stage, XGBoost is used to construct a relational model between the process parameters/alloy composition and ingot performance. At the process parameters or alloy composition optimization stage, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the process parameters and alloy compositions respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the melting and casting production process dataset of aluminum alloy is constructed. Experiments show that our algorithm can automatically optimize the process parameters or alloy compositions in a short time, and significantly improve the performance of ingots. The proposed method is an important guideline for practical production."
pub.1151082446,Improving Business Process Resilience to Long-tailed Business Events via Low-code,"Among different types of changes, a specific type named long-tailed change (LTC), induced by wide-spectrum and sporadic events (hereafter long-tailed business events (LBEs), poses fresh challenges to available change management solutions in business process management. The disorder in economic and social life caused by the competition of COVID-19 epidemics and countermeasures all over the world fully demonstrates the impact of this new change management problem. Based on the principle of separation of concerns, this paper proposes a systematic framework to solve the above problem. The solution consists of a low-code mechanism for process adaptation and business policy conformance. As a result, front-line practitioners can quickly react to changes by using a domain-specific language (DSL) while a corresponding verification of functional and non-functional attributes maintains compliance with business constraints. We validate the solution through a case study of an e-commerce scenario during the COVID-19 pandemic."

pub.1093036007,Toward uBPMN-Based Patterns for Modeling Ubiquitous Business Processes,"Ubiquitous business processes are the new generation of processes that pervade the physical space and interact with their environments using a minimum of human involvement. Although they are now widely deployed in the industry, their deployment is still ad hoc. They are implemented after an arbitrary modeling phase or no modeling phase at all. The absence of a solid modeling phase backing up the implementation generates many loopholes that are stressed in the literature. Here, we tackle the issue of modeling ubiquitous business processes. We propose patterns to represent the recent ubiquitous computing features. These patterns are the outcome of an analysis we conducted in the field of humancomputer interaction to examine how the features are actually deployed. The patterns understandability, ease-of-use, usefulness, and completeness are examined via a user experiment. The results indicate that these four indexes are on the positive track. Hence, the patterns may be the backbone of ubiquitous business process modeling in industrial applications."
pub.1166656237,Towards Human-Centered Best Practice Sharing in Global Production Networks for More Socially Sustainable Production Processes,"Due to globally distributed and interconnected value chains, manufacturing companies operate across multiple production sites in complex production networks. An effective transfer of knowledge within the network can create decisive competitive advantages. However, this learning process is often impeded by a lack of knowledge transparency in the network. The Best Practice Sharing (BPS) tool is a data-driven approach to facilitate knowledge sharing by identifying comparable processes across production sites and determining optimization potential through process evaluation. However, the current version of the BPS tool focuses solely on economic criteria for process optimization. To also consider social sustainability aspects, a human-centered perspective on process design is needed. To this end, this paper introduces two extensions to the BPS approach. First, based on a systematic literature review, a framework for characterizing the human role in production processes is developed, which extends the identification of comparable processes. Second, a risk assessment-based analysis approach for the evaluation of processes following human-centered criteria is presented. Here, particular emphasis is placed on identifying suitable methods to assess psychosocial risk factors, using a second systematic literature review. Together, these two extensions pave the way for human-centered BPS in global production networks."

Both technologies provide wide-area connectivity to “things” that benefit from being connected including sensors, machines, actuators, and so on. LTE-M and NB-IoT continued their evolution across successive 3GPP releases providing higher data rates, power saving features, coexistence with the fifth generation New Radio (NR), and so on. In Release-17 (Rel-17), 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) for NB-IoT, as well as the support of up to 14 hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) processes and a new maximum DL transporting block size (TBS) for half duplex frequency-division duplexing (HD-FDD) LTE-M devices were standardized. This article provides an overview of the Rel-17 physical layer enhancements according to the 3GPP specifications, including descriptions of their technical components, qualitative gains, and performance evaluations. For NB-IoT, 16-QAM in DL nearly doubles the peak data rate using a larger maximum DL TBS, whereas 16-QAM in UL allows transmitting the largest TBS available for quadrature phase shift keying using half of the resources in the time domain. For LTE-M, for HD-FDD Category M1 (Cat-M1) UEs, the 14 HARQ processes feature adds full support for handling the presence of invalid subframes and increases the DL peak data rate by 20 percent, whereas the introduction of a larger maximum DL TBS further increases the DL peak data rate by 73.6 percent."
pub.1095103825,Next Generation of TCAD Environments for MEMS Design,"Most available MEMS design environments focus on the integrated behavioral simulation of electronic and mechanical components. The fabrication process is considered a fixed sequence of well-known steps, which can be purchased from foundries. Simulation models rely on the assumption of ideal process conditions and do not take into account tolerances or intra die variations. Recently there has been discussion that the gap between actual process results and that of predicted models are often out of a tolerable range. This leads to the demand of increased simulation accuracy for the most crucial process steps. The deviations of the comb structures in a resonator, which result from the tolerances in a Deep-RIE process, for example, can make the overall system design fail. To avoid these kinds of errors two things are needed: the technology provider has to know the parameter range of his process and be able to provide it to the designer without loosing his intellectual property. The designer in turn must be provided with a way to use this information to design a system which can perform in the range expected. In this paper we present the latest version of the TCAD environment BICEP3S (Braunschweigs Integrated CAD-Environment for Product Planning and Process Simulation). By using a central process database, which allows the exchange of all relevant process data it is able to overcome many of the mentioned obstacles. The database and process planning tool can be used by process developers to document changes in process settings and the influence of such changes on the process result. This information can then be used by the designers to set-up a simulation file for a detailed analysis of the impact of such parameter changes on the requested design. This will be shown by the example of silicon etching using an atomistic etch simulator."
pub.1086194076,Early manufacturing involvement in new process technology,"The authors outline the process of installing a new semiconductor process technology into manufacturing under IBM's policy of early manufacturing involvement. Final process development was performed on the manufacturing line, with the prime objective of reducing the time required to bring a new technology to full manufacturing capability. Other benefits included improved manufacturability of the process and lower capital costs. In this particular case, the new technology was an evolutionary extension of the older process, with several critical sectors requiring the majority of the development effort. In certain other sectors, a tightening of the specifications was required. Conflicts of interest and priority had to be dealt with, as well as optimizing the process. In some cases, development engineers worked directly with manufacturing engineers and, in other cases, manufacturing engineering took the responsibility for the process. When development was completed, a final process transfer procedure was put in place and manufacturing engineering carried out the final process qualification. The authors discuss the organization required and the developments involved when integrating the development effort within a manufacturing organization.<>"

The previous work on these patterns only considered the implementation level, but not the implications on the modeling level. Moreover, the potential for business process flexibility have not been fully leveraged due to some limitations in externalization of business logic into business rules. In this work, we report on the experience in modeling the set of rule patterns by using a rule-enhanced business process modeling language (rBPMN), and demonstrate the applicability of our findings on a business process case study."

To obtain the performance metrics of an avalanche silicon diode fabricated using a standard 0.5 μm CMOS process, and to examine possible ways to improve device characteristics using process variations and electrical control, we designed various low photon count avalanche diodes. We then laid out these diode designs with different well geometries and control terminals, had them fabricated in different process runs, and later tested them individually. To guide the design, understand the device behavior, and determine carrier impact ionization dictated performance figures, we also developed a device simulator verified by experimental data. The simulator is optimized for analysis of avalanche breakdown. Furthermore, to achieve as-designed device and circuit performance by suppressing unwanted peripheral corner breakdown between a p+-implant and a surrounding n-well, we used the overlapping between adjacent n-well implants. In a standard CMOS process that allows n-, n+-and p+-implants on a p− substrate, the n-wells were laid out by a length shorter than the process design kit recommended cross-talk distance 9λ, λ being half of the feature size. In addition to going beyond the standard process design rules to experiment with the effects of the lateral diffusion of dopants on device performance, we also added electrical gain and performance controllability to our impact ionization diodes by employing gate electrodes located at the perimeter."

pub.1111725899,Process Feature Change Recognition Based on Model Performance Monitoring and Adaptive Model Correction for the Gold Cyanidation Leaching Process,"The gold cyanidation leaching process (GCLP) is the central unit operation in hydrometallurgy, and satisfactory gold recovery is highly significant in practice. However, GCLP faces the challenge of an irregular slow time-varying feature (STVF), which seriously affects gold recovery, and blind treatment for STVF also has drawbacks, which results in the need for the recognition of STVF for purposeful, rather than blind, treatment. Meanwhile, it also faces the problem of change of working condition (COWC) due to the variability of mineral resources. Both STVF and COWC may cause degradation of the soft-measuring model, which presents the need for model correction. Therefore, a coping strategy is proposed to solve these existing problems. First, an improved model-based principal component analysis monitoring is proposed to detect model mismatch and monitor the change of process feature. Next, a support vector machine-based process feature change recognition method is presented to recognize change type, which not only provides guidance in treating STVF but also makes it possible to implement targeted model correction for STVF and COWC. Finally, an adaptive model correction strategy that combines case-based correction and just-in-time learning-based correction is proposed. The simulation studies have verified the validity of the proposed coping strategy."

The method of asymptotic approximation product was proposed, which constructs 3D process model automatically and intelligence. Compared with the traditional 3D model reconstruction based on orthographic projections or engineering drawing, the process information has some advantages followed. On the one hand, the reconstruction object is translated from the complicated engineering drawing into a series of more simple process drawing. With added plentiful process information for reconstruction, the disturbances are avoided such as irrelevant graph, symbol and label etc. And more, the form change of both neighbor process drawings is so little that the engineering drawings interpretation is no difficulty; in addition, the abnormal solution and multi-solution can be avoided during reconstruction, and the problems how to be applicable to more objects is solved ultimately. Therefore, the utility method for 3D reconstruction model will be possible. On the other hand, the WPM not only includes the information about parts characters, but also can deliver the information of design, process and engineering to the downstream."

The yield estimation demonstrated that the yield enhancement effect of the wide first Al wiring for the BDWL scheme was comparable with or surpassed that of the redundancy for the WS scheme yield, when the first Al wiring pitch over the memory cell array or a BDWL scheme was over 4 times wider than that of the WS scheme. The yield estimation with step height indicated that the first Al wiring yield of the BDWL scheme with the step height exceeded that of the WS scheme with the step height of zero, even if using some global planarization technology."

Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools need to be adapted to these new technologies. There are different CAD software available on the global market. These software programs all have unique features adapted to the needs of companies but they include the same modules: layout, design, simulation and verification. These software programs need to be fed with Process Design Kits (PDK) to allow designers to meet manufacturing constraints and run simulations. PDKs are generally specifically created for a particular technology. In this paper, we show a way to manage and create multiple PDKs for different types of technology and software programs. To that end, we use a database containing technology and software independent information. We apply PDK management to silicon 3D capacitors technologies and related components."

For instance, CMOS smart power device, discrete and Integrated Circuit (IC) products have been mass production in the fabrication foundry. However, these device applications have been processed in the same fabrication line which composed of ion implantation, wet chemical etching, lithography, and others. For instance, ion implantation process could lead to contamination from Arsenic element from implant residue which leads to early electrical breakdown of the device. In order to avoid cross contamination, the mixed fabrication process line of CMOS smart power device and other IC products is taken care and additional containment process is introduced before the high temperature step. The following study demonstrates cross contamination effect analysis on CMOS smart power device and the containment action in order to prevent cross contamination in the semiconductor mass production line."

This paper describes research for associative integration of part and part-manufacturing modeling. The authors applied their well-proved feature-driven and Petri net representation-based machining process modeling. In order to gain associative models, they analyzed the effects of changes of part models on manufacturing process models. This is a major problem in practice, because present-day models are not fully suitable for high-level associativity. The feasibility of manufacturing is communicated actively with part design by constraints from part manufacturing processes and production systems. On the other hand, the method is based on generic manufacturing models that describe variants, so that a new process variant can be created for changed part design by using the same process model. The method assumes a unified solid model with topology-controlled identification of surfaces and a re-orderable form-feature-based part model. Firstly, basic concepts and objectives of the research are introduced. Related issues of part and manufacturing process modeling are outlined and the concept of integrated modeling is emphasized. Following this, relationships between part and part-manufacturing processes are detailed. Next, the handling of the effects of part model changes and the implementation of the proposed modeling are discussed.

pub.1061591557,Si–H Bond Breaking Induced Retention Degradation During Packaging Process of 256 Mbit DRAMs with Negative Wordline Bias,"Data retention degradation of a 256-Mbit DRAM during the packaging process is investigated in this paper. Electrical measurement and device simulation show that a trap-assisted leakage degrades the retention time even in packaging process at about 250$~^{\circ}$ C. Retention time of the degraded chip is strongly dependent on the negative wordline voltage and operation temperature, but less sensitive to the substrate bias. Trap-assisted gate induced drain leakage is proposed as the mechanism of retention loss in the degraded chip. The degraded chips usually can be repaired by another thermal baking process. We propose Si–H bond breaking and the subsequent trap generation at the gate and drain overlap region as the root cause of retention degradation according to the fact that the Si–H bond density of backend passivation oxide and nitride layers correlate well with the retention performance of DRAM chips with negative wordline bias. Moreover, the packaged chip shows variable retention behavior during a thermal baking of 250$~^{\circ}$ C. Theoretical calculation indicates that the trap generation or movement to the high electrical field region beneath the gate can increase the trap-assisted gate induced drain leakage by about an order of magnitude."

pub.1139940595,What Makes Agile Software Development Agile?,"Together with many success stories, promises such as the increase in production speed and the improvement in stakeholders’ collaboration have contributed to making agile a transformation in the software industry in which many companies want to take part. However, driven either by a natural and expected evolution or by contextual factors that challenge the adoption of agile methods as prescribed by their creator(s), software processes in practice mutate into hybrids over time. Are these still agile? In this article, we investigate the question: what makes a software development method agile? We present an empirical study grounded in a large-scale international survey that aims to identify software development methods and practices that improve or tame agility. Based on 556 data points, we analyze the perceived degree of agility in the implementation of standard project disciplines and its relation to used development methods and practices. Our findings suggest that only a small number of participants operate their projects in a purely traditional or agile manner (under 15 percent). That said, most project disciplines and most practices show a clear trend towards increasing degrees of agility. Compared to the methods used to develop software, the selection of practices has a stronger effect on the degree of agility of a given discipline. Finally, there are no methods or practices that explicitly guarantee or prevent agility. We conclude that agility cannot be defined solely at the process level. Additional factors need to be taken into account when trying to implement or improve agility in a software company. Finally, we discuss the field of software process-related research in the light of our findings and present a roadmap for future research."
pub.1061795711,Formalizing a Workflow-Net Implementation of Design-Structure-Matrix-Based Process Planning for New Product Development,"Many new product development (NPD) projects fail. The NPD context, which incorporates knowledge about the product, requirements, technology, and other factors, is dynamically evolving during the process. Simulations of NPD processes using their specific contexts can provide project managers with decisions-making methods to test their planning. The design structure matrix (DSM) can be used to model the product knowledge; then, reordering algorithms are used for process planning. However, interpretation of the DSM-based plan is not unique, and its translation to a process workflow (WF) model may lead to implementation inconsistencies. WF nets, being a subclass of Petri nets, provide formal tools for verifying process properties. Well handled with Regular Iteration (WRI)-WF nets are a subclass of WF nets that are sound by construction and, therefore, enable an automated process-build approach. This paper presents a formal translation of the DSM-based plan to a process-scheme model, the DSM net, which can be executed and simulated. Using several translation stages, it is proved that the resulting DSM net is equivalent to a WRI-WF net. Therefore, the proposed translation is inherently sound and can be automated, becoming an enabler of implementing evolving product knowledge into a sound changing-process model required for NPD simulations. The presented approach bridges an identified gap between the process-planning community (DSM) and the process-implementation community (Petri net)."
pub.1094224440,Semantic Variability Modeling in Business Processes: A Comparative Study,"Business Process Management (BPM) is an approach that aligns information systems (IT view) with business processes (Business view). Both the dynamic environment of business and the fast changes in requirements have created the need to reuse business processes in order to gain in cost and time. To enhance reuse in BPM, significant research efforts have been made on the development of methods and languages in order to support variability modeling. However, there is no single standard for modeling variability in configurable process models. Each modeling language integrating variability proposes its own method for representing variability, and different representations are used to express the same variability concepts. In addition to that, human intervention is still mandatory in order to create, configure and evolve configurable process models. With semantic annotations and the usage of ontology, these tasks could be automated. In this paper, we propose a comparative study to assess variability modeling approaches in software engineering domains, which include software product line engineering, services engineering and process engineering. This comparative study is conducted in terms of semantics use."
pub.1120599664,Smart Wire Bond Solutions for SiP and Memory Packages,"Memory device market has grown 12% annually in the past five years. NAND and DRAM comprise majority of the package volume within this segment and each of them have an average annual growth rate of 7%. Ultra-thin dies stacked 32 times are making their way into mass production and very long overhang die structures are becoming increasingly prevalent in new package designs. Multi-Chip modules and SiP applications have also witnessed tremendous growth in recent years. Even with the emergence of several competing packaging technologies, wire bonding is by far the most widely used and cost-effective interconnect solution for SiP and memory device packaging. The dominance of wire bonding is maintained not only due its exceptional flexibility and low cost, but also due to new generations of smart processes that have reduced optimization time, improved reliability and ensured higher yield, all of which further contribute to the cost effectiveness. Modern NAND and DRAM packages have very stringent specifications and often have challenges in ball bond, looping and stitch bond formation. Extremely low loops lower than 35μm that have not been used in mass production before, are now desired to further reduce package height. For packages utilizing Stand-off Stitch bonding (SSB), height and flatness of SSB bump requires finer control. The overhanging die structures are prone to varying amounts of deflection during wire bonding, which in turn affects the quality of the bond and its intermetallic growth. Such dies have higher risk of die crack under the normal forces applied during wire bonding. These challenges increase wire bond process optimization time and the risk of part failure. This paper highlights key advancements in wire bond processes to overcome the aforementioned challenges in modern packages. New ultrasonic and bond force control mechanisms are introduced, and ball bond process improvements are demonstrated for both Au and Cu fine-pitch applications. Au wire remains predominant in memory applications and fine Cu wire is the preferred choice in high pin count SiP applications. Finite element analysis (FEA) of an overhang configuration is presented, compared against experimental results and used to develop and improve calibration routines for minimizing die crack and maximizing throughput. New looping processes that can better withstand die compliance and achieve ≤35 μm loop heights are also demonstrated. Bump formation is explored, and results integrated into smart response-based solutions for achieving a flat-topped bump with finer height control for 0.6 mil wire. All of the above developments significantly reduce overall optimization time. Furthermore, new on-bonder process monitoring capabilities are discussed and shown to improve quality controls, paving the way for industry 4.0 in wire bond process capabilities."

Amongst others, a process-centric guidance of users (e.g. service operators) is required, taking the high variability in the assembly of cyber-physical systems (e.g. press line variability) into account.

Accurate numerical extraction of 3D interconnect capacitance is essential for achieving design targets in the multi-GHz digital regime. An AlGaAs-GaAs heterojunction-bipolar-transistor test chip was fabricated. The chip used 3-level metal with anisotropic polyimide interlevel dielectrics. Full differential current-mode logic circuit technology was employed. The chip contained a variety of interconnect capacitor structures (parallel plate, finger, crossover) and interconnect-limited ring-oscillator circuits. Capacitance and oscillator frequency measurements were performed to compare with CAD-tool predictions. Good agreement with measurements was achieved with an independently obtained 25% uniaxial polyimide dielectric anisotropy. Measured and predicted results for the capacitor test structures generally agreed to within 2%. Predicted ring-oscillator periods were within 4% of measurement."

In CHILL96, moreta modes of object-orientation are added for reusability and modularity of telecommunications software. We propose a translation scheme from CHILL96 to CHILL based on the two design concepts: (1) for high compatibility with CHILL software for partial object orientation of existing software, and for high reusability of the existing CHILL codes in object orientation; and (2) for an easy and rapid implementation to CHILL96 compilation system by use of the verified tools such as a code generator and a code optimizer executable with CHILL. With respect to the considerations of distributed concurrent real-time the translation scheme consists of rules for moreta modes definition, visibility control, inheritance, renaming, dynamic binding and the other features of CHILL. Moreover, we extend some features of CHILL96 for distributed real-time processing. The experimental results show that, in the object orientation of the existing CHILL programs, the reuse rate of existing CHILL program and productivity is very high and the run-time performance is decreased by 8%-10% compared with its corresponding CHILL program.

Neural network model was established and used to characterize the nonlinearity of the process. To improve the robustness and accuracy of the neural networks, the MNN was obtained by stacking multiple neural networks which were developed based on the reorganization of the original data.

pub.1157307281,TC Reliability Enhancement Technology for SSD with Low Temperature Solder Paste Material,"The present study relates to the acquisition of optimal design and reliability enhancement technology using new solder paste material in the development process of new products in order to enter the SSD market with rapid customer response. As SAC paste material is reduced to about 70°C, the customer is able to reduce power and cost, CO2 emissions (35%), and PCB/Substrate warpage 50%. Based on these advantages, customer wants to lead a new industry change and are hoping for the generalization of the application of LTS solder paste material. In general, package causes process failure due to warpage at high and low temperature [1]. Warpage can be reduced by more than 50% from reflow peak temperature of LTS material. However, material bonding technology of SAC ball and LTS material SnBi paste of package is required. It is possible to improve the warpage of SSD set and array by lowering 70°C, but there is a disadvantage that the TAT of the reflow process increases. The SMT reflow profile is mainly managed by dividing it into ramp-up, soak range, and peak temp. In addition, it is necessary to build an additional assembly process line for customer’s LTS paste material application. Various DOE evaluations of peak temp. and duration were performed with the goal of reflow profile optimization. Under the TC 0-125°C conditions of DRAM module products, the reliability was weak due to hot tearing effect in close proximity to melting temp. 138°C of Bi paste. First, BMR 42.1% was confirmed under 180°C and 50sec conditions, and 900cycle defect occurred. Second, to improve this, the duration of the peak temperature section was increased from 50 to 120sec. BMR was confirmed to be 53.8% at 180°C and 120sec, and 1, 200cycle passed. Under the TC -40-85°C conditions of SSD M.2 products, the existing SAC paste failed at 2, 000cycle, but the LTS paste of S/PB material passed at 3, 024cycle and it has been improved by about 50% compared to mass production solder paste."

pub.1061763563,Processing of Sugar Beets With Pulsed-Electric Fields,"The treatment of biological cells with strong pulsed-electric fields can lead to irreversible formation of large pores in the cell membrane and thus destroy the cell and give access to its content. This well-known process of electroporation has been successfully applied to the inactivation of bacteria in many laboratories. However, few efforts have been made to utilize the technique on a large industrial scale for the production of nourishment from food plants. We have built the mobile test device Karlsruher Elektroporations Anlage (KEA), which consists of a 300-kV Marx generator operating at 10 Hz and delivering its pulses to a cylindrical reaction chamber with axially and azimuthally distributed electrodes. The reaction chamber has a large cross section, sufficient for the treatment of entire sugar beets in a continuous stream. KEA has been used in an experimental campaign to demonstrate the advantages of electric pulse treatment for the production of sugar from beets compared with conventional techniques. Although the process has not yet been optimized, it was found that appreciable energy savings are possible since the treated beets could be extracted at much lower temperatures with the same result. To demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility on a large scale, we plan to build a pilot plant with a throughput of several tens of tons per hour and to use it in the next seasonal campaign. Although the results are convincing, important details of the effect are not yet understood. In particular, the interaction between the cell membrane and the cell wall in the plant organism under the action of the electric field needs further investigation. Therefore, we also plan to establish a basic research program."

pub.1101909618,Dependence-Based Data-Aware Process Conformance Checking,"Data-aware executable processes are an effective and efficient means to build service-oriented applications. However, since the services involved are loosely-coupled and self-managed, the process is flexible by nature and it executions may deviate from their specifications. In contrast to existing approaches that focus on control flow deviations, we leverage activity dependences for data-aware process conformance checking. To analyze the conformance of a process instance to its process definition, we seek a process reference trace “best-fitting” the instance trace such that the conformance degree of the input trace to the process equals the consistency degree of both traces. We measure the consistency between two traces based on their activity dependences. Since finding the reference trace is NP-hard, we resort to heuristics based on process decomposition and trace replaying to determine the trace. Our approach can identify conformance decrease caused by activity dependence deviations, thus, complementing existing approaches. We implement our approach as a ProM plugin. Experimental results on 102 real-world WS-BPEL processes and 26,880 synthetic input traces confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."

pub.1163655693,Towards Conflict Resolution Methods in Process-Oriented Programs,"In the modern world manufactures and industrial processes are controlled by microcomputers. Those microcomputers, for example in form of programmable logic controllers, execute programs with a huge amount of parallel processes which are connected through numerous shared real world objects. There are several paradigms which solve problems of specifying and implementing control algorithms, e. g. execution problems connected to non-deterministic behaviour. One such paradigm is process-oriented programming which was proposed at IA&E SB RAS. The paradigm was used in large-scale projects and proves its effectiveness for the domain. The problem is that the current requirements for the manufactures include a high fault tolerance, and the ideas from Industry 4.0 require an even higher tolerance for implementation which includes minimization of the damages during malfunctioning. The paper describes the problem of conflicts in process-oriented programs and discusses an approach to increase the execution reliability of process-oriented programs. This work shows that solving non-deterministic behaviour is not enough and the ordering of the processes is also important to avoid conflicts between different processes and achieve the requirements. Provided classification should help further works t o develop automated tools for conflict detection and possible automated conflict solving."

Bandpass modulators sampling at high IFs ($\sim$ 200 MHz) allow direct sampling of the RF signal-reducing analog hardware and make it easier to realize completely software programmable receivers. This paper presents circuit design of and test results from continuous-time fourth-order BP $\Delta\Sigma$ modulators fabricated in AIInAs/GaInAs heterojunction bipolar technology with a peak unity current gain cutoff frequency $(f_{T})$ of 80 GHz and a maximum frequency of oscillation $(f_{\mathrm{MAX}})$ of about 130 GHz.

pub.1061792107,Large-Scale Semiconductor Process Fault Detection Using a Fast Pattern Recognition-Based Method,"Fault detection and classification (FDC) has been recognized as an integral component of the advanced process control (APC) framework in the semiconductor industry, as it helps to improve overall equipment efficiency (OEE). However, some unique characteristics of semiconductor manufacturing processes have posed challenges for FDC applications, such as nonlinearity in most batch processes, and multimodal batch trajectories due to product mix. To explicitly account for these unique characteristics, a pattern recognition based fault detection method utilizing the k-nearest-neighbor rule (FD-kNN) was previously developed. In FD-kNN, historical data are used directly as the reference of normal process operation to determine whether a new measurement is a fault. Therefore, for processes with a large number of variables, it can be computation and storage intensive, and may be difficult for online process monitoring. To address this difficulty, we propose a fast pattern recognition based fault detection method, termed principal component-based kNN (PC-kNN), which takes advantages of both principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and FD-kNN for nonlinearity and multimode handling. Two simulation examples and an industrial example are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed PC-kNN method in fault detection."

pub.1093816238,Yield Optimization for Third Party Library Elements,"Optimization of semiconductor product yield requires control of systematic defects. A variety of industry tools are available to check designs for systematic layouts that will be difficult to manufacture. Because of the cost associated with setting up the rules for a checking tool and the cost of licenses needed to evaluate designs, manufacturing process lines typically enable a limited set of tools to evaluate designs for systematic yield sensitivity. Semiconductor product design systems typically incorporate library elements designed by third party design companies. When third party library suppliers do not have access to the licenses or expertise to use the tools selected by the target manufacturing line, a barrier is created to having all library elements in a semiconductor design system checked to the same level. This results in a yield exposure for library elements that are not evaluated and fixed. This paper describes a method used to enable systematic yield evaluation for 32nm library elements procured from third party library suppliers. The third party library supplier provides layout data to the contracting library owner for yield sensitivity analysis. Changes are prioritized and fed back to the third party library supplier. This method interlocks design practices with the third party library supplier and provides a means for the contracting library owner to evaluate third party library elements and provide feedback to optimize the design."

Given the large number of defects reported by BFI, especially during R&D stage where the defectivity is often high, users need a way to effectively down sample the defects to be sent for SEM review. In this paper, we demonstrate various BFI to SEM down sampling techniques including, pattern-based clustering, and machine learning (ML) based down sampling that effectively find trends and make prediction to identify systematic weak patterns with increased SEM defect hit rate and systematic defect discovery."
pub.1094422683,A Language Design and Implementation for Geospatial Information Services Chaining,"The Geospatial Information that service from public organizations and authorities are significantly increasing e.g., JPL OnEarth, GeoBrain, Google, and so on. Those geospatial information services rely on various existing Web technologies such as Web Service, OGC Web Services, REST, and GeoRSS. There are several formats of geospatial data which are published via the standard protocol HTTP such as GML, KML, Shapefile, and GeoTiff. Currently, a number of researches in geosciences community focus on geospatial services integration. The geospatial services integration is jointly defined and introduced by OGC and ISO TC 2111. The services integration is defined in term of service chaining: Transparent chaining, Translucent chaining, and Opaque chaining. This paper reports a research which focuses on Translucent chaining in which public user is allowed to predefine a service chain and execute it via Workflow enactment service. A process definition language is applied to coordinate across XML-based interfaces and support services chaining among Web Service, OGC Web Service, and REST. WPS-T (Transactional Web Processing Service as Workflow enactment service) is implemented and used to introduce a scalable framework. Complex geospatial operation can be managed by sequencing a number of simple operations from service itself or other services into a single operation. A geospatial service chain can then be executed as a single service operation, and it also can be invoked by other service chain. The implemented system is demonstrated to facilitate services chaining which is independent from any services interface."

pub.1061205815,Application of statistical analysis to determine the priority for improving LSI technology,"LSI failures are classified into three categories: nonoperation failure, out-of-specification failure, and out-of-reliability failure. The first two are emphasized. The binomial-distribution model is applied for nonoperation failure, and the analysis-of-variance using the F-distribution is applied for the out-of-specification analysis where the distribution of each characteristic parameter is assumed to be the Gaussian distribution. The analysis is performed experimentally using a test chip. An independent evaluation of an elemental structure, which is defined as a critical structure, is the most important principle in test chip design. A new two-level database system is adopted for the statistical analysis based upon the analysis-of-variance. Methods to determine the priority for improving LSI technology are presented for both nonoperation and out-of-specification failures. This procedure effectively assists in improving LSI yield.<>"

pub.1061795166,Process-Data-Warehousing-Based Operator Support System for Complex Production Technologies,"Process manufacturing is increasingly being driven by market forces, customer needs, and perceptions, resulting in more and more complex multiproduct manufacturing technologies. The increasing automation and tighter quality constraints related to these processes make the operator's job more and more difficult. This makes decision support systems (DSSs) for the operator more important than ever before. A traditional operator support system (OSS) focuses only on specific tasks that are performed. In the case of complex processes, the design of an integrated information system is extremely important. The proposed data-warehouse-based OSS makes possible linking complex and isolated production units based on the integration of the heterogenous information collected from the production units of a complex production process. The developed OSS is based on a data warehouse designed by following the proposed focus-on-process data-warehouse-design approach, which means stronger focus on the material and information flow through the entire enterprise. The resulting OSS follows the process through the organization instead of focusing separate tasks of the isolated process units. For human–computer interaction, front-end tools have been worked out, where exploratory data analysis and advanced multivariate statistical models are applied to extract the most informative features of the operation of the technology. The concept is illustrated by an industrial case study, where the OSS is designed for the monitoring and control of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plant."

The human-body-model (HBM) and machine-model (MM) ESD levels of these devices are also investigated and compared. A significant improvement in ESD robustness is observed when an nMOS device is fabricated with both boron and arsenic ESD implantations. The ESD robustness of the N-type diode under the reverse-biased stress condition can also be improved by the boron ESD implantation. The layout consideration in multifinger MOSFETs and diodes for better ESD robustness is also investigated."

pub.1093531087,Optimum test structure design for CMOS parasitic transistor characterisation,"As CMOS active transistor channel lengths continue to shrink with each technology generation, there is typically a reduction in key layout pitches, to increase packing density and thereby reduce costs. Maintaining adequate lateral device isolation is central to this scaling strategy. One of the problems associated with scaling the active area (AA) pitch is the increased likelihood of parasitic field transistor leakage, either due to low field threshold voltages or field punch through. The key rule is the AA space, as this is one of the major factors in determining the lateral isolation. For 0.5 /spl mu/m geometries, a typical AA space is 0.9 /spl mu/m, reducing to 0.7 or 0.6 /spl mu/m for 0.35 /spl mu/m design rules. It is thus essential to be able to fully characterise and understand parasitic leakage currents in such structures to ensure they are kept to a minimum. This paper seeks to define an optimum set of test structures that can be used to measure the different parasitic leakage components. The authors outline the formation of the parasitic field device and the main leakage mechanisms. They show how the level of leakage depends on the structure, particularly for gated devices. The optimum structure, which gives worst case leakage, is defined. The authors describe how the different currents measured during test can be used to determine the type of leakage, and hence lend themselves to an automated test."
pub.1094741315,Novel Diode Structures and ESD Protection Circuits in a 1.8-V 0.15-μm Partially-Depleted SOI Salicided CMOS Process,"Due to the low thermal conductivity of the buried oxide underneath the thin-film silicon layer and the shallow-trench-isolation (STI) structure on the insulating layer, electrostatic discharge (ESD) robustness of CMOS devices in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS technology has become a major reliability challenge (Chan et al., 1994; Raha et al., 1999; Smith, 1998). As SOI technology continues to be scaled down, the thickness of the top layer silicon film is decreased, and the junction area for ESD protection devices to discharge ESD current becomes smaller. Therefore, the ability to dissipate the heat generated by ESD events in SOI CMOS ICs is seriously degraded. In this paper, two novel diode structures with effective larger p-n junction area for better heat dissipation in partially-depleted SOI CMOS technology are proposed. The I-V characteristics and ESD robustness of these new diodes are investigated and compared to that of the Lubistor diode (Voldman et al., 1996)."

pub.1061515227,Decentralized Fault Diagnosis of Continuous Annealing Processes Based on Multilevel PCA,"Process monitoring and fault diagnosis of the continuous annealing process lines (CAPLs) have been a primary concern in industry. Stable operation of the line is essential to final product quality and continuous processing of the upstream and downstream materials. In this paper, a multilevel principal component analysis (MLPCA)-based fault diagnosis method is proposed to provide meaningful monitoring of the underlying process and help diagnose faults. First, multiblock consensus principal component analysis (CPCA) is extended to MLPCA to model the large scale continuous annealing process. Secondly, a decentralized fault diagnosis approach is designed based on the proposed MLPCA algorithm. Finally, experiment results on an industrial CAPL are obtained to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—The focus of the work in this paper is an application of a new process monitoring and fault diagnosis method to an industrial cold rolling continuous annealing process line (CAPL). First, to make use of the knowledge on the division and sequence of process variables, in particular the knowledge on sampling locations, a multilevel principal component analysis (MLPCA) is proposed for decentralized fault diagnosis. Secondly, the proposed diagnosis scheme is applied to the CAPL, while process knowledge on the transportation of the feed material is considered to help interpret the fault due to defective raw materials. The multilevel diagnosis approach is recommended for industrial process monitoring and fault diagnosis of large scale sequential manufacturing processes. Particularly, the developed diagnosis scheme in a multilevel manner is recommended for complex processing units that can be decomposed into separate sections and subblocks in sequence. The multilevel scheme is extended to a general fault diagnosis framework with more than three levels should the process characteristics demand it."
pub.1095413400,Texaco Coal Gasification Quality Prediction by Neural Estimator Based on Dynamic PCA,"Prediction of syngas compositions, the most important parameter in determining the product's grade and quality control of raw syngas produced in coal gasification process, was studied. A neural estimator model based on improved dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA) and multiple neural networks (MNN) was proposed to infer the syngas compositions from real process variables. DPCA was carried out to select the most relevant process features and to eliminate the correlations of the input variables. To reduce the large computing work of DPCA, the arithmetic of DPCA was predigested by constructing a compressed augmented data matrix on the basis of the autocorrelation analysis for input variables. Neural network model was established and used to characterize the nonlinearity of the process. To improve the robustness and accuracy of the neural networks, the MNN was obtained by stacking multiple neural networks which were developed based on the reorganization of the original data. The implementation of the model was presented and the model was applied to Texaco coal gasification system to predict the syngas compositions. Research results show that the proposed method provides promising prediction reliability and accuracy."
pub.1164003122,Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks with Embedded Variable Selection Module for Data Sequence Modeling in Dynamic Industrial Processes,"Industrial processes usually exhibit nonlinearity and dynamic characteristics, whereby the data are subject to temporal variability due to continuous sampling. Thus, the prediction of quality variables in industrial processes relies on the utilization of dynamic models, such as quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN). However, traditional QRNN cannot accurately extract the important feature containing predictive content from input variables during the modeling process. To complement this shortcoming, a novel data modeling method named quasi-recurrent neural network with embedded variable selection module (EVSM-QRNN) is proposed in this paper. First, a variable selection module (VSM) is embedded in a standard QRNN network, which replaces the common activation function to generate the alternative state of the cell. Then, the updated cell state incorporates additional valuable information of input variables, thereby attaining an equivalent effect as the conventional cell state update process. The proposed method effectively uses the features containing predictive information from input variables, thereby enabling accurate prediction of quality variables. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation experiments on datasets collected from an actual industrial process."

Medical datasets like cervical cancer data likely to have high dimensional, redundant and irrelevant attributes with mislaid values and some of them incline to have imbalanced target classes. Efficient feature selection techniques could resolve these issues and advance the performance of the classification models with advanced precision in classification by accomplishing computational efficiencies. The execution of effectual feature selection methods on cervical cancer datasets could support to attain a reduced and enhanced feature subset. Besides, the competences of filter and wrapper approaches can be integrated to acquire a finest and effectual feature subset for classification progression.

Hence this research purposes to handle these issues through integrated feature selection approach to attain an optimal feature subset. The subsets attained through this fused approach can be employed in augmented prediction process. The best and an optimal feature subset can be decided based on the performance efficiency of the classifiers in predicting the results. This fused approach is essential in bio medical and bio informatics datasets like cervical cancer datasets where data classification with progressive accuracy is more challenging.

pub.1094795708,Entity-Centric Operations Modeling for Business Process Management,"The entity-based approach for operations modeling was published for the first time three decades ago. Specifically, the notion of entities as the main subjects of processes and entity life-cycle as a technique for dynamic modeling of operations were introduced independently by K. Robinson in 1979, C. Rosenquist in 1982 and M. Jackson in 1983. This modeling work emerged in clear contrast with static entity-relationship modeling found in the data-base tradition. These three pioneer contributions and other substantial research done at the realm of information engineering, structured systems analysis and social sciences in the 80's and 90's have established an important foundation for business process modeling. On the other hand, Business Process Management (BPM) has continued to receive great attention from practitioners and scholars. In spite of its steady growth, the industry side of BPM seems to have evolved somewhat unaware of related progress in the above sister disciplines. Specifically, recent claims on the need to integrate information and activities in process modeling and some rediscoveries of core ideas from entity-based dynamic modeling offer some examples of the disconnection. These and other findings suggest that the BPM field may not have yet fully benefited from the work done in the tradition of structured analysis, information engineering and process theory schools. Furthermore, the possibility of using entity life-cycle for modeling operations addressed by Case Management is an important byproduct. Entity-based life cycle offers a conceptual framework to integrate different types of enterprise operations whose modeling has not yet been reconciled in the BPM tradition. This paper presents a multidisciplinary review of the state-of-the-art on entity life cycle. The focus of this review is exclusively on modeling concepts and methodology. This review will help pave more holistic approaches to BPM by benefiting from the work done in different disciplines that focus on organizational design and systems modeling."

pub.1061480867,Fully Integrated AC Coupled Interconnect Using Buried Bumps,"Presented is the complete demonstration of an assembled system using AC coupled interconnect (ACCI) and buried solder bumps. In this system, noncontacting input/output (I/O) are created by using half-capacitor plates on both a chip and a substrate, while buried solder bumps are used to provide power/ground distribution and physical alignment of the coupling plates. ACCI using buried bumps is a technology that provides a manufacturable solution for noncontacting I/O signaling by integrating high-density, low inductance power/ground distribution with high-density, high-speed I/O. The demonstration system shows two channels operating simultaneously at 2.5Gb/s/channel with a bit error rate less than 10−12, across 5.6 cm of transmission line on a multichip module (MCM). Simple transceiver circuits were designed and fabricated in a 0.35-$\mu$ m complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and for PRBS-127 data at 2.5 Gb/s transmit and receive circuits consumed 10.3 mW and 15.0 mW, respectively. This work illustrates the increasing importance of chip and package co-design for high-performance systems."
pub.1173248788,Packaging Challenges and Solutions for Next Generation Low-Profile WLCSP,"Owing to its small footprint, fine pitch capability, low profile, known process flow, and low cost, Wafer Level Chip Scale Package (WLCSP) has been a very fundamental package option for a host of applications such as consumer mobile, portable and wearable products, Internet of Things (IoT) for Power Management, Bluetooth/WiFi, Audio, NFC. Etc. As the driving force of thinner electronic needs and its applications, hence, it is worth exploring the low-profile WLCSP from a package structure, manufacturability, reliability and performance standpoint. In this study, successfully developed a low-profile 4-Layer WLCSP package with the die thickness below 200um for maximum total package height of 250um and 200um. Based on the references of current mass production capability for 300um package stack-up, two test vehicles were designed for maximum package thicknesses of 250um and 200um with die thicknesses down to 105um and 90um respectively using 300mm wafer size. Both test vehicles follow standard 4-Layer WLCSP structure with two dielectric layers as passivation, one Redistribution Layer (RDL), and one Under Bump Metallization (UBM) layer. The main achievement of this work is mitigating the risks associated with low-profile WLCSP as they relate to reliability performance. Board Level Reliability Thermal Cycling Test (BLR-TCT) reliability simulations were carried out to assess the influence of various parameters including die thickness, bump height standoff as well as effects of different UBM sizes. Design of Experiment (DoE) and process engineering characterizations were also carried out to assess and mitigate key assembly challenges such as warpage handling, grinding and de-taping, laser marking recipe studies, dicing parameters, and ball placement evaluations. Both test vehicles successfully passed Package Level Reliability (PLR) and Board Level Reliability (BLR) performance dictated by future product requirements and target mission profiles."

pub.1061290138,Magnetic Composite Electroplating for Depositing Micromagnets,"This paper reports a novel magnetic composite materials deposition technique called magnetic composite electroplating (MCE). Thin films and micromagnets arrays of a composite matrix consisting of magnetic particles and a ferromagnetic alloy have been fabricated based on this technique. In a typical MCE process, magnetic particles are electrochemically and mechanically embedded into electroplated ferromagnetic thin films to form a magnetic particle-alloy composite. The magnetic particle selected is a barium ferrite magnet $({\rm BaFe}_{12} {\rm O}_{19})$ and the ferromagnetic matrix is a pulse-reverse electroplated CoNiP alloy. The particle embedded fraction (w.t. %) directly affects magnetic properties and is experimentally determined by its energy dispersive spectrum (EDS). Various factors including electrolyte particle concentration, applied current, electrolyte pH, and the presence of cationic surfactants affecting the particle embedded fraction are experimentally investigated. Arrays of ${\rm BaFe}_{12} {\rm O}_{19}$-CoNiP magnets with a variety of dimensions and features as small as 8$\mu{\rm m}$ have been realized by MCE. Experimental analysis shows that the composite exhibits magnetic properties, such as a high coercivity $(H _{c})$ of up to 1.75$\, \times {10}^{5}~{\rm A/m}$, particularly well suited for MEMS actuators.$\hfill{{\hbox{[1196]}}}$"
pub.1061817016,"Fast Transistor Threshold Voltage Measurement Method for High-Speed, High-Accuracy Advanced Process Characterization","As process technologies continually advance, process variation has greatly increased and has gradually become one of the most critical factors for IC manufacturing. Furthermore, these increasingly complex processes continue to make greater use of stressors for mobility enhancement, thus requiring large volumes of data for extensive characterization of layout-dependent effects (LDE) for validation of both SPICE models and design for manufacturing. Transistor threshold voltage $(V_{t})$ is a commonly used parameter both for characterization during process development and for monitoring of volume manufacturing. To adequately quantify local process variation or LDE, $V_{t}$ must be measured for a sufficiently large number of device-under-tests (DUTs) to obtain a statistically representative sample population. The number of $V_{t}$ measurements required to obtain such a statistically significant result, however, requires extremely long testing time, especially for array-based test structure designs including thousands of DUTs. In this paper, we present a very fast threshold voltage measurement methodology using an operational amplifier-based source-measure unit test configuration, which greatly improves testing efficiency and accuracy, and is not sensitive to process variation. The proposed test methodology can improve $V_{t}$ testing time by a factor of 5–10 relative to the commonly used binary-search algorithm, and by a factor of ${\sim}{2}$ relative to an optimized interpolation algorithm, and achieves better accuracy (standard deviation of $V_{t}=0.15~{\rm mV}$ , versus typical accuracy of ${\sim}{\rm 0.5}~{\rm mV}$ for the two algorithms mentioned). Furthermore, the layout and configuration of conventional test structures need not be modified to adapt the proposed methodology. The measured results from the most advanced process technology nodes demonstrate the testing efficiency and accuracy of the proposed test structure in characterizing the large number of DUTs required for quantifying process variation or LDEs."

pub.1093984385,EdiFlow: data-intensive interactive workflows for visual analytics,"Visual analytics aims at combining interactive data visualization with data analysis tasks. Given the explosion in volume and complexity of scientific data, e.g., associated to biological or physical processes or social networks, visual analytics is called to play an important role in scientific data management. Most visual analytics platforms, however, are memory-based, and are therefore limited in the volume of data handled. Moreover, the integration of each new algorithm (e.g, for clustering) requires integrating it by hand into the platform. Finally, they lack the capability to define and deploy well-structured processes where users with different roles interact in a coordinated way sharing the same data and possibly the same visualizations. We have designed and implemented EdiFlow, a workflow platform for visual analytics applications. EdiFlow uses a simple structured process model, and is backed by a persistent database, storing both process information and process instance data. EdiFlow processes provide the usual process features (roles, structured control) and may integrate visual analytics tasks as activities. We present its architecture, deployment on a sample application, and main technical challenges involved."
pub.1093894195,Mini Story Composition for Generic Workflows in Support of Disaster Management,"The success and effectiveness of disaster management increasingly depend on the ability of a disaster response team to quickly and flexibly react to changes in unanticipated exceptional situations. Workflow management systems can be used to support the process organization of a disaster scenario. However, most workflow management systems are only applicable for domains with well structured and static processes. So, the highly dynamic characteristics of disaster management cannot be handled by current workflow management systems. In this paper, we present our approach of generic workflows that is based on the concept of generic functions and can be combined with the word field theory. We introduce the term mini story as a semantically logical unit for the construction of complex workflows. The elaborated concepts represent an essential part of a framework, which will be developed in the context of INDYCO project (“Integrated Dynamic Decision Support System Component for Disaster Management Systems”)."

We exploit techniques from Software Product Line (SPL) domain, particularly feature modeling techniques, to design our framework. Feature modeling allows to abstract variability in consumers' requirements to simplify customization processes, while automated analysis on feature models helps to validate customizations. The use of feature models at runtime enables dynamic deployment of a business process as a result of a service customisation. We propose the use of feature models as service description artifacts to facilitate service customizations. The framework builds on a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach to automate large parts of its operation."

pub.1095434229,No-Flow Underfill Process Optimization for High Yield and Reliability in Flip Chip Assembly,"No-Flow underfill process has been widely accepted as a key technology to implement low-cost, high-throughput flip chip on board (FCOB) assembly because of the elimination of processing steps such as flux application, flux residue cleaning, capillary underfill flow and secondary thermal curing of the underfill. While feasibility tests for the low-cost, high-throughput flip chip assembly based on no-flow underfill over a wide range of flip chip configurations are underway, unfamiliar process defects that have not been observed in the conventional capillary flow process are newly found. Of those new process defects, “chip floating” over the board surface after chip placement process is a critical issue that may significantly impact process yield when process variables are not properly controlled. It was found that much of the yield losses observed post reflow is attributed to the “chip floating”. In order to understand the underlying physics of the floating phenomena and predict process variables to eliminate the process defects, a process model has been developed. The model can be used to optimize the no-flow underfill process. In addition, the effect of the underfill volume on the reliability is discussed associated with the underfill fillet shape."
pub.1094206444,SwampFinder,"Since the semiconductor industry has aggressively shortened product development cycles, characterizing and solving design-process sensitivities has seen a drastic reduction in the “window of opportunity”. Thus, many semiconductor fabricators must build products that include these sensitivities. Often, a design revision is no longer a business option, given “time to market” requirements; therefore, the manufacturer must engineer a serviceable alternative. Knowledge of these potential problems prior to releasing wafers allows manufacturing engineering to make process adjustments encompassing these specific parts. Many of these problems may be isolated to specific geometries or shape configurations within the design data, and, therefore, sophisticated shape checks may be deployed. The IBM Microelectronics Vermont facility has developed a system for identification of these locations (i.e., “find the muck in the design”) using a tool called “SwampFinder”. This paper will discuss both the supporting methodology and software behind this approach and includes several examples illustrating the types of sensitivities that may be identified. This paper will also describe a feed-forward strategy targeted at both the reduction of incoming incompatible design content and the engineering of tolerant processes. Lastly, a larger picture of physical design characterization in manufacturing will be introduced."

A product information model is the information source of plenty of design activities (conceptual design, structure design, detail design and process planning). Product information can be shared by CAD and CAPP, and concurrent design of product can be implemented based on the product information, so the function and information integration of product design can be realized. The product and its design process can then be optimized."

pub.1095784897,Temporary Bonding for High-topography Applications: Spin-on Material Versus Dry Film,"Handling wafers with sub-100 µm thicknesses requires a support or carrier wafer during handling, transport and processing in a semiconductor process line. This thin wafer support system should be very stable during these operations but should also allow for easy wafer debonding. Therefore, room temperature debonding methods are the favored solutions, in particular, room temperature peel debonding, which is one the industry focuses on today. We have estimated that a TTV of less than $2\mu {\rm m}$ is required to enable a ‘soft’ backside via reveal process for temporary bonding material thicknesses less than $20\mu{\rm m}$. For high frontside topography applications involving Cu pillars or C4 types of bumps, the challenge is to maintain a low post-grinding TTV value while processing the device wafer with thick temporary bonding materials (typically thicker than $50\mu {\rm m}$). Reducing the post-thinning TTV can be done either by reducing the edge bead effect of the spin-on temporary bonding material, or by looking into novel types of material applications such as thick film lamination. In this paper, we compare the thinning performance in terms of post-grinding TTV of two materials from Brewer Science: the thick spin-on ZoneBOND®5150 material and the experimental BrewerBOND™ dry film."

Half rate operation doubles the allowable propagation delay. Dual outputs alternate in time and combine linearly, allowing overlap without error, resulting in greater linear range.

pub.1061636450,Guest Editorial First Special Section of the IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement in the Area of VLSI Testing—Future of Semiconductor Test,"As the Electronics industry continues to grow, technology feature sizes continue to decrease and complex systems and levels of integration continue to increase, the need for better and more efficient methods of testing to ensure reliable operations of chips, the mainstay of today's digital systems, is being increasingly felt. This tremendous complexity comes primarily from a reduction in the ratio of externally accessible nodes (primary inputs and primary outputs) to inaccessible internal nodes in the resulting circuit design. With changes in technology, the number of input–output (I/O) pins has increased, but not at the same rate as that of the circuit size, with the net result that the pin-to-gate ratio is continually decreasing. In general, the cost of testing integrated circuits (ICs) is prohibitive, ranging from 35%–55% of their total manufacturing cost. Besides, testing a chip is also time-consuming, taking up to about one-half of the total design cycle time. The amount of time available for manufacturing, testing, and marketing a product, on the other hand, continues to decrease. Moreover, as a result of global competition, customers demand lower cost and better quality products. Therefore, in order to achieve this higher quality at a lower cost, testing techniques need to be improved. In recent times, a number of major innovations have occurred in the architecture and design of automatic test equipment (ATE) or IC testers. Some of the examples include fly-by architecture (to overcome round trip delay in gigahertz testing), development of built-in self-testing (BIST), and design-for-testability (DFT) testers (for ICs with BIST and DFT), virtual testers (to validate a test program before tapeout), event testers (to link design and simulation technologies), remote operations of testers, and the most current developments in open tester architectures. The test and measurement community is increasingly adopting design solutions for test resource partitioning and scheduling, with methods to take simulation test benches directly to ATE."

pub.1094290244,Extraction of optimal control patterns in industrial batch processes based on Support Vector Machines,"In general industrial processes are complex systems that have to be optimized due to several performance criteria. As control optimization based on the development of physical models is in many cases very time consuming and cost intensive or not even feasible an alternative consists in analyzing historical process data, as lots of it is usually available. Hereby an approach is to use computational intelligent methods as these can identify characteristic control patterns and classify them according to their contribution for process optimization. As data coming from these processes is in general only available as time series a crucial question is how to generate and find these significant features from the measured data concerning a prior defined performance index. Traditional ways of finding these features need plenty of knowledge about the underlying process. In this paper we propose an automated feature extraction and ranking methodology based on Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR). Furthermore the methodology is used to derive a model of the performance index in terms of the relevant features within the algorithm. The found model can finally be used to find a suitable control pattern of the complex system. The proposed concept is applied to a real world industrial batch process."

However, the void defects in a molded underfill process could cause pop-corning effect and solder extrusion during the reflow process. This paper presents a highly efficient and accurate hybrid model that can be applied to diagnose the void risk in vacuum molded underfill processes of real flip-chip, package-on-package devices with complex ball arrays and large PCB strips. The model combines multi-zone porous media model, Hele-Shaw model and compressible two-phase computational fluid dynamics model. The model has been well validated in terms of the entrapped void size and its behavior with flow visualization experiments. Also, a set of parametric studies on a FC-POP molded underfill flow process were performed to pre-assess the future node’s molded underfill process. Not only the model provides a better understanding of the physics of void entrapment but also it is proven to be an effective tool for assessing the potential void risk through its application to 10nm flip-chip, package-on-package device manufactured in mass production line."
pub.1061098421,Managing multiple engineering projects in a manufacturing support environment,"Business trends require front-line managers to integrate multiproject concepts with those of traditional single-project management since very rarely can one find major organizations managing just one project. A typical situation entails a limited pool of resources which is applied to the management of several projects, with people moving back and forth among different assignments in different projects. Yet, few studies on project management have started to explore the issue of how to manage an organization with multiple inter- or intradepartmental projects. Using a case study method, our exploratory research investigates the specific problems associated with the management of multiple engineering projects in a manufacturing support environment, with the intent to identify common factors of success. Knowing the factors of success is but the first step toward improving multi-project management. Our findings provide insight into how the most important multiple-project success factors in this environment differ from factors of success in traditional single-project management, and are consistent with other emerging research in product development environments. The differences center on resource allocation and flexibility. Some factors, such as ownership, staff experience, and communication, take on additional dimensions when considered in a multiple-versus a single-project environment. Division and assignment of resources, prioritization, and customized management style, which have little relevance in relation to single projects, are shown to play a major role in the success of multiproject management."

pub.1181374355,"Fine Pitch Aluminum Hybrid Bonding: Overcoming the Challenges in Plating, Passivation and Bonding","Aluminium to Aluminium (Al-Al) direct bonding is CMOS line compatible and is comparable to gold (Au) and copper (Cu) due to metal cross-contamination in a process line. The Au-Au and Cu-Cu direct bonding are widely used and oxides of these metals are either negligible or can be controlled. Aluminium low temperature direct bonding would enable integrations of various types of sensors onto a CMOS wafer. On the contrary, Al tends to form an oxide layer as soon as it comes in contact to ambient atmosphere, which is difficult to remove and passivate thus requiring higher bonding temperature and bonding forces. In this paper, we would like to present the technology enabler processes that could lead to successful aluminium hybrid bonding: aluminum electro-plating for via filling, aluminum oxide removal and surface passivation and aluminium direct bonding at low temperatures. Low-temperature bonding is demonstrated using, in-situ surface treatment leading to metallic bonds at a temperature < 300 °C in ambient conditions."

pub.1095722798,AUTOMATED PROCESS METROLOGY IN SOLAR CELL MANUFACTURING,"Optimizing a solar cell manufacturing line must take into account a variety of issues. Wafers used for solar cells are typically thinner than those used in semiconductor I'C manufacturing. This makes the solar cell wafers susceptible to surface and edge defects such as deep scratches and cracks. The wafer slicing operation can induce thickness non-uniformity as well as surface roughness variation. Wafer texturing (typically via etching) must result in an optimal pyramid height in the case of monocrystalline wafers and an optical grain size in the case of polycrystalline wafers. Silicon Nitride grown on the wafer can induce stress and eventual breakage of the wafer. An uneven nitride film can cause a drop in the overall efficiency of the wafer. The metal contact lines account for a significant cost in the production of a solar cell wafer. The process engineer must pay attention to the contact line height and width while minimizing the total amount of metal used. Based on all these requirements, an optical profiler, the Zeta-200, was developed to provide rapid and meaningful feedback to the process line. In this paper we present results from various process points in solar cell manufacturing, such as bare wafer roughness, silicon nitride film thickness and contact line dimensions."

pub.1094985252,Production implementation of a practical WLR program,"Wafer Level Reliability (WLR) programs have been active in many semiconductor companies since the early 1980s. Test structures are designed to accelerate known reliability failure mechanisms. Large samples of these test structures are packaged and tested to determine reliability failure rates. These WLR programs typically focus on electromigration (EM), hot carrier, and TDDB testing of packaged parts. National Semiconductor has developed and implemented a WLR program which differs from the traditional approach. Wafer manufacturing personnel need to know which people, equipment, or process variables need to be better controlled to prevent reliability problems in the field. They also need faster feedback, Our WLR program looked at these issues and a more practical approach to eliminating fab-related reliability problems. Wafers, not packaged parts, are tested in-line and at the end of line (before sort test) to provide near-real-time feedback. We identified our top ten reliability failure mechanisms of concern based on past field failure rates and reliability monitors. WLR test structures and test methods were then designed to measure the effect of wafer fab process variability on reliability risk. Designed experiments were used extensively to correlate fab process monitors, WLR test results, and reliability test results."

pub.1086307282,Using fuzzy logic for on-line trend analysis,"Real-time trend analysis of plant data is an important but sometimes difficult human-thought process. While experienced operators can usually quickly filter out spurious information upsets, novices must spend considerable time acquiring such skill. Then the number of trend analyses are high, updating the memory of current plant situations can be onerous, resulting in omissions or other failures. A real-time expert system has been developed to assist in this task for a copper flotation process. Using fuzzy logic, the system determines current and past process states and reports on DCS signals regarding significant changes up or down. When such a change occurs, a message is sent to the computer console to indicate the trend and its corresponding time scale. The system filters out faulty assays and recognizes when equipment is shut down. In this way, an operator can instantly become aware of process trends upon returning to his station from an excursion into the plant. Aspects of the trend analyzer are discussed in this paper and an example of its successful application is given.<>"

The constraints and limitations on VLSI component integration are also discussed. It is shown that the optimal level of component integration can be determined for a set level of specific system goals such as cost, performance, and size. The effects of component integration are illustrated by using a simple electronic system containing memory digital ASICs, and a microprocessor on a single circuit board as an example. It is concluded that the desired level of component integration is determined through the examination of system requirements such as volume, performance, reliability, and cost goals. The level of integration is subject to technical and economic limitations on chip complexity. Limitations involving both technical and economic issues result from the constraints of process, design, assembly, and test of ASICs. In addition, consideration of the economic return on investment generally favors the use of ASICs for products produced in high volume, where the initial cost of ASIC development is small compared to the total value of the systems produced.<>"

Often, the service provided to citizens is presented as a business process, which describes all the required actions that a citizen's request will go through until the citizen's needs are fulfilled. However, citizens and all individuals and systems interacting with the process may choose not to follow the prescribed actions in the process for various reasons, leading to the execution of tasks in different ways. Therefore, these changes in behavior should be taken into account to better adapt the process to their needs and provide improved services to citizens. In a previous work, we proposed a framework that can detect changes not only in a single business process but in a family of business processes issued from a configurable business process, and the detected changes are represented in a change tree.

pub.1061561438,Parasitic Back-Gate Effect in 3-D Fully Depleted Silicon on Insulator Integrated Circuits,"3-D integrated circuits (ICs) promise to deliver faster, more compact circuitry with lower power consumption than equivalent planar ICs. However, 3-D integration introduces unique noise sources not present in planar ICs. In this paper, we identify how interconnect on a backside metal layer acts as a back gate of transistors on the adjacent tiers in 3-D fully depleted silicon on insulator technology. The resulting shift in threshold voltage is determined by process and backside interconnect geometries. We develop a framework to evaluate the impact of process parameters. Our results show that coupling due to backside metal results in 5X more electrostatic noise coupling than nearby through-oxide vias. The results also show that the change in threshold voltage of an NFET device increases with thicker front oxide, thinner buried oxide, thinner silicon film, and increased backside metal voltage. Additionally, we simulate the adverse effects of back-gate coupling on circuit performance using a representative analog test circuit, an analog amplifier. We show that the back-gate voltage can change the output of an inverting amplifier by as much as the output swing of the amplifier (0.058 V) under normal operation."
pub.1093505943,Using Feature Modeling for Program Comprehension and Software Architecture Recovery,"The available evidence in a legacy software system, which can help in its understanding and recovery of its architecture are not always sufficient. Very often the system's documentation is poor and outdated. One may argue that the most reliable resource of information is the system's source code. Nevertheless a significant knowledge about the problem domain is required in order to facilitate the extraction of the system's useful architectural information. In this approach feature modeling is introduced as an additional step in a system's architectural recovery process. Feature modeling structures the system's functionality and supports reverse engineering by detecting the relations between source code elements and requirements. Tracing these relations may lead to a better understanding of the program's behavior and the recovery of various architectural elements. In this way, by providing a mapping between source code and features, the system's feature model supports program comprehension and architectural recovery. The approach is developed as first part of a migration methodology towards a component-based architecture of legacy systems. Recovered information about features and architecture is collected in a repository to enable a refactoring as next step. The approach is currently applied in a large project for reengineering of an industrial Image Processing System."

In such a mature fabrication process, the importance of the detection of random defects is crucial as they contribute to the majority of the defects occurring while processing the chips. The global low yield in superconductor electronics (SCE) is due to the fact that little is known about the defects and fault mechanisms occurring in Nb technology.

For this purpose, a structural testing approach has been applied to the HYPRES Nb process. As a result, we have developed test structures for the detection of random defects in the process.

In the case of a process failure, the root cause of the failure must be analyzed, and relevant actions must be taken to correct it. In this paper, we describe a novel way of diagnosing process failures. First, the tested PCM parameters, which are correlated to each other, are analyzed and transformed to a new set of independent parameters using principal component analysis (PCA). In the second step, the most important eigenvectors from PCA calculation are identified, and the causes of the process failures can therefore be extracted. Furthermore, using the PCA eigenvectors as a coordinate base, the state space of a process can be constructed. As a result, the process states from different lots of wafers can be compared; thus, it is possible to trace the IC processes, or even to predict a possible process failure, before it happens."

A classical solution to schedule parallel programs on-line is Work Stealing. However, its use with MPI-2 is complicated by a restricted communication scheme between the processes: namely, spawned processes in MPI-2 can only communicate with their direct parents. This work presents an on-line scheduling algorithm, called Hierarchical Work Stealing, to obtain good load-balancing of MPI-2 programs that follow a Divide & Conquer strategy. Experimental results are provided, based on a synthetic application, the N-Queens computation. The results show that the Hierarchical Work Stealing algorithm enables the use of MPI with high efficiency, even in parallel dynamic HPC platforms that are not as homogeneous as clusters."

pub.1094389388,Modeling and Configuration of Process Variants for On-Boarding Customers to IT Outsourcing,"An essential part of IT outsourcing is to move the customer's IT environment into the service provider's mode of operation, which is known as customer on-boarding. It covers every aspect of transition and transformation, from the time the customer signs the contract to the time the provider can deliver steady-state IT services. In order to improve the repeatability and enforce adoption of best practices, a standard set of processes should be established to direct, control, and measure on-boarding activities for each customer. However, this process is very complex and often gets adapted according to customer environments and requirements. It is very difficult to incorporate process variants needed for diverse scenarios into a single on-boarding process model, so that they can be reused. In this paper, we propose an approach based on ontology and rules to model the standard on-boarding process and configure process variants based on the business context that characterizes various scenarios. Further, semantic rules model adaptation policies and help generate a customized process variant schema on the fly. Based on this framework, we have developed a prototype to support process variant configuration. We also discuss the flexibility of our approach, and present its cost-benefit analysis."

pub.1095836819,Formal Verification of AADL Models Using UPPAAL,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are known to be highly complex systems which can be applied to a variety of different environments, covering both civil and military application domains. As CPS are typically complex systems, its design process requires strong guarantees that the specified functional and nonfunctional properties are satisfied on the designed application. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and high-level specification languages are a valuable asset to help the design and evaluation of such complex systems. However, when looking at the existing MDE tool-support, it is observed that there is still little support for the automated integration of formal verification techniques in these tools. Given that formal verification is necessary to ensure the levels of reliability required by safety critical CPS, this paper presents an approach that aims to integrate the Model Checking technique in the CPS design process for the purpose of correctly analyzing temporal and safety characteristics. A tool named ECPS Verifier was designed to support the model checking integration into the design process, providing the generation of timed automata models from high-levels specifications in AADL. The proposed method is illustrated by means of the design of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, from where we derive the timed automata models to be analyzed in the UPPAAL tool."

This article presents the design and type-theoretic foundation of Nomos, a programming language for digital contracts that addresses these challenges. To express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types. To control resource usage, Nomos employs automatic amortized resource analysis. To prevent the duplication or deletion of assets, Nomos uses a linear type system. A monad integrates the effectful session-typed language with a general-purpose functional language. Nomos’ prototype implementation features linear-time type checking and efficient type reconstruction that includes automatic inference of resource bounds via off-the-shelf linear optimization. The effectiveness of the language is evaluated with case studies on implementing common smart contracts such as auctions, elections, and currencies. Nomos is completely formalized, including the type system, a cost semantics, and a transactional semantics to deploy Nomos contracts on a blockchain. The type soundness proof ensures that protocols are followed at run-time and that types establish sound upper bounds on the resource consumption, ruling out re-entrancy and out-of-gas vulnerabilities."

Original method of their neutralization is based on their dissolution in water followed by a complex reaction crystallization process (after solid (NH4)2S04 addition) effecting in production of barium sulphate. The process regime, which determines the crystalline product quality, depends on many technological parameters which individually influence various partial processes in micro- and macroscale.

Unfortunately, defect detection resources are seldom available in sufficient quantity to allow a yield enhancement engineer to pinpoint yield loss contributions down to a single operation. This paper will explain a methodology to build a by-operational loop defect pareto for an entire manufacturing process, which normally has only limited inspection points in-line due to scan capacity constraints. Establishing a total line pareto is essential in effectively distributing limited engineering resources to improve yields on defect limited devices. Key enables for checking and cross referencing the validity of short loop experiments will be outlined in detail throughout the paper.

For each issues cluster we determine the functionality to be provided and artifacts to be managed by a tool as assessment criteria. The degree of fulfillment of a certain criteria depends on if and how the associated function or artifact is provided. Our investigations result in the definition of 12 evaluation criteria.

A long thin bulk micromachined mirror array, which is not easily described analytically, was modelled by using a pseudo process and the coupled field problem of its elastic-electrostatic behaviour has been investigated."
pub.1095705272,Preparing Cyber-physical Systems Functional Models for Implementation,"The design process of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) normally starts with the development of a functional model, used for simulation purposes. This model is composed of the control algorithms and a mathematical representation of the physical system to be controlled. The approach, called Assisted Transformation of Models (AST), provides a means to transform the functional model into an architectural model, which is intended to detail how the computing system should be implemented on a real (typically embedded) platform. Up to now, AST only focused on the transformation of the control part. It is assumed that the mathematical model will be treated as a device, i.e., that it will be seen as an external element to the system under development. The consequence of this assumption is that there will be work left to be done by the designers, since the control application running on a real platform requires sensing and actuation instead of the mathematical model. This paper describes how to extend the AST approach in order to transform a CPS functional model into an architectural model that also takes into consideration the sensing and actuation subsystems. For instance, it addresses how designers should modify the functional model to consider a set of sensors and actuators, the possibility to express their dynamic characteristics (like sampling frequency, time response, and period) and technological details (like communication protocol and power supply). The outcome of this proposal is not only a proper generation of the architectural model, but also an adaptation of the functional model to be used with Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulations."
pub.1121050532,Evaluation and Comparison of Agent-Oriented Methodologies: A Software Engineering Viewpoint,"Numerous agent-oriented methodologies that offer a rich pool of resources to support developers of agent-based systems have been proposed. However, the use of existing methodologies in industrial settings is still limited due to the large volume of methodologies, diversity of covered scopes, ambiguity in concepts, and lack of maturity. This makes it difficult for agent technology practitioners to choose the appropriate methodology that best fits their given development context. To eliminate such agent-based development bottleneck, it is important to introduce suitable methods for evaluating, comparing, and classifying agent-oriented methodologies in order to leverage their usage among practitioners. Having systems to evaluate methodologies can effectively help developers better understand existing methodologies, realize their benefits, outline their pros and cons, and assist practitioners with selecting the best-fit methodology for a specific agent-based project. In response, this paper proposes a novel criteria-based evaluation that is influenced by software engineering practices to assess and compare agentoriented methodologies. The proposed evaluation is derived from the software engineering body of knowledge (SWEBOK) and provides a simplified method to assess the coverage degree of an agent-oriented methodology with respect to major software knowledge areas such as the requirements and testing phases. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed evaluation by applying it to three agent-oriented methodologies (PASSI, MaSE, and Prometheus) in the software engineering requirements and testing phases."

However, a business process may be exposed to different environments and subjected to many conditions in which a sequence cannot be identified at design time. We present declarative business process specifications that can be used to align optional process customizations as well as process redesign, with the business strategy of the organization. These specifications complement the traditional (imperative) business process model by specifying the process independently from a particular environment."
pub.1181459145,Towards Silicon Carbide Monolithic Active Pixel Radiation Sensors,"Future collider experiments demand tracking detectors with rapid data acquisition, high spatial and temporal resolution, and exceptional radiation hardness. Monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS), manufactured using silicon CMOS technology, are proven to provide excellent spatial and temporal resolution. In terms of radiation hardness, however, wide band-gap semiconductors such as silicon carbide (SiC) promise better performance. In this work, we take the first step towards MAPS implementation in SiC-CMOS technology. We used the Fraunhofer IISB 2μm SiC-CMOS technology to design the first stage in the electronic read-out chain of a MAPS, a charge-sensitive amplifier (CSA) circuit. Circuit simulations show that an equivalent noise charge of 107e is attainable for a sensor capacitance of 1pF. The attained bandwidth of 31kHz was limited by the large size of the transistors currently available in SiC-CMOS technology. While SiC-CMOS technology is still in its infancy, we believe that with increasing integration density, SiC-MAPS can become a feasible and interesting alternative to their silicon counterparts."

Based on a six-month action research project in an automotive manufacturer, we present an integrated multilevel roadmapping approach that develops a single architecture and single scope roadmap, but that organizes its information according to three levels of analysis: macro, meso, and micro. These interconnected levels are designed to deliver the specific information granularity requested by top, middle, and low-level managers. A new bottom-up approach is followed for the interconnected roadmap development, zooming out from detailed (micro) layers to a strategic (macro) landscape. Results indicate superior internal consistency, sense of ownership, communication, and integration among all levels and functions involved, as well as rich strategic insights. We discuss how the specificities of this article contribute to the current knowledge and why it is especially valuable for established firms of traditional sectors, such as the automotive industry."

This MMIC was fabricated using a commercially available 6-in InGaP–GaAs HBT MMIC process. It achieved a measured sensitivity of above 1100 V/W for an analog multiplier and a conversion gain of better than 9 dB for a mixer. It also demonstrated a lower corner frequency and noise than that of an InP HBT analog multiplier. The measured low-frequency noise was 10 nV/sqrt(Hz), which is about half of that of an InP HBT analog multiplier with a similar architecture. The corner frequency of the low-frequency noise was roughly estimated to be 15 kHz. The measured performance of this MMIC chip with gain–bandwidth–product (GBP) of 47 GHz rivals that of the reported GaAs-based analog multipliers and mixers. The high GBP result achieved by this chip is attributed to the HBT device performance and the broad-band input-matching network."

Less than 30% of the smaller companies were familiar with reliability. In 1996, based on a survey and a following ""out-line study"", a new project was initiated by the Association of Swedish Engineering Industries, VI, and its Reliability Committee Te 5/2. The goal was to develop and document a program for ""cooperative reliability development by small and medium-sized companies of the Swedish industrial sector"". It will offer help to companies to initiate need based and local reliability work/activities. Starting point is an auditing/review of a company's existent process(es) and an audit of existing reliability status. Based on this, one will reach an understanding of in what way any ""down-to-the-floor"" simplified reliability-centered activity could be helpful. The final program will include necessary information and methods packages, training activities, expertise for managerial support and guidance during start-up and access to consultancy support where necessary for further implementation. This paper describes the project and its findings and illustrates the tools and methods developed for organizing individual down-to-the-floor reliability work programs by the industry."

Set based design enables the exploration of feasible solutions for longer in the design process than is otherwise affordable using point-based design, so as to allow for input from several project participants early on and at the same time. The simulations use the canonical example of selecting longitudinal reinforcement for a beam-column joint. The first simulation uses EZStrobe© to model the amount of time necessary to converge to a satisfactory design solution using set-based vs. point-based design methods. The second simulation uses XML data exchange and state machines in a service-based architecture to analyze the required information flows for communicating design sets.

Of particular interest to the authors is the manufacture of electronic components, which involves many process intensive, semicontinuous, and repetitive wet chemical and physical operations that define circuit patterns on polymer, ceramic, or silicon substrates. The value of the application of systems analysis concepts for environmental considerations to complex sequential manufacturing operations lies in its capability to ascertain materials flow, consumption and waste generation at all times, at the individual process step, manufacturing line, or factory levels, and to provide process optimization and control from an environmental perspective. A proposed architecture for the application of systems analysis in a typical manufacturing process line in a UNIX System environment is illustrated. A major element incorporated in the platform is the ""smart"" module, which provides intelligent manufacturing systems assessments having environmental impact at both the micro and macro manufacturing levels, and recommends process alternatives or control using knowledge of best available process technology.<>"

Since foundry SRAM cells can be validated during process development and manufacturing ramp but radiation hardening by design cells cannot, we use a specialized test structure to validate the cell design here. Stability, manufacturability, and hardness are experimentally investigated using a 4 kbit SRAM structure, fabricated on one version of the foundry 90 nm process. The structure, combined with a novel test and simulation based extraction procedure, allows direct measurement of the as-fabricated cell electrical characteristics. Variation of the SRAM switching points due to irradiation as well as the individual transistor threshold voltage variability is measured in the SRAM array test structure. Irradiation tests show negligible impact on switching voltage and increase in the standby current less than 1.5% after 2 Mrad(Si). The effects on the cell margins are also analyzed. The specific SRAM cell layout, which uses a very low aspect ratio, is intended to minimize multibit upset of horizontally adjacent cells. This impact is also discussed with measured heavy ion results."

The business process is usually described by Petri net, BPMN, and other modeling languages, and the model structure also confirms all instances produced by these networks. Queries and analysis of instances are mainly querying the path and attributes on the graph model. However, almost all instances are stored in the relational database from practical applications and lost their original path information indeed, which can not support efficient route query. This is the main reason for the bottleneck of process analysis performance, especially in big data era. This paper proposed a path-based bitmap index named PBI, providing fast path querying for process instances in the Cloud, without changing the original relational schema. Meanwhile, with the help of utilizing the parallel computing resources provided by the Cloud, the query efficiency is dramatically improved. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on real data. The results demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform the method without our index."

pub.1061205954,Quantifying the impact of homogeneous metal contamination using test structure metrology and device modeling,"Deposition of metallic impurities from HF process solutions has been investigated experimentally and explained theoretically in a qualitative manner. The depositions are shown to be electrochemical in nature in that an oxidation reduction reaction results in metal ions in solution depositing on the wafer as elements with an oxidation state of 0. The theory is only qualitative in that it can only predict which metals will deposit, not how much. Experimentally, simple transmission equations can be determined which relate metallic contamination levels on Si wafer surfaces (atoms/cm/sup 2/) to metal concentration in the solution (ppb). Simple test structures have been fabricated with known amounts of iron and copper contamination in the pregate oxide clean of a 1.25 /spl mu/m CMOS process. Device measurements indicate device degradation in the case of copper, confirming deposition studies that copper deposits from HF solutions. Iron contaminated wafers show no contamination related device effects, in support of theoretical predictions and deposition studies indicating iron does not deposit from HF solutions. The importance and potential usefulness of test structures as homogeneous contamination monitors is illustrated through device modeling of the contamination effects observed in the test structures that can then be used to estimate the effects of such contamination on ULSI circuit performance.<>"

Also, the temperature at the center position is lower than that at the corner, and the time above liquidus at the center position is only 16s. Microstructure on the bonding interface was observed, and the reaction products were given at different position of solder balls.

pub.1095595981,"DATE 2006 Special Session: DFM/DFY Design for Manufacturability and Yield - influence of process variations in digital, analog and mixed-signal circuit design","The concepts of design for manufacturability and design for yield DFM/DFY are bringing together domains that co-existed mostly separated until now $circuit design, physical design and manufacturing process. New requirements like SoC, mixed analog/digital design and deep-submicron technologies force to a mutual integration of all levels. A major challenge coming with new deep-submicron technologies is to design and verify integrated circuits for high yield. Random and systematic defects as well as parametric process variations have a large influence on quality and yield of the designed and manufactured circuits. With further shrinking of process technology, the on-chip variation is getting worse for each technology node. For technologies larger than 180nm feature sizes, variations are mostly in a range of below 10%. Here an acceptable yield range is achieved by regular but error-prone re-shifts of the drifting process. However, shrinking technologies down to 90nm, 65nm and below cause on-chip variations of more than 50%. It is understandable that tuning the technology process alone is not enough to guarantee sufficient yield and robustness levels any more. Redesigns and, therefore, respins of the whole development and manufacturing chain lead to high costs of multiple manufacturing runs. All together the risk to miss the given market window is extremely high. Thus, it becomes inevitable to have a seamless DFM/DFY concept realized for the design phase of digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits. New DFY methodologies are coming up for parametric yield analysis and optimization and have recently been made available for the industrial design of individual analog blocks on transistor level up to 1500 transistors. The transfer of yield analysis and yield optimization techniques to other abstraction levels - both for digital as well as for analog - is a big challenge. Yield analysis and optimization is currently applied to individual circuit blocks and not to the overall chip yielding on the one hand often too pessimistic results - best/worst case and OCV (on chip variation) factor - for the digital parts. On the other hand for analog often very high efforts are spent to design individual blocks with high robustness (>6sigma). For abstraction to higher digital levels first approaches like statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) are under development. For the analog parts a strategy to develop macro models and hierarchical simulation or behavioral simulation methodologies is required that includes low-level statistical effects caused by local and global process variation of the individual devices"

In this way, a relation between the HBT cutoff frequencies ${ f} _{ T}$ and ${ f} _{\max}$ and the 3-dB cutoff frequency ${ f} _{ c}$ of the amplifier is obtained. This is very useful for assessing the gain-bandwidth potential of a given HBT technology for cascode-based TWAs. Applying these results, we study the potential of two technologies with different ${ f} _{\max} /{ f} _{ T}$ ratios, an InP technology with ${ f} _{\max} /{ f} _{ T}$ of 120 GHz/190 GHz, and a GaAs technology with ${ f} _{\max} /{ f} _{ T}$ of 170 GHz/36 GHz.

A successful KIP has to adapt for the situation and to treat each customer's request as unique rather than to follow some predefined sequence of actions. The discipline of Business Process Management (BPM) defines solutions for modeling, development, analysis and improvement of processes with a predefined flow of activities. From the traditional, activity-centered point of view, KIP are challenging to automate, to control and to test for compliance.

pub.1061167005,A 7 ns 1 Mb BiCMOS ECL SRAM with shift redundancy,"A 7-Mb BiCMOS ECL (emitter coupled logic) SRAM was fabricated in a 0.8 mu m BiCMOS process. An improved buffer with a high-level output of nearly V/sub CC/ is adopted to eliminate the DC current in the level converter circuit, and the PMOS transistor has a wide operating margin in the level converter. The configurable bit organization is realized by using a sense-amplifier switch circuit with no access degradation. A wired-OR demultiplexer for the *1 output, having the same critical path as the *4 output circuit, allows for the same access time between the two modes. The *1 or *4 mode is electrically selected by the external signal. A simplified programming redundancy technology, shift redundancy, is utilized. Address programming is performed by cutting only one fuse in the shift redundancy. The RAM operates at the ECL-10K level with an access time of 7 ns. and the power dissipation at 50 MHz is 600 mW for the * mode.<>"

Recent advances in process technology have come from a variety of industrial foundries and university research efforts. These advances in processing have reduced critical current spreads and increased circuit speed, density, and yield.

pub.1127578792,Design for High Reliability of CMOS IC With Tolerance on Total Ionizing Dose Effect,"As the standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit (IC) generates a leakage current due to ionizing radiation reacting with silicon in a radiological environment, radiation hardening of CMOS devices is being actively investigated. If a radiation-tolerant IC (RTIC) is designed, it is very important to examine the design possibility of an application specific IC (ASIC) that uses a radiation-tolerant MOS field-effect transistor (MOSFET). This study developed a new RTIC design using an I-gate structure that is more effective in terms of time, cost, and reliability than the existing RTMOSFET. Because an RTIC with an I-gate structure can be fabricated via the usual full-custom IC design process, it can be produced after its reliability is ensured based on post-layout simulation results, which are obtained by layout parasitic extraction (LPE). To realize the possibility of such fabrication, radiation-tolerant digital and analog ICs were designed and fabricated in the standard 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$ CMOS process, and an irradiation test was conducted up to a total dose of approximately 2 Mrad. Accordingly, the radiation damage in the standard IC and the radiation tolerance of the RTIC were identified. Consequently, we have proposed and verified an efficient radiation-tolerant ASIC design solution."

Thus the process can be carried out in face detection and face recognition."
pub.1140916215,Uncertainty-Aware Prognosis via Deep Gaussian Process,"The task of predicting how long a certain industrial asset will be able to operate within its nominal specifications is called Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation. Efficient methods of performing this task promise to drastically transform the world of industrial maintenance, paving the way for the so-called Industry 4.0 revolution. Given the abundance of data resulting from the advent of the digitalization era, Machine Learning (ML) models are the ideal candidates for tackling the RUL estimation problem in a fully data-driven fashion. However, given the safety-critical nature of maintenance operations on industrial assets, it’s crucial that such ML-based methods be designed such that their levels of transparency and reliability are maximized. Modern ML algorithms, however, are often employed as black-box methods, which do not provide any clue regarding the confidence level associated with their output. In this paper, we address this limitation by investigating the performance of a recently proposed class of algorithms, Deep Gaussian Processes, which provide uncertainty estimates associated with their RUL prediction, yet retain the expressive power of modern ML techniques. Contrary to standard approaches to uncertainty quantification, such methods scale favourably with the size of the available datasets, allowing their usage in the “big data” setting. We perform a thorough evaluation and comparison of several variants of DGPs applied to RUL predictions. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated on the NASA N-CMAPSS (New Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset for aircraft engines. The results show that the proposed methods are able to yield very accurate RUL predictions along with sensible uncertainty estimates, providing more reliable solutions for (safety-critical) real-life industrial applications."
pub.1094825833,10-40GHz design in SiGe-BiCMOS and Si-CMOS -linking technology and circuits to maximize performance,"This paper reviews the relevance of the widely used device metrics ${\mbi f}_{{\mbi T}},{\mbi f}_{{\mbi m}{\mbi a}{\mbi x}}$: as well as the recently introduced device metrics fAand ${\mbi f}_{{\mbi c}{\mbi r}{\mbi o}{\mbi s}{\mbi s}}$ for broadband circuit design. Usually, IC processes are benchmarked on the basis of their frand fmax. For most circuit applications however, there is only an indirect relation between frfmaxIT, and circuit bandwidths. Since the differential pair amplifier is a key building block in broadband circuits, the metric fA provides a nearly direct relation to broadband circuit performance. This is demonstrated via the maximum operating frequency of a current-mode logic frequency divider, processed in 3 generations of a BiCMOS process. Metric fcrossis valuable for the design of circuits employing a cross-coupled differential pair as active negative resistance, such as in LC-VCOs. The metrics can be expressed in terms of transistor parameters (e.g., Rb, Cbc, …), allowing to derive a link between circuit performance and technology. Based on our experience, we evaluate IC processes on the basis of fTfmax and fcross rather than fT and fmax."

Activities such as business knowledge acquisition, business process modeling, performance, quality and impact analysis all can be done more effectively if supported by proper tools. We describe a design scenario for business understanding and re-engineering tools that is based on systematic modeling of business knowledge. The business knowledge model forms conceptual schema for the tool repository. We start by building a generic business model. As both the model and required tool characteristics vary from company to company and from one business re-engineering project to another, we customize the generic model and tools to reflect needs of a given company and a business re-engineering project in hand. We achieve a required level of tool flexibility by applying meta-CASE techniques. The physical repository schema and tools themselves are automatically generated from the customized business model specifications. We focus on tools and analysis methods that have not been extensively described in other sources. We describe an interview assistant tool, support for impact analysis and an end-user query language in which a user can define new business analysis methods, not supported by a generic tool environment.<>"

pub.1094819471,Improvements in process yields for a 200 mm wafer fabricator,"IBM's 200 mm wafer fabricator in Essex Junction, Vermont, Like other semiconductor manufacturers, periodically experienced production losses due to wafers scrapped in process or at final wafer test. Efforts to increase yield by the use of traditional top-down management techniques such as executive directives and problem solving by management with little input from hands-on employees did not result in any sustainable improvement. To remedy the situation, IBM turned to it's employees and their knowledge of the product and the processes used to manufacture that product. Two self-directed work teams, which eventually merged into a single unit, were formed and given responsibility for improving process and electrical test yields. A three-pronged approach to improving process yields was put in place that included in-depth team meetings that discovered reasons why wafers were scrapped and drove activity to fix the problems, stimulated preventive actions through systematic investigation and improvement of process controls for every process area, and created focus on process control and yield problems through an incentive program. This program is still in use today. In-depth team reviews are conducted for all wafers stopped in process because of quality screens. These reviews are attended by team members and representatives from every manufacturing department holding wafers that might be defective. Information from these meetings is shared with a subset of the team that works directly with toolset teams (reactive ion etching, wet cleans, oxidations and diffusions, etc.), to improve preventive measures. Actions taken to prevent process problems are developed from working meetings with every toolset team. Teams are rewarded through an incentive program based on attaining team targets, as well as goals for overall fabricator process yield. This work team approach has resulted in an eighty percent reduction in the scrap rate of wafers in process and at wafer-level functional test."

Software architecture describes the functionality and the size of system to be built. Software architecture is illustrated as packages diagram, class diagram or Enterprise Architecture diagram. To make a robust software, it's important to know quality of architecture. Architecture Quality is reflected in its design. There are various topics of research on the quality aspect of the architectural design, from enviroment adaption of architectural design to design stability maintenance. The concept of reuse elements of the system is one of the topics to maintain the stability of the software design. Aversano and Constantinou introduce the method of measuring the stability of the architectural design by taking into account external and internal elements of architecture built. Both just look at the number of packets that undergo additions and deletions to the pair versions. Quantitative research to assess an architectural stability by looking at environmental factors needed to complete measurement.

pub.1157672851,Vertices Packaging-Based Interval Independent Component Analysis (VP-I2CA) for Fault Detection With Process Uncertainty,"The fault detection capability of traditional data-driven process monitoring methods is highly dependent on the quality of process data. However, affected by measurement noise, harsh operation scenarios and other factors, the process data are inevitably contaminated by uncertainty in real processes. In this article, a vertices packaging-based interval independent component analysis (VP-I2CA) method is proposed to monitor the uncertain non-Gaussian processes. First, a variable bandwidth-kernel density estimation-based measurement error estimation method is developed to describe the uncertainty-contaminated process data in interval form using limited reliable data samples. Then, VP-I2CA is developed to estimate the demixing matrix based on hypermatrices constructed by vertices encoding, which includes all possible combinations between the bounds of interval data by explicitly considering the existence of uncertainty. In order to reduce computational complexity, the idea of data packaging is introduced to represent the hyper-independent components in interval form with a series of values by packaging all possible feature information hidden in uncertain process data. Afterwards, four monitoring statistics are constructed to monitor the systematic and nonsystematic parts of process operation variation. The proposed algorithm is verified in both a six-variable numerical simulation system and a continuous stirred tank reactor system."
pub.1061206354,Statistical device models from worst case files and electrical test data,"Two statistical metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) models are described, one based on worst case files and the other on electrical test data. The former is appropriate for predicting the variability of a process early in its life cycle, while the latter would better track a maturing process. The key statistical tool that is used to develop the models is principal component analysis (PCA), which is used in novel ways in order to derive statistical models from readily available information. The models are used to perform statistical circuit simulation in order to quantitatively predict the impact of manufacturing variations on circuit performance metrics. Due to the use of linear response surface modeling and latin hypercube sampling, the simulation cost of using the models is about the same as with worst case simulation. The modeling technique is general and is applicable to other semiconductor devices besides MOS devices which are considered in this paper."

These structures are called 'MONGOS' due to their size ( approximately 300 K Cells) and were designed using the process target EPROM or Flash cells in an array as an exact replica of the product vehicle. Resistance and IV measurements, on pieces of the MONGOs complete with gate and substrate bias control, provide raw data input. The entire 300 K cells can be treated like one giant transistor. A post-processor program creates defect bins from these data for each layer deconfounding the defects according to rules defined in a set of calculation files. The approach is flexible in that defect bins (models) can be defined and implemented as mechanisms are refined; it is also fast since >300 K cells are tested in parallel.

pub.1061280636,An Open Platform for Fully-Additive Printed Electronics,"Despite the gargantuan market potential, Printed Electronics-only (PE-only) circuits and systems on flexible substrate remain nascent. There are a number of reasons for this, including the inavailability of Process Development Kits (PDKs) to facilitate PE circuits and systems design and to predict manufacturability (due to the innately high process variations of PE). In this paper, we describe an “Open-Platform” PDK for our Fully-Additive Low-Temperature All-Air printing process with Very Low Process Variations. Our PDK embodies a novel simple yet accurate transistor model that can not only accurately model the printed transistors depending on their layout and when they are flat (unbent substrate) but also accurately model the process variations when they are bent (bent substrate). This PDK for bending is important for PE circuits and systems whose substrate is adhered to uneven surfaces or bent to fit odd spaces, thereby expanding the applicability of PE circuits and systems. The efficacy of the Open-Platform and the proposed PE transistor model is verified by means of comparisons between simulations and measurements of basic individual printed electronic elements and for several fundamental printed digital and analog circuits. These comparisons include when the substrate is flat and bent, depicting that bending is not only detrimental, but may conversely be advantageously exploited. The proposed PDK is compatible with commercial computer aided design simulation tools."

In this paper, a new approach called concurrent kernel PLS (CKPLS) is presented to detect faults comprehensively for nonlinear processes. The new model divides the nonlinear process and quality spaces into five subspaces: the co-varying, process-principal, process-residual, quality-principal, and quality-residual subspaces. The co-varying subspace reflects nonlinear relationship between quality variables and original process variables. The process-principal and process-residual subspaces reflect the principal variations and residuals, respectively, in the nonlinear process space. Further, the quality-principal and quality-residual subspaces reflect the principal variations and residuals, respectively, in the quality space.

pub.1093842847,Dynamo + Astro: An Integrated Approach for BPEL Monitoring,"In the literature, there exist several approaches for monitoring the execution of BPEL processes. They concentrate on different properties, adopt different languages, work at different levels of abstraction, and assume different perspectives. Even if the field is rather new, we do not think that this diversity is a limitation of current solutions; rather it is intrinsic in the problem itself. We claim that, instead of working on the definition of the ultimate approach for BPEL monitoring, we should push a cooperative approach based on the integration of different solutions. In this paper, we present a first step in this direction, and describe a monitoring framework which is obtained by integrating two well-known approaches, namely Dynamo and Astro. This integration, which happens both for the language used for expressing the properties to be monitored, and for the architecture of the monitoring framework, allows to combine the advantages of the two approaches and to obtain a general, comprehensive solutions for BPEL monitoring."

pub.1174525488,An Approach to Double-Balanced Mixer Synthesis Using Surrogate Modeling and Genetic Algorithm,"In this paper, we propose an approach to double-balanced mixer synthesis. Distinctive features of the approach are using genetic algorithm to search the solution and surrogate modeling to speed-up the circuit simulation. The synthesis is carried out according to a set of requirements for conversion gain, port-to-port isolation, and LO and RF return loss. The synthesized mixer is configured as a downconverter. Used surrogate model is based on the combination of surface approximation and adaptive space mapping. Kriging interpolation is used as an approximation technique. Search algorithm varies the mixer element geometric parameters, RF and LO baluns layout, and IF filter order. We presented the synthesis example of 25-40 GHz double-balanced mixers based on $0.25 \mu \mathrm{m}$ GaAs pHEMT process. Results shown that each run gives us a solution that meets almost all requirements. Also, we estimated the influence of the LO and RF baluns surrogate model error on the mixer characteristics. The mean relative error between the EM simulation and surrogate model results was less than 4%."
pub.1103965897,Pilot-Scale Application of on-Line Monitoring System for Ultrapure Water,"The on-line monitoring system for ultrapure water (UPW) systems was investigated. For the quality control of production water and the screening of defective water during the production of semiconductors and displays, as well as the operation of plant turbines, ultrapure water is managed through on-line and off-line monitoring of its conductivity and resistivity as well as its silicate, heavy metal, total organic carbon (TOC) and particle content. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed and proposed seven types of electronics-grade water for the production of electronics and semiconductors. Type E-1.3 is classified as microelectronic water to be used in the production of devices having line widths between 0.065 and 0.032μm. This type is a water of ultimate practical purity produced in large volumes, and is intended for the most critical microelectronic uses. ASTM Type E-1.3 is also identical to the SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Guide for Ultrapure Water Used in Semiconductor Processing (F063), 2010 version. The monitoring system of this study was operated in a pilot-scale ultrapure water plant having facilities with a production capacity of 50 m3/d. The results of system operations yielded water having an average TOC of 0.002 μg/L (Min. 0.001 μg/L, Max. 0.005 μg/L), an average particle content of 0.4 ea/L (> 0.05 μm, Min. 0.3 ea/L, Max. 0.8 ea/L), and a resistivity of 18.15 MΩ•cm. The results above indicated that the water quality standards provided in the Type E-1.2 specifications proposed by ASTM were satisfied."

pub.1061735486,Effects of Ionizing Radiation on Digital Single Event Transients in a 180-nm Fully Depleted SOI Process,"Effects of ionizing radiation on single event transients are reported for Fully Depleted SOI (FDSOI) technology using experiments and simulations. Logic circuits, i.e. CMOS inverter chains, were irradiated with cobalt-60 gamma radiation. When charge is induced in the n-channel FET with laser-probing techniques, laser-induced transients widen with increased total dose. This is because radiation causes charge to be trapped in the buried oxide, and reduces the p-channel FET drive current. When the p-channel FET drive current is reduced, the time required to restore the output of the laser-probed FET back to its original condition is increased, i.e. the upset transient width is increased. A widening of the transient pulse is also observed when a positive bias is applied to the wafer without any exposure to radiation. This is because a positive wafer bias reproduces the shifts in FET threshold voltages that occur during total dose irradiation. Results were also verified with heavy ion testing and mixed mode simulations."
pub.1061548652,Advanced Copper/Polyimide Hybrid Technology,"In the past, a unique hybrid IC processing approach which combines wet-metallized copper, air-fired (ruthenium-based) RuO2paste, and photoactive polyimide, was presented by the authors [1], Now, a further improved and advanced new copper/polyimide hybrid technology Mitsubishi Copper Polyimide Hybrid (MCPH) has been developed. The new MCPH was processed using a large (106 x 106 mm) Al2O3substrate, full copper system (all layers) with 50-µm fine lines. For the first layer, the full-additive process was adopted, while for the other layers, a semiadditive process was employed. The photoactlve polyimide interlayer insulation is screen printed, and after the exposure and development steps, is cured using a conveyor belt furnace. This new process has many excellent features, such as uniform coating thickness, better mass-production capability, etc. The MCPH fundamental processes were evaluated and established using an MCPH Test Element Group (TEG). This TEG has fine lines, small diameter vias and/or pads, matrix lines, etc. To compare characteristics, the same circuit as a conventional hybrid IC was fabricated by applying the MCPH technology. As a result, this functional MCPH (MCPH ES) is a compact size (less than 1/2 the circuit area), has excellent electrical parameters, and high reliability. This MCPH ES uses a flip-chip IC (2.9 mmx 3.4 mm) with 30 small solder bumps (100 µm, min. 170-µm pitch). Important MCPH process factors and/or reliability factors were fully evaluated by using the TEG and functional ES. Through various tests (thermal cycle, voltage loaded, humidity, pressure cooker, break-down or leak, etc.), the MCPH shows excellent reliability characteristics. Consequently, a unique MCPH has been developed using a simple, reliable, cost-effective and excellent massproduction multilayer-hybrid process."

pub.1061754483,Cache-Hierarchy Contention-Aware Scheduling in CMPs,"To improve chip multiprocessor (CMP) performance, recent research has focused on scheduling strategies to mitigate main memory bandwidth contention. Nowadays, commercial CMPs implement multilevel cache hierarchies that are shared by several multithreaded cores. In this microprocessor design, contention points may appear along the whole memory hierarchy. Moreover, this problem is expected to aggravate in future technologies, since the number of cores and hardware threads, and consequently the size of the shared caches increase with each microprocessor generation. This paper characterizes the impact on performance of the different contention points that appear along the memory subsystem. The analysis shows that some benchmarks are more sensitive to contention in higher levels of the memory hierarchy (e.g., shared L2) than to main memory contention. In this paper, we propose two generic scheduling strategies for CMPs. The first strategy takes into account the available bandwidth at each level of the cache hierarchy. The strategy selects the processes to be coscheduled and allocates them to cores to minimize contention effects. The second strategy also considers the performance degradation each process suffers due to contention-aware scheduling. Both proposals have been implemented and evaluated in a commercial single-threaded quad-core processor with a relatively small two-level cache hierarchy. The proposals reach, on average, a performance improvement by 5.38 and 6.64 percent when compared with the Linux scheduler, while this improvement is by 3.61 percent for an state-of-the-art memory contention-aware scheduler under the evaluated mixes."

pub.1166488465,Discovering Hierarchical Multi-Instance Business Processes From Event Logs,"Process discovery aims to extract descriptive process models from event logs. To date, various process discovery algorithms have been proposed for different application settings. However, most of them meet challenges in handling event logs produced from hierarchical multi-instance business processes, in which multiple sub-process instances are invoked by the execution of a parent process. To address the problem, a novel approach is presented to support the discovery of hierarchical multi-instance process models. Specifically, taking event logs with multi-instance information as input, the detailed implementation of our method can be generally divided into four steps: nesting relation detection, hierarchical event log construction, sub-process case identification, and hierarchical multi-instance model discovery. We have implemented our approach properly as plugins in the openly accessible ProM toolkit, and compared its performance against the state-of-the-art process discovery approaches over six publicly available event logs. Based on the experimental result, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively discover hierarchical multi-instance process models with better quality."

Large companies that operate in rapidly changing environments experience frequently changing customer needs which force decision makers to continuously adjust the scope of their projects. Change intensity is further fueled by fierce market competition and hard time-to-market deadlines. Staying in control of the changes in thousands of features becomes a major issue as information overload hinders decision makers from rapidly extracting relevant information. This paper presents a visual technique, called Feature Survival Charts+ (FSC+), designed to give a quick and effective overview of the requirements scoping process for Very Large-Scale Requirements Engineering (VLSRE). FSC+ were applied at a large company with thousands of features in the database and supported the transition from plan-driven to a more dynamic and change-tolerant release scope management process. FSC+ provides multiple views, filtering, zooming, state-change intensity views, and support for variable time spans. Moreover, this paper introduces five decision archetypes deduced from the dataset and subsequently analyzed and the atomic decision visualization that shows the frequency of various decisions in the process. The capabilities and usefulness of FSC+, decision patterns (state changes that features undergo) and atomic decision visualizations are evaluated through interviews with practitioners who found utility in all techniques and indicated that their inherent flexibility was necessary to meet the varying needs of the stakeholders."

While feasibility tests for the low-cost, high-throughput flip chip assembly based on no-flow underfill over a wide range of flip chip configurations are underway, unfamiliar process defects that have not been observed in the conventional capillary flow process are newly emerging. Of those new process defects, “chip floating” over the board surface after chip placement process is a critical issue that may significantly impact process yield when process variables are not properly controlled. It was found that much of the yield losses observed post reflow is attributed to the “chip floating”. In order to understand the underlying physics of the floating phenomena and predict process variables to eliminate the process defects, a process model has been developed. The critical process variables include chip placement speed, chip placement force, dwell time, deposited underfill mass and underfill material properties such as viscosity, density, surface tension, wetting speed on the board, etc. A test chip and board was made such that chip floating over the board can be detected by testing the electric continuity of the path connecting the chip and board via the solder bumps. The effects of the critical process variables on the chip floating are investigated by a series of experiments and the results are compared to the theoretical model prediction for the model validation."

In this paper, a comprehensive 3-D simulation on 14/16-nm advanced-process FinFET under geometric and process considerations was presented in order to achieve the best possible performance with minimal penalty. Geometric designs, specifically the width and height of the fins as well as the channel lengths, were imposed onto the FinFET, and the impact on the performance merits and device’s characteristics was analyzed. The influence of stress engineering, metal gate work function (WF), and doping concentration was further explored for an allowable leakage limit. The simulation suggests that the process-induced stress can boost the 14/16-nm FinFET drain current up to two or three times. It was also found that the channel length is the most critical geometric parameter to affect the performance of both the pFinFET and nFinFET, of which 60% and 50% increases in its respective drain current were observed as the channel length is scaled from 35 nm to 15 nm. In addition, a change in metal WF is found to be the most effective method for the adjustment of threshold voltage."

A transition from compressive to tensile stress was observed at a boron concentration of 9.1%. Pedestal-type waveguides formed with the high-boron top cladding layer show low loss of 0.02 dB/cm. Arrayed waveguide grating devices with a polarization-dependent wavelength shift of 0.01 nm and excellent stability have been demonstrated."
pub.1094346832,A Linear Program for Optimal Configurable Business Processes Deployment into Cloud Federation,"A configurable process model is a generic model from which an enterprise can derive and execute process variants that meet its specific needs and contexts. With the advent of cloud computing and its economic pay-per-use model, enterprises are increasingly outsourcing partially or totally their process variants to cloud providers, and recently to cloud federations. A main challenge in this regard is to allocate optimally cloud resources to the process variants' activities. More specifically, an enterprise may be interested in outsourcing only those that result in an optimal deployment. Due to the diversity of the enterprise QoS requirements, the heterogeneity of resources offered by the cloud federation and the large number of possible configurations in a configurable process model, finding the optimal process variant deployment becomes a highly challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve this problem through a binary/(0-1) linear program with a quadratic objective function under a set of constraints pertinent to both the enterprise and cloud federation requirements. Our prototypical implementation demonstrates the feasibility and the results of our experiments highlight the effectiveness of our proposed solution."
pub.1148912389,Explainable Steel Quality Prediction System Based on Gradient Boosting Decision Trees,"The steelmaking industry is one of the most energy-intensive industries and is responsible for 4% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Solutions to improve operational efficiency can therefore bring major improvements to the overall environmental performance of the entire industry. This article proposes a novel steel quality prediction system based on gradient boosting trees that can be used to predict the quality of steel products during manufacturing. The prediction system enables the detection of possible surface defects in the early phase of the manufacturing process, thus avoiding costly and time-consuming manufacturing efforts to address defective products. In this study, we trained a prediction model with data collected from an SSAB Europe steelmaking plant in Raahe, Finland. From the 296 process parameters measured in the liquid steel stage of steelmaking, we selected 89 input features to train and test the prediction model. The model was then integrated into a quality monitoring tool (QMT) to utilize real-time manufacturing data in its predictions. The validation process showed that the prediction model can find more than 50% of defective steel products by marking only about 10% of the steel products as potentially at risk of surface defects in plate rolling. This can potentially save time in the quality control phase and improve process efficiency. To gain more insights into the model predictions, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to find a potential connection between the process input parameters and surface defects."

A sector of remanufacturing that today has high volumes - and still is increasing - is that of toner cartridge remanufacturing. The investigation found that, in the sector of toner cartridge remanufacturing, most of the companies are independent of the OEMs, which creates a big competition between the actors, something that is especially evident when considering toner cartridge design. If the designs are to be improved and adapted for remanufacturing, the research found that designers must focus on introducing toner cartridges with the properties of ease-of-identifiation, ease-of-access and wear resistance. The companies studied had a high commitment to quality, and were very much cutomer-focused. Areas that the companies should consider in order to achieve a process that is more lean/efficient were concluded to be visual management systems and the use of space, movement of materials materials and product product line flow. Furthermore, the number of companies dealing with remanufacturing makes it harder to retrieve empties for customers. In this paper, there are sereral diferent strategies mentioned on how to retrieve cartridges,"

Consequently, we aim to represent by means one or more architectural viewpoints that together can provide a unified A$\Gamma$ of SoS’ architecture."

This materials system is referred to as a reflowable underfill. The experimental process flow was as follows: a finite volume of reflowable underfill was dispensed on the printed circuit board (PCB) at the die site, the die was aligned over the bond pads, and the die was placed into the material. Next, the FCOB assembly was transferred to a reflow furnace and subjected to a standard surface mount technology (SMT) eutectic Pb/Sn reflow profile, the solder was reflowed, interconnects were formed between the die and PCB, and the reflowable underfill was partially cured. The built FCOB assemblies were placed in liquid to liquid thermal shock and air to air temperature cycling. The assembly yields varied and continued development of systems with increased flux activity are warranted for the acceptance of this FCOB assembling technology. Promising accelerated life testing (ALT) results were obtained warranting further evaluation of the reflowable materials systems and process."
pub.1094581593,Industrial Oil Producing Stations: Modeling and Analysis using Petri nets and Intelligent Schemes,This paper suggests Petri nets as a mathematical and graphical tool for modeling an industrial oil producing station. It enhances the bottom-up methodology for modeling such stations. It also employs the MATLAB-based PN-tool and the concepts of Petri nets to analysis the developed model that has continuous and discrete activities. The former leads to some difficulties in modeling of hybrid systems due to the fact that most of industrial continuous activities have no models. This paper employs particle swarm algorithm and adaptive fuzzy controller to model and control such continuous activities that are represented with few places inside discrete ones. Simulation results depict the potential of using the PN-tool and intelligent systems for modeling industrial processes.

Thus, new methods are required that measure fluid properties with minimum interference of extraneous factors. Herein, 150 pL of different chemicals, namely, ethanol, 1-butanol, ethylene glycol, ${n}$ -hexadecane, and water, were injected into an enclosed microfluidic channel on top of a microcantilever resonator sensor. Then, resonance frequencies of four vibrational modes and quality factors (${Q}$ -factors) were experimentally measured as functions of fluid density and viscosity. The four resonant frequencies ${f}1$ –${f}4$ consistently increased as the fluid mass decreased. The ${Q}$ -factor for the first mode decreased with increasing viscosity; however, it increased for higher modes. Numerical modal analysis results were compared to the experimental results. The obtained experimental and numerical resonance frequencies are in good agreement, where the numerical values agree well with the experimental results obtained for the first three modes, with only an 8% ± 2% difference."

pub.1061792106,Properties of EWMA Controllers with Gain Adaptation,"Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) controllers are the most commonly used run-to-run controllers in the semiconductor industry. Using a linear model, an EWMA controller can be implemented in two different ways: either process gain or process intercept can be updated using EWMA statistics at each run. The most commonly used EWMA controller formulation is to keep the process gain as its off-line estimate and update the intercept term at each run. We term this formulation as “EWMA controller with intercept adaptation (EWMA-I)”, and its properties have been extensively studied and well understood. We term the other implementation, i.e., keeping the intercept term as its off-line estimate and updating the process gain at each run, as “EWMA with gain adaptation (EWMA-G)”. Despite the fact that gain variation and adaptation is typical in the semiconductor industry, little research has been done to investigate the properties of an EWMA-G controller, such as its stability and sensitivity. In this work, the stability and sensitivity properties of an EWMA-G controller are investigated and compared with those of an EWMA-I controller. Both stationary and drifting processes are considered. In addition, the expressions of the process outputs are derived and the output variances for stochastic processes are evaluated. Simulation examples are given to illustrate these properties and the relevance of these properties to semiconductor process control is discussed. The analysis results will provide some useful guidance on the industrial applications of the EWMA controllers."

pub.1084202665,"A Circuits and Systems Perspective of Organic/Printed Electronics: Review, Challenges, and Contemporary and Emerging Design Approaches","The often touted attractive attributes of printed/organic electronics are its mechanically flexible form-factor, low-cost, green, on-demand printing, scalability, low-power operation, and intelligence (signal processing) – ideally, the creation of intelligent lightweight electronics printed by simple ubiquitous printing processes, and integrated into new ways to exploit its mechanically flexible form-factor. Printed/Organic Electronics, now an industry on its own right and recognized as one of the key technological enablers for the Internet of Things, is largely complementary to silicon because the printed transistors are slow and the printed elements are large. The sanguine projected growth of the $29 B market today to $73 B by 2027 assumes that ‘intelligence’ (analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing) would be realizable. Nevertheless, many of the said attributes of printed/organic electronics remain a challenge. In this paper, we exemplify this with a comprehensive and critical review and tabulation of the state-of-the art printed digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits. We further review the application space of printed/organic electronics and the supply chain, including their classifications and delineate the associated challenges in each constituent chain. These challenges, largely unresolved, are indeed formidable, and are discussed with a critical circuits and systems perspective. Our review depicts that contemporary design philosophies and methodologies for silicon are largely inadequate for printed/organic electronics. To this end, we discuss esoteric analog and digital design philosophies and methodologies, with emphasis on co-design and co-optimization between the different constituent supply chains that may potentially circumvent the said formidable challenges, and discuss the associated penalties thereto."
pub.1095325063,On the impact of fault list partitioning in parallel implementations for dynamic test compaction considering multicore systems,"Modern multicore systems have multiplied the processing power of computing systems, increasing the potential of solving difficult EDA problems. At the same time, careful decomposition of the problem should be made in order to explore the parallelism without compromising the quality of the result with respect to the existing non-parallel solutions. Test set compaction is one of the major EDA problems that is NP-hard and a crucial component of any ATPG methodology. This paper presents a study on the effect of fault list partitioning on a dynamic test set compaction algorithm that has shown to give very good results when considering the entire fault list. The serial algorithm is executed in different subsets of the considered fault list and the obtained results are evaluated in terms of the compaction achieved as well as the execution time. The experimental results demonstrate that the partitioning technique used highly affects the compaction quality while the execution time is significantly reduced."
pub.1153670617,Explainable Process Prescriptive Analytics,"Process-aware Recommender systems (PAR systems) are information systems that aim to monitor process executions, predict their outcome, and recommend effective interventions to have better ends. Recent literature puts forward proposals of PAR systems that return valuable, practical recommendations. However, recommendations without sensible explanations prevent process owners from feeling engaged in the decision process or understanding why these interventions should be carried out. Therefore, the risk of process owners do not trust the PAR system and overlook these recommendations is high. This paper proposes a framework to accompany recommendations with sensible explanations based on the process behavior, the intrinsic characteristics, and the context in which the process is carried on. The paper illustrates the potential relevance of these explanations for process owners in two use cases."

pub.1061766868,Erosion and Lifetime Evaluation of Molybdenum Electrode Under High Energy Impulse Current,"One of the factors of the functional life of the electrodes used in pulse current discharge depends on the erosion of electrodes. There are many areas that have not been investigated and many areas that require additional study. Some studies have presented results related to the erosion of electrodes made of Cu, Cu–W, Ti, graphite, stainless steel, etc. There is little information available on the erosion of molybdenum electrodes. The erosion of electrodes is related with the electrode material (conductivity, melting point, and density) and the Coulomb charge transferred per impulse. In this paper, molybdenum (Mo) was selected as the main electrode material, considering these factors in addition to high erosion resistance due to high work function and better formability. The performance of pulse discharge devices is mainly characterized by static breakdown voltage, prebreakdown voltage, recovery time, delay time, jitter, and reliability. The degradation of these performance parameters (PPs) is related to many critical factors affecting electrode erosion, consisting of peak current, electrode material, electrode geometry, electrode surface roughness, and gas type. The degree with which the electrode-erosion factors (EEFs) affect the PPs of the pulse discharge device relatively varies and has complex interrelationships, and the relative importance weight of each EEF in order to maximize the life of the pulse discharging device is calculated using quality function deployment and analytic network process methodology. This paper presents experimental work carried out to investigate the erosion characteristics of a molybdenum electrode. Testing was performed at 10–11-kA current discharge every 35 s at a rate of 300 discharges per day with a total of 10 000 shots. The experimental results for Mo electrodes indicate approximately 60 $\mu \hbox{g/C}$ for 5000-C transfers. For 10–11-kA current transfer with Mo electrodes, we can take about $8.5 \times 10^{5}$ shots with wear of 0.3 g without appreciable local wear."

The purpose of this work is to optimize the processing parameters, such as processing pressure, thickness of Thin Film by varying the flow rate of Argon gas. Depending upon the different parameters the process of fabrication will get diminished.

pub.1121401654,A Structure Data-Driven Framework for Virtual Metrology Modeling,"Virtual metrology (VM) has been widely studied in the semiconductor industry with the purpose of decreasing the cycle time and reducing the expensive metrology measurements. Ideally, a VM model should not only be able to provide accurate predictions but also present an interpretable and rational structure to accommodate fundamental restrictions and relationships that are known to be present in the process. The last aspects have been missing in the VM models proposed hitherto. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel framework by combining in a single VM model the capability to learn from data with the ability to incorporate the domain knowledge on the process. Thus, the new methodology can use the best of both information sources: data and the subject-matter expert (SME) knowledge. The framework consists of two phases. In the first phase, a Gaussian Bayesian network (GBN) is used to extract the implicit relationships between the metrology and production/process variables. In the second phase, the target response variable is defined, the predictors are selected through the associated Markov blanket, and finally, an empirical model is estimated to accurately predict the response. The proposed framework was tested and its effectiveness was confirmed through a real industrial data from a chemical–mechanical polishing (CMP) process in semiconductor fabrication. The physical meaning of the model obtained was also scrutinized by an SME. Note to Practitioners—Unlike the conventional virtual metrology (VM) techniques that model the x–y relationship based only on process data, the proposed method aims at consolidating the process knowledge from experts into an extensive relational structure. Not only the x–y model is inferred but also the relationships among the predictors are revealed. The structure is illustrated in a form of a connected graph so that the correlation between parameters can be expressed explicitly, which is also compatible with the physical laws. With the clear visualization of the correlation structure of variables, the practitioners are able to utilize the result in different applications. The learned structure can be further integrated into the plant advanced process control system, including VM, process monitoring and diagnosis, and run-to-run (R2R) control."

pub.1093548281,The application of a direct parameter extraction strategy to hot-carrier reliability simulation of n-channel LDD MOSFETs,"The application of a direct parameter extraction technique to LDD n-channel MOSFET hot-carrier reliability simulation is presented in this paper. The use of direct extraction procedures allows a very fast extraction of circuit reliability parameters, with a minimum of measurements. This is an important consideration in relation to accelerated hot-carrier reliability testing, since it is highly desirable to minimise the duration of the interruptions to stressing conditions for the measurement of device characteristics. The parameters extracted are physically relevant, which is important when considering the physical nature of the hot-carrier degradation mechanisms. The more common commercial reliability simulators available in the industrial market, such as the BERT reliability simulator, generate predicted parameter sets after selected durations of device operation by extrapolation (or interpolation) between measured parameter sets extracted at intervals during a constant-bias stress. The work we are presenting suggests that confidence in the predicted circuit performance is dependent on very careful choice of both the parameter sets supplied to the reliability simulator, and the applied stressing conditions."
pub.1061535390,Wait-Free Programming for General Purpose Computations on Graphics Processors,"The fact that graphics processors (GPUs) are today’s most powerful computational hardware for the dollar has motivated researchers to utilize the ubiquitous and powerful GPUs for general-purpose computing. However, unlike CPUs, GPUs are optimized for processing 3D graphics (e.g., graphics rendering), a kind of data-parallel applications, and consequently, several GPUs do not support strong synchronization primitives to coordinate their cores. This prevents the GPUs from being deployed more widely for general-purpose computing. This paper aims at bridging the gap between the lack of strong synchronization primitives in the GPUs and the need for strong synchronization mechanisms in parallel applications. Based on the intrinsic features of typical GPU architectures, we construct strong synchronization objects such as wait-free and $t$ -resilient read-modify-write  objects for a general model of GPU architectures without hardware synchronization primitives such as  test-and-set and compare-and-swap. Accesses to the wait-free objects have time complexity $O(N)$ , where $N$  is the number of processes. The wait-free objects have the optimal space complexity $O(N^2)$ . Our result demonstrates that it is possible to construct wait-free synchronization mechanisms for GPUs without strong synchronization primitives in hardware and that wait-free programming is possible for such GPUs."

This encapsulant has been implemented on pin grid array (PGA) ceramic carriers and on peripheral leaded surface mount (SMT) ceramic carriers for IBM's C4 chips. The encapsulant is a UV curable material and is used to cover the thin-film circuitry on the ceramic carrier. The encapsulant offers a low-cost alternative to the metal caps that were used on the pin grid array ceramic carriers or to the ceramic cap that was used on the peripheral leaded surface mount carrier. UV curing was chosen as the preferred curing process in order to improve the manufacturing process flow. The packages used with this encapsulant all employ IBM's C4 chips. The C4 joints to the ceramic carrier are strengthened with a silica-filled epoxy encapsulant. The new UV curable urethane encapsulant is used to protect the remaining exposed circuitry from mechanical and environmental damage. The urethane encapsulant covers everything from the chip edge to the outer edge of the package. The backside of the chip is intentionally left uncovered. When thermal enhancement is needed the heatsink is bonded directly to the chip. Significant improvement in internal thermal resistance is realized with this design.<>

First, the fabrication of needle tips was demonstrated for polymeric microneedles with an outer diameter of 250 $\mu\hbox{m}$, through-hole capillaries of 75-$\mu\hbox{m}$ diameter and a needle shaft length of 430 $\mu\hbox{m}$ by lithographic processing of SU-8 onto simple v-grooves. Second, the technique was extended to gain more freedom in tip shape design, needle shaft length and use of filling materials. A novel combination of silicon dry and wet etching is introduced that allows highly accurate and repetitive lithographic molding of a complex shape. Both techniques consent to the lithographic integration of microfluidic back plates forming a patch-type device. These microneedle-integrated patches offer a feasible solution for medical applications that demand an easy to use Point-of-Care sample collector, for example, in blood diagnostics for lithium therapy. Although microchip capillary electrophoresis glass devices were addressed earlier, here, we show for the first time the complete diagnostic method based on microneedles made from SU-8.$\hfill$[2006-0110]"

The proposed architecture and framework will support the storage of modular, extensible, and reusable Knowledge Base (KB) of process performance models. The approach requires the development of automatic methods that can translate the high-level models in the reusable KB into low-level specialized models required by a variety of underlying analysis tools, including data manipulation, optimization, statistical learning, estimation, and simulation.

A research model is proposed to investigate the connection between technology and market uncertainty, supplier-buyer relationships, supplier integration outcomes, and the role of black-box and grey-box integration. Data from high-tech companies were used to analyze the proposed hypotheses through PLS-SEM. The results reveal technology and market uncertainty are significant to supplier-buyer cooperation. Suppliers and buyers tend to work more intensively when technology and market uncertainty is high. Supplier-buyer relationship impacts supplier involvement outcomes, and this collaboration is more effective when black-box integration form is selected in the product innovation process. This research paper contributes to supplier involvement in product innovation literature by unfolding how firms can integrate suppliers under technology and market uncertainty and black-box and grey-box integration under product innovation projects."

pub.1139321825,Single-objective optimization with gain scheduling control,"This article presents a new method for adjusting the gain-scheduling controller, using the $\nu$-gap metric to reduce the number of gains in the gain-scheduling set and optimizing the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) values through single-objective optimization. For that, an algorithm was created with all the proposed steps, applying to a Peltier cell and comparing the results with two controllers: gain scheduling adjusted by a classical technique and PI controller adjusted with multiobjective optimization presented in [1]. With the reduced set, two new controllers were created: the first one optimizing a controller for each model in the set separately; the second one optimizing a single controller optimizing the whole set. As a result, it is observed that the separately optimized group is able to control almost as well as the gain scheduling adjusted by a classical technique and the PI controller tuning with multiobjective optimization, but both present a great effort in the control action. With a single controller, the response is slower, but the effort of the control action is significantly better."

One promising approach to meet the market demands bases on so called desktop factories. They inherently offer a sustainable and energy efficient solution for the assembly of meso- and micro-sized parts. The realisation of adaptable automation solutions based on desktop factories under the paradigm of Evolvable Production Systems leads to the question of downscaling the implementation following the EPS guidelines. This paper describes some of the requirements and boundary conditions which occur in that process. The obligation to have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of all aspects along the production process is shown.

The series-connected cell concept allows a nearly half-sized DRAM cell even when using the same fabrication process as for conventional DRAMs. The low-noise quasi-folded data-line architecture allows the data-line capacitance to be one eighth the conventional value at the minimum, or the number of cells per amplifier to be 64 times the conventional number at the maximum. In addition, this architecture provides a more relaxed layout for the READ/WRITE circuits. The operation of four series-connected cells is observed successfully through a test device which includes a voltage-to-current conversion circuit, a current-mirror amplifier, and a 0.76- mu m/sup 2/ crown-shaped stack-capacitor (STC) cell.<>"

Such models can be configured to obtain a process variant according to specific requirements. With this aim, several approaches have been proposed for the configuration of process models. Nevertheless, an increasing attention is being paid to achieve this in a sound manner due to the complex inter-dependencies between the configuration decisions. In this work, we aim to guide the process analyst to easily configure process models while preserving soundness. To do so, we propose a formal approach for ensuring correctness of business process configurations while considering structural constraints they have to obey. Specifically, using the Event-B language, we formally define a configurable process model, its correctness-preserving conditions and its configuration constraints."

The main advantage of this processing approach is that it permits fabrication of devices with gate lengths of less than 0.5 mu m using standard optical photolithography without recourse to deep UV or electron-beam lithography. The process is simple and easy to implement in a manufacturing environment. Exceptionally good gate-length control, typically 10% for a 0.4- mu m-long gate, is demonstrated. Yield of a 300- mu m-wide FET, designed for use in a gain block and in a switch, is found to be 89% on average. Data on wafer-to-wafer and on-wafer variations in device DC and RF parameters and equivalent circuit values are presented. Typical standard deviations are in the 5-10% range. This process technology has been used to fabricate a 17.5-GHz, 3-b phase-shift receive monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) of moderately high complexity. Statistics of RF data on 704 such devices, fabricated over a period of two years, are presented.

pub.1167439167,Intelligent Modeling of Temperature Profile for Sustainable Food Waste Composting,"The composting process exhibits dynamic changes in environmental variables due to underlying biological and physiochemical mechanisms, adding complexity to its modeling. This work focuses on developing a mathematical model for food waste composting in forced continuous aeration conditions. The model incorporates substrate degradation with microbial kinetics, heat balance, and mass balance to address the complexity. In this study, we compare the performance of nth order kinetics against first-order kinetics in predicting temperature variations during food waste composting. Additionally, a comparison is made between nth order kinetics and Monod kinetics for forecasting temperature variations in manure waste composting. The six-stage with fifth order ODE solver (ode45) in MATLAB is employed to numerically solve the differential equations and generate temperature profiles. The developed model successfully predicts peak temperature and the time taken to reach it, enabling better temperature control during the thermophilic phase. This control is vital for avoiding excessive temperatures that can inhibit microbial activities. Comparison of experimental and simulation data, using RRMSE and MAE validation, demonstrates good agreement in the performance of the nth order model when utilizing experimental heat of reaction and proposed kinetics. To further enhance the predictive model for composting processes, it is suggested to expand the nth order model to incorporate other factors such as oxygen concentration, pH, and moisture content. This expansion can contribute to improved prediction accuracy and performance. By employing intelligent and resilient digital innovations, this research strives to advance sustainable living practices in the domain of food waste composting."

Experimental data and TCAD simulations showed an improved SET response for the pnp comparator circuit. 2-D raster scans revealed that the devices in the pnp circuit exhibit a reduction in sensitive area of up to 80% compared to their npn counterparts. In addition, by sweeping the input voltage, the sensitive operating region with respect to SETs was determined. By establishing a figure-of-merit, relating the transient peaks and input voltage polarities, the pnp device was determined to have a 21.4% improved response with respect to input voltage. This study has shown that using pnp devices is an effective way to mitigate SETs, and could enable further radiation-hardening-by-design techniques."

We choose Erlang due to the functional high-level programming model and the native support for concurrency and distributed programming. Both are assets when developing applications as well as system-level functionality in our target domain. Our design enriches the Erlang framework with a custom library for programming sensing/actuation distributed systems along with a dedicated run-time support, while we wipe off unnecessary language and run-time features. We couple the resulting platform with adhoc tools for simulation and testing, supporting developers throughout the development cycle. We assess our solution by implementing three sensor network distributed protocols. A comparison with traditional sensor network programming platforms demonstrates the advantages in terms of terseness of code, readability, and maintainability."

The wafer alignment is one of theimportant elements that impact overlay accuracy. In this paper, an evaluation of alignment performance was performed using various alignment marks placed in the scribe-lineof short-loop wafers used for SilTerra 130nm process. The alignment capability and overlay performance were studied for Trench 1 aligns to Contact and Vial aligns to Trench 1, which follows layer-to-layer alignment scheme. A Design of Experiment was conducted with splits in interlayer dielectric (ILD) thickness, tungsten and copper CMP polishing time, in order to evaluate the process sensitivity of multiple alignment marks. Two different types of alignment marks were evaluated. There are Scribe-line Primary Marks (SPM) and Versatile Scribe-line Primary Mark (VSPM). To implement this experiment, exposures were performed using a scanner with various marks and recipes. Then, overlay measurement was conducted on an off-line overlay metrology tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the alignment performance. Data taken by scanner and off-line overlay metrology tool were analysed. The comparison was done between different mark types in an attempt to find out the robust alignment strategy (marktype/color/order) covering all process variation. The results show that, all alignment marks demonstrate low sensitivity to process variation where as there are no wafers were rejected due to alignment error. Besides that, the number of gratings in mark's subdivision for SPM and VSPM affect the signal strength."
pub.1101301930,D3L-Based Service Runtime Self-Adaptation Using Replanning,"For business processes based on micro service architecture in an enterprise, failures often occur because of modified business rules or goals, change of service availability, and dynamical running environment. Based on dynamical replanning technologies, these failures can be repaired at runtime. However, semantic conflicts among services from different providers can greatly decrease response efficiency and response success rate of a business goal. In this paper, we propose a novel service runtime self-adaptation framework to decrease response time and raise success rate. Distributed dynamic description logic is utilized to eliminate semantic conflicts among services and provide basic models for carrying out planning among services. Considering inputs, outputs, preconditions, and effects properties of services, local and global planning algorithms based on artificial intelligence graph planning are designed. Local planning can rapidly search a service-based path only including services from a provider, and global planning can try to explore a path including services from multiple providers. Based on these two algorithms, local and global replanning strategies are designed to handle runtime exceptions at service level and path level. We implement a prototype system by means of workflow engine Activiti and business process language BPMN2.0. Experiments show that compared with previous works, our framework can guarantee higher efficiency and success rate."

The microphone is fabricated on a single wafer by use of silicon anisotropic etching and sacrificial layer etching techniques, so that no bonding techniques are required. The introduction of corrugations has greatly increased the mechanical sensitivities of the microphone diaphragms due to the reduction of the initial stress in the thin films, For the purpose of further decreasing the thin film stress, composite diaphragms consisting of multilayer (polySi/Si/sub x/N/sub y//polySi) materials have been fabricated, reducing the initial stress to a much lower level of about 70 MPa in tension. Three types of corrugation placements and several corrugation depths in a diaphragm area of 1 mm/sup 2/ have been designed and fabricated. Microphones with flat frequency response between 100 Hz and 8/spl sim/16 kHz and open-circuit sensitivities as high as 8.1/spl sim/14.2 mV/Pa under the bias voltages of 10/spl sim/25 V have been fabricated in a reproducible way.

pub.1094266271,High Productivity Thermocompression Flip Chip Bonding,"Thermocompression (TC) bonding is seen as the next-generation packaging technology that will enable faster and more energy efficient devices in the face of slowing cost-performance gains achievable by advancing wafer fabrication technology. TC bonding will enable higher I/O counts and finer pitch interconnections than traditional interconnect methods through better control of the stress and warpage between devices and the substrate. In combination with through-silicon-vias (TSVs), TC bonding allows advanced memory stacks, such as the Hybrid Memory Cube and Wide-I/O memory. Despite the tremendous technical and quality advantages of TC bonding, adoption has been limited by the relatively low throughput of the first generation thermocompression bonders. In this paper we describe bonding results obtained with an innovative TC bonder that is specifically designed for achieving high throughput with excellent bonding quality. High-throughput processes capable of achieving greater than 1000 units per hour using both pre-applied underfill as well as dip fluxing of the die are shown. The heart of this bonder is a uniquely designed bond head with heating and cooling capabilities of 200°C/sec and greater than 100°C/sec, respectively. Excellent bonding is achieved because the temperature uniformity of the heater surface is maintained to better than ±3°C during the entire temperature cycle. In addition, the Z position of the bond tool is maintained with micron-level accuracy during the temperature profile. Finally, a set of metrology and process monitoring tools directly incorporated into the bonder allow in-line verification that the desired process is being maintained. These tools include inspection for damaged die after pick, post-bond placement accuracy verification, checks for tool contamination by underfills and in-line measurement of dispense volume."
pub.1061206086,Methods for measurement of development parameters in the manufacturing line for use in photolithography modeling,"One of the outstanding problems of photolithography is the measurement of development parameters, particularly in one's own manufacturing line. We present an inexpensive practical method for obtaining values of development parameters for use in photolithography modeling. The method utilizes the actual production equipment used in the fab, as well as the computer modeling package for which the development parameters are being collected. In addressing experimental geometries with which one may carry out such data collection, we discuss the critical issue of standing waves and their impact on measurement accuracy. Two techniques are presented for solving the problem of standing waves and their extreme impact on the quality of collected data. One involves creating a photoactive component latent image in which there are no standing waves. The other is a means by which development parameters may still be obtained for situations such as photolithography of thin film magnetic recording heads, where the standing waves may not necessarily be deconvolved from the development process or data collection. Development parameters using 1.15 /spl mu/m of AZ 4110 resist on a NiFe substrate were measured using the latter technique."
pub.1129392913,Verification of Data-Value-Aware Processes and a Case Study on Spectrum Auctions,"Verification techniques are fundamental to improve the reliability of process designs in practice. In application domains like auctions, the issue is extremely valuable; the goal of auction designers is to prevent undesirable executions and maximize certain outcome measures. Current verification approaches tend to be confined to control flows, even though data values play a significant role. We address this issue by proposing a new data-value-aware verification approach: We enhance process models with information on data values. Then we transform the data-value-aware process models to Petri Nets, respecting the semantics of data value usages. By employing an off-the-shelf model checker and specifying data-value centered properties, one can now verify data-value-aware process models. A distinctive feature of our approach is the specification of data values and of their modifications during the process. This enables the verification of interesting properties in many domains. We evaluate our approach against the use case of Simultaneous Multi-Round (SMR) spectrum auctions. We verify SMR auction models and compute extreme values of common auction measures such as revenue."

Self contained clocking with metal-finger flying capacitors enable embedding voltage boost functionality in close proximity to digital logic for supplying low current Vmin requirement of state elements in logic blocks. Multi-phase operation with phase separation of the order of buffer delays avoids the need for a large storage reservoir capacitor. Special configuration of the pump stages to work in parallel enables a fast (5 ns) output transition from disable to enable state.

The objective of the committee is to develop standardized whisker testing methods to provide to the electronics industry for characterizing and qualifying tin-based finishes. The team completed two evaluation phases and has identified three test methods effective in inducing whisker growth, two isothermal storage methods and one temperature cycle method. A Phase 3 evaluation was initiated in mid 2003 to confirm the consistency of these testing methods, determine effectiveness for different Sn-based finishes, and possibly define test end points by determining the longest duration for whisker growth saturation for different Sn-based finishes. Results thus far confirm that temperature cycling and 60C/93 RH isothermal storage are effective in producing whiskers. An additional evaluation, Phase 4, has been initiated to look at the effect of electrical bias on accelerating whisker growth. A Phase 5 Evaluation is in the design stage. The objectives of the Phase 5 Evaluation are still being discussed. A brief review of the Phase 1 and 2 Evaluations results which led to NEMI's test method recommendations will be provided.

Activities such as business knowledge acquisition, business process modeling, performance, quality and impact analysis can all be done more effectively if supported by proper tools. In this paper, we describe a design scenario for business understanding and re-engineering tools that is based on the systematic modeling of business knowledge. The business knowledge model forms a conceptual schema for the tool repository. We start by building a generic business model. As both the model and required tool characteristics vary from company to company and from one business re-engineering project to another, we customize the generic model and tools to reflect needs of a given company and a business re-engineering project in hand. We achieve a required level of tool flexibility by applying meta-CASE techniques. The physical repository schema and tools themselves are automatically generated from the customized business model specifications. In this paper, we focus on tools and analysis methods that have not been extensively described in other sources. We describe an interview assistant tool, support for impact analysis, and an end-user query language in which a user can define new business analysis methods that are not supported by a generic tool environment."

Chip on Chip on Substrate packaging methodology was demonstrated for handling active Si interposer die as thin as 40 $\mu \text{m}$ . Different packaging approaches were evaluated and the results are benchmarked. In addition, active Si interposer concept is introduced to provide Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) and Power Management Unit (PMU) functions to support high-performance logic. Furthermore, benefits of active Si approach such as system scaling and cost-effectiveness have been demonstrated. “Via Last” TSV approach is used for the fabrication of 130 nm tech node active Si interposer. It was confirmed that appropriate selection of temporary bonding material plays a critical role in device wafer warpages in via last TSV process flow. Functionality checks were carried out on all samples subjected to pre- and post-reliability assessments, which include thermal cycling (TC), moisture sensitivity tests (MSL) and highly accelerated stress tests (HAST). All samples were found to be functional with no deterioration in performance despite being subjected to reliability tests and high-voltage stress tests."
pub.1093689325,Improving Coverage Based Test Purposes,"Test purposes have been presented as a solution to avoid the state space explosion when selecting test cases from formal models. We previously presented a technique that assists a test engineer with test purpose design: It allows automatic generation of coverage based test suites and can be used to automatically exercise those aspects of the system that manually designed test purposes missed. Although the generated test purposes allow for coverage based testing, they did not comprise refuse states. Refuse states in test purposes restrict the state space that needs to be considered during test case generation. In this paper, we present an approach that leads to test purposes with refuse states, thus speeding up the test case generation. Furthermore, our new approach allows one to generate test cases for coverage items where our previous approach failed. We consider coverage of LOTOS specifications, and show how data flow graphs help to improve coverage based test purposes. We then show how existing tools can be used to efficiently derive test cases and present first experimental results."
pub.1061106170,Software development on Internet time,"There is probably little debate that Internet software companies must use more flexible development techniques and introduce new products faster than companies with more stable technology, established customer needs, and longer product cycles. Internet and PC software firms favor a more flexible style. The basic idea is to give programmers the autonomy to evolve designs iteratively but to force team members to synchronize their work frequently and then periodically stabilize their design changes or feature innovations. Studying two companies, the authors found that Netscape was using a version of the Microsoft-style synchronize and stabilize process for PC software, but adapting it to build Internet browser and server products. They also found that Microsoft's Internet groups were modifying their standard process to increase development speed and flexibility. The goal was to balance flexibility and speed with professional engineering discipline."

However, certain applications, such as memory stacking, demand specific low-thermal budget processing. Although new dielectrics like SiCN are promising for reducing the thermal budget of dielectric-to-dielectric bonding interfaces, the formation of metal/Cu-Cu interconnects requires a higher thermal budget. Consequently, the overall thermal budget for Cu/dielectric hybrid bonding exceeds 350 °C. This paper aims to achieve Cu/dielectric bonding at a lower thermal budget of ⩽ 250 °C. This goal is accomplished by modifying the Cu microstructure through grain size variation employing the modifications into the conventional damascene process flow or with a combination of both. Systematic investigations in Cu dishing, by comparing the proposed methods to the conventional damascene flow reveal no variations with the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process. Furthermore, grain modifications with high <111> oriented Cu were investigated by altering the plating parameters without special chemistry or by using an alternate deposition method. The scanning electron microscopy-electron backscatter diffraction (SEM-EBSD) is utilized for understanding the Cu microstructure modifications. Interface characterization demonstrates significant enhancement in bonding interface grain growth with our proposed methods, leading to low thermal budget Cu/dielectric hybrid bonding."

pub.1061321459,MEMS Motion Sensors Based on the Variations of the Fringe Capacitances,"In this paper, a MEMS motion sensor is described which uses fringe field capacitances as sensing elements. Each capacitance basic cell is formed using thin strips of standard electrical paths, running side by side, and close one another in a plane parallel to the substrate: in this way, the capacitance between the paths is mainly formed by the fringe field streamlines. A grounded seismic mass, suspended in the air volume where the electric fringe field streamlines are concentrated, determines changes in the capacitance value when subject to an external force that makes it move. With respect to parallel plates capacitive sensors, this implementation has the advantage to be more immune from the pull-in instability. A test device is built using an industrial surface micromachining process. The experimental results show a sensitivity close to 1 fF of capacitance variation per unit of earth acceleration for a device taking up an area of (430 μm)2.

Among different inter-chip interconnect approaches reported [1]-[9], a fan-out technology with RDL could be the simplest integration approach. RDL scaling capability has been severe challenge. InFO_UHD technology [1] has been proposed to provide submicron pitch inter-chip RDL. InFO_UHD applications to high performance computing is discussed in the first part of this paper.

For efficient optical coupling and a relaxed alignment tolerance, the mode field on both the InP-SOAs and the Si waveguides was expanded by spot-size converters (SSCs). On the InP-SOAs, width-tapered SSCs were used to obtain an isotropic mode-field having an approximately a 3-m diameter. On the silicon photonics platform, dual-core SSCs were used to expand the same mode-field size of 3m as for the SSCs on SOAs. Using the FCB technology and the SSCs, an in-line optical amplification of 15dB was achieved by in-line integrated SOAs with angled waveguides. The optical coupling losses were 7.7dB, which included 5.1-dB excess losses by misalignment and a gap between InP-SOA and Si waveguides.

These small high-speed devices are vital for routing and conveying signals in such uses. The important characteristics of pHEMTs, besides their small size, are their high-frequency capability, insertion loss, isolation, power handling, switching speed, and linearity. A topology using a pair of simple but modified series and shunt elements was designed to improve upon the linearity of an RF switch. Each element of the switch was composed of a single, unbiased, but relatively long pHEMT, which was designed for the test. By shifting the position of the gate asymmetrically toward the source terminal in these transistors, it was found that the linearity was improved without cost to other performance parameters."

pub.1061296097,The HIMOS flash technology: the alternative solution for low-cost embedded memory,"The high-injection MOS (HIMOS) technology was initially developed as an application-specific memory technology, i.e., a nonvolatile block-erasable (Flash-type) memory for embedded applications. The label ""embedded"" points out that cost was considered to be the prime issue. Because of this, processing complexity and voltage reduction have been the major driving forces in the cell and process development rather than mere cell size scaling. Indeed, what really counts in embedded applications is the chip area per megabit rather than the cell size itself. Because the substantially high operating voltages of floating-gate-based memories are not being scaled, the peripheral area becomes the main bottleneck for most embedded applications. Also, cost has to be viewed in terms of masking steps and complexity or marginality of processing in general, especially in the case of embedded Flash, since the envisaged products have to be incorporated in a conventional CMOS line. To achieve this goal, a split-gate approach was adopted, which, combined with an additional program gate (PG), leads to maximized hot-electron efficiency at low voltages. As an additional major advantage, this PG allows the use of an electrically erasable programmable ROM-like threshold voltage window. This implies that the high threshold needs to be only slightly positive, while the low one could be strongly negative. Such a scheme allows very low excess charge levels (especially in the more critical off state), which greatly improves device reliability, while allowing further scaling of the tunnel oxide as compared with other Flash concepts. This allows further reduction of the program/erase voltages. Also, such a window provides a larger read current, which removes the necessity for wordline boosting during readout and therefore improves access time."

In this paper, a polymer-based fabrication process using UV lithography into micromolds is developed, allowing the fabrication of microneedle (MN) shafts, tips, lumens, and substrate baseplate using lithography. Using UV lithography into micromolds allows complex three-dimensional structures to be defined, since both mask patterns and mold topography are available to define the structures.

However, BPM users have problems dealing with the complexity of such models. Therefore, the challenge is to improve the comprehension of process models. While a substantial amount of literature is devoted to this topic, there is no overview of the various mechanisms that exist to deal with managing complexity in (large) process models. As a result, it is hard to obtain an insight into the degree of support offered for complexity reducing mechanisms by state-of-the-art languages and tools. This paper focuses on complexity reduction mechanisms that affect the abstract syntax of a process model, i.e., the formal structure of process model elements and their interrelationships. These mechanisms are captured as patterns so that they can be described in their most general form, in a language- and tool-independent manner. The paper concludes with a comparative overview of the degree of support for these patterns offered by state-of-the-art languages and tools, and with an evaluation of the patterns from a usability perspective, as perceived by BPM practitioners."

pub.1169679071,PointGT: A Method for Point-Cloud Classification and Segmentation Based on Local Geometric Transformation,"Recently, three-dimensional (3D) point-cloud analysis has been extensively utilized in the domain of machine vision, encompassing tasks include shape classification and segmentation. However the inherent disorder in point clouds poses a challenge in capturing relationships among points, particularly when dealing with mutilated and occluded data. To this end, We propose the Point Geometry Transformation (PointGT) method for 3D point-cloud classification and part segmentation, by exploring the underlying geometric structure in the local and global of points. Specifically, the efficacy of PointGT arises from the integration of a local abstraction (LA) module and an optimization strategy. The LA module is tailored to address the localized features inherent to point clouds. This module encapsulates the multidimensional attributes of local edge and inside points. The bi-directional cross-attention mechanism amalgamates these two constituents into the native channel with the primary objective of optimizing the exploitation of edge and inside delineations, thereby judiciously mitigating noise artifacts. Ultimately, the channel residual connections disseminate the post-downsampling point attributes, thereby inheriting the edge and inside delineations gleaned via post bi-directional attention. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through the validation of point-cloud classification and segmentation datasets. The empirical findings confirmed the efficacy of PointGT; accuracies of 93.2 and 87.8 were achieved for the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets, respectively."

pub.1153659399,High-Level Event Mining: A Framework,"Process mining methods often analyze processes in terms of the individual end-to-end process runs. Process behavior, however, may materialize as a general state of many involved process components, which can not be captured by looking at the individual process instances. A more holistic state of the process can be determined by looking at the events that occur close in time and share common process capacities. In this work, we conceptualize such behavior using high-level events and propose a new framework for detecting and logging such high-level events. The output of our method is a new high-level event log, which collects all generated high-level events together with the newly assigned event attributes: activity, case, and timestamp. Existing process mining techniques can then be applied on the produced high-level event log to obtain further insights. Experiments on both simulated and real-life event data show that our method is able to automatically discover how system-level patterns such as high traffic and workload emerge, propagate and dissolve throughout the process."

The critical issues related to photresist burning/deforming, resist removal, selectivity, mesa edge roughening, and nonuniform etching of GaN and AlGaN layers are discussed in detail using plasma of $\hbox{BCl}_{3}/ \hbox{Cl}_{2}$ gases. The effect of ICP process parameters like ICP power, RF power, pressure, and $\hbox{BCl}_{3}/\hbox{Cl}_{2}$ flow rate ratio on etch rate of GaN/AlGaN layers and mask is studied systematically for the optimization of a HEMT mesa etching process that results in smooth etched surface with sharp and highly anisotropic mesa edges. The photoresist mask selectivity is found to depend strongly on pressure and RF power, whereas the etched surface morphology changes significantly with the gas flow rate ratio and chamber pressure. The AlGaN etch rate and selectivity with respect to GaN is also characterized for different Al concentrations varying up to 33%. The etch process is finally applied to GaN/AlGaN HEMT mesa etching, where the mesa features with depth of $\sim\! 1500\ \hbox{A}^{\circ}$ are etched successfully. The resultant process etch uniformity is found to be better than 5% over 2-in wafer."
pub.1061164953,A 1.5-V full-swing BiCMOS logic circuit,"A BiCMOS logic circuit applicable to sub-2-V digital circuits has been developed. A transiently saturated full-swing BiCMOS (TS-FS-BiCMOS) logic circuit operates twice as fast as CMOS at 1.5-V supply. A newly developed transient-saturation technique, with which bipolar transistors saturate only during switching periods, is the key to sub-2-V operation because a high-speed full-swing operation is achieved to remove the voltage loss due to the base-emitter turn-on voltage. Both small load dependence and small fan-in dependence of gate delay time are attained with this technique. A two-input gate fabricated with 0.3- mu m BiCMOS technology verifies the performance advantage of TS-FS-BiCMOS over other BiCMOS circuits and CMOS at sub 2-V supply.<>"

Up to now, vehicles could be considered as closed systems while in future they have to be seen as components of an open system with ad hoc interfaces. Since ITS influence the series development and production of single vehicles, standards and procedures of process quality, systems engineering and functional safety apply for this higher level as well. The paper discusses the impact of those standards to the design of ITS and the role of model-based software and service oriented architectures (SOA) as means for process quality and functional safety assurance.

We explore the limitations of current GaN processes at the process, circuit, and system levels, and present some potential developments to mitigate these limitations. The most recent progresses in GaN circuits has been inspired by the quest for higher performance, which has influenced innovations in circuit and system architectures. A promising solution is to pursue a functionality-oriented design paradigm in parallel with the traditional performance-oriented design approach. A review of state-of-the-art GaN transceivers indicates that most comprise merely a power amplifier (PA), a low-noise amplifier (LNA), and transmit-receive (T/R) switches. We propose three disruptive directions that potentially can reshape the future of highly integrated GaN systems, including a digital PA, an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transceiver, and GaN-CMOS chiplets in package, and investigate their prospects and challenges."

Our goals are the following: 1) to find out what happens to these resistors under accelerated stress and define “failure;” 2) to compare results between “equivalent” resistor films that are independently developed in two of our internal fabs; and 3) to generate better reliability-based design rules as a function of current density, temperature, and resistor geometry. We have characterized the changes in resistance and temperature coefficient of resistivity as a result of accelerated to highly accelerated test conditions, using thermal and constant-current stresses, and determined activation energies for some of these changes. We have found that we can produce resistance increases and resistance decreases, depending on resistor process and stress levels, with an activation energy of about 1 eV for resistance increase for one of the resistor process types at one fabrication site and an activation energy of about 3 eV for the resistance decrease for the other three process type and fabrication-site combinations."
pub.1094452657,ANGEL: Optimal Configuration for High Available Service Composition,"With the fast development of Internet and rapid acceptance of Web Service technology, more and more service resources have emerged. Service composition which integrates the functionalities of different services is a promising technique for developing applications across multiple organizations. However, in a distributed, dynamic and autonomous environment, such as a service composition-based system, the availability and reliability are big concerns in terms of nonfunctional properties. In this paper, we propose a novel service composition method, ANGEL, with the target of the improvement of system availability. We adopt redundant mechanism in ANGEL and propose a model to improve the property of the service availability. We model the multiple services selection problem based on redundant mechanism as a nonlinear mixed integer programming problem and therefore, we propose two heuristic algorithms to select multiple feasible services that have the same functions, but with better availability. In order to maintain the availability of composite services, we further introduce monitor and detection mechanisms. Through the comprehensive experiments, we find that our proposed techniques can indeed achieve better availability as expected."

System development is seldom a linear progression from well-defined, fully-specified requirements to finished products that fully meet the initial requirements. More likely, there are ongoing cycles of exploration, design and implementation, taking into account evolving needs and capabilities, as well as lessons from earlier cycles. Existing requirements modeling and analysis techniques largely presume application settings that are stable and predictable. Can these techniques be used to support analysis in the new dynamic environment? Scenarios from the recent surge in demand for business intelligence capabilities in enterprises provide an interesting setting for examining organizational and IT responses to the challenges of high uncertainty and rapid change. In this paper, we apply existing requirements modeling techniques to these scenarios in order to uncover their inadequacies, and to identify research challenges."

However, ensuring reliability and repeatability is challenging due to the complex physics and various sources of uncertainty in the process. In this work, we investigate closed-loop control of the melt pool dimensions in a 2-D laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. We propose a trajectory optimization-based layer-to-layer (L2L) controller based on a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model that adjusts the laser power input to the next layer to track a desired melt pool depth and validate our controller by placing it in closed-loop high-fidelity multilayer smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulator of the 2-D LPBF process. Detailed numerical case studies demonstrate successful regulation of the melt pool depth on brick and overhang geometries and provide first of its kind results on the effectiveness of L2L input optimization for the LPBF process as well as detailed insight into the physics of the controlled process. Computational complexity and process performance results illustrate the method’s effectiveness and provide an outlook for its implementation onto real systems."
pub.1101339958,Domain-Specific Language Facilitates Scheduling in Model Checking,"A concurrent system consists of multiple processes that are run simultaneously. The execution orders of these processes are defined by a scheduler. In model checking techniques, the scheduling policy is closely related to a search algorithm that explores all of system states. To ensure the correctness of the system, the scheduling policy needs to be taken into account during the verification. Current approaches, which use fixed strategies, are only capable of limited kinds of policies and are difficult to extend to handle the variations of the schedulers. To address these problems, we propose a method using a domain-specific language (DSL) for the succinct specification of different scheduling policies. Necessary artifacts are automatically generated from the specification of the policy to analyze the system. We also propose a search algorithm for exploring the system states. Based on this method, we develop a tool to verify the system with different scheduling policies. Our experiments show that we could serve the variations of the schedulers easily and verify systems accurately."

The submicrometer SIC is designed and fabricated in CMOS 180-nm technology and consumes a maximum of 122 μW, including a decoder and voltage follower. The SIC achieves a measurement accuracy of 1.4% over a 2.5 kΩ to 25 MΩ dynamic range of sensor resistance. A critical issue associated with a submicrometer integrated circuit implementation is satisfactory performance of the SIC for fabrication process variations that range from the slow, to typical, to fast process corners and simultaneously meeting the requirement for the very large dynamic range for sensor resistances. A robust design considering the full range of potential process variations becomes more critical as feature size is reduced. The SIC design includes an added degree for freedom for counteracting process variations during post fabrication calibration. In addition, a new design procedure is outlined and implemented to permit an accurate and efficient first order design to ensure satisfactory performance for typical, fast, and slow model parameters. The first order design is verified by complete model simulation performance, and finally selected measured results are included for a fabricated circuit."

We report, for the first time, +65% low-field hole mobility enhancement in narrow-width (0.29-$\mu\hbox{m}$ effective width $W_{\rm eff}$) versus large-width (10- $\mu\hbox{m}\ W_{\rm eff}$) GeOI mesa-isolated devices. The observed enhancement, which is independent of the device length down to 90 nm, is attributed to improved sidewall transport properties resulting in higher hole mobility on the sides than on the top of the devices. At high inversion charge density $N_{\rm inv}\!\sim\!\hbox{10}^{13}\ \hbox{cm}^{-2}$, +55% hole effective mobility improvement is preserved.

pub.1061792197,Enabling Scatterometry as an In-Line Measurement Technique for 32 nm BEOL Application,"Conventional metrology tools are unable to precisely monitor some interconnect attributes such as trench sidewall angle either due to limited capability or excessive cycle time. But these attributes have great impact on interconnect performance for 32 nm technology node and beyond. Scatterometry, a non-destructive metrology technique, is proposed to address the shortcomings of current metrology tools while also potentially providing additional measurement capabilities that enable more comprehensive characterization of interconnect attributes. Enabling scatterometry for back-end-of-line metrology at 32 nm technology node is challenged by the inherent complexity of a multilayer film structure. The research reported describes the implementation of scatterometry measurements to explore the advantages of this technique for the 32 nm technology node. The results obtained demonstrate the superiority of scatterometry techniques over conventional semiconductor metrology tools such as throughput, process control capability, precision, and accuracy. The total measurement uncertainty of scatterometry results with tunneling electron microscope and cross-sectional scanning electron microscope results for line height shows 1.92 and 6.46 nm, respectively, which compare favorably to the reference metrology tools. Scatterometry techniques also exhibited impressive potential to estimate end-of-the-line electrical parametric data. Finally, physical dimensions obtained from scatterometry measurements are shown to be comparable to TEM results from product wafers."

pub.1149159523,Recent Research and Applications in Variational Autoencoders for Industrial Prognosis and Health Management: A Survey,"Whether in the industrial, medical, or real-world domains, more and more data are being collected. The common particularity of all these application domains is that a great part of this data is mostly unlabeled. Thus, designing a learning model with a minimum of labeled data represents a major challenge in the coming years. A particular emphasis has recently been put on unsupervised learning methods based on the idea of autoencoding. The objective of these methods is twofold: to reduce the dimensionality of the input space and to reconstruct the original observation from this lower dimensional representation space. The variational form of these autoencoders, called the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), is particularly successful in almost all application areas. This enthusiasm comes from the fact that VAEs allow to take advantage of the theoretical foundations of the Variational Bayesian methods and the learning capabilities of artificial neural networks. This review paper gives to the PHM community a synthesis of the latest publications in the PHM domain using the VAEs related to four topics: 1) Data-Driven Soft Sensors for missing values and data outliers, 2) reconstruction error for fault detection, 3) resampling approach for imbalanced data generation and minority class and 4) the variational embedding as PHM preprocessing pipelines and data transformations. After a review of the theoretical foundations and some practical tricks to succeed the implementation of the VAEs in industrial applications, the four main topics used to exploit the VAEs in the PHM domain are detailed.

We propose to enrich software's component design by accountability clauses using an abstract accountability language (AAL). We also define conditions for the well-formedness of an accountable component design and show how they can be checked using a model-checking tool."

pub.1135689811,Enhancement of Contour Smoothness by Substitution of Interpolated Sub-Pixel Points for Edge Pixels,"This study designed a sub-pixel precision edge detecting algorithm to enhance contour smoothness. First, the coordinate value of RGB pixel is projected on the space line of R=G=B to obtain gray image. Then, pixel edges are located using a Canny detector. Next, the edge width is thinned to a single pixel using a morphological thinning operation. Finally, sub-pixel-level smooth contours are extracted by interpolation. In this sub-pixel level contour extraction process, a Single-Pixel-Multi-Point interpolation method was developed to enhance edge smoothness and obtain high precision in edge estimation. This method divides edges in a $3\times 3$ pixels block into nine arrangement modes. According to the arrangement of the eight neighborhoods of a centered edge pixel, different locations of interpolated sub-pixel points are calculated by interpolation with Bezier curves. For symmetrically arranged linear edge pixels, this method can be used to determine the exact contour. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can improve the smoothness of image edge contour. As the curvature of the edge increases, the maximum systematic error will increase. For the edge pixel centered in the $3\times 3$ pixels block and two pixels located at the corner of one side, the max systematic error is 0.5 pixel. For two edge pixels aligned in a single row or column with one located at a corner, the max systematic error is 0.25 pixel."
pub.1061463677,On the optimization of VLSI contacts,"The contact-resistance characteristic of silicon devices has been a subject of research and development since the early days of silicon integrated-circuit technology. The contact-chain losses suffered by very large scale integration (VLSI), however, have made the minimization of contact resistance a critical parameter due to the large number of contacts per circuit and due to the increase of contact resistance with decreasing contact size. This paper will present a brief review of the theory of contact resistance, the literature, measurement techniques, and of the transmission-line model (TLM) for analyzing contact-resistance data. Contact-resistance data pertaining to shallow high-conductivity contacts for VLSI will be presented as a function of the junction parameters (implant dose, etc.) and of the contact area for BF2and arsenic implants with aluminum-silicon metallization. Contact-resistance data for a sputtered molybdenum silicide contact barrier for boron and arsenic implants versus contact area will also be presented and compared to the aluminum-silicon control samples with a discussion regarding the uniformity of contacts to silicon."

The simulation results predict that the nonself-aligned bottom-gate MOS transistor cannot be scaled into the deep submicron regions. A simple fully self-aligned bottom-gate (FSABG) metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) technology is then proposed and developed. A new technique for forming thermal oxide on poly-Si serving as the bottom-gate dielectric is also investigated. It is found that the quality of the oxide on the poly-Si recrystallized by the metal induced uni-lateral crystallization (MIUC) is much higher than that by the solid phase crystallization (SPC). Deep submicron fully self-aligned bottom-gate pMOS transistors are fabricated successfully using the proposed technology. The experimentally measured results indicate the device performances depend strongly on the channel-width, and get comparable to that of a single crystal MOSFET if the channel width is less than 0.5$\mu{\hbox{m}}$. The effects of the channel width on the device performances are discussed. In addition, the experimental results also confirm that the proposed technology has a good control of the channel film thickness."
pub.1061443214,Stochastic realization of Gaussian processes,"A Gaussian stochastic process (yt) with known covariance kernel is given: we investigate the generation of (yt) by means of Markovian schemes of the type dxt= F(t)xtdt + dwtyt= H(t)xt. Such a generation of (yt) as the ""output of a linear dynamical system driven by white noise"" is possible under certain finiteness conditions. In fact, this was shown by Kalman in 1965. We emphasize the probabilistic aspects and obtain an intrinsic characterization of the state of the process as the state of an externally described stochastic I/O map. Realizations of (yt) can be constructed with respect to any increasing family of ω-fields; in particular, when the family of ω-fields is induced by the process itself, the driving white noise reduces to the innovation process of (yt). The corresponding realization has been referred to as the ""innovation representation"" of (yt)."
pub.1061298011,Perspectives on Energy Storage for Flexible Electronic Systems,"If truly thin embedded and human worn flexible electronics are to become a commercial reality for wearable electronics, medical devices, and internet of things tags, effective energy storage technologies that safely and robustly match the mechanical flexibility of the overall system form factor are required. At the same time, the energy and transient power needs of functions such as wireless connectivity, information display, and high sample rate sensing must be supported. These capabilities have time-dependent power and current requirements often not captured in simple energy and capacity metrics. In this paper, a progression of energy storage approaches, challenges and learning experiences will be presented from the perspective of an energy storage technology developer. The essential requirements for energy storage for feature-driven applications in flexible electronics are addressed with the goal of finding the most compelling fit between products needs, consumer safety and the technology capabilities of different energy storage approaches. Micropower modules from supercapacitors to microbatteries and their limitations for flexible electronics will be discussed in terms of capacity, power and charge retention as the starting point. Following this discussion, limitations of lithium technologies in this flexible and thin (<; 1 mm) application space are also outlined. This paper then presents a review of key requirements for energy storage for high functionality flexible electronics prototype systems and some approaches that have been explored to meet those needs. This leads to the conclusion that safe, low cost, flexible electronics energy storage requirements may be most appropriately met using intrinsically stable battery chemistry. Furthermore, such a materials approach allows for simpler lower cost processing and packaging, such as additive printing and roll to roll processing of thin and therefore more mechanically flexible cells. Examples and performance data from such a zinc polymer battery technology are given and compared to other thin and flexible battery approaches."

In the next two to three years, the I/O pitch will fall within 100 $\mu{\rm m}$ for area array die and 30 $\mu{\rm m}$ for periphery die. That raises an important question to the packaging industry: How will the rapid shrinkage of the I/O pitch affect the package substrate for chip attaching? The answer is sub-10 micron copper line technology.

pub.1148581164,Checking Missing-Data Errors in Cyber-Physical Systems Based on the Merged Process of Petri Nets,"Missing-data errors easily occur in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Although many business process modeling notation (BPMN)-based methods are proposed to model CPSs and detect errors, it is hard to automatically verify their correctness, especially in the data flows, due to their lack of formal specifications. By comparison, Petri nets, as a formal method, are widely used to detect data-flow errors. However, these methods easily suffer from the state-space explosion problem. This is mainly because their reachability graphs or state transition graphs are based on the interleaving semantics. As an unfolding technique of Petri net, a merged process can characterize concurrency relations and alleviate this problem. Thus, we utilize the merged process of Petri net with data (PD-net) to check the missing-data errors of the CPS. We first transform a BPMN of the CPS into a PD-net and generate its merged process. Meanwhile, we analyze its structural behaviors and data-adjacent events. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for checking missing-data errors. In addition, a case study and some experiments are done to show the practicality and effectiveness of our method."
pub.1127797748,Tradeoffs Between RF Performance and SET Robustness in Low-Noise Amplifiers in a Complementary SiGe BiCMOS Platform,"Low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) are necessary components for any communications system. Single-event transients (SETs) induced by energetic particles in space can corrupt the data in an RF receiver. Using p-n-p silicon–germanium (SiGe) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), instead of their more common n-p-n counterparts, has been shown to be an effective mitigation technique in digital, analog, and RF circuits. Since p-n-p SiGe HBTs tend to have lower performance than n-p-n SiGe HBTs, in this article, the tradeoffs between performance and SET robustness have been evaluated through the use of simulations. Two LNAs were designed using an algorithmic design technique: one using only n-p-n SiGe HBTs, and the other using only p-n-p devices. The n-p-n LNA had higher peak gain and lower noise figure at the center frequency of 5 GHz when compared to the p-n-p LNA, by 3.2 and 0.4 dB, respectively. However, the n-p-n LNA also produced transients with amplitudes larger than the p-n-p LNA across all simulated linear energy transfers. Although the p-n-p LNA has lower overall performance, it is also more robust to SETs. Thus, the choice between using n-p-n and p-n-p SiGe HBTs for an RF design will depend on application requirements."

The performance of these sensors up to an elevated temperature of 200°C and pressure of 140 bar was investigated by measuring the variation of sensitivity, offset voltage and hysteresis. At room temperature, the diffused piezoresistor based pressure sensor demonstrated sensitivity of 0.147 mV/V/bar and it was observed to operate up to the maximum temperature of 100 °C. The oxide isolated single crystal silicon piezoresistor and polysilicon piezoresistor based pressure sensors showed sensitivities of 0.211 mV/V/bar and 0.308 mV/V/bar respectively at room temperatures. These sensors could be operated up to the measured temperature of 200 °C without any failure. All types of sensors showed decreased sensitivities with temperature. With respect to the sensitivity at room temperature, the sensor with diffused piezoresistors exhibited 13% decrease of sensitivity at 100 °C. For oxide isolated single crystal silicon or poly silicon piezoresistors, the decrease in the sensitivity at 200 °C was 19.5% and 9.0% respectively y. At elevated temperatures of 200 °C, the sensors with oxide isolated polysilicon piezoresistors demonstrated the best performance in terms of lowest decrease of sensitivity, and variation of offset voltage and hysteresis."
pub.1061795610,Steering Dynamic Collaborations between Business Processes,"Under the background of business globalization nowadays, many organizations are connecting their business processes into complex collaborative business processes to facilitate business collaboration. To adapt to the changing requirements and market opportunities, collaborative business processes have to evolve all the time. Such dynamics brings challenges to the modeling and tracking of collaborative business processes. In addition, these issues can be further complicated by the requirements of privacy protection and information openness in the interorganizational context. Aiming to tackle these problems, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework to model and track dynamic collaborative business processes with our extended relative workflow model. This framework helps each participating organization derive its collaborative business processes and update the processes at run time. A process visibility control mechanism is developed to enforce such derivation and extend organizations' process perception via process visibility transitivity. The whole framework is formalized with matrices and is theoretically proven to be privacy safe. Corresponding algorithms are developed for generating and tracking collaborative business processes. A prototype is also implemented for the proof-of-concept purpose."

Unfortunately, there is a problem of poor selectivity, especially for gases such as ketones and alcohols, which have a similar high sensitivity. In this paper, dynamic temperature modulation technology was used to solve this problem. Rectangular wave and sine wave, typical voltage jump waveform and voltage smooth waveform, were used as heating voltage waveform. It was introduced in detail that the optimization of dynamic temperature modulation parameters based on response time and power consumption. According to the different heating waveform parameters, we obtained the dynamic response data of six groups of sensors to five concentration gradients of acetone, butanone, n-propyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol. It was used to evaluate the performance of heating waveform parameters by support vector machine (SVM) and principal component analysis (PCA) combined with K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Both data analysis methods showed that the recognition effect was better when the SnO2 sensor was heated by sine wave. In order to reduce power consumption, the heating waveform was determined as 0-6 V sine wave. Then the mechanism was analyzed in dynamic temperature modulation of the sensor. The voltage smooth waveform reached the stepless response of multiple temperature points by traversing the temperature range. More characteristics can be produced by experiencing more types proportion of adsorbed oxygen species within the cycle. It provided a new research idea for semiconductor gas sensor dynamic temperature modulation technology."

An integral part of the process of recycling waste material is its quality sorting. Nowadays, both manual and automated sorting methods, especially optical sorting, are used worldwide for sorting mixed waste. This article presents the application of the NIR/VIS optical sorting system through a description of this processing equipment integrated into a specific plastic waste processing line. The aim of the article was to select the optimal mode of operation generally applicable to mixed waste, and, specifically, to compare the quality of sorting of plastic waste in automated and manual sorting modes. In order to compare the efficiency of the sorting system, significant parameters of the sorting process were proposed. The measurement of the plastic waste sorting purity parameter was based on data obtained by weighing selected control samples, and the evaluation of the results of these measurements showed, in particular, the dependence of the concerned parameter not only on the sorting mode, i.e., automated and manual, but also on the conveyor belt speed/waste material flow, on the pre-sorting methods and, in the case of manual sorting, on the operating shift. The subsequent economic assessment of both sorting processes clearly declared the investment in automated sorting systems in the optical system operation mode not only as profitable, but also as extremely advantageous both for the production economy and the environment."
pub.1144066201,Multi-View Collaborative Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation,"Recently, Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) has become more practical because a small number of labeled target samples can significantly boost the empirical target performance when using SSDA. Several current methods focus on prototype-based alignment to achieve cross-domain invariance in which the labeled samples from the source and target domains are concatenated to estimate the prototypes. The model is then trained to assign the unlabeled target data to the prototype within the same class. However, such methods fail to exploit the advantage of using few labeled target data because the labeled source data dominate the prototypes in the supervision process. Moreover, a recent method (Yang et al., 2021) showed that concatenating source and target samples for training can damage the semantic information of representations, which degrades the trained model’s ability to generate discriminative features. To solve these problems, in this paper, we divide labeled source and target samples into two subgroups for training. One group includes a large number of labeled source samples, and the other obtains a few labeled target samples. Then, we propose a novel SSDA framework that consists of two models. A model trained on the group that has the labeled source samples to provide an “inter-view” on the unlabeled target data is called the inter-view model. A model trained on a few labeled target samples that provides an “intra-view” of the unlabeled target data is called the intra-view model. Finally, both of these models collaborate to fully exploit information on the unlabeled target data. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art classification performance of SSDA in extensive experiments conducted on several visual benchmark domain adaptation datasets that utilize the advantages of multiple views and collaborative training."

To handle this issue, companies develop software to manage the generation, the tracking, and the assignment of tickets to employees. Current advances in machine learning can automate the HDTAP, and make it more efficient. In this paper, we propose the use of an ensemble model based on Stacked Generalization that replicates the expert behavior by reducing the classification errors. The model is tested using data of a Chilean company that develops management software for hospitals. The results show that our proposal obtains the best accuracy and $F_{1}$ score outperforming, consistently, most state-of-the-art models."
pub.1095671737,Fault-Tolerant RFID Reader Localization Based on Passive RFID Tags,"With the growing use of RFID-based devices, RFID reader localization attracts increasing attentions recently. In this technology, an object carrying an RFID reader is located by communicating with some passive RFID tags deployed in the environment. One important problem of RFID reader localization is that frequent occurred RFID faults affect localization accuracy. Specifically, complex localization environment (may include metal, water, obstacles, etc.) makes some tags fail to communicate with the reader, which makes the localization result deviate from the real location. Existing approaches can tolerate the faults occurred in individual tags and lasting for a short time period, but suffer serious localization error if the faults exist in a large region and last for a long time period. Moreover, existing approaches do not provide quality measurement of a localization result. In this paper, we propose an effective fault-tolerant RFID reader localization approach suitable for the above-mentioned situations, and illustrate how to measure the quality of a localization result. We have taken extensive simulations and implemented an RFID-based localization system. In both cases, our solution outperforms existing approaches in localization accuracy and can provide additional quality information."

Unlike traditional processes, the measured data in the plant-wide process pose great challenges to information capture, data management, and storage. More importantly, it is difficult to efficiently interpret the information hidden within those data. In this paper, the road map of a distributed modeling framework for plant-wide process monitoring is introduced. Based on this framework, the whole plant-wide process is decomposed into different blocks, and statistical data models are constructed in those blocks. For online monitoring, the results obtained from different blocks are integrated through the decision fusion algorithm.

We first optimized the input power and gain of the SOA-integrated switch to obtain the optimum operation point in terms of the transmitted signal quality. We then performed simultaneous transmission of 8-ch, 32-Gbaud, SP 16-QAM WDM (800 Gbs) signals through all the four paths of the switch. The effect of crosstalk on the switch was very small, and thus could not be observed. We also examined multistage (up to four stages) transmission of the signals with circulating configurations. We show that even for a 4-stage transmission, the bit error rate of the transmitted signal is below the 20 forward-error-correction limit. Finally, we discuss approaches to improve the optical signal-to-noise ratio of the transmitted signals to enlarge the signal quality margin and increase the possible number of the cascading stages andor WDM channels for wide applications."
pub.1083810626,Application of a Quantum-Well Silicon NMOS Transistor as a Folding Amplifier Frequency Multiplier,"This paper reports on the use of a single quantum well (QW) silicon NMOS transistor to generate a folded current-voltage transfer function that enables frequency doubling and tripling. The QW NMOS device is fabricated entirely on an industrially standard 45 nm technology node CMOS processing line. Quantum transport through the QW results in negative differential transconductances that fold the IDS-VG function. Using two such folds, time domain data shows frequency doubling up through the kHz range at room temperature, and Fourier analysis confirms that the output is dominated by the second harmonic of the input. Total harmonic distortion is approximately -14 dB. De-embedding the frequency response from parasitic cable and contact impedances suggests that the intrinsic doubling bandwidth of a QW NMOS transistor could be as high as 10 GHz if monolithically integrated into a circuit. The high frequency performance of the QW NMOS is limited by the relatively high transresistance magnitude of the device. Frequency tripling can also be shown using a single QW NMOS with three folds. This work helps establish the high frequency performance limitations of a QW NMOS device. It is also the first example of a silicon quantum device fabricated by mainstream CMOS technology being used in a circuit application."
pub.1093665166,Optimizing Service Protection with Model Driven Security@run.time,"Enterprises are more and more involved in collaborative business. This leads to open and outsourcing all or part of their information system (IS) to create collaborative processes by composing business services picked in each partner IS and to take advantage of Cloud computing. Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the business context leading to costly over protection. To address this issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS) and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end to end protection. A proof of concept prototype is built on top of the OW2 FraSCAti middleware, validating our proposition efficiency. Our experiments and simulations show that MDS@run.time improves the system efficiency when the over-protection risk rate increases."

Narrower n/sup +/ diffusions require higher anneal temperatures, or longer anneal times, than wider diffusions for complete transitions from the high-resistivity C49 phase to the low-resistivity C54 phase. A model is presented which explains this in terms of the probability of forming C54 nuclei on narrow diffusions and the influence of diffusion width on C54 grain size. The results are that more C49 and C54 nucleation events are required to completely transform narrow lines. For thin TiSi/sub 2/ (40 nm), there is a narrow process window for achieving complete transformation without causing agglomeration of the TiSi/sub 2/. The process window decreases with decreasing silicide thickness. A significantly larger process window is achieved with short-time rapid annealing. Similar studies are performed for CoSi/sub 2/ on n/sup +/ and p/sup +/ diffusions. No linewidth dependence is observed for the transformation from CoSi/sub x/ to CoSi/sub 2/. There is a broad process window from 575 degrees C to 850 degrees C using furnace annealing, for which the low-resistivity phase is obtained without causing agglomeration.<>"

pub.1061156139,Measuring photolithographic overlay accuracy and critical dimensions by correlating binarized Laplacian of Gaussian convolutions,"A technique is described for measuring overlay accuracy and critical dimensions in IC manufacture and similar fields, based on a theory originally developed for matching binocular stereo images. The method uses targets composed of small elements that can be at the minimum feature size of the photolithographic process. Alignment is measured using clusters of those elements rather than the small elements individually. This makes the method insensitive to many of the imaging effects that have plagued other approaches, such as interference fringes and edge topology differences between process steps. The method is tolerant of high noise levels, which allows operation on process layers that produce low-contrast images or high-noise backgrounds as is the case when aligning resist over metal. Adding an appropriate bar grating to the alignment target causes element size changes to induce a proportional shift in alignment, allowing critical dimensions to be measured by the alignment technique.<>"

However, achieving this aim involves the realization of several conflicting objectives. In carbon fiber industry, the stabilization process is the most vital step with high energy consumption. The aim of this study is to use intelligent modeling methods in the stabilization process to maximize energy efficiency while considering better production quality, avoiding defects, and not scarifying the prediction accuracy. To this aim, a modified DOE method was used to reduce the number of required experiments. The mechanical and physical properties were then modeled based on input-output data derived from the experiments. In this way, the SVR method is used to develop a set of mathematical models for mechanical and physical properties of the fibers. The skin-core defect and energy consumption were considered as objective functions within the given range of physical and mechanical properties of fibers. The state-of-the-art NSGA-II algorithm used to find the optimum Pareto front, including non-dominated solutions among these conflicting objective functions. The results showed that by using the integrated NSGA-II and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), the energy efficiency of the system was improved. Moreover, the discussions showed how similar hybrid algorithms with high accuracy can be used by other industries to reduce the overall energy consumptions."

Some studies have shown that the requirements risk-based approaches can be effective in improving the effectiveness of regression testing techniques. However, the risk estimation processes used in such approaches can be subjective, time-consuming, and costly. In this research, we introduce a fuzzy expert system that emulates human thinking to address the subjectivity related issues in the risk estimation process in a systematic and an efficient way and thus further improve the effectiveness of test case prioritization. Further, the required data for our approach was gathered by employing a semi-automated process that made the risk estimation process less subjective. The empirical results indicate that the new prioritization approach can improve the rate of fault detection over several existing test case prioritization techniques, while reducing threats to subjective risk estimation."
pub.1167962989,Explainable and Effective Process Remaining Time Prediction Using Feature-Informed Cascade Prediction Model,"Predictive Process Monitoring aims to predict the future information of ongoing process executions by leveraging machine and deep learning techniques. One of the tasks is known as remaining time prediction, which focuses on predicting the remaining time of ongoing cases. Accurate remaining time prediction can be valuable and important for improving business operations or taking timely interventions to prevent delays. For predicting the remaining time, existing work has used deep learning techniques to achieve high prediction accuracy. However, most of these techniques tend to learn very complex models that are difficult to explain. Systematic feature selection approaches may help improve both the prediction accuracy and the explainability of the model. In this paper, we introduce a feature-informed cascade prediction framework to predict the remaining time. Specifically, we first propose an approach that builds a tree of features by systematically estimating their effects on the remaining time prediction. Next, we use the tree to either automatically select an optimal combination of features or to guide users in this selection process. Each selected feature is correlated with its prediction results in our Feature-informed Cascade Prediction Model (FCPM) for explainability. The proposed approach has been implemented and is made publicly available. Using eight public real-life event logs, the proposed approach is compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of prediction accuracy. In addition, it is demonstrated that our approach visualizes the impact of each input feature in the prediction of individual cases, producing explanations of the prediction results."
pub.1112774203,Advanced Fabrication Processes for Superconductor Electronics: Current Status and New Developments,"In superconductor electronics fabrication processes developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Josephson junctions (JJs) are placed near the top of the stack composed of nine or ten superconducting layers. We discuss the effects of this placement and other processing factors on uniformity of JJ critical current across 200-mm wafers; specifically, nonuniformity of residual stress in Nb films, wafer bow and warpage caused by accumulated stress in the underlying dielectric and superconducting layers, and effects of accumulated topography caused by patterning and planarization of wiring layers. We describe the typical fabrication defects, focusing primarily on the peculiar defects caused by electrochemical corrosion of dissimilar metals. To increase the integration scale and enhance fabrication capabilities, we are developing a new process, titled SC1, in which Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb JJs are placed near the bottom of the layer stack, preceded only by two planarized layers: resistor layer and superconducting ground plane. Six planarized Nb wiring layers are placed above the JJs. This layer stack should simplify routing of data and clock in integrated circuits, and allow for improvements in uniformity of small JJs. The SC1 process has a 250-nm minimum feature size for inductors, three sheet resistance options for resistors, and two options for JJ critical current density: 100 and 200 μA/μm2.

pub.1061538609,Efficient Methodologies for 3-D TCAD Modeling of Emerging Devices and Circuits,"Over the past decade, 3-D process simulation, which is central to the 3-D Technology Computer-Aided Design (3-D TCAD) approach, has severely limited the scope and applicability of TCAD to circuits with a small number of field-effect transistors, owing to its prohibitively high computational costs for large layouts. Due to rapidly changing process recipes and shorter production cycles in the industry, design–time optimization and iterative layout-3-D TCAD exploration for yield-critical or yield-characterizing circuits, such as static random-access memories (SRAMs), ring oscillators, and others, is currently impossible in a practical time frame. In this paper, we architect a novel layout/process/device-independent TCAD methodology in the Sentaurus tool suite to overcome the process simulation barrier for accurate 3-D TCAD structure generation. We adopt an automated structure synthesis (SS) approach, thereby bypassing the need for repetitive 3-D process simulations for different layouts or different versions of the same layout. Results for 32-nm bulk process simulations versus SS and 32-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) hardware measurements versus corresponding synthesized structures indicate that the method is an excellent substitute to 3-D process simulation of large layouts, with extremely favorable time and memory scaling behavior. Finally, the robustness and scalability of the proposed abstractions are highlighted through the synthesis of 22-nm SOI 6T FinFET SRAMs and ring oscillator structures."
pub.1061289778,Fabricating Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers with Wafer-Bonding Technology,"This paper introduces a new method for fabricating capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) that uses a wafer bonding technique. The transducer membrane and cavity are defined on an SOI (silicon-on-insulator) wafer and on a prime wafer, respectively. Then, using silicon direct bonding in a vacuum environment, the two wafers are bonded together to form a transducer. This new technique, capable of fabricating large CMUTs, offers advantages over the traditionally micromachined CMUTs. First, forming a vacuum-sealed cavity is relatively easy since the wafer bonding is performed in a vacuum chamber. Second, this process enables better control over the gap height, making it possible to fabricate very small gaps (less than 0.1 $\mu\hbox{m}$). Third, since the membrane is made of single crystal silicon, it is possible to predict and control the mechanical properties of the membrane to within 5%. Finally, the number of process steps involved in making a CMUT has been reduced from 22 to 15, shortening the device turn-around time. All of these advantages provide repeatable fabrication of CMUTs featuring predictable center frequency, bandwidth, and collapse voltage. Using this new technique, we have fabricated CMUTs that have membrane sizes between 12 $\mu\hbox{m}$ and 750 $\mu\hbox{m}$, and thicknesses between 0.34 $\mu\hbox{m}$ and 4.5 $\mu\hbox{m}$. This paper presents the fabrication process and some experimental results obtained from the wafer-bonded devices.$\hfill{\hbox{[929]}}$"

In particular, design details are given about the two core functional blocks embedded in the microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC): a 12-bit phase and amplitude control circuit and an 18-bit serial-to-parallel (S2P) interface. The S2P interface was designed resorting to a custom symmetric device model, expressly conceived for the time-domain simulations required for digital circuits. Due to the adoption of a differential structure with resistive pull-ups, it achieves a state-of-the-art power consumption of 2.2 mW/bit and nearly 87% yield. The analog circuit includes a 6-bit phase shifter (PS) and a 6-bit attenuator. To mitigate risks, two different PS architectures have been developed and are compared in this work, discussing advantages and drawbacks of the different solutions. Since the two designs share the same target specifications, a truly fair comparison can be made not only in terms of performance but also concerning robustness and repeatability, thus providing useful guidelines for the selection of the most appropriate strategy. In particular, it is shown that one architecture outperforms the other by about 2 dB and 1.5° in terms of insertion loss and rms phase error, respectively."

pub.1136541650,Classifying Powder Flowability for Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing Using Machine Learning,"Metal powders are used as feedstock in a variety of manufacturing methods, wherein the metallic particulates may be deposited upon a substrate, spread upon a build plate, or melted layer-by-layer. Regardless of how the powder is consumed during a given manufacturing process, the ease with which a powder flows maintains a significant impact on the properties and behavior of the resultant component procured. This is especially true for cold spray additive manufacturing, which is a solid-state metallic particulate deposition process that requires suitable flowability to prevent component waviness as well as prevent nozzle clogging. That being said, particle-level geometrical properties, such as size and shape features, greatly impact the capacity of a powder to flow, or its flowability. Existing techniques for measuring a particle’s flowability require manual powder processing which can be both time-consuming and vulnerable to man-made error. Both of these setbacks can be addressed through automatic, data-driven techniques trained to classify flowability from particle property measurements and expertly procured powder Hall Flow rates for training and testing. To our knowledge, we present the first computational model for classifying flowability (when captured in terms of the industrially standardized Hall Flow rates) of a metal powder given its particle-level physical property measurements. After obtaining twenty-one metal powder samples from manufacturers, particle-level physical property measurements of each powder were measured. We used these particle measurements to train a Decision Tree model to classify whether a particle’s Hall Flow rate was fast or slow. With an achieved accuracy 98.04%, our work illustrates that powder flowability, through the lens of Hall Flow rates, can be accurately classified using data-driven techniques. This work lays a promising foundation for further exploration into predictive models for this cutting-edge domain."
pub.1061329492,Synthesized Compact Models and Experimental Verifications for Substrate Noise Coupling in Mixed-Signal ICs,"A synthesized compact modeling (SCM) approach for substrate coupling analysis is presented. The SCM is formulated using a scalable $Z$ matrix approach for heavily doped substrates with a lightly doped epitaxial layer and using a nodal lumped resistance approach for lightly doped substrates. The SCM models require a set of process-dependent fitting coefficients and incorporate geometrical parameters of the substrate ports in a compact form that includes size, perimeter, and separation defined using the geometric mean distance to accommodate both far-field and near-field effects. The SCM approach is verified based on measurement data from two test chips, one in a custom lightly doped process and the other one using a 0.18-$\mu{\hbox {m}}$ BiCMOS lightly doped foundry process. The model accuracy is shown to be within 15% compared to measured data extracted from the test patterns. The SCM is exploited with application examples to show substrate model generation efficiency and accuracy at different levels of complexity, including a full chip substrate noise distribution analysis for a 2 mm by 2 mm chip with 319 substrate contacts."
pub.1153579517,Piecemeal Clustering: a Self-Driven Data Clustering Algorithm,"Various approaches have been discussed in the literature for the clustering of data, such as partitioning, hierarchical, and machine learning methods. Most of the approaches require some prior knowledge about the clusters, such as their total number. Furthermore, some previous algorithms are not robust enough to process higher-dimensional data or require a large amount of memory for computations. We propose, herein, a data clustering algorithm, Piecemeal Clustering, that successfully clusters data without prior knowledge of the number of clusters. The proposed clustering algorithm uses the similarity and density of the data to identify the number of clusters in the data set and works with both low- and high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the power of the proposed Piecemeal Clustering algorithm with two real-world data sets. It is found that the proposed algorithm outperforms seven other state-of-the-art algorithms on both of these data sets."
pub.1174430402,Collaborative Deployment and Routing of Industrial Microservices in Smart Factories,"In large smart factories, massive microservices compose complicated modular IT systems, providing various service functions. However, large microservices-based IT systems incur sophisticated communications and invocations among the massive microservices, which calls for efficient orchestration techniques to meet the high requirements in smart factories. Also, complex data interdependencies among microservices tightly couple deployment with routing, further intensifying the difficulties in orchestration. Such challenges demand delicate joint optimization of service deployment and request routing, which however, are neglected by previous work. In this case, this article investigates the collaborative optimization of microservice deployment and routing in smart factories. First, we construct a communication queuing network model to analyze service performance under dynamic load. Second, two heuristics are proposed to provide differentiated deployment and routing schemes for various demands. Finally, rigorous experiments validate that our approach significantly enhances network efficiency across various production scenarios in smart factories."
pub.1061132133,Use of COTS microelectronics in radiation environments,"This paper addresses key issues for the cost-effective use of COTS (Commercially available Off The Shelf) microelectronics in radiation environments that enable circuit or system designers to manage risks and ensure mission success. We review several factors and tradeoffs affecting the successful application of COTS parts including (1) hardness assurance and qualification issues; (2) system hardening techniques, and (3) life-cycle costs. The paper also describes several experimental studies that address trends in total-dose, transient, and single-event radiation hardness as COTS technology scales to smaller feature sizes. As an example, the level at which dose-rate upset occurs in Samsung SRAMs increases from 1.4/spl times/10/sup 8/ rad(Si)/s for a 256 K SRAM to 7.7/spl times/10/sup 9/ rad(Si)/s for a 4 M SRAM, indicating unintentional hardening improvements in the design or process of a commercial technology. Additional experiments were performed to quantify variations in radiation hardness for COTS parts. In one study, only small (10-15%) variations were found in the dose-rate upset and latchup thresholds for Samsung 4 M SRAMs from three different date codes. In another study, irradiations of 4 M SRAMs from Samsung, Hitachi, and Toshiba indicate large differences in total-dose radiation hardness. The paper attempts to carefully define terms and clear up misunderstandings about the definitions of ""COTS"" and ""radiation-hardened (RH)"" technology."

The collection of these experiences provided input to different pilot activities in each partner region and functioned as the starting point for thematic discussions at trans-national seminars. Regional clusters, the geographic concentration of economic activities in a specific field connected through different types of linkages, from knowledge spill-over's to the use of a common labour market, are increasingly viewed as an interesting conceptual tool to understand the economic strength or competitiveness of a region. The Innovative Regions project has given the partners an opportunity to learn from the good and bad experiences of others, and collect reflections and recommended methods, which can be passed on to other regions. So other regions do not have to make the same mistakes.

Each Schottky diode field-effect transistor logic (SDFL) cell can be programmed with 3 options as an unbuffered or buffered NOR gate, or as a dual OR/NAND gate. The interface I/O cell can be programmed for ECL, TTL, CMOS, and SDFL logic families. Each 16 bit RAM is fully decoded using depletion mode MESFET's with SDFL circuit approach.

pub.1061404614,Innovative and Reliable Power Modules: A Future Trend and Evolution of Technologies,"Since the introduction of the first power module by Semikron in 1975, many innovations have been made to improve the thermal, electrical, and mechanical performance of power modules. These innovations in packaging technology focus on the enhancement of the heat dissipation and thermal cycling capability of the modules. Thermal cycles, caused by varying load and environmental operating conditions, induce high mechanical stress in the interconnection layers of the power module due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), leading to fatigue and growth of microcracks in the bonding materials. As a result, the lifetime of power modules can be severely limited in practical applications. Furthermore, to reduce the size and weight of converters, the semiconductors are being operated at higher junction temperatures. Higher temperatures are especially of great interest for use of wide-?bandgap materials, such as SiC and GaN, because these materials leverage their material characteristics, particularly at higher temperatures. To satisfy these tightened requirements, on the one hand, conventional power modules, i.e., direct bonded Cu (DBC)-based systems with bond wire contacts, have been further improved. On the other hand, alternative packaging techniques, e.g., chip embedding into printed circuit boards (PCBs) and power module packaging based on the selective laser melting (SLM) technique, have been developed, which might constitute an alternative to conventional power modules in certain applications."
pub.1095768246,Realsearch: a framework for knowledge management and continuing education,"This paper deals with insight as the deep form of knowledge we wish to develop about our business environments, and the form of knowledge we wish to transfer to others who are in business with us. More specifically, this paper describes an insight development process called Realsearch, and its application specifically to the analysis and design of highly adaptable business practices. Realsearch is an issue-focused, principle-based methodology that first defines the nature of a problem before considering solutions. Solutions are then analyzed or designed according to a set of fundamental design principles. Insight is fostered with this cause-and-effect understanding, and communicated within an organization through means of a local metaphor model-which provides a graphic depiction of this cause-and-effect relationship for a known and respected local business practice. One immediately practical application is for directing business process reengineering projects. Another is the capture and mobilization of corporate core competency knowledge. A third important application is in what we now call continuing education-at all employee levels. Insight provides a very different leverage over simple procedural learning and training. Formal education traditionally gives us new rules to employ, training traditionally gives us experience in applying those rules, workshops focus us (sometimes) on real and practical problems, and seminars expose us to someone else's thoughts. None have demonstrated the ability to provide insight consistently-so all have a marginal value by comparison."
pub.1061098094,Increasing profitability and improving semiconductor manufacturing throughput using expert systems,"This paper describes a new procedure for using a machine-learning classification technique coupled with an expert system to increase profitability and improve throughput in a semiconductor manufacturing environment. The authors show how to use this procedure to identify relationships between work-in-process data (information obtained during semiconductor fabrication) and potential integrated circuit yield. The relationships, in the form of IF-THEN rules, are extracted from databases of previously fabricated integrated circuits and final yield. It is further shown that these rules, when incorporated into expert systems, can advise the human operator as to which batches of circuits are likely to produce submarginal yield if processed to completion, thereby providing a basis for developing or enhancing a quality control strategy. These rules also identify the parameters and values which have historically provided the highest and lowest final wafer yields. A cost analysis is given to illustrate the cost-effectiveness of this procedure. An introduction to semiconductor manufacturing and a glossary are provided.<>"
pub.1094544937,A novel approach to process mining: Intentional process models discovery,"So far, process mining techniques have suggested to model processes in terms of tasks that occur during the enactment of a process. However, research on method engineering and guidance has illustrated that many issues, such as lack of flexibility or adaptation, are solved more effectively when intentions are explicitly specified. This paper presents a novel approach of process mining, called Map Miner Method (MMM). This method is designed to automate the construction of intentional process models from process logs. MMM uses Hidden Markov Models to model the relationship between users' activities logs and the strategies to fulfill their intentions. The method also includes two specific algorithms developed to infer users' intentions and construct intentional process model (Map) respectively. MMM can construct Map process models with different levels of abstraction (fine-grained and coarse-grained process models) with respect to the Map metamodel formalism (i.e., metamodel that specifies intentions and strategies of process actors). This paper presents all steps toward the construction of Map process models topology. The entire method is applied on a large-scale case study (Eclipse UDC) to mine the associated intentional process. The likelihood of the obtained process model shows a satisfying efficiency for the proposed method."

The transformation is assisted by employment of machine learning techniques that can deal with modeling both big or limited data. This manuscript reviews these concepts and present a case study that demonstrates the use of a novel intelligent hybrid algorithms for Industry 4.0 applications with limited data. In particular, an intelligent algorithm is proposed for robust data modeling of nonlinear systems based on input-output data. In our approach, a novel hybrid data-driven combining the Group-Method of Data-Handling and Singular-Value Decomposition is adapted to find an offline deterministic model combined with Pareto multi-objective optimization to overcome the overfitting issue. An Unscented-Kalman-Filter is also incorporated to update the coefficient of the deterministic model and increase its robustness against data uncertainties.

pub.1105399806,Acoustic Emission for <italic>In Situ</italic> Monitoring of Solid Materials Pre-Weakening by Electric Discharge: A Machine Learning Approach,"Pre-weakening of solid materials using electric discharge is a new technique aiming at reducing significantly the costs and energy consumption as compared with the traditional raw materials processing in mining and recycling industries. However, the absence of an effective pre-weakening process monitoring and control prohibits its introduction into the market. The present contribution aims to fill this gap by investigating the feasibility of combining acoustic emission with machine learning for process monitoring. Hence, this paper is a supplement and enrichment of existing studies on in situ and real-time process monitoring and diagnosis associated with failure mechanism problems. Three categories and six subcategories are defined to describe the major pre-weakening scenarios of solid materials. The acoustic signals are collected and labeled according to the visual control of specially prepared transparent samples subjected to discharge exposure. The acoustic signals are decomposed with data adaptive M-band wavelets and the relative energies of the extracted frequency bands are used as features. Principal component analysis is applied to select the most informative features whereas several classifiers are applied to recognize the pre-weakening quality. The classification accuracy of the defined categories ranges between 84-93% demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method for in situ and real-time control of pre-weakening of solid materials using electric discharge."
pub.1061561447,Package-on-Package Assembly Yield Assessment in the ODM/EMS Environment Using Monte Carlo Simulation,"Package-on-package (PoP) is one of the major manufacturing strategies for achieving an electronic component miniaturization. Achieving a desired process yield is critical to maintaining competitiveness. This paper develops a scientific approach to assess the PoP assembly yield in both the $x$–$y$ in-plane and the $z$-direction using a Monte Carlo simulation. Influences of variations of materials such as components and printed circuit boards (PCBs) are investigated. Equipment accuracy and different process strategies are also under consideration. The scenarios under which defects occur are defined through the geometric phenomena, process incidence, and theoretical inferences. Defects such as shorts and soldering open may occur after reflow soldering if there is an excessive amount of offset between the centers of the solder ball and the bonding pad during the component placement stage. The amount of component/PCB warpage during the reflow heating and coplanarity of the solder balls beneath the substrate will also impact the package stacking yield. The simulation-based design for experiment is employed to investigate the effects of soldering materials, stencil thickness, reflow temperature profile, and component ball height variation on the assembly yield. The optimal materials and process combinations are then identified."

To address the consequent software-related challenges, automotive manufacturers are adopting methodologies like software product-line engineering, electrics/electronics platforms, and product generation engineering. However, each of these methodologies relies on an own vocabulary, necessitating a unification of the divergent understandings and interpretations of key terms and definitions. In this article, we investigate and discuss a terminological framework that provides a common ground for specifying a unified product-structuring concept. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic mapping study to develop a framework of existing terms and definitions used to describe product-structuring concepts in software, electrics/electronics, as well as mechanical engineering.

A low-power high-speed tunneling SRAM (TSRAM) memory array including sense amplifiers and pre-charge circuit blocks operating at 0.5 V is designed and simulated using available MOSIS CMOS 90 nm product design kit coupled with VerilogA models developed from this group's Si/SiGe resonant interband tunnel diode experimental data. 1 T and 3 T- 2 tunnel diode memory cell configurations were evaluated. The memory array assigns 0.5 V as a logic “1” and 0 V as a logic “0”. Dual supply voltages of 1 and 0.5 V and dual threshold voltage design are used to ensure high sensing speed concurrently with low operating and standby power. Read access time of 1 ns and write access time of 2 ns is achieved for the 3 T memory cell. Write access time can be reduced to 0.5 ns for 32 bit write operations not requiring a preceding read operation. Standby power dissipation of $6\times 10^{-5}\ {\hbox {mW}}$ per cell and dynamic power dissipation of $1.8\times 10^{-7}\ {\hbox {mW/MHz}}$ per cell is obtained from the TSRAM memory array. This is the first report of TSRAM performance at the array level.
pub.1109828742,Optimal Deployment of Configurable Business Processes in Cloud Federations,"Configurable processes are increasingly being adopted by enterprises that seek experience sharing and best practice adoption. A configurable process is a customizable model that specifies how different enterprises perform similar processes. At the modeling level, a configurable process model provides for flexible business process (BP) reuse by (de)selecting the (ir)relevant parts to derive a particular process variant. At the exploitation level, it offers flexibility and agility to an enterprise looking to outsource its BP to different providers cooperating in a cloud federation. More specifically, an enterprise can use a configurable process model to derive particular process variants that it outsources depending on its objectives. In particular, it may opt for outsourcing the variant that results in the optimal deployment, e.g., having the minimal cost of allocated cloud services that fulfill the user quality of service (QoS) requirements. However, identifying the optimal deployment variants is a complex problem because of the heterogeneity of services within a cloud federation and the number of possible variants that can be derived from a configurable process model. In addition, the complexity of this problem increases for variable user QoS requirements. In this paper, we propose an approach to derive, from a configurable process model, the variant that has the optimal deployment in a cloud federation. We propose a linear programming approach that accounts for the variability of both the BP model and the user QoS requirements, and that ensures an optimal time-aware cloud service allocation. We experimentally show the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach on a generated testbed."
pub.1166542030,ClusterNet: Routing Congestion Prediction and Optimization Using Netlist Clustering and Graph Neural Networks,"Accurately predicting routing congestion caused by netlist topology is essential as circuit designs become increasingly complex. To correctly predict routing congestion, the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) has gained great attention. However, existing GNN-based methods have limitations in capturing crucial netlist information and effectively representing complex topologies. In this work, we propose a novel approach, ClusterNet, to predict routing congestion caused by netlist topology. Our approach leverages netlist clustering to overcome these limitations. We first divide the netlist into highly connected clusters using the Leiden algorithm, enabling an analysis of the local netlist topology. We then predict routing congestion by exploiting GNNs to generate cluster embeddings that capture the detailed netlist topology. In addition, we introduce a cluster padding method that utilizes the trained model to mitigate routing congestion. By applying the proposed ClusterNet, we can accurately predict and optimize routing congestion from specific cluster topologies. Our experimental results demonstrated improved prediction performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.056 and an R2 score of 0.669. Furthermore, routing congestion optimization significantly improved the total negative slack and reduced the number of failing endpoints by 14.5% and 9.9%, respectively."
pub.1144086872,Evaluating Parsons Problems as a Design-Based Intervention,"Parsons problems are a type of assessment that helps introductory programming (CS1) students learn programming by arranging fragments of code to form working programs. Parsons problems enables students to focus on the learning concepts by minimising their focus on extrinsic operations while coding, such as syntax details. Because of the success in teaching programming with Parsons problems, we investigate the possibility of using it as a design-based intervention. We examine how Parsons problems can be used by procedural programming students during the design process, and investigate how the assessment supports the use of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) strategies during the problem-solving process. We performed usability testing, comprising a mixed-methods approach of pre-test, think-alouds, and interviews, to collect students' behaviours and experiences. The results show a variety of approaches used by students when solving the Parsons problems, including engaging SRL strategies to better understand the problem and to verify their work. We offer future research opportunities to further explore Parsons problems as a design-based intervention."
pub.1146865978,A Novel Model-Based Defogging Method for Particle Images With Different Fog Distributions,"Defogging of particle images is a common task in machine vision-based measurement of particle size distribution (PSD) for granular materials or products. Current defogging methods are challenged by particle images captured in industrial environment, where artificial light is dominant in the imaging process and the fog is often unevenly distributed in the image due to its rapid and random movement. The recovered images may contain serious overexposures and result in failures in PSD measurement. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model-based defogging method for particle images with different fog distributions. First, a physical model is established to describe the image formation in industrial foggy environment with artificial light. Then, an adaptive method is proposed to estimate the range of the key model parameter (light intensity coefficient) and to obtain candidate defogged images. Finally, the fog-free image is generated by fusing the candidate images to reduce overexposures while retaining the image brightness. The proposed method was validated experimentally using iron ore particle images and compared with ten current defogging methods. Results demonstrate that our proposed method is adaptive to different illuminations and different fog contributions. It outperforms other defogging methods in removing unevenly distributed fog from the image and thus greatly improves the measuring accuracy of particle size. The proposed image defogging method can be integrated into machine vision systems for particle-handling processes to facilitate PSD measurement in foggy environment. The sample implementation of the proposed method is available at “https://github.com/zhoushuyi/particle-image-defog.”"
pub.1061541975,Converged Network-Cloud Service Composition with End-to-End Performance Guarantee,"The crucial role of networking in cloud computing calls for federated management of both computing and networking resources for end-to-end service provisioning. Application of the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in both cloud computing and networking enables a convergence of network and cloud service provisioning. One of the key challenges to high performance converged network-cloud service provisioning lies in composition of network and cloud services with end-to-end performance guarantee. In this paper, we propose a QoS-aware service composition approach to tackling this challenging issue. We first present a system model for network-cloud service composition and formulate the service composition problem as a variant of Multi-Constrained Optimal Path (MCOP) problem. We then propose an approximation algorithm to solve the problem and give theoretical analysis on properties of the algorithm to show its effectiveness and efficiency for QoS-aware network-cloud service composition. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive experiments and the obtained results indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance in service composition than the best current MCOP approaches."

Such PDs are envisioned to be integral parts of high-speed optical interconnects in the future intrachip, chip-to-chip, board-to-board, rack-to-rack, and intra-/interdata center links. Si-based PDs are of special interest since they present the potential for monolithic integration with CMOS and BiCMOS very-large-scale integration and ultralarge-scale integration electronics. In the second part of this review, we present the efforts pursued by the researchers in engineering and integrating Si, SiGe alloys, and Ge PDs to CMOS and BiCMOS electronics and compare the performance of recently demonstrated CMOS-compatible ultrafast surface-illuminated Si PD with absorption-enhancing low-dimensional structures. We discuss the advantages and challenges of device design with micro-/nanostructures, and finally, we conclude with the future directions that low-dimensional structures can offer to potentially cause a paradigm shift in high-performance PD design for various applications such as extended-reach links, single-photon detection, light detection and ranging, and high-performance computing."

The plasma channels are precisely formed and addressed using current high-resolution silicon fabrication technology. These dynamically defined plasma-reconfigurable antennas enable frequency hopping, beam shaping, and steering without the complexity of RF feed structures. This concept shows promise for delivering the performance and capabilities of a phased array, but at a reduced cost. However, challenges such as p-i-n biasing circuit complexity and their nonlinearities, as well as antenna efficiency, would still require further investigations."
pub.1147402764,Predicting Student Employability Through the Internship Context Using Gradient Boosting Models,"Universities around the world are keen to develop study plans that will guide their graduates to success in the job market. The internship course is one of the most significant courses that provides an experiential opportunity for students to apply knowledge and to prepare to start a professional career. However, internships do not guarantee employability, especially when a graduate’s internship performance is not satisfactory and the internship requirements are not met. Many factors contribute to this issue making the prediction of employability an important challenge for researchers in the higher education field. In this paper, our aim is to introduce an effective method to predict student employability based on context and using Gradient Boosting classifiers. Our contributions consist of harnessing the power of gradient boosting algorithms to perform context-aware employability status prediction processes. Student employability prediction relies on identifying the most predictive features impacting the hiring opportunity of graduates. Hence, we define two context models, which are the student context based on the student features and the internship context based on internship features. Experiments are conducted using three gradient boosting classifiers: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Category Boosting (CatBoost) and Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM). The results obtained showed that applying LGBM classifiers over the internship context performs the best compared to student context. Therefore, this study provides strong evidence that the employability of graduates is predictable from the internship context."

The best performing devices, with a maximum output current above 4 kA/cm2 and an area specific ON-state resistance of 1.1 $\text{m}\Omega \cdot $ cm2, are manufactured on ammonothermal GaN substrate with the gate channel parallel to the a-plane of the GaN crystal. The scalability of the devices up to 40 mm gate periphery is investigated and demonstrated. It is found that, in addition to oxide interface traps, the semiconductor border traps in the ${p}$ -GaN layer limit the available mobile channel electrons and that the channel surface roughness scattering limits the channel mobility. Both strongly depend on the gate trench orientation and on the GaN substrate defect density."
pub.1110904735,Multi-Label Question Classification for Factoid and List Type Questions in Biomedical Question Answering,"Biomedical experts and bio-curators are unable to quickly find short and precise information using typical search engines as the amount of biomedical literature is increasing exponentially. The research community is focusing on biomedical question answering (QA) systems so that anyone can find precise information nuggets from the massive amount of biomedical literature. Generally, the user queries fall under different categories such as factoid, list, yes/no, or summary. The existing state-of-the-art question answering systems deal with most of these question types. However, the research to improve the performance of individual question types is also on the rise. To improve QA system performance, question classification plays a vital role for factoid and list type questions as it allows the answer processing stage to narrow down the candidate answer space and assigns a higher rank to the correct answers. A single biomedical answer or entity may be associated with more than one biomedical category or semantic type, e.g., Coenzyme Q(10) is classified under two categories in Unified Medical Language System (UMLS): organic chemical and biologically active substance. This inherent characteristic of biomedical entities makes question classification in the biomedical domain a multi-label classification problem, where one question might expect answers belonging to more than one semantic type. To the best of our knowledge, several QA systems deal with question classification as a multi-class classification problem and only one state-of-the-art system – OAQA – deals with it as a multi-label classification problem. In this paper, we analyze the pipeline of the OAQA system for factoid and list type questions, emphasizing the multi-label question classification. We use an improved question classification dataset with the copy transformation technique to improve the performance of list type questions. Moreover, we introduce a binary transformation in the pipeline of factoid questions to increase its performance. Our modified methodology enhances the performance of both list and factoid type questions by a margin of 2% and 3% evaluated on standard $F_{1}$ and Mean Reciprocal Rank measures, respectively."
pub.1061444808,Devices and circuits for bipolar (V)LSI,"It is shown that bipolar circuits can continue to play an important role in high-performance LSI and VLSI circuits, because power supply voltages and logic swings can be minimized independently of dimensions, and because the speed degradation due to on-chip wiring capacitances is less severe than in MOSFET/MESFET types of circuit. General performance improvements (in speed and packing density) of logic gates are obtained by increasing transistor fT, and decreasing parasitic capacitances, series resistances and device areas, by using oxide isolation, self-aligned techniques and polysilicon electrodes. Fast switching diodes (such as Schottky barrier diodes and lateral polydiodes) improve the flexibility of circuit design. Logic circuits (such as I2L, LS, DTL, ISL, STL, ECL, and NTL), which already perform in LSI and VLSI circuits or are realistic proposals for them, are discussed."

They are representative cyber-physical systems where the cyberspace and the physical world are strongly coupled. However, the safety of mobile robots is significantly threatened by cyber/physical attacks and software/hardware failures. These threats can thwart normal robot operations and cause robot misbehaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection system, which leverages physical dynamics of mobile robots to detect misbehaviors in sensors and actuators. We explore issues raised in real-world implementations, e.g., distinctive robot dynamic models, sensor quantity and quality, decision parameters, etc., for practicality purposes. We implement the detection system on two types of mobile robots and evaluate the detection performance against various misbehavior scenarios, including signal interference, sensor spoofing, logic bomb and physical jamming. The experiments show detection effectiveness and small detection delays."

pub.1111408872,Hierarchical Verification for the BPMN Design Model Using State Space Analysis,"The BPMN design models are widely used in the software development process. Owing to the lack of BPMN standard semantics, formal verification is used to validate whether the BPMN design model is free of undesirable properties. The primary challenges of BPMN design model verification are the enormous size and complexity of BPMN design models; these challenges may lead to time-consuming processes for model abstraction and overcoming the state space explosion problem. This paper proposes a hierarchical verification technique for the state space analysis based on a colored Petri net (CPN). A BPMN partitioning technique and rules for the transformation of a BPMN into a CPN model are provided. The partitioning approach supports the unstructured BPMN design model, and the obtained CPN model also supports hierarchical verification. To validate and analyze the BPMN design model, the transformation technique and state space generator are implemented as a BPMN verification framework. This method is a viable option for the software process designers and is suitable for the large-scale BPMN design model verification."
pub.1122873700,Large-Scale Automatic K-Means Clustering for Heterogeneous Many-Core Supercomputer,"This article presents an automatic $k$k-$means$means clustering solution targeting the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. We first introduce a multilevel parallel partition approach that not only partitions by dataflow and centroid, but also by dimension, which unlocks the potential of the hierarchical parallelism in the heterogeneous many-core processor and the system architecture of the supercomputer. The parallel design is able to process large-scale clustering problems with up to 196,608 dimensions and over 160,000 targeting centroids, while maintaining high performance and high scalability. Furthermore, we propose an automatic hyper-parameter determination process for $k$k-$means$means clustering, by automatically generating and executing the clustering tasks with a set of candidate hyper-parameter, and then determining the optimal hyper-parameter using a proposed evaluation method. The proposed auto-clustering solution can not only achieve high performance and scalability for problems with massive high-dimensional data, but also support clustering without sufficient prior knowledge for the number of targeted clusters, which can potentially increase the scope of $k$k-$means$means algorithm to new application areas."
pub.1105836358,Optimistic Modeling and Simulation of Complex Hardware Platforms and Embedded Systems on Many-Core HPC Clusters,"The large size and complexity of the modern digital hardware impose great challenges to design and validation. Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and System-Level Description Languages (SLDLs) rely on sequential discrete event semantics. Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) has recently gained extensive attention for parallelizing these languages due to the ever-increasing complexity of embedded and cyber physical systems. However, PDES application has not yet reached acceptable maturity and pervasiveness for accelerating computer architecture problems. This is due to inherent complexity of hardware components that require using different advanced PDES techniques. In this paper, we look at the main problem from a radically different angle. First, we suppose there is only a single universal discrete event model of computation for simulation purely defined by distributed optimistic PDES, i.e., logical-process-based event scheduling worldview. Second, we construct a new parallel system-level simulation language called OSML for ESL. Third, we propose a unified Cloud-based CAD tool called Troodon to automatically parallelize existing hardware languages atop OSML. To the best of our knowledge, OSML is the first work on optimistic synchronization applied to hardware-specific SLDLs and hardware models at different levels of abstraction in ESL, which contain complex data structures by proposing a hybrid checkpointing scheme."
pub.1061754729,Industrial Automation as a Cloud Service,"New cloud services are being developed to support a wide variety of real-life applications. In this paper, we introduce a new cloud service: industrial automation, which includes different functionalities from feedback control and telemetry to plant optimization and enterprise management. We focus our study on the feedback control layer as the most time-critical and demanding functionality. Today's large-scale industrial automation projects are expensive and time-consuming. Hence, we propose a new cloud-based automation architecture, and we analyze cost and time savings under the proposed architecture. We show that significant cost and time savings can be achieved, mainly due to the virtualization of controllers and the reduction of hardware cost and associated labor. However, the major difficulties in providing cloud-based industrial automation systems are timeliness and reliability. Offering automation functionalities from the cloud over the Internet puts the controlled processes at risk due to varying communication delays and potential failure of virtual machines and/or links. Thus, we design an adaptive delay compensator and a distributed fault tolerance algorithm to mitigate delays and failures, respectively. We theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed architecture when compared to the traditional systems and prove zero or negligible change in performance. To experimentally evaluate our approach, we implement our controllers on commercial clouds and use them to control: (i) a physical model of a solar power plant, where we show that the fault-tolerance algorithm effectively makes the system unaware of faults, and (ii) industry-standard emulation with large injected delays and disturbances, where we show that the proposed cloud-based controllers perform indistinguishably from the best-known counterparts: local controllers."
pub.1061786735,Service Outsourcing with Process Views,"Service outsourcing is a business paradigm in which an organization has a part of its business process performed by a service provider. Process views are pivotal to support this way of working. A process view shields secret or irrelevant details from a private business process, thus allowing an organization to reveal only public, relevant parts of its private business process to partner organizations. This paper introduces a specification framework to support service outsourcing using process views. To enable the construction of process views at various levels of detail, the framework defines several projection relations between process views and the underlying internal processes. To allow consumers and providers of process views to establish an outsourcing relation, the framework defines several matching relations between the respective views that are comprehensive and flexible for service outsourcing. A proof-of-concept prototype tool implements the framework, which is applied in a case study."

pub.1061788718,Atomicity Analysis of Service Composition across Organizations,"Atomicity is a highly desirable property for achieving application consistency in service compositions. To achieve atomicity, a service composition should satisfy the atomicity sphere, a structural criterion for the backend processes of involved services. Existing analysis techniques for atomicity sphere generally assume complete knowledge of all involved backend processes. Such an assumption is invalid when some service providers do not release all details of their backend processes to service consumers outside the organizations. To address this problem, we propose a process algebraic framework to publish atomicity-equivalent public views from the backend processes. These public views extract relevant task properties and reveal only partial process details that service providers need to expose. Our framework enables the analysis of atomicity sphere for service compositions using these public views instead of their backend processes. This allows service consumers to choose suitable services such that their composition satisfies the atomicity sphere without disclosing the details of their backend processes. Based on the theoretical result, we present algorithms to construct atomicity-equivalent public views and to analyze the atomicity sphere for a service composition. Two case studies from supply chain and insurance domains are given to evaluate our proposal and demonstrate the applicability of our approach."
pub.1061600545,A Quantitative Evaluation of Concurrent Product Development Effectiveness Theories,"We suggest new directions for research on the effectiveness of concurrent product development. These models relate overlapping or functional integration to performance using analytical, simulation, or statistical methods. By collecting quantitative data from 82 research articles, we ascertain the percentage of a methodology's models that have incorporated each of certain significant theoretical features. We then use this information to recommend important underutilized features and a comprehensive theory that integrates the features. Analytical and simulation modelers could make more use of functional integration, while statistical modelers could attend more to overlapping, rework, and the constituent phases of the development process. Then, in finding a subset of interrelated features appearing simultaneously in a majority of a methodology's models, we identify a core theory upon which models in the mainstream build. Next, our study offers specific mutual learning suggestions through which modeling efforts in any one methodology might facilitate modeling efforts in another methodology. Analytical and simulation modelers could study the reluctance to transmit and use preliminary information, while statistical researchers could develop dynamic models. Finally, the study provides a template for researchers willing to apply our evaluation methods to other areas."
pub.1061788860,Preventing Temporal Violations in Scientific Workflows: Where and How,"Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying high-performance infrastructures for scientific workflows such as grid and cloud computing, failures of timely completion of important scientific activities, namely, temporal violations, often take place. Unlike conventional exception handling on functional failures, nonfunctional QoS failures such as temporal violations cannot be passively recovered. They need to be proactively prevented through dynamically monitoring and adjusting the temporal consistency states of scientific workflows at runtime. However, current research on workflow temporal verification mainly focuses on runtime monitoring, while the adjusting strategy for temporal consistency states, namely, temporal adjustment, has so far not been thoroughly investigated. For this issue, two fundamental problems of temporal adjustment, namely, where and how, are systematically analyzed and addressed in this paper. Specifically, a novel minimum probability time redundancy-based necessary and sufficient adjustment point selection strategy is proposed to address the problem of where and an innovative genetic-algorithm-based effective and efficient local rescheduling strategy is proposed to tackle the problem of how. The results of large-scale simulation experiments with generic workflows and specific real-world applications demonstrate that our temporal adjustment strategy can remarkably prevent the violations of both local and global temporal constraints in scientific workflows."
pub.1061515095,From Hardware-in-the-Loop to Hybrid Process Simulation: An Ontology for the Implementation Phase of a Manufacturing System,"Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) is a widely used testing approach for embedded systems, where real components and/or controllers are tested in closed-loop with a simulation model. In this paper, we generalize HIL by combining multiple simulations and real components into a Hybrid Process Simulation (HPS). An HPS is a test setup that contains at least one simulated and one actual component, but may contain many of both. It is implemented such that each simulated component can be swapped out with its real counterpart without making changes to the existing system, and vice versa. In this paper, an ontology which provides a conceptual architecture is developed for an HPS, such that a general interpretation of a manufacturing system's implementation is made possible. A formalized application method is then devised for replacing simulations with real processes and vice versa. A conceptual architecture is put forth that separates the effect of a component from its spatial essence (volume or mass). This separation allows workpieces in a manufacturing process, for example, to go from the physical world into the virtual world (computer simulation) and back again repeatedly. The conceptual architecture is applied to a small manufacturing line in the following scenarios: replacing a real robot with a simulated robot, replacing a manufacturing cell with a simulated manufacturing cell, and adding a new simulated manufacturing cell to the existing system. These applications successfully demonstrate how an HPS can be used to test a manufacturing system setup with multiple regions of real and simulated components. Note to Practitioner—Traditionally, in the manufacturing system development process, once the design is completed, a simulation model is built for design validation. Then, the actual system is built. The confidence of the simulation is limited by the accuracy of the simulation model, and testing of the actual system can be time-consuming with high safety risks, such as personal injury and damages to equipment. To accommodate product changes and revisions, there is an ongoing continuous improvement process on the plant floor, such as reconfiguration of manufacturing system equipment, and adding hardware and software into existing processes. This may result in loss of production due to a long validation period with possibilities of damaged equipment. With the HPS approach outlined in this paper, however, the simulated and actual components can be validated and tested iteratively; this means each component can be tested with more individual focus, without having to wait until the entire process is complete. In the case of modifying an existing system, simulations can be seamlessly integrated with the real process to evaluate different solutions before a particular option is financially committed. Because the actual components are used during the simulation phase, the overall validation accuracy is less dependent on a single simulation model, while the testing s"

Due to time-varying communication channels, dynamic user clustering is a promising method to increase the throughput of NOMA-IoT networks. This article develops an intelligent resource allocation scheme for uplink NOMA-IoT communications. To maximise the average performance of sum rates, this work designs an efficient optimization approach based on two reinforcement learning algorithms, namely deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and SARSA-learning. For light traffic, SARSA-learning is used to explore the safest resource allocation policy with low cost. For heavy traffic, DRL is used to handle traffic-introduced huge variables. With the aid of the considered approach, this work addresses two main problems of fair resource allocation in NOMA techniques: 1) allocating users dynamically and 2) balancing resource blocks and network traffic. We analytically demonstrate that the rate of convergence is inversely proportional to network sizes. Numerical results show that: 1) Compared with the optimal benchmark scheme, the proposed DRL and SARSA-learning algorithms have lower complexity with acceptable accuracy and 2) NOMA-enabled IoT networks outperform the conventional orthogonal multiple access based IoT networks in terms of system throughput."
pub.1154838565,A Multi-Transformation Evolutionary Framework for Influence Maximization in Social Networks,"Influence maximization is a crucial issue for mining the deep information of social networks, which aims to select a seed set from the network to maximize the number of influenced nodes. To evaluate the influence spread of a seed set efficiently, existing studies have proposed transformations with lower computational costs to replace the expensive Monte Carlo simulation process. These alternate transformations, based on network prior knowledge, induce different search behaviors with similar characteristics to various perspectives. Specifically, it is difficult for users to determine a suitable transformation a priori. This article proposes a multi-transformation evolutionary framework for influence maximization (MTEFIM) with convergence guarantees to exploit the potential similarities and unique advantages of alternate transformations and to avoid users manually determining the most suitable one. In MTEFIM, multiple transformations are optimized simultaneously as multiple tasks. Each transformation is assigned an evolutionary solver. Three major components of MTEFIM are conducted via: 1) estimating the potential relationship across transformations based on the degree of overlap across individuals of different populations, 2) transferring individuals across populations adaptively according to the inter-transformation relationship, and 3) selecting the final output seed set containing all the transformation's knowledge. The effectiveness of MTEFIM is validated on both benchmarks and real-world social networks. The experimental results show that MTEFIM can efficiently utilize the potentially transferable knowledge across multiple transformations to achieve highly competitive performance compared to several popular IM-specific methods. The implementation of MTEFIM can be accessed through the external link in the footnote.1"

pub.1173174565,EtherCloak: Enabling Multi-Level and Customized Privacy on Account-Model Blockchains,"The lack of privacy-preserving capabilities hinders the further development of blockchains and smart contracts. While numerous privacy solutions have been proposed, limitations persist. Firstly, most existing solutions focus on specific privacy protections such as anonymous payments, private data, or multi-party computation tasks. However, these solutions lack a general privacy ability, allowing users to deploy applications with diverse privacy requirements. Secondly, existing solutions have limited customizability, which means users cannot easily customize and adapt the privacy policies according to their specific demands or preferences. In this paper, we present EtherCloak, which adopts trusted execution environments (TEEs) to achieve a general and customizable privacy policy on account model blockchains, enabling users to conceal any on-chain information. To address the security issues caused by the unreliability of the host the TEE runs on, we design the enclave state check and crash recovery mechanisms and employ them in the block generation process. In addition, we propose an access control mechanism for privacy policy management and data query. We prove that EtherCloak offers general and customizable privacy protection with a minimal increase in transaction size (less than triple) and communication overhead (approximately 10%) compared to Ethereum."
pub.1061786830,Automatic Web Service Composition Based on Uncertainty Execution Effects,"By arranging multiple existing web services into workflows to create value-added services, automatic web service composition has received much attention in service-oriented computing. A large number of methods have been proposed for it although most of them are merely based on the matching of input-output parameters of services. Besides these parameters, some other elements can affect the execution of services and their composition, such as the preconditions and service execution results. In particular, the execution effects of some services are often uncertain because of the complex and dynamically changing application environments in the real world, and this can cause the emergence of nondeterministic choices in the workflows of composite services. However, the previous methods for automatic service composition mainly rely on sequential structures, which make them difficult to take into account uncertain effects during service composition. In this paper, Graphplan is employed and extended to tackle this problem. In order to model services with uncertain effects, we first extend the original form of Graphplan. Then, we propose a novel approach that can introduce branch structures into composite solutions to cope with such uncertainty in the service composition process. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate and analyze the proposed methodology."
pub.1169563841,A Composite Decomposition Method for Large-Scale Global Optimization,"Cooperative co-evolution (CC) algorithms, based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, have emerged as the predominant approach to solving large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problems. The efficiency and accuracy of the grouping stage significantly impact the performance of the optimization process. While the general separability grouping (GSG) method has overcome the limitation of previous differential grouping (DG) methods by enabling the decomposition of non-additively separable functions, it suffers from high computational complexity. To address this challenge, this article proposes a composite separability grouping (CSG) method, seamlessly integrating DG and GSG into a problem decomposition framework to utilize the strengths of both approaches. CSG introduces a step-by-step decomposition framework that accurately decomposes various problem types using fewer computational resources. By sequentially identifying additively, multiplicatively and generally separable variables, CSG progressively groups non-separable variables by recursively considering the interactions between each non-separable variable and the formed non-separable groups. Furthermore, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of CSG, we introduce two innovative methods: a multiplicatively separable variable detection method and a non-separable variable grouping method. These two methods are designed to effectively detect multiplicatively separable variables and efficiently group non-separable variables, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSG achieves more accurate variable grouping with lower computational complexity compared to GSG and state-of-the-art DG series designs."
pub.1171131746,Constrained Probabilistic Pareto Dominance for Expensive Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Problems,"This paper proposes a new parameterless constraint-handling technique, named constrained probabilistic Pareto dominance (CPPD), for expensive constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). In CPPD, when comparing two solutions, in terms of each original objective, we design a new objective for each solution, which is the negative product of two probabilities calculated based on the predicted fitness mean values and the uncertainty information provided by Kriging models: 1) the probability that this solution satisfies all constraints, denoted as PoF, and 2) the probability that this solution is better than the other on the original objective, denoted as PoB. It is evident that for each solution, PoF and PoB indicate its feasibility and its optimality on the corresponding original objective, respectively. Then, Pareto dominance based on new objectives is executed. As a result, both competitive feasible solutions and promising infeasible solutions with good diversity can be preserved by CPPD. These two kinds of solutions can help the population to exploit the located feasible parts and to explore new feasible parts, respectively. Further, based on CPPD, we develop a Pareto-based Kriging-assisted constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (called PEA) to deal with expensive CMOPs with two or three objectives. Finally, PEA is generalized to solve expensive constrained many-objective optimization problems, named PEA+. The effectiveness of CPPD, PEA, and PEA+ is verified by comprehensive experiments."
pub.1158635790,SiGe and CMOS Technology for State-of-the-Art Millimeter-Wave Transceivers,"Innovation and evolution are paramount where the demand for wideband, data-intensive connectivity is ever-increasing, and the only constant is change. Standards that define the operation of next-generation mobile networks are moving away from the traditional radio frequency (RF) spectrum and into millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands. The physical layer (PHY) for IEEE 802.11ad Wi-Fi and 802.11ay WLANs dictates operation in the unlicensed 60 GHz band. 5G New Radio (NR) applications utilize selected bands from 26 to 39 GHz. Additionally, newly developing Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) applications depend on 5G NR as an enabling technology. Satellite communications and wireless backhaul will occur in E-band between 70–86 GHz. Increasing demands from the market cause designers to push boundaries, and the development of standards guide technological advances. Perhaps the most substantial improvements are observed in integrated circuit technology. This article details the major Si processes, namely Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) and SiGe Bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS), and their foray into the wireless transceiver space traditionally dominated by GaAs. CMOS and BiCMOS have become popular in many communities because of their low fabrication cost and excellent digital integration capabilities. RF performance has matured to where Si is a serious competitor for tried-and-tested III-V technologies. Some extreme environments and sophisticated applications still favor GaAs and GaN, however. GaAs, for example, can yield unparalleled output power and excellent noise figure performance, albeit at a higher cost and increased design and manufacturing complexity due to the multi-chip nature of these circuits."
pub.1061789122,Automated Synthesis of Mediators to Support Component Interoperability,"Interoperability is a major concern for the software engineering field, given the increasing need to compose components dynamically and seamlessly. This dynamic composition is often hampered by differences in the interfaces and behaviours of independently-developed components. To address these differences without changing the components, mediators that systematically enforce interoperability between functionally-compatible components by mapping their interfaces and coordinating their behaviours are required. Existing approaches to mediator synthesis assume that an interface mapping is provided which specifies the correspondence between the operations and data of the components at hand. In this paper, we present an approach based on ontology reasoning and constraint programming in order to infer mappings between components' interfaces automatically. These mappings guarantee semantic compatibility between the operations and data of the interfaces. Then, we analyse the behaviours of components in order to synthesise, if possible, a mediator that coordinates the computed mappings so as to make the components interact properly. Our approach is formally-grounded to ensure the correctness of the synthesised mediator. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by implementing the MICS (Mediator synthesis to Connect Components) tool and experimenting it with various real-world case studies."
pub.1061788857,Efficient Consistency Measurement Based on Behavioral Profiles of Process Models,"Engineering of process-driven business applications can be supported by process modeling efforts in order to bridge the gap between business requirements and system specifications. However, diverging purposes of business process modeling initiatives have led to significant problems in aligning related models at different abstract levels and different perspectives. Checking the consistency of such corresponding models is a major challenge for process modeling theory and practice. In this paper, we take the inappropriateness of existing strict notions of behavioral equivalence as a starting point. Our contribution is a concept called behavioral profile that captures the essential behavioral constraints of a process model. We show that these profiles can be computed efficiently, i.e., in cubic time for sound free-choice Petri nets w.r.t. their number of places and transitions. We use behavioral profiles for the definition of a formal notion of consistency which is less sensitive to model projections than common criteria of behavioral equivalence and allows for quantifying deviation in a metric way. The derivation of behavioral profiles and the calculation of a degree of consistency have been implemented to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. We also report the findings from checking consistency between partially overlapping models of the SAP reference model."

pub.1061179930,"CAD challenges for microsensors, microactuators, and microsystems","In parallel with the development of new technologies, new device configurations, and new applications for microsensors, microactuators, and microsystems, also referred to as microelectromechanical devices and systems (MEMS), there has arisen a growing need for computer-aided engineering and design systems. There is a wide range of design problems: process simulation, solid-body geometric renderings from photomasks and process descriptions, energetically correct simulations of behavior across multiple coupled energy domains, extraction of lumped low-order models of device behavior, optimization of geometry and process sequence, and design of full systems that include MEMS devices. Because of the computational demands of the modeling required to support full computer-aided design (CAD), there is a premium on fast and memory-efficient algorithms that help the designer, both by automating, where possible, complex sets of related tasks and by providing rapid computational prototyping at critical points in the design cycle. This paper presents an overview of the present state of the art in CAD for MEMS, with particular emphasis on the role of macromodels and test structures as part of the design environment."
pub.1149506185,Scheduling Under Uncertainty for Industry 4.0 and 5.0,"This article provides a review about how uncertainties in increasingly complex production and supply chains should be addressed in scheduling tasks. Uncertainty management will be particularly important in Industry 5.0 solutions that will require the close integration of operators and technical systems. To prepare for these challenging developments, this work reviews the sources of uncertainty and the scheduling algorithms that deal with the different types of models developed to handle the uncertain nature of the elements and the environment of complex technological systems. The paper not only identifies the challenges, but also the main building blocks that can help to manage and reduce uncertainties based on the I4.0 and I5.0 solutions. We hope that this study will serve as a starting point for R&D projects and algorithm developments, which will be needed primarily in the field of multi-agent, multistage and inverse optimizations."
pub.1107110573,Dengue Epidemics Prediction: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art Based on Data Science Processes,"Dengue infection is a mosquitoborne disease caused by dengue viruses, which are carried by several species of mosquito of the genus Aedes, principally Ae. aegypti. Dengue outbreaks are endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, mainly in urban and sub-urban areas. The outbreak is one of the top 10 diseases causing the most deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, dengue infection has increased 30-fold globally over the past five decades. About 50–100 million new infections occur annually in more than 80 countries. Many researchers are working on measures to prevent and control the spread. One avenue of research is collaboration between computer science and the epidemiology researchers in developing methods of predicting potential outbreaks of dengue infection. An important research objective is to develop models that enable, or enhance, forecasting of outbreaks of dengue, giving medical professionals the opportunity to develop plans for handling the outbreak, well in advance. Researchers have been gathering and analyzing data to better identify the relational factors driving the spread of the disease, as well as the development of a variety of methods of predictive modeling using statistical and mathematical analysis and machine learning. In this substantial review of the literature on the state of the art of research over the past decades, we identified six main issues to be explored and analyzed: 1) the available data sources; 2) data preparation techniques; 3) data representations; 4) forecasting models and methods; 5) dengue forecasting models evaluation approaches; and 6) future challenges and possibilities in forecasting modeling of dengue outbreaks. Our comprehensive exploration of the issues provides a valuable information foundation for new researchers in this important area of public health research and epidemiology."

pub.1061591698,Device and Technology Evolution for Si-Based RF Integrated Circuits,"The relationships between device feature size and device performance figures of merit (FoMs) are more complex for radio frequency (RF) applications than for digital applications. Using the devices in the key circuit blocks for typical RF transceivers, we review and give trends for the FoMs that characterize active and passive RF devices. These FoMs include transit frequency at unity current gain $f_T $, maximum frequency of oscillation $f_{\rm MAX} $ at unit power gain, noise, breakdown voltage, capacitor density, varactor and inductor quality, and the like. We use the specifications for wireless communications systems to show how different Si-based devices may achieve acceptable FoMs. We focus on Si complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS), Si Bipolar CMOS, and Si bipolar devices, including SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors, RF devices, and integrated circuits (ICs). We analyze trends in the FoMs for Si-based RF devices and ICs and show how these trends relate to the technology nodes of the 2003 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. We also compare FoMs for the best reported performance of research devices and for the performance of devices manufactured in high volumes, typically more than 10 000 devices.11Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this article to specify adequately the experimental or theoretical procedures.

pub.1061095328,On the very-high-current degradations on Si n-p-n transistors,"The stressing of 0.8- mu m double-poly self-aligned Si n-p-n transistors at current densities up to 12.5 mA/ mu m/sup 2/ is discussed. The emitter contact does not fail abruptly; rather, its contact resistance drifts gradually. The contact resistance increases when the current flows out of the emitter and decreases when the current is reversed. The drift in emitter resistance can be thermally accelerated and is consistent with the electromigration phenomenon. The emitter-base junction shows negligible degradation when stressed in normal-mode operation, i.e. the current flows out of the emitter. However, the junction degrades when stressed with open collector or when stressed in inverse mode. The annealing experiments show that the junction degradation results from the interface-state generation. However, the drift in contact resistance cannot be recovered by annealing. The causes of junction degradation are suggested.<>"

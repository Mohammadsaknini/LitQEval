pub.1174418685,A canonical software process family based on the Unified Process,"The Unified Process (UP) is a processes framework widely known and used by the software industry and academic community. UP was developed under the conception of a universal application, but even a single process is not appropriate to address all development projects since optimal process depends on the particularities of each project or organization. Frequently, many process components need to be adapted to the organization or project needs, a complex task because the experience and knowledge required. Perform adaptation in an inappropriate way is prone to error due to the difficulties for taking tailoring decisions. The paper goal is proposing a canonical software processes family based on the Unified Process to support software process tailoring. Our methodology was based on the meta-process CASPER to build a software process family and we use the Case Study method as a strategy for validating the canonical process family empirically. As a result, we show a canonical software processes family, which will serve as a platform for determining a process family based on Unified process in a small software organization. This canonical family has the advantage that uses a tailoring mechanism following a transformation strategy that encapsulates tailoring decisions in order to systematize this activity. In this work, we show the initial results in the applicability of a canonical software process family as base in the building the software process families based on UP in the small companies context, and also we conclude that the UP is a process framework with spread spectrum, which limited its formulation like a general software process family, due to that a process family requires determining carefully the application domain known as software process family scope"
pub.1077939532,The role of chemical engineering in process development and optimization.,"This review focuses on the roles that chemical engineers can play in the development, scale-up and optimization of synthetic processes for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients. This multidisciplinary endeavor involves close collaboration among chemists and chemical engineers, and, for successful products, involves bridging the R&D and manufacturing enterprises. Balancing these disparate elements in the face of ever-mounting competitive pressures to shorten development timelines and ever-tightening regulatory, safety and environmental constraints, has become a critical business objective for all pharmaceutical companies. The concept of focusing development resources on selected critical process features as a function of phase within the development cycle will be discussed. In addition, several examples of chemical engineering- focused process development and optimization will be presented."
pub.1034312456,"How Preferences for Public Participation are Linked to Perceptions of the Context, Preferences for Outcomes, and Individual Characteristics","Practitioners and stakeholders involved in environmental and risk assessment and decision-making efforts have access to a growing list of policies and guidance for implementing good process. The advice is often general. There is little understanding of how situation specific features are relevant in new circumstances. In a series of ten case studies we investigated how people’s (a) perceptions of the context, (b) preferences for outcomes, and (c) affiliations, experiences and motivations are related to their preferences for process features in a particular situation. The cases are in three policy areas: watershed management, forestry management, and clean-up and public health management of radioactively contaminated sites. We conclude this paper with a discussion of how the results can inform process design. Process design should be based on a diagnostic approach that specifically assesses relevant situational characteristics."
pub.1170475976,Continuous direct compression of a commercially batch-manufactured tablet formulation with two different processing lines,"The transfer from batch-based to continuous tablet manufacturing increases the quality and efficiency of processes. Nonetheless, as in the development of a batch process, the continuous process design requires optimization studies to ensure a robust process. In this study, processing of a commercially batch-manufactured tablet product was tested with two continuous direct compression lines while keeping the original formulation composition and tablet quality requirements. Tableting runs were conducted with different values of process parameters. Changes in parameter settings were found to cause differences in tablet properties. Most of these quality properties could be controlled and maintained within the set limits effortlessly already at this stage of studies. However, the API content and content uniformity seemed to require more investigation. The observed content uniformity challenges were traced to individual tablets with a high amount of API. This was suspected to be caused by API micro-agglomerates since tablet weight variability did not explain the issue. This could be solved by adding a mill between two blenders in the process line. Overall, this case study produced promising results with both tested manufacturing lines since many tablet properties complied with the test result limits without optimization of process parameter settings."
pub.1093480635,Variability in Software Process Models: Requirements for Adoption in Industrial Settings,"It is an increasing trend to apply Software Product Line (SPL) concepts and techniques for software process tailoring, generating a Software PRocess Line (SPrL). However, there are several aspects that must be addressed before SPrLs can be fully adopted by industry, a key aspect being how software process variability is specified and managed. In the literature, there are several general-purpose as well as domain-specific proposals for specifying process variability. In this paper, we analyze the benefits and drawbacks of two general-purpose (feature models and OVM) and two domain-specific (SPEM variability primitives and vSPEM) approaches, as well as discuss what hinders industry adoption in each case."
pub.1093832512,Leveraging CVL to Manage Variability in Software Process Lines,"Variability on project requirements often implies variability on software processes. To manage such variability, Software Process Lines (SPLs) can be used to represent commonality (i.e., common practices) and variability (i.e., differences) of a set of related software processes. To this end, some Software Process Modeling Languages (SPMLs) natively integrate variability mechanisms. Nevertheless, such a coupling between the SPML and the variability mechanisms i) requires to interpret the requirements variability in terms of the processes variability, ii) limits the reuse of the requirements variability for other purposes (e.g., the development itself), and iii) is a barrier to the use of advances from the field of variability management. In this paper, we propose an approach to apply the Common Variability Language (CVL from the OMG consortium) for requirement variability modeling and its binding to the processes. This work is illustrated on a family of industrial Java development processes. Our approach enables the definition of an SPL and the automatic derivation of a process from this SPL according to the requirements of a given project. The variability is managed separately from the process model and benefits from existing tools coming from the process modeling community and CVL."
pub.1150554443,Factor-based assessment of continuous bio-H2 production from cheese whey,"Despite having been widely investigated, dark fermentative H<sub>2</sub> production from organic residues is still limited by process-related issues which may hamper the perspectives of full-scale process implementation. Such constraints are mainly due to the process complexity, which is largely affected by multiple and often mutually interacting factors. In the present work, the results of continuous fermentative H<sub>2</sub> production experiments using synthetic cheese whey as the input substrate were used to gain detailed knowledge of the process features and identify suitable and critical operating conditions. Specifically, innovative process interpretation involved a combination of analytical characterization of the fermentation broth, mass balance calculations and statistical methods (correlation and principal component analyses) to derive systematic considerations for process characterization and scale-up. The metabolic products mainly included acetate and butyrate, which however were likely to derive (in different proportions depending on the operating conditions) from both hydrogenogenic and competing pathways. For some tests, lactate and succinate were also found to have been formed. It was observed that the main features of the process (H<sub>2</sub> yield and rate, stability condition) were correlated with the operational and analytical parameters. The first three principal components identified by the statistical analysis were able to account for: 1) the effect of retention time and total metabolites produced; 2) biogas (H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>) generation, butyrate production and stability condition; and 3) organic loading rate and propionate production. The results suggested that the main features of hydrogenogenic fermentation can be described by a reduced set of factors that may be usefully adopted for both process monitoring and prediction purposes."
pub.1021871976,MDE software process lines in small companies,"Software organizations specify their software processes so that process knowledge can be systematically reused across projects. However, different projects may require different processes. Defining a separate process for each potential project context is expensive and error-prone, since these processes must simultaneously evolve in a consistent manner. Moreover, an organization cannot envision all possible project contexts in advance because several variables may be involved, and these may also be combined in different ways. This problem is even worse in small companies since they usually cannot afford to define more than one process. Software process lines are a specific type of software product lines, in the software process domain. A benefit of software process lines is that they allow software process customization with respect to a context. In this article we propose a model-driven approach for software process lines specification and configuration. The article also presents two industrial case studies carried out at two small Chilean software development companies. Both companies have benefited from applying our approach to their processes: new projects are now developed using custom processes, process knowledge is systematically reused, and the total time required to customize a process is much shorter than before."
pub.1094703784,Definition of Software Process Lines for Integration of Scrum and CMMI,"The adoption of Agile Methods, like Scrum, in conjunction with maturity models, like Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), often leads to variation of process. Process definition is a complex and difficult task, requiring a lot of effort and experience. Software Process Line (SPrL) has been considered a suitable paradigm for software process tailoring and reuse; and there is a lack of approaches that use SPrL concepts for modeling these approaches in conjunction. This paper presents the definition of a SPrL considering Project Planning and Project Monitoring and Control process areas in processes using Scrum agile methodology together with CMMI maturity model. It is expected the presented SPrL assists software organizations to tailor processes that meet both approaches."
pub.1005241508,Toward a classification scheme for software process modelling approaches,"A variety of software process modelling approaches (SPMAs) are available whereby abstract representations of the software process can be constructed for the purpose of software process understanding, assessment and automation. Given the diversity of approaches available, a classification scheme is proposed for comparing existing SPMAs, and for classifying and discussing future work. The scheme is derived through consideration of existing SPMAs and their context in relation to other process entities, taking account of SPMA objectives, properties of the process modelling language, process features modelled and SPMA worldview. The scheme is illustrated and discussed through classification of a representative sample of SPMAs."
pub.1137347134,A hybrid NIR-soft sensor method for real time in-process control during continuous direct compression manufacturing operations,"Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is commonly utilized for continuous manufacturing as Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tool. This paper focus on a continuous direct compression manufacturing process, in which an NIR PAT probe is integrated into the tablet press feed frame and into the tablet diversion control system to ensure continuous monitoring of the potency and homogeneity of the blend within the process line. The quantification of NIR spectra is achieved through Partial Least-Squares (PLS) modeling, calibrated with offline analyzed tablet cores at different potency levels. Because the NIR measurements are often sensitive to sample physical properties caused by raw materials or process conditions, etc., adopting a data-driven approach will require a large amount of representative data throughout the method lifecycle. During the early stages of process development, whenever new uncaptured source of variability in the model space are encountered, the chemometric predictions can deviate from the offline reference, requiring frequent model updates. These deviations can be reduced by integrating process and physico-chemical knowledge in the on-line potency estimation. This paper presents a novel hybrid method combining the online NIR PLS and a potency soft sensor estimation, enabling a robust potency prediction whilst minimizing maintenance downtimes and facilitating cross-site method transfer."
pub.1107809783,Odyssey-ProcessCase,"Software processes have been the focus of discussion in the literature, but defining a software process that meets project-specific needs remains a challenge. The Software Process Line (SPrL) technique offers a systematic to identify processes' similarities and variability to support software process reuse. Based on a literature review analysis, a concentration of SPrL approaches that use mapping/rules techniques to support project-specific software process definition was observed. However, the knowledge acquisition process required by this kind of technique is not trivial, due to the unavailability of experts and overhead in domain engineering. This paper presents an incremental learning approach for SPrL, called Odyssey-ProcessCase, focused on the decision-making support to solve SPrL variability during the project-specific software process definition. The approach applies techniques such as Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule-Based System to offer complementary mechanisms to support the decision-making task aiming at the software process definition from reusable artifacts of SPrL."
pub.1005783961,Parental experience of family resources in single‐parent families having a child with cancer,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to explore the essence of family experiences in terms of family resources and how these assist a single-parent caring for a child with cancer.
BACKGROUND: When families face stresses caused by cancer, they need to readjust their roles, interactive patterns and relationships, both inside and outside the family. During the adaptation process, family resources may assist recovery from stress and a return to equilibrium. Most research has emphasised the support resources available to two-parent families during the treatment process. There is a lack of information on the experiences of single-parent families and their available resources together with the functions and roles played by family resources during the adjustment process.
DESIGN: Qualitative.
RESULTS: Five major themes were identified: (i) facing the disease with courage; (ii) hope kindled by professionals; (iii) constructing parental role ability; (iv) assisting the children to live with the illness; and (v) family flexibility.
CONCLUSION: The results of the current study demonstrate that single-parent families with a child suffering from cancer employ family resources to assist family adjustment and to maintain family function/equilibrium. These results explain the dynamic interactions between the multiple levels of resources available to the family.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The study results provide evidence-based information that identifies the nature of family resources in single-parent families and describes how these resources can be applied to assist the families."
pub.1144811595,Swarm intelligence-based model for improving prediction performance of low-expectation teams in educational software engineering projects,"Software engineering is one of the most significant areas, which extensively used in educational and industrial fields. Software engineering education plays an essential role in keeping students up to date with software technologies, products, and processes that are commonly applied in the software industry. The software development project is one of the most important parts of the software engineering course, because it covers the practical side of the course. This type of project helps strengthening students' skills to collaborate in a team spirit to work on software projects. Software project involves the composition of software product and process parts. Software product part represents software deliverables at each phase of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) while software process part captures team activities and behaviors during SDLC. The low-expectation teams face challenges during different stages of software project. Consequently, predicting performance of such teams is one of the most important tasks for learning process in software engineering education. The early prediction of performance for low-expectation teams would help instructors to address difficulties and challenges related to such teams at earliest possible phases of software project to avoid project failure. Several studies attempted to early predict the performance for low-expectation teams at different phases of SDLC. This study introduces swarm intelligence -based model which essentially aims to improve the prediction performance for low-expectation teams at earliest possible phases of SDLC by implementing Particle Swarm Optimization-K Nearest Neighbours (PSO-KNN), and it attempts to reduce the number of selected software product and process features to reach higher accuracy with identifying less than 40 relevant features. Experiments were conducted on the Software Engineering Team Assessment and Prediction (SETAP) project dataset. The proposed model was compared with the related studies and the state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) classifiers: Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), standard KNN, and J48. The proposed model provides superior results compared to the traditional ML classifiers and state-of-the-art studies in the investigated phases of software product and process development."
pub.1018053542,Continuous production of poly([R]-3-hydroxybutyrate) by Cupriavidus necator in a multistage bioreactor cascade,"Poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) constitute biodegradable polyesters and are considered among the most promising candidates to replace common petrochemical plastics in various applications. To date, all commercial processes for PHA production employ microbial discontinuous fed-batch fermentations. These processes feature drawbacks such as varying product quality and the inevitable periods of downtime for preparation and post-treatment of the bioreactor equipment. An unprecedented approach to PHA production was chosen in the presented work using a multistage system consisting of five continuous stirred tank reactors in series (5-SCR), which can be considered as a process engineering substitute of a continuous tubular plug flow reactor. The first stage of the reactor cascade is the site of balanced bacterial growth; thereafter, the fermentation broth is continuously fed from the first into the subsequent reactors, where PHA accumulation takes place under nitrogen-limiting conditions. Cupriavidus necator was used as production strain. The focus of the experimental work was devoted to the development of a PHA production process characterized by high productivity and high intracellular polymer content. The results of the experimental work with the reactor cascade demonstrated its potential in terms of volumetric and specific productivity (1.85 g L−1 h−1 and 0.100 g g−1 h−1, respectively), polymer content (77%, w/w) and polymer properties (Mw = 665 kg/mol, PDI = 2.6). Thus, implementing the technology for 5-SCR production of PHB results in an economically viable process. The study compares the outcome of the work with literature data from continuous two-stage PHA production and industrial PHA production in fed-batch mode."
pub.1152677405,Advancing the scholarship and practice of stakeholder engagement in working landscapes: a co-produced research agenda,"Participatory approaches to science and decision making, including stakeholder engagement, are increasingly common for managing complex socio-ecological challenges in working landscapes. However, critical questions about stakeholder engagement in this space remain. These include normative, political, and ethical questions concerning who participates, who benefits and loses, what good can be accomplished, and for what, whom, and by who. First, opportunities for addressing justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion interests through engagement, while implied in key conceptual frameworks, remain underexplored in scholarly work and collaborative practice alike. A second line of inquiry relates to research–practice gaps. While both the practice of doing engagement work and scholarly research on the efficacy of engagement is on the rise, there is little concerted interplay among ‘on-the-ground’ practitioners and scholarly researchers. This means scientific research often misses or ignores insight grounded in practical and experiential knowledge, while practitioners are disconnected from potentially useful scientific research on stakeholder engagement. A third set of questions concerns gaps in empirical understanding of the efficacy of engagement processes and includes inquiry into how different engagement contexts and process features affect a range of behavioral, cognitive, and decision-making outcomes. Because of these gaps, a cohesive and actionable research agenda for stakeholder engagement research and practice in working landscapes remains elusive. In this review article, we present a co-produced research agenda for stakeholder engagement in working landscapes. The co-production process involved professionally facilitated and iterative dialogue among a diverse and international group of over 160 scholars and practitioners through a yearlong virtual workshop series. The resulting research agenda is organized under six cross-cutting themes: (1) Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion; (2) Ethics; (3) Research and Practice; (4) Context; (5) Process; and (6) Outcomes and Measurement. This research agenda identifies critical research needs and opportunities relevant for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike. We argue that addressing these research opportunities is necessary to advance knowledge and practice of stakeholder engagement and to support more just and effective engagement processes in working landscapes."
pub.1094407996,Supporting the Definition of Software Processes at Consulting Organizations via Software Process Lines,"Software Process Consulting Organizations (SPCOs) support other organizations to define, deploy, and improve their software processes. Usually they are requested to define similar processes to different organizations, leading to some process reuse opportunities. Software Process Lines (SPLs) are reusable process architectures that model similarities and variabilities among processes, and could be of great value for SPCOs to derive multiple processes based on the same original SPL. This paper presents a reuse-based software process definition approach that aims at making it easier for consulting organizations to define reusable processes. We describe the main concepts related to a SPL, and how to define and use them in this context. We also present a supporting tool to define SPLs and derive defined processes. Finally, we present a usage experience of the approach in the context of a SPCO in Brazil."
pub.1008187633,Building Software Process Line Architectures from Bottom Up,"In this paper, we propose a technique for establishing process lines, which are sets of common processes in particular problem domains, and process line architectures that incorporate commonality and variability. Process line architectures are used as a basis for deriving process lines from the perspective of overall optimization. The proposed technique includes some extensions to the Software Process Engineering Metamodel for clearly expressing the commonality and variability in the process workflows described as UML activity diagrams. As a result of applying the proposed technique to hardware/software co-design processes in an embedded system domain, it is found that the proposed technique is useful for defining consistent and project-specific processes efficiently."
pub.1094184369,Template-Based vs. Automatic Process Tailoring,"Software process lines (SPrL) is a trend in software companies for generating software processes adapted to specific project contexts, i.e., process tailoring. There are several strategies for process tailoring ranging from having a unique process always applied, to defining a specific process for each project, the former is inefficient while the latter is expensive. Two intermediate strategies used in industry and academia are template-based and automatic process tailoring. In this paper we present a case-study where we compare the productivity and quality of both strategies measured in terms of extra or missing process elements. We applied both strategies to the SPrL of a small Chilean company and we found that automatic tailoring is always more productive, but this difference is mitigated when the predefined processes are those more frequently applied."
pub.1094563585,A megamodel for Software Process Line modeling and evolution,"Companies formalize software processes as a way of organizing development projects. Since there are differences in project contexts, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work well in practice. Some companies use a family of a predefined processes, but this approach has a high process maintenance cost. Instead, we define Software Process Lines (SPrL), where a general process with variability is tailored to project contexts. Model- Driven Engineering (MDE) provides a formal framework for defining the models and transformations required for automated SPrL tailoring. However, this approach requires the definition and co-evolution of various types of models and tool support beyond the skills of process engineers, making the industrial adoption challenging. This paper shares our experience using a megamodeling approach to the development of the back-end of our toolset. The megamodel provides a uniform mechanism for process definition, variability, tailoring and evolution, and we hide the MDE complexity through a user-friendly front-end. We report the application of our approach at Mobius, a small Chilean software enterprise."
pub.1120139092,Software Process Definition using Process Lines: A Systematic Literature Review,"Software processes have been the focus of discussion in literature, but defining a software process remains a challenge. The Software Process Line (SPrL) technique offers a systematic process reuse approach that identifies processes' similarities and variability. This study aims to characterize the state-of-the-art of the software process definition using SPrL. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted and 26 papers were identified to be studied in depth. The results indicate a concentration of approaches that use mapping/rules techniques to support variability resolution and the need for integrated supporting tools. In addition, three problems that affect the software process definition using SPrL were observed: (1) low understanding of SPrL models complexity and their impact, (2) lack of understanding about the impacts of the defined software process, and (3) experts' knowledge dependence issues in decision-making to solve variability."
pub.1136163365,Towards a Biology-Based Approach to Support Software Process Line Evolution,"Considering the fact that the process by which software is developed influences the final product quality, companies are concerned with their process definitions. However, defining a software process is a complex activity, as well as a risky one. In this scenario, different software process reuse techniques have been proposed in the literature, such as Software Process Line (SPrL). SPrL provides a systematic way to support software process reuse, aiming to increase the reuse potential, risk reduction, among other benefits. However, SPrL is not being widely used in industry yet, mainly due to the lack of support, e.g., SPrL evolution support. SPrL evolution research topic investigates the modifications (e.g., maintenance, improvement, tailoring) performed during the SPrL lifecycle and helps to understand and manage them. Although it has not been appropriately explored by previous studies, it is important to support SPrL useful life extension through enabling practices and technologies. Aware that engineers often try to learn from their natural counterparts to solve problems following approaches in nature, this paper analyzes four theories of biological evolution aiming at interpreting its concepts and terms within the SPrL evolution context. Different SPrL evolution’s open research points were observed. It is expected that this work supports future investigations to propose a biology-based approach to support SPrL evolution."
pub.1036866528,Software process line discovery,"Companies define software processes for planning and guiding projects. Since process definition is expensive, and in practice, no one process ""fits all"" projects, the current trend is to define a Software Process Line (SPrL): a base process that represents the common process elements, along with its potential variability. Specifying a SPrL is more expensive than just specifying one process, but the SPrL can be adapted to specific project contexts, minimizing the amount of extra work carried out by employees. Mining project logs has proven to be a promising approach for discovering the process that is applied in practice. However, considering all the possible variations that may be logged, the mined process may be overly complex. Some algorithms deal with this by filtering infrequent relations between log events, but they may discard relevant relations. In this paper we propose the v-algorithm that uses two thresholds to set up a SPrL: highly frequent relations are used to build the base process, variable relations define process variability, and rare relations are discarded as noise. We applied the $v$-$algorithm$ to the project log of Mobius, a small Chilean software company. We obtained a SPrL where we identified unexpected alternative ways of performing certain activities, as well as an optional activity that was originally specified as mandatory."
pub.1040903366,Generalized Process Family Modeling Based on Process Platform,"Process family based on process platform provides an effective solution for rapid process design in mass customization production. Generally speaking, process platform includes three aspects: generic structure, generic planning and variety parameters. The essence of narrow sense process family is generic structure of generic process, in order to achieve the purpose of rapid response of manufacturing as the product family in product design and configuration in rapid response design, based on process platform the connotation of generalized process family is confirmed, which includes three aspects: generic process feature, process knowledge and generic process structure. The architecture of generalized process family is described, and the model of generalized process family is formulated which can be represented by Extensible Markup Language (XML). Finally, the generalized process family of satellite plate is constructed to illustrate the main results."
pub.1107809773,Comparing SMartySPEM and vSPEM for Modeling Variability in Software Processes,"Customizing and reusing software processes is a common practice for addressing the diversity of software projects. This fact expanded the number of Software Process Lines (SPrL) researches based on concepts derived from the Software Product Line approach. However, SPrL is still incipient with regard to existing literature providing de facto empirical studies on comparing SPrL variability modeling capabilities. In this context, approaches such as SMartySPEM and vSPEM, both based on the Metamodel Software and System Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM), were proposed as annotative mechanisms for variabilities representation in SPrL. We compared SMartySPEM and vSPEM for comprehensibility and variability mechanism in a previous controlled quasi-experiment. Results from such study suggested further investigation on variability modeling of both approaches. Therefore, this paper presents an empirical study, which qualitatively compares such approaches based on Modularity, Traceability, Error Detection, Granularity, Adoption and Systematic Variability Management. Experts were invited to contribute to our study. Their feedback was analyzed based on Grounded Theory procedures, such as Coding. Results provided initial evidence SMartySPEM had better results compared to vSPEM, except for the Adoption criterion. In addition, several points of improvement for SMartySPEM were highlighted."
pub.1037253105,Modeling and simulation of oxygen‐limited partial nitritation in a membrane‐assisted bioreactor (MBR),"Combination of a partial nitritation process and an anaerobic ammonium oxidation process for the treatment of sludge reject water has some general cost-efficient advantages compared to nitrification-denitrification. The integrated process features two-stage autotrophic conversion of ammonium via nitrite to dinitrogen gas with lower demand for oxygen and no external carbon requirement. A nitrifying membrane-assisted bioreactor (MBR) for the treatment of sludge reject water was operated under continuous aeration at low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations with the purpose of generating nitrite accumulation. Microfiltration was applied to allow a high sludge retention time (SRT), resulting in a stable partial nitritation process. During start-up of the MBR, oxygen-limited conditions were induced by increasing the ammonium loading rate and decreasing the oxygen transfer. At a loading rate of 0.9 kg N m(-3) d(-1) and an oxygen concentration below 0.1 mg DO L(-1), conversion to nitrite was close to 50% of the incoming ammonium, thereby yielding an optimal effluent within the stoichiometric requirements for subsequent anaerobic ammonium oxidation. A mathematical model for ammonium oxidation to nitrite and nitrite oxidation to nitrate was developed to describe the oxygen-limited partial nitritation process within the MBR. The model was calibrated with in situ determinations of kinetic parameters for microbial growth, reflecting the intrinsic characteristics of the ammonium oxidizing growth system at limited oxygen availability and high sludge age. The oxygen transfer coefficient (K(L)a) and the ammonium-loading rate were shown to be the appropriate operational variables to describe the experimental data accurately. The validated model was used for further steady state simulation under different operational conditions of hydraulic retention time (HRT), K(L)a, temperature and SRT, with the intention to support optimized process design. Simulation results indicated that stable nitrite production from sludge reject water was feasible with this process even at a relatively low temperature of 20 degrees C with HRT down to 0.25 days."
pub.1154779669,A Model-Driven Approach for Software Process Line Engineering,"It has become increasingly preferable to construct bespoke software development processes according to the specifications of the project at hand; however, defining a separate process for each project is time consuming and costly. One solution is to use a Software Process Line (SPrL), a specialized Software Product Line (SPL) in the context of process definition. However, instantiating an SPrL is a slow and error-prone task if performed manually; an adequate degree of automation is therefore essential, which can be achieved by using a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach. Furthermore, we have identified specific shortcomings in existing approaches for SPrL Engineering (SPrLE). To address the identified shortcomings, we propose a novel MDD approach specifically intended for SPrLE; this approach can be used by method engineers and project managers to first define an SPrL, and then construct custom processes by instantiating it. The proposed approach uses a modeling framework for modeling an SPrL, and applies transformations to provide a high degree of automation when instantiating the SPrL. The proposed approach addresses the shortcomings by providing an adequate coverage of four activities, including Feasibility analysis, Enhancing the core process, Managing configuration complexity, and Post-derivation enhancement. The proposed approach has been validated through an industrial case study and an experiment; the results have shown that the proposed approach can improve the processes being used in organizations, and is rated highly as to usefulness and ease of use."

One of the processes used by enterprises to gain competitiveness is by outsourcing their activities. The lack of adequate processes may cause the failure of software projects involving software acquisition. This paper aims at presenting an approach to the definition of acquisition processes, taking the different contexts into consideration, through the definition of a Software process Line (SPL). We expect that this approach will facilitate processes definition, reuse of the knowledge model on the SPL, and minimize problems related to the software acquisition as well as support to execute software acquisition more efficiently."
pub.1062959772,Activity-Based Software Process Lines Tailoring,"Software process definition requires choosing the process elements that appropriately fulfil the tailoring requirements, such as to prevent risks or to satisfy quality goals. The selection of appropriate process elements is usually done manually, making this process complex, time-consuming and error-prone. Our main objective is to define a systematic approach to tailor software process and a support tool to simplify and to support the tailoring process by improving the selection process of reusable process elements. We developed a systematic approach to tailor software process based on software process architectures and lines. This approach selects the process elements that appropriately match the tailoring requirements. A web tool was developed to support the use of the proposed approach. We concluded that the approach aids process engineer to make decisions for selecting a set of process elements suitable to the tailoring requirements and to the project context."
pub.1136163543,A Repository to Support Software Process Reuse Based on Process Lines,"Defining a software process is a complex activity, especially when defined from scratch. Thus, different reuse techniques have been proposed to reduce the effort, as well as increase the quality of the defined process, such as Software Process Line (SPrL). SPrL provides a systematic way to support software process reuse. However, adopting SPrL approaches without supporting tools may turn to be a very difficult task. Although SPrL supporting tools are becoming more practical, integrated tools are still needed to support all reuse stages. In addition, to make reuse in a systematic manner, it is necessary to provide a repository, i.e., a shared database of information and artifacts. However, software process repositories are not frequently discussed in SPrL literature and those discussed are coupled with their related approaches, which makes reuse in different scenarios unfeasible. This paper presents a reusable software process repository focused on SPrL concepts support, called Odyssey Repository, which can support the development of SPrL integrated tools. In this scenario, a proof of concept was performed to verify the proposed repository feasibility. Moreover, a TAM-based preliminary evaluation was conducted, where software process experts indirectly evaluated the repository during the project-specific software process definition using SPrL artifacts. Although the results are positive, further evaluations are still needed."
pub.1015765623,Towards Understanding Software Process Variability from Contextual Evidence of Change,"Software development enterprises need to tailor their own processes before enact them in order to ensure that they fit both the organization and the project. This necessity has, to date, been solved by providing these processes with variability support. Tailoring proposals have traditionally been focused on solving the problem of managing the variability of processes in order to facilitate their adaptation. Process tailoring has not, however, been considered as a solution to a wider problem consisting of the organization, project, laws and some other influencing factors that change according to each project, a problem that software processes must confront if they are to be successful. In this paper we enhance a tailoring framework in order to tackle changes in the context level of the process, and this variability is considered to drive the tailoring of the supporting processes. As a part of the enhanced framework, this paper analyzes the OMG’s Business Motivation Model (BMM) in order to apply it to the characterization of the organizational units as a part of the context variation factors, and to link them with subsequent process variations. The proposal is illustrated by means of an application example, which is based on a real industrial case and which has served as a proof of concept. The resulting conclusion is that since software process tailoring depends on the process context, so understanding and managing changes in the latter’s drive variability in software processes."
pub.1093698709,Deriving Project-Specific Processes from Process Line Architecture with Commonality and Variability,"Definition and utilization of project-specific processes is important for effectively conducting industrial information system development. Process tailoring is an approach of achieving processes optimized for the characteristics of a project. However, conventional tailoring techniques such as component-based ones and generator ones lack a way to address the overall consistency or reuse process fragments. In this paper, we propose a technique for establishing process lines, which are sets of common processes in particular problem domains, and process line architectures that incorporate commonality and variability. Process line architectures are used as a basis for deriving process lines from the perspective of overall optimization. The proposed technique includes some extensions to the Software Process Engineering Metamodel for clearly expressing the commonality and variability in the process workflows when modeling the workflows as UML activity diagrams. As a result of applying the proposed technique to hardware/software co-design processes in an embedded system development domain, it is found that the proposed technique is useful for defining consistent and project-specific processes efficiently."
pub.1030802993,A Process Family Approach for the reuse of development processes,"Development processes are often newly defined for every project.

pub.1047709746,Representing Process Variation with a Process Family,"The formalization of process definitions has been an invaluable aid in many domains. However, noticeable variations in processes start to emerge as precise details are added to process definitions. While each such variation gives rise to a different process, these processes might more usefully be considered as variants of each other, rather than completely different processes. This paper proposes that it is beneficial to regard such an appropriately close set of process variants as a process family. The paper suggests a characterization of what might comprise a process family and introduces a formal approach to defining families based upon this characterization. To illustrate this approach, we describe a case study that demonstrates the different variations we observed in processes that define how dispute resolution is performed at the U.S. National Mediation Board. We demonstrate how our approach supports the definition of this set of process variants as a process family."
pub.1007551255,Acquisition of a Project-Specific Process,"Currently, proposed development processes are often considered too generic for operational use. This often leads to a misunderstanding of the project-specific processes and its refuse. One reason for non-appropriate project-specific processes is insufficient support for the tailoring of generic processes to project characteristics and context constraints. To tackle this problem, we propose a method for the acquisition of a project-specific process. This method uses a domain-specific process line for top-down process tailoring and supports bottom-up refinement of the defined generic process based on tracking process activities. The expected advantage of the method is tailoring efficiency gained by usage of a process line and higher process adherence gained by bottom-up adaptation of the process.

We propose a novel methodology base on a Business Process Line (BPL) engineering approach to inject flexibility into process modeling phase and promote reuse and flexibility by selection. Moreover we suggest a decision-table (DT) formalism for eliciting, tracking and managing the relationships among business needs, environmental changes and process tasks. In a real case study we practiced the proposed methodology by leveraging the synergy of feature models, variability mechanisms and decision tables. The application of DT-based BPL engineering approach proves that the Business Process Line benefits from fundamental concepts like composition, reusability and adaptability and satisfies the requirements for process definition flexibility."
pub.1120338559,Quantitative evaluation of tailoring within SPICE‐compliant security‐informed safety‐oriented process lines,"Abstract  In the context of SPICE‐compliant and (security‐informed) safety processes, efficient process tailoring is necessary due to the increasing proliferation of requirements, which, if not systematised, may become an unmanageable cognitive overload leading to process degradation instead of improvement. Recently, security‐informed safety‐oriented process line engineering (SiSoPLE) has been proposed as a sound solution to systematise common and variable process elements in the context of security‐informed safety‐oriented processes described within security as well as safety‐related standards. SiSoPLE represents an extension of safety‐oriented process line engineering (SoPLE). The gain of the application of SoPLE in terms of efficient tailoring via reuse was measured in a previous work, where the GQM + Strategies model, an extension of the goal/question/metric (GQM) paradigm, was adopted to develop a measurement model for achieving quantitative evidence. In this paper, we develop further our previously proposed measurement model to achieve quantitative evidence regarding the benefits of using process line engineering extended to SPICE‐compliant security‐informed safety processes. We then apply our extended GQM + Strategies model on a SPICE for space‐compliant SiSoPL to illustrate and assess its usefulness. Finally, we discuss our findings and provide our perspectives on quantitative evaluation of tailoring in the context of critical‐systems engineering. "

First, we discuss issues of process line for mix-production and propose a method of process design for mix production to enhance productivity. The process design is treated as multi-objective problem in the method. Combination method of multi-objective genetic algorithm and clustering method is developed to design process line. Clustering method is utilized to generate groups of similar works with regard to connection relationship of parts in BOM and precedence relationship between works. We consider that quality of operation can be promoted and operation time can be reduced by assigning the groups of works to work centers. The developed method is performed on simple model to evaluate the performance of the method. The numerical experiments show that the number of clusters predetermined in the process of clustering is significantly affected to productivity of the line."
pub.1106681939,Safety-oriented process line engineering via seamless integration between EPF composer and BVR tool,"The integration between process engineering and variability management is required for tailoring of safety-oriented processes with variabilities to individual projects in a similar manner to the product lines. Previous studies have not adequately established the Safety-oriented Process Lines (SoPLs). This paper focuses on the seamless integration between Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) Composer and Base Variability Resolution (BVR) Tool. The former supports the major parts of the OMG's Software & Systems Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) Version 2.0, while the latter is a simplification and enhancement of the OMG's revised submission of Common Variability Language (CVL). The proposed integration is implemented as Eclipse plugin. It provides support for importing backend folders and files within the method library of EPF Composer, resolving problems with the files for variability management with the BVR Tool, and exporting back the resolved process models to the EPF Composer. The applicability of the implemented plugin is demonstrated by engineering an ECSS-E-ST-40C compliant SoPL for the space projects and applications."
pub.1020511311,Requirements and constructors for tailoring software processes: a systematic literature review,"Organizations developing software-based systems or services often need to tailor process reference models—including product-oriented and project-oriented processes—to meet both their own characteristics and those of their projects. Existing process reference models, however, are often defined in a generic manner. They typically offer only limited mechanisms for adapting processes to the needs of organizational units, project goals, and project environments. This article presents a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed conference and journal articles published between 1990 and 2009. Our aim was both to identify requirements for process-tailoring notation and to analyze those tailoring mechanisms that are currently in existence and that consistently support process tailoring. The results show that the software engineering community has demonstrated an ever-increasing interest in software process tailoring, ranging from the consideration of theoretical proposals regarding how to tailor processes to the scrutiny of practical experiences in organizations. Existing tailoring mechanisms principally permit the modeling of variations of activities, artifacts, or roles by insertion or deletion. Two types of variations have been proposed: the individual modification of process elements and the simultaneous variation of several process elements. Resolving tailoring primarily refers to selecting or deselecting optional elements or to choosing between alternatives. It is sometimes guided by explicitly defined processes and supported by tools or mechanisms from the field of knowledge engineering. The study results show that tailoring notations are not as mature as the industry requires if they are to provide the kind of support for process tailoring that fulfills the requirements identified, i.e., including security policies for the whole process, or carrying out one activity rather than another. A notation must therefore be built, which takes these requirements into consideration in order to permit variant-rich processes representation and use this variability to consistently support process tailoring."

Part II: stamping process planning,"In metal stamping development, stamping process planning plays quite an important role for the related die design. As mentioned in Part-I [Feature-based metal stamping part and process design. Part 1: stampability evaluation, 2007, 45, 2673–2695], the feature can encapsulate comprehensive engineering information; this paper proposes to realize stamping process planning based on feature mapping. A feature mapping system, between a stamping design feature space and a stamping process feature space, has been presented. The inherent mechanism of such feature mapping has been investigated with formal representations. The substance of feature mapping is the processing of related knowledge and information. Mapping rules are established to generate the stamping operation and stamping direction. Four mapping manners (direct mapping, conjugate mapping, syncretic mapping, and sequential mapping) are presented for generating the form of process feature, through geometrical information transformation from design features. Meanwhile, considering a stamping process plan as an ordered tree, this paper has introduced how to build a stamping process plan through organizing the stamping operations mapped from design features, and an illustrative example is demonstrated."

pub.1165620389,Research on automatic analysis and layout system of the stamping process for automotive panels and its key technologies,"With the shorter update cycle of automobiles and the development trend of fashion and streamlined appearance, the design of forming processes is becoming increasingly complex and demanding, and a large number of composite processes need to be used and arranged in 2–5 procedures to reduce production costs and shorten production cycles, which is usually done by trial and error. Aiming at the automatic recognition, analysis, and layout of process features, an intelligent system based on the computer-aided geometric design (CAGD) theory of complex curves and surfaces, process design knowledge, and multidisciplinary optimization techniques is proposed. The process feature analysis method based on discretization and merging idea has been proposed to split big and complex geometric form features and identify every process feature accurately and automatically, such as piercing, trimming, flanging, restriking, and its punching directions. The combinatorial optimization algorithm is proposed to merge the discrete features according to the best stamping direction, process rules, and the geometric parameters of the features, and a process constraint diagram with combined features is constructed, which is used as the initial solution and sequence constraint conditions for the process layout to effectively ensure the rationality of the process layout.

pub.1044176397,Applying System Families Concepts to Requirements Engineering Process Definition,"In this paper, some experiences gained during the definition of a unified, common software development process for several companies in Telvent are presented. Last year, Telvent made the decision of developing a unique software development process which was flexible enough to be adapted to specific practices and needs of the different companies. In this paper we focus mainly on the experiences gained during the definition of the requirements engineering process, al-though many of them are also applicable to other software development processes. One of the most interesting experiences from our point of view is that, al-though the definition process was started using a top-down approach and well-know techniques like data flow diagrams, we eventually end up applying requirements engineering techniques like glossaries, scenarios or conflict resolution for the definition of the requirements engineering process itself. On the other hand, the need of having adaptable processes for the different companies in Telvent made us adopt a process family approach, i.e. adopting an approach similar to the system families development, thus defining a core process that could be adapted to specific needs of specific companies in a predefined, controlled manner. The experiences gained in the definition of the process family were applied to the definition of requirements engineering process for product line development, which is briefly presented in this paper."

This new ‘design with process features’ approach represents the evolving part form to the designer in multiple process domains and at multiple stages of a sequential process. Each set of part form representations defines the conceptualized process that transforms it from one to the other. At this modeling level, processes are reversible so that design activity can take place in any of the domains and be transferred to the others. We have fully implemented this concept in a sheet metal design/manufacturing system in which preliminary process design occurs concurrently with product design and the normal representational ambiguities of wireframe and flat panel models are eliminated."

pub.1034964213,A framework for the integration of solvent and process design with controllability assessment,"This work presents a systematic framework for solvent design and selection based on optimum economic and controllability separation process performance. Solvents are initially designed in a solvent-process screening stage where conceptual process models are optimized to identify solvent options and process features of optimum economic performance. The integration of solvent and process design is facilitated computationally by a data mining approach which allows a reduced number of solvents to be evaluated in process design optimization. Highly performing solvents identified in the first stage are introduced into rigorous separation process design, supported again by the proposed data mining approach. At this stage detailed process models enable identification of operating process characteristics which can be used as targeted set-points in a subsequent control design problem. Selected solvents and design configurations which are able to match the targeted set-points are then investigated for their performance in compensating the effects of multiple and large in magnitude process disturbances. A non-linear sensitivity analysis approach is employed that calculates the optimum steady-state effort for the solvent-process design-control structure configuration. The focus of the work is maintained in the formal mathematical presentation and implementation of the data mining procedure and the controllability assessment of different solvents as well as in the use of rigorous process design models. In this respect alternative solvents and process designs are evaluated based on their economic and static controllability performance."
pub.1160809630,Optimization of Process Families for Deployment of Carbon Capture Processes using Machine Learning Surrogates,"Traditional process design approaches focus on exploiting economies of scale but are inefficient when designing a large number of similar processes for decentralized applications. By optimizing each process individually, these approaches do not allow for manufacturing standardization or make use of economies of numbers. In this work, we design a family of processes (i.e., multiple processes) of a carbon capture facility with various performance requirements. We identify sub-components within the process and create a small set of sub-component designs that can be shared across all the processes in the process family. We formulate this optimization problem as a nonlinear generalized disjunctive program (GDP) and, in previous work, developed two approaches for reformulating and solving this problem: one based on full-discretization of the design space (Zhang et al., 2022) and one that used Machine Learning (ML) surrogates to replace the nonlinear process models (Stinchfield et al., 2022). Using ML surrogates to predict required system costs and performance allows us to reformulate the nonlinearities in the GDP to generate an efficient MILP formulation. In this work, we apply the ML surrogate approach to design a family of carbon capture systems to cover a set of different flue gas flow rates and inlet CO2 concentrations, where we consider the absorber and stripper as sub-component types."

Substantiation of the production cycle with fluorine and hydrogen recycle,"A fluoride cycle in tungsten technology is based on three processes: (i) electrochemical decomposition of HF in the KHF2 + HF melt at 80–100°C with the separate evolution of gaseous fluorine and hydrogen; (ii) fluorination of the tungsten powder with evoluated fluorine at 300–350°C with the condensation of formed WF6 in a liquid form at t = 2.5–3.0°C, and (iii) reduction of gaseous WF6 with evoluated hydrogen at t = 580–600°C with the condensation of formed HF at +1°C and its use for the fluorine and hydrogen production, thereby ensuring their recycling in the cycle. The optimization of mentioned processes resulted in hardware-process implementations providing the formation of a large-scale plane and cylindrical billets in the industrial scale for deformation, as well as pipes, crucibles, and other products of various sizes made of tungsten with productivity of one process line of ~4.3 kg/h (>34 t/yr) with the fulfillment of environmental requirements. In contrast with the methods of powder metallurgy, the described technology ensures the formation of dense half-finished products and products made of pure tungsten with finer grain structures and almost unlimited sizes. Herewith, the specific power consumption for 1 kg of production lowers by a factor of 2.0–2.5. To increase the production efficiency, the simultaneous operation of four process lines in an automated mode is recommended."

Ordinarily, multiple work elements are assigned to workers or work centers in the process of process design to aim at high productivity. However, fluctuation of operation times is normally included in mixed production line and capacity of buffer affects productivity of the line. In this study, we deal with the problem of process design for mixed production line including fluctuation of operation time. In addition, we treat the problem of process line as multi-objective problem. In this paper, multi-objective genetic algorithm is developed to resolve the problem to minimize the bi-objective functions: the maximum value of operation time at all work centers and the maximum value of dispersion of operation time all work centers. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate performance of the algorithm and characteristics of solutions. Productivity of the production line designed by the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using event-driven simulation. Simulation result shows that production line designed by the proposed mathematical model generates high productivity and small size of WIP when buffers are located between work centers."

pub.1113861974,Towards variant management and change impact analysis in safety-oriented process-product lines,"In safety-critical (software) systems, safety management embraces both processes and products, which due to e.g., product's upgrade, tend to be tailored, giving rise to safety-oriented product lines and corresponding safety-oriented process lines. To tailor these lines systematically, their inter-dependencies would have been taken into consideration. To date, however, no satisfying implemented solution is available on the shelf. Accordingly, this paper focuses on the co-engineering of process and product lines. At first, the process and product lines need to be established for which the integration between Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) Composer, Composition with Guarantees for High-integrity Embedded Software Components Assembly (CHESS) Tool and Base Variability Resolution (BVR) Tool is achieved; they are process engineering, product design and variant management solutions, respectively.

The objective of the developed process is to have complete glucose utilization during fermentation stage. The process design integrates the conservation of mass principle and the experimental data of collected residual glucose profiles measured under VHG conditions. An ageing vessel involves three consecutive time periods: filling, ageing and operating. The ageing time is biological relevance, and is affected by the initial glucose concentration, the ethanol concentration, and the yeast viability in an ageing vessel. The operating time period is adjustable; a short operating time means a high discharge rate in order to empty an ageing vessel. The filling time links to the selection of the number of equal-sized ageing vessels that are installed downstream to a chemostat device. The developed process features the use of equal sized fermenters for all chemostat and ageing vessels so that the vessel exchangeability and the flexibility of fermentation operation are increased."
pub.1095083693,Development of Situational Requirements Engineering Processes: A Process Factory Approach,"The Software Product Line (SPL) approach is a paradigm for systematic reuse of software products, and a Software Factory is a SPL aimed at the industrialization of software development. Based on the notion that a software/RE process can be developed via an engineering process (much akin to engineering other types of software), this research aims to provide a feature-based RE process factory to develop RE processes based on the characteristics of the project at hand (project situation). In our approach, the project situation is modeled as the problem domain through using the ${\bf i}^{\ast}$ modeling language (resulting in a situation model). A feature model can encapsulate all the features in an SPL; therefore, the abundant riches of the RE field – results of decades of research – have been explored for extracting the variations and commonalities among existing RE processes, the results of which are represented in the form of a feature model, considered as a model of the solution domain. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed feature model, it has been compared against RE-related activities found in prominent software development methodologies. A mapping for translating the situation model to the RE process feature model is proposed with the specific aim of promoting traceability and rationality in the selection of RE process features. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through an RE process development example."
pub.1100087671,CONFIGURING PROCESS VARIANTS THROUGH SEMANTIC REASONING IN SYSTEMS ENGINEERING,"ABSTRACT When dealing with processes, engineering systems need to be able to deal with the existence of many versions of the same process, known as variants. Each process variant aims to represent a specific business context but, due to some differences in the activities, resources, and control flow, they may differ in their logic. As result, the concept of a customizable process model has emerged. A process model can be customized by representing the process family in one single model deriving a variant through transformations in this single model. However, the process customization is not a trivial‐task. It must be ensured that the variant is correct. Besides, the resulting variant must respect all requirements related to the application context and internal and external regulations, among others. In addition, recommendations and guidance should be provided during the customization. In this context, this research aims to propose a framework for customizing variants according to the user's requirements. The customization is achieved by reasoning in an ontology based on the rules for selecting a variant, in the internal/external regulations, and on expert knowledge."

The approach and the corresponding method consists of the following main blocks: (a) production process definition, (b) ML performance, (c) selector constructor and (d) assessment and incremental improvement of selector performance. The first component defines a typical production process or domain based on a well-established set of features, e.g. product quality inspection through process features as accuracy, material characteristics, etc. The ML performance construct contains precise defined performance of well clustered ML algorithms based on established benchmarking. The third construct, the Selector, automatically realizes a perfect mapping between the production process features and the performance of the ML algorithms. The logic of this automated selection represents the innovation of our work. The last component assesses the selector algorithm based on a set of specific KPIs for each production domain or process. The incremental improvement of the selector is approached as well, closing the loop between all method components. The developed approach and method have as foundations our work on identifying critical production processes/domains as core of realizing the intelligent production and laborious developed collection of ML algorithms, based on their performance data. These foundations and a motivation scenario are presented inside our paper to highlight the relevance of our research work."

Therefore, they should be supported to transform into well-established companies. However, SMEs often lack knowledge regarding operation and management. This study proposes three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3DCE) approach to help SMEs accelerate their growth through differentiation and efficiency, leading to high-quality yet low-cost products with efficient delivery. This study aimed to develop a strategic formulation framework incorporating the 3DCE concept in product functionality, concurrent process design, and appropriate supply chain solutions. The framework has been developed and implemented in food and beverage SME. Strategy development follows the traditional approach, including environmental analysis, strategy formulation, and strategy mapping. However, the result of environmental analysis extracted in the form of SWOT and Grand Strategy matrices are specifically piled into concurrent strategic theme covering the concurrent product, process, and supply chain aspects. Predominantly, product features covering the product innovation and functionality and process features covering segmentation-based and cross-functional process designs were tailored with innovative supply chain solutions based on the segmented model.

pub.1046291193,Enabling Cross-Domain Reuse of Tool Qualification Certification Artefacts,"The development and verification of safety-critical systems increasingly relies on the use of tools which automate/replace/ supplement complex verification and/or development tasks. The safety of such systems risks to be compromised, if the tools fail. To mitigate this risk, safety standards (e.g. DO-178C/DO330, IEC 61508) define prescriptive tool qualification processes. Compliance with these processes can be required for (re-)certification purposes. To enable reuse and thus reduce time and cost related to certification, cross-domain tool manufacturers need to understand what varies and what remains in common when transiting from one domain to another. To ease reuse, in this paper we focus on verification tools and model a cross-domain tool qualification process line. Finally, we discuss how reusable cross-domain process-based arguments can be obtained."

pub.1115994449,Exergoenvironmental analysis of methanol production by steam reforming and autothermal reforming of natural gas,"Methanol is one of the most important chemicals serving as a base for a range of synthetic fuels and variety of other chemical derivates. Steam reforming and autothermal reforming of natural gas represent the major technologies used for syngas production in indirect low pressure methanol synthesis routes. Further process development is driven by technical and economic aspects, while environmental aspects often fade into the background. In this paper methanol production processes using steam reforming and autothermal reforming are investigated from the viewpoint of an exergoenvironmental analysis. The processes feature a coproduction of electricity for high efficiency. The pollutant formation within the chemical conversion units, particularly within the reformer and the furnace, reduces the environmental impact associated with the overall system. The environmental impact of generated methanol and electricity is calculated respectively as 156.4 mPt/kg and 98.2 mPt/MWh for the steam methane reforming process and has values of 134.0 mPt/kg and 71.3 mPt/MWh for the autothermal reforming process."
pub.1138790894,Plant-wide systems microbiology for the wastewater industry,"Infiltrating systems microbiology concepts in the water industry requires the development of a language of love and shared endpoints in analytical bioscience and process engineering at the (waste)water line.
 The wastewater treatment sector embraces mixed-culture biotechnologies for sanitation, environmental protection, and resource recovery. Bioprocess design, monitoring and control thrive on microbial processes selected in complex microbial communities. Microbial ecology and systems microbiology help access microbiomes and characterize microorganisms, metabolisms and interactions at increased resolution and throughput. Big datasets are generated from the sequencing of informational molecules extracted from biomasses sampled across process schemes. However, they mostly remain on science benches and computing clusters, without reaching the industry in a clear engineering objective function. A bilateral bridge should actionize this information. As systems microbiologists, we miss that engineering designs and operations rely on stoichiometry and kinetics. The added-value provided by microbial ecology and systems microbiology to improve capital (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX) needs to be addressed. As engineers, we miss that microbiology can be provide powerful microbial information on top of physical–chemical measurements for quantitative process design ( e.g. , nutrient removal systems) with detailed scientific description of phenomena inside microbiomes. In this perspective article, we allied academia and industry to address the state of shared knowledge, successes and failures, and to establish joint investigation platforms. Our roadmap involves three milestones to (i) elaborate an essential list of microbiological information needed to implement methods at the process line; (ii) characterize microbiomes from microorganisms to metabolisms, and shape conceptual ecosystem models as primer for process ecology understanding; (iii) bridge engineering and mathematical models with an analytical toolbox for fast- vs. high-throughput analyses to discover new microbial processes and engineer assemblies.

The threshold voltages are set high to permit operation above room temperature without excessive leakage. Novel process features include zero-topography well design, RTP CMOS well anneal in an ammonia ambient, RTP gate oxide, RTP source/drain anneal, and BPSG reflow at 750 degrees C in a high-pressure nitrogen ambient. Transistors with 8 nm gate oxide and 0.4 mu m gate lengths provide 65 ps gate delay at 3.3 V. The use of 4*10/sup 17//cm/sup 3/ CMOS well doping without added channel implants results in higher diode capacitance and increases inverter chain delay by approximately 20 ps/stage, but speeds less than 50 ps/stage should be obtained with L=0.3 mu m NMOS and L=0.4 mu m PMOS, both having effective channel lengths of approximately 0.2 mu m.<>"

By saving the new solution in the case library after the latest problem has been solved, the system is able to perform self-learning from the experience accumulated. The work includes: 1. Developing a case-based reasoning environment for diecasting die design, so that the system can self-learn from the previous consultation itself and become more efficient. 2. Developing an effective case representation and adaptation methodology for reusing previous design resources efficiently. This paper focuses mainly on the design of die-casting dies.

This dewar will mainly be used for the helium inventory management at FRIB (preserving helium inventory during unplanned / planned maintenance of the cryogenic system) and also in sharing the capacity to support the various cryogenic refrigeration systems to increase the operational efficiency and availability. It is also designed to interface to future cryogenic system upgrades (i.e., new 4.5 K refrigerators). This dewar has a single large penetration, or ‘neck’, that all the process lines and instrumentation pass through. On top of the ‘neck’ is a vacuum insulated interface box, or ‘neck can’, which houses all the connections between the dewar and the connecting distribution system. Though not generally common, this design approach has been successfully implemented on 5 to 10 kL liquid helium dewars at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Jefferson Lab (JLab), and also at FRIB. It has been found that this approach greatly simplifies the mechanical design, while allowing for multiple process and instrumentation interfaces and still permitting a low heat in-leak.

Over the past 20 years, application based research on appropriate technologies to treat residual streams such as filter backwash water (FBWW) has promoted the development of integrated process design that presents recycling as a viable residual management option. However, as utilities continue to develop and expand their main process lines to comply with more stringent government regulations encompassing both water quality and residual disposal practices, the development of sustainable residual management practices is expected to become a more prominent issue for this industry. The purpose of this paper is to present, from a critical point of view, the matrix of issues that currently exist regarding WTP residual streams and strategic pathways that would enhance future decision making processes for achieving long-term residual management solutions for the drinking water industry."

Specifically, we address topics such as throughput and reliability enhancement by chemically assisted broad ion beam milling and on-line monitoring of the etch process. We discuss how integrated elemental analysis by EFTEM can be used to gain quantitative information on the broad variety of new material systems currently entering front end and back end of the IC manufacturing process line. The accelerating pace of device integration results in extreme demands for quantitative analysis in process development, yield ramp-up and process control with spatial resolution and elemental sensitivity at the very limits of currently available instrumentation. Historically, the high resolution performance of TEM analysis has been hampered by long turn around times for the required sample preparation. Meanwhile the routine use of FIB systems for “trench” and “lift-out” preparation techniques allows for an enormous increase in the efficiency of TEM analysis."
pub.1133890638,Mass Transport Phenomena during the Recovery of Volatile Compounds by Pervaporation,"This chapter presents pervaporation as a membrane separation process for the selective removal and recovery of dilute compounds from a bulk liquid. First, the principle of pervaporation will be described, followed by a discussion of its main transport phenomena and a mathematical description of ideal conditions. Pervaporation is, at first sight, not a complicated process. It is, however, rather versatile. This is on the one hand an advantage, because pervaporation can be adapted and integrated in process lines with considerable flexibility. On the other hand, this versatility has led to an abundance of different individual applications that cannot readily be compared. Recently, attempts have been made in the literature to search for empirical rules on pervaporation in individual situations. It is, however, the authors’ opinion that instead of empirical rules, a concise but comprehensive understanding of the scientific background of pervaporation fosters the creativity necessary for a flexible and appropriate process design. The essentials of this background will be presented for ideal conditions in the first section, “The Principles of Pervaporation,” in conjunction with a discussion of the most relevant nonideal phenomena."
pub.1104104137,Pre-treatment with dissolved air flotation considering an integrated process design,"The raw water from Lake Zegrzynski is difficult to treat and requires a high chemical dosing rate of coagulant for the reduction of organic matter in order to comply with EU standards. The high degree of reduction calls for an efficient coagulant, but also an optimal chemistry such as correct dosing amount and an optimal flocculation-pH. The paper describes different removal efficiencies of organic matter, particularly with respect to pH in flocculation.
                  During the warm season, the raw water can also suffer from large amounts of plankton that are difficult to remove to a satisfactory degree. In a two-step chemical treatment concept, with Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) and the pulsator process, the plankton content in the final outlet water is reduced to very low levels. It follows that eventual peaks of plankton in the raw water cannot be detected in the final outlet water.
                  Ozone is added for removal of taste and odour originating from the presence of plankton. In the pre-treatment step prior to the ozonation, a great deal of the organic matter is removed, which reduces the necessary ozone dosage.
                  The Municipal Water Company of Warsaw City has decided to consider an additional pre-treatment step to the existing water treatment plant at Wieliszew. For that purpose, and bearing in mind an integrated process design, the company has performed pilot-scale experiments with DAF installed prior to a process line identical with the existing full-scale plant. The experimental flow is about 10 m3/h."

To obtain the performance metrics of an avalanche silicon diode fabricated using a standard 0.5 μm CMOS process, and to examine possible ways to improve device characteristics using process variations and electrical control, we designed various low photon count avalanche diodes. We then laid out these diode designs with different well geometries and control terminals, had them fabricated in different process runs, and later tested them individually. To guide the design, understand the device behavior, and determine carrier impact ionization dictated performance figures, we also developed a device simulator verified by experimental data. The simulator is optimized for analysis of avalanche breakdown. Furthermore, to achieve as-designed device and circuit performance by suppressing unwanted peripheral corner breakdown between a p+-implant and a surrounding n-well, we used the overlapping between adjacent n-well implants. In a standard CMOS process that allows n-, n+-and p+-implants on a p− substrate, the n-wells were laid out by a length shorter than the process design kit recommended cross-talk distance 9λ, λ being half of the feature size. In addition to going beyond the standard process design rules to experiment with the effects of the lateral diffusion of dopants on device performance, we also added electrical gain and performance controllability to our impact ionization diodes by employing gate electrodes located at the perimeter."
pub.1027347186,A performance evaluation of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) processes within the South African context,"SEA has been described as being more about process than about product. Yet very little research has been conducted to gain a better understanding of how SEA processes perform within developing country contexts. To address this gap in knowledge the research underlying this paper aimed to evaluate the quality of SEA processes within the South African context against specifically designed key performance indicators. Comparison of the different data patterns revealed general SEA process features as well as three broad models, namely the ‘stand alone’, ‘central to decision making’ and ‘integrated’ models. The research results suggest a particularly poor performance in terms of process quality for the SEA case studies investigated. Moreover, it shows that there is no one understanding of SEA process within the South African context. The main limitations related to a weak understanding of the decision making processes SEA aimed to inform, as well as an inability to incorporate flexibility into process design. To take the debate forward it is proposed that SEA follow-up and effectiveness research be explored to determine which of these models (if any) ultimately contributed to influencing decision making and promote sustainability."

pub.1114894317,A Conceptual Business Process Entity with Lifecycle and Compliance Alignment,"This paper proposes a conceptual model that incorporates: (a) a business process entity, (b) a business process lifecycle aligned with the proposed entity, and (c) a compliance framework that focuses on the degree of process compliance to imposed regulatory standards. The pursuing objective is to systematize business processes through a conceptual entity applicable to Business Process Management (BPM) practices and compliance-checking. The applied methodology involves the review, interpretation and comparison of business process definitions, structural elements and their interrelations, acknowledged BPM lifecycles and compliance rules. The initial findings lead to the proposal of a contextual business process structure that sets the boundaries of business process as a clearly defined entity. The business process entity encompasses continuous modification of its design based on the feedback it generates. Additionally, a comparative analysis of prominent BPM lifecycles resulted in a proposed ‘business process lifecycle’ that allows for a better alignment of the included cycle steps. The proposed business process entity is also related with process compliance practices to produce compliance-aware business processes. The introduced conceptual model can assist professionals in apprehending core business process features, focusing on process flexibility and redesign. It can also serve as a preliminary prototype for checking the degree of compliance between a business process and the applicable compliance rules."
pub.1006680509,A modeling framework for manufacturing services in Service-oriented Holonic Manufacturing Systems,"Holonic and Service-Oriented Architectures have been proposed as solutions for the conception of flexible and reactive systems. The combination of both architectures has been recognized as an attractive solution for the conception of more flexible and reactive systems. Services, originally conceived for web applications, need new models that better adapt to the needs of manufacturing systems namely, the specification and planning of processes. This paper proposes a methodology for designing customizable product-process specifications based on manufacturing-services that are suitable for product driven applications. A framework is proposed for modeling manufacturing-services designed for its application in Holonic Manufacturing Systems, preserving the fractal character found in products and processes. Three types of manufacturing processes are identified based on the relations among its composing operations and a model is proposed for each type. Application service-ontologies are created to describe operations and resource capabilities rather than complex semantic descriptions to facilitate process design and reduce the computational load of service discovery for planning. The framework leverages service reusability among process families in the same way as physical features are reused among product families. An illustrative example describes the design of a product's process specification based on the manufacturing service framework in a Holonic Manufacturing System, giving rise to Service-oriented Holonic Manufacturing Systems."

pub.1000961623,Modelling the Hygienic Processing of Foods — a Global Process Overview,"A modelling approach has been developed to predict the implications of processing for microbial growth in food production, storage and distribution. Models based on mass and energy balances together with simple microbial kinetics have been incorporated into a commercial simulation package. The process is evaluated from raw materials through to consumption and as a result a prediction of the contribution of each individual process stage to the microbial level in the product is made. The model is a valuable tool to assist decision making on the operation of existing processes as well as in the process design of new product lines. The system output is a quantitative estimate used as a guide to identifying key process steps rather than a high precision solution to a fully defined problem. This can help to identify critical areas of a process line for which more dedicated programs and microbial kinetics can be used for a more detailed assessment. The model is thus a valuable tool for a HACCP team by providing a more quantitative basis on which to base decisions and set critical limits. The system is a framework within which various models can be combined. An initial test of the model has shown its value in identifying bottlenecks and setting limits for several processes, including both batch and continuous systems."

An understanding of its behavior in prawn helps ensure safety of the seafood consumption. The objective of this investigation was to understand the pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus behavior in non-sterile prawn in a laboratory and frozen food factory as responding to temperature. The behavior was observed in a laboratory. It was found that in the laboratory this pathogen grew in a temperature range of 15–44 °C but died in −20 to 10 °C. The primary Baranyi and modified Gompertz models excellently explained the pathogenic growth and death characteristics, respectively. The effects of temperature on the primary-model parameters were well described by the Kohler, Ratkowsky, asymptotic and non-linear Arrhenius models. The behavior of the pathogen was also observed in a freezing process line. The pathogen responded to temperature in a similar manner to that in the laboratory results although the actual line process involved more influencing factors. Therefore, the laboratory results of temperature effect on the pathogen behavior can provide a good guideline of safety for process design and control of the seafood. The response similarity was beneficial in the information usage of pathogen behavior in prawn which was satisfactorily interchangeable between these two environments."
pub.1175741775,Visualizing and Understanding Batch Heterogeneity During Freeze-Drying Using Shelf-Scale Infrared Thermography,"Various biopharmaceutical products are distributed as freeze-dried formulations in vials. Minimizing batch heterogeneity, which refers to the variability of relevant properties among vials and negatively affects product quality, represents a major challenge in process design and operation. Both the root causes of batch heterogeneity and its dependence on the operating conditions of the process remain poorly understood. To study batch heterogeneity, we here introduce a quantitative tool consisting of an infrared thermography setup (camera plus mirror) capable of monitoring non invasively and online the temperature of 60 vials densely packed on a shelf during freeze-drying. The stochastic nature of nucleation, the differences in heat transfer between vials in the core and at the edges of the batch on the shelf, and the heat transfer between neighboring vials are all demonstrated to be causes of heterogeneity during freezing. The last phenomenon causes the latent heat released by a vial upon nucleation to heat up its neighboring vials, thus delaying their nucleation. Based on the results obtained using a mechanistic model, whose predictive capabilities were confirmed by experiments, fast cooling rates and sparse vial arrangements were identified as means to mitigate batch heterogeneity. Regarding drying, the setup enabled the determination of the end point of primary drying, a process feature that is essential for whole-process optimization."
pub.1181996719,A KAN-based Interpretable Framework for Process-Informed Prediction of Global Warming Potential,"Accurate prediction of Global Warming Potential (GWP) is essential for
assessing the environmental impact of chemical processes and materials.
Traditional GWP prediction models rely predominantly on molecular structure,
overlooking critical process-related information. In this study, we present an
integrative GWP prediction model that combines molecular descriptors (MACCS
keys and Mordred descriptors) with process information (process title,
description, and location) to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability.
Using a deep neural network (DNN) model, we achieved an R-squared of 86% on
test data with Mordred descriptors, process location, and description
information, representing a 25% improvement over the previous benchmark of 61%;
XAI analysis further highlighted the significant role of process title
embeddings in enhancing model predictions. To enhance interpretability, we
employed a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to derive a symbolic formula for GWP
prediction, capturing key molecular and process features and providing a
transparent, interpretable alternative to black-box models, enabling users to
gain insights into the molecular and process factors influencing GWP. Error
analysis showed that the model performs reliably in densely populated data
ranges, with increased uncertainty for higher GWP values. This analysis allows
users to manage prediction uncertainty effectively, supporting data-driven
decision-making in chemical and process design. Our results suggest that
integrating both molecular and process-level information in GWP prediction
models yields substantial gains in accuracy and interpretability, offering a
valuable tool for sustainability assessments. Future work may extend this
approach to additional environmental impact categories and refine the model to
further enhance its predictive reliability."
pub.1152046002,A novel process line for the valorization of industrial spent coffee grounds through coffee roasting technology and ultrasonic‐assisted extraction,"Abstract  BACKGROUND The main by‐product of the coffee industry is spent coffee grounds (SCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first occasion where industrial SCG has been used to build a batch‐valorization line combining barrel coffee roasters as an innovative drying process and ultrasound‐assisted extraction technology under the biorefinery concept, seeking to extract chlorogenic acids (CGA).   RESULTS  A Probat Sample Barrel Roaster were used to determine the optimal temperature, volume flow of fan, and time for a novel drying method. Drying optimization was carried out in order to reach 5.0% moisture content, reduce water activity and maximize total CGA content. Optimal conditions of 140 °C, 160.0 m 3 h −1 and 11.43 min for temperature, volume flow of fan, and time, respectively, were obtained with a desirability of 70%. Likewise, the optimal temperature, power and frequency settings for an ultrasonic extraction procedure of CGA from dried SCG were evaluated. To maximize the total CGA content, the ultrasonic technique was optimized. Temperature 50 °C, frequency 37 kHz and power 100 W with a desirability of 80% were necessary for optimality. The study was completed with a kinetic analysis using a second‐order rate model, Peleg's kinetic model and the phenomenological model.    CONCLUSION Industrial coffee by‐products can be processed and valorizing using barrel coffee roasters as a novel technique. For process design, the kinetic parameters of ultrasound‐assisted extraction are a helpful tool. A new mathematical model is presented that takes into account the impact of changing temperature on the ultrasonic process. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). "
pub.1035648861,Soybean Oil Volume Fraction Effects on the Rheology Characteristics and Gelation Behavior of Glucono‐δ‐Lactone and Calcium Sulfate‐Induced Tofu Gels,"Abstract    The effects soybean oil volume fraction on the rheological characteristics and gelation behavior of acid and salt‐induced soft tofu‐type gels was investigated. High oil volume fraction resulted in lower gel point temperature and shorter gelation time ( t gel ) while G ′ at the gel point increased as the oil volume fraction in the gels increased. A power law relationship t gel , gel point temperature and oil concentration was found and also the plot of G ′ versus oil concentration fitted well in the model: G ′∼  C A  . The exponent “ A ” was positive in salt‐induced gels but negative in acid‐induced gels. This gelation behavior trend was demonstrated by estimating the composite gel shear modulus, which showed that, in salt‐induced gels the stiffness of the oil droplets was higher than the one of the gel matrix while it was the opposite in acid‐induced gels. Furthermore, the weak gel model was used to analyze and describe the network extension and its strength.    Practical Applications In this comparative study, soybean oil volume fraction effects on the rheological characteristics and gelation behavior of acid and salt‐induced soft tofu‐type gels was established. Different coagulation temperatures and coagulants were used. The study gives new insights on the protein‐to‐oil droplets interactions during gelation at different pHs in a tofu gel like product. The better understanding of the gelation mechanism, small and large scale deformations of soy protein gels with additional oil, is industrially relevant, as it will help in better process line design, monitoring and quality control which would potentially lead to the development of novel soy‐based and dairy free cheeses products. Additionally, the parameters and conditions used were closely related to the ones used during soft silken tofu making, therefore, ensuring the process implementation much easier. "

The systems integration becomes increasingly challenging due to variety of devices and passives that typically compose such RF modules, and careful choices of materials are needed for low loss interconnects. One way to minimize RF losses is to integrate the module with high performance interconnect using Si technology, where the different device are mounted on the interposer and the passive are integrated into the silicon. Thanks to the TSV (Through Silicon Via) technology and use of High Resistivity Si substrate, it is possible to have small form factor modules. Such integration approach allows to benefit from the well-established base of 200mm foundries together with the recent progress made in High Resistivity substrate manufacturing.
                  In this work, the process development of a 3D RF interposer technology based on a 200mm process line is reported. The build-up contains 2 levels of metals processed by Cu damascene technology, including a thick 2μm top metal for the lower frequencies applications, an integrated MIM (Metal Insulator Metal) capacitor and use trough silicon via in 5kOhm high resistivity 85μm thick substrate. The TSV are 20μm diameter and 85μm deep made in via first manner with via reveal using temporary carrier handling. Various RF passivation techniques for the silicon have been investigated and a comparison to quartz based on similar test structure is discussed..
                  Variety of passive devices, transmission line and filter have been processed and characterized. The technology yields 1μm pitch interconnect routing layer, a line loss of 0.34 dB/mm at 40 GHz, and high quality factors inductors larger than 30."
pub.1166392095,Machine learning aided process design of Fe-Cr-Ni-Al/Ti multi-principal element alloys for excellent mechanical properties,"Fe-Cr-Ni-Al/Ti multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) with the good mechanical properties were designed by utilizing machine learning (ML) methods in our previous work. It can be noted that the post-processing (thermo-mechanical treatments, TMT) can tailor microstructures of the designed MPEAs with an aim to further obtain excellent mechanical properties. However, for a novel MPEA, determining the optimal post-processing parameters often requires time-consuming and laborious experiments due to the absence of existing precedents. In this work, we collected approximately 400 sets of mechanical properties data of MPEAs. The various feature selection methods were employed to train ML models for the process optimization of MPEAs. In addition, two input strategies were compared to offer a simplified approach for model inputs: one considering all process features and the other focusing solely on TMT process. The results showed that the difference in model accuracy between the two input strategies was minimal, indicating a strong possibility to simplify the ML model by disregarding specific processing features. Based on the trained models, we conducted optimization design for the TMTed parameters of Fe-Cr-Ni-Al/Ti MPEAs. The as-TMTed (Fe10Cr35Ni55)95Al5 and (Fe10Cr35Ni55)97Al2Ti1 samples demonstrated a balance between strength and toughness, with yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) values of approximately 600 MPa and 900 MPa, respectively, and a fracture elongation (FE) exceeding 30 %. As compared to samples without the TMT process in our previous work, the as-TMTed samples demonstrated a significant increase in YS and UTS, while only a certain loss in FE. This work confirmed the viability of ML-assisted efficient design for post-processing treatment in novel MPEAs."
pub.1027968084,Evaluating the application of augmented reality devices in manufacturing from a process point of view: An AHP based model,"Augmented Reality (AR) systems in last few years show great potentialities in the manufacturing context: recent pilot projects were developed for supporting quicker product and process design, as well as control and maintenance activities. The high technological complexity together with the wide variety of AR devices require a high technological skill; on the other hand, evaluating their actual impacts on the manufacturing process is still an open question. Few recent studies have analysed this topic by using qualitative approaches based on an “ex post” analysis – i.e. after the design and/or the adoption of the AR system - for evaluating the effectiveness of a developed AR application. The paper proposes an expert based tool for supporting production managers and researchers in effectively evaluating a preliminary ex-ante feasibility analysis for assessing quantitatively most efficient single AR devices (or combinations) to be applied in specific manufacturing processes. A multi-criteria model based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has been proposed to provide decision makers with quantitative knowledge for more efficiently designing AR applications in manufacturing. The model allows to integrate, in the same decision support tool, technical knowledge regarding AR devices with critical process features characterizing manufacturing processes, thus allowing to assess the contribution of the AR device in a wider prospective compared to current technological analyses. A test case study about the evaluation of AR system in on-site maintenance service is also discussed aiming to validate the model, and to outline its global applicability and potentialities. Obtained results highlighted the full efficacy of the proposed model in supporting ex-ante feasibility studies."
pub.1144293097,Impact of effective governance structure on succession process in the family business: exploring the mediating role of management succession planning," Purpose The aim of this research is to analyze empirical evidence of the effect of governance structure (GS) on perceived success of the succession process. It is also reported that in India, family firms have a more informal organization structure and governance and have an informal and unplanned approach to bringing the successors into family business. Previous studies have reported that GS is an important factor for a successful succession process. This study examines the role of management succession planning as an intervening variable to achieve perceived success of the succession process.   Design/methodology/approach Data have been collected using a questionnaire schedule with 113 respondents who are successors from family business firms in Kerala, India. The study uses snowball sampling technique. Partial least square-structural equation modeling has been used to do data analysis.   Findings The results of the study showed that GS has a significant positive effect on the success of the succession process. GS has a significant positive effect on management succession planning. Management succession planning partially mediates the relationship between GS and perceived success of the succession process.   Research limitations/implications The results of the study indicate the effect of GS on the relationship between, perceived success of the succession process and management succession planning. The mediating role of management succession planning in the above relationship is also confirmed. Therefore, before starting the succession process a good GS should be put in place for ensuring the success of the succession process. Family firms must implement the succession plan well to make the succession process successful.   Originality/value The main contribution of the study is to empirically investigate the effect of GS and management succession planning to enhance the success of the succession process. "
pub.1169162297,Opportunities of Metal Structures in Cooling Systems,"Abstract. The growing market of power electronics in the mobility sector leads to an increasing demand for cooling systems. In the project this need to improve performance is to be met by adapting the cooling structure. Depending on the intended application of cooling systems - automotive, railway and aerospace - different requirements are defined for the cooling process resulting in varying conditions for the design. So metallic foam structures are under investigation because of their high inner surface. Two different process lines are most suitable for the aimed application. The production and optimization of galvanized foams seems to be the most lucrative for a low-cost product, while 3D printing is currently only worthwhile for special applications such as aerospace. As a potentially more cost-effective process, which is already being used for small series, investment casting structures are being investigated as an alternative. Depending on the production process chosen, corresponding requirements for structure creation suitable for production apply. Corresponding process adaptations are also taken into consideration. The first optimization step is an analysis of the conventional open cellular metal foam structures using CT. The results of the CT evaluation, together with the empirical data for fluid mechanical and thermal characteristics, are the basis for a later replacement model of the CFD simulation. Besides the Kelvin cell, which is a good geometrical substitute for the conventional structures that copy the Polyurethan master pattern, other cell types are also considered. Alternatively, structures based on mathematical cells e.g. Schwarz P/D, offer the possibility of separating two media to create cross-flow or counter-flow heat exchangers. Regardless of the chosen system, the main task of the investigation is to find an optimum of the relation between pressure drop and heat transfer performance for the corresponding system and to design the cell arrangement in a way that is suitable for manufacturing. This justifies, among other things, the investigation of a minimal surface structure, which at first seems contradictory. Considering the manufacturing process to be defined beforehand, requirements such as self-supporting design (additive process) and free accessibility (electroplating) also play an important role in the structure development. Thus, the goal is still to optimize the cell and web geometry accordingly."
pub.1023760065,"Environmental-impact reduction through simultaneous design, scheduling, and operation","Processing facilities are normally designed with sufficient flexibility to handle nominal variations. When the process features planned changes in feedstock and products, scheduling is often used to optimize process operation. Proper scheduling may be limited to existing design or may entail retrofitting. Traditionally, economic objectives have served as the primary drivers for the design, retrofitting, and scheduling of industrial processes. Once a base design and scheduling plan have been established, environmental issues are addressed in many cases as an afterthought. As a result of this sequential approach, valuable synergisms and tradeoffs of economic and environmental objectives are often missed. The objective of this study is to develop a new approach to design and scheduling with economic and environmental objectives. Specifically, this study introduces a systematic framework and the associated mathematical formulation for simultaneous process design and scheduling while simultaneously addressing economic and environmental objectives. Therefore, this study establishes two types of proper tradeoffs (a) between design and scheduling and (b) between economic and environmental objectives. The environmental issues pertaining to the parameterized process retrofitting, scheduling, and operation strategies are simultaneously considered along with the environmental impact of these changes. An optimization formulation is developed for the case of project schedule while allowing design retrofitting changes that include new environmental units and modification of design and operating conditions in the process (without new process units). Also, a process model with the appropriate level of relevant details is included in the formulation. The projected schedule is discretized to allow for a multiperiod formulation with algebraic equations. The resulting framework identifies opportunities for synergism between the economic and environmental objectives. It also determines points of diminishing return beyond which tradeoffs between economic and environmental objectives are established. The devised procedure is illustrated with a case study on an oil refinery with scheduling of different products and the design of an environmental system that addresses NOx emission."
pub.1068956461,Development of the HYGAS Process for Converting Coal to Synthetic Pipeline Gas,"A process for converting coal to synthetic pipeline-quality gas is in the final stage of development. A large pilot plant with a daily capacity of 80 tons of coal feed and 1.5 MMcf of gas product is now in operation. Three methods of generating hydrogen from coal char are being developed and will be tested with the HYGAS process, with the goal of establishing commercial operation by 1980.  Introduction The development of the HYGAS process at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) has been a continuous effort since 1946. The need for pipeline-quality gas from coal to supplement pipeline-quality gas from coal to supplement a projected shortage of natural gas was long forecast by IGT and others as being inevitable in the face of a continuing 5 to 6 percent annual increase in demand for natural gas. Despite this, even recently researchers had to defend the need for coal gasification. However, in the last 2 years, the projected shortage etched an indelible mark on the consciousness of both the public and private sectors when the annual discovery rate of gas fell far short of our past additions to reserves. The ""energy crunch"" for natural gas is now being realized by all - so much so that the development of coal gasification processes no longer needs justification, but only processes no longer needs justification, but only immediate commercialization. Unfortunately, an industry for converting pipeline gas from coal cannot be established at will. To comprehend the sheer magnitude of such an industry we must realize that just to supply by coal gasification the incremental annual demand of about 1 Tcf/year would require an investment of about $2 billion and the development of more than 1 billion tons of coal deposit for an annual production of 50 million tons of coal. With these factors in mind, we shall discuss the status of HYGAS process development.   Chronology Work on the HYGAS process began in 1946 and continued under the sole sponsorship of the American Gas Association (AGA) until 1964. During this period much work was done on the fundamentals of reaction kinetics, process yields, and the incorporation of several key process innovations. Experiments went from bench-scale batch studies to small continuous units at high temperatures and pressures that could handle throughputs of about 10 pressures that could handle throughputs of about 10 lb of coal feed per hour. In 1964 the U.S. Dept. of the Interior, of Office of Coal Research (OCR), joined AGA as co-sponsors in a 3-year program that ended with a preliminary design for a large HYGAS pilot plant. During this period, effort was pilot plant. During this period, effort was concentrated on the testing of different types of coal from the U.S. and on defining suitable operating conditions for each type of coal. Most of the work was done in units having, a throughput up to 100 lb of coal feed per hour. In 1967 the contract with OCR was amended to cover the engineering, construction, and operation of the HY"
pub.1091146105,Supporting Process Implementation with the Help of Tangible Process Models,"Situation faced: Companies invest considerable resources in the elaborate design of computer-based process models. Because of these models’ inherent complexity, they are not necessarily suitable for communicating with and training the employees who are supposed to apply them, but their understanding the processes is essential for efficient and effective work. Hence, creative, innovative methods are needed to bring these abstract models to life and increase their adoption by employees who typically have a low affinity for IT-related tools. Therefore, the methods that are developed should require little previous knowledge, (ideally) should not be IT-based, and should stimulate creativity, collaboration, and discussion. They should also create a playful experience while still offering guidance and overview of existing processes.Action taken: The company considered in this case searched for new, playful ways of communicating existing processes to employees who have little knowledge about process operations or process management. Two methods, a process card game and a process board game, were chosen and implemented. The card game conveys the most important process steps and process characteristics in a playful manner, providing a positive experience for the training participants and, thus, being memorable. The process board game complements the card game by conveying deeper knowledge about, for example, incidents that had in the past had positive or critical influences on the process. Both methods were developed in theory, both have been implemented as prototypes, and both have been tested in training new employees and during simulations, after which they were evaluated based on predefined requirements.Results achieved: The participants in the training were interviewed orally and in written form to evaluate the methods’ benefits. Feedback from the trainers was included as well. These participants evaluated the methods positively, as both the participants and the trainers attested to the methods’ ability to provoke discussions and stimulate creativity. Both methods are applicable to a variety of processes with reasonable effort.Lessons learned: Creative models demand the ability to abstract from business processes that are normally filled with details, so a clear business outcome and target group must be in mind when the new methods are first set up. However, since they do not provide a complete presentation of a process, additional methods should be used as complements. It is advisable to focus on one process that matters most to the target group at the beginning and to concentrate on the basic process features while designing the creative methods. Moreover, the degree of creativity should fit the company and its corporate culture."
pub.1106089071,Advances in Wire Bonding Technology to Overcome Resonance Conditions,"Increasing number of semiconductor packages are using low modulus die attach adhesives. Low modulus adhesives can efficiently absorb and dissipate the mechanical and thermal stresses (e.g. due to CTE mismatch) than conventional adhesives resulting in better thermal performance and package reliability. However, wire bonding on a die attached with low modulus adhesive can be very challenging. Die attached with low modulus adhesive is more prone to die movement and vibration, which may lead to resonance condition. Resonance during bonding can cause low ball shear, low IMC, skidded and smashed bonds. This paper examines the challenges of wire bonding on devices attached using low modulus epoxy. A FEA model is developed to understand the effect of key factors such as die attach adhesive modulus, bond line thickness, die size and die thickness on different resonant modes that can occur during wire bonding. It is found that for a given die size, the die thickness, die attach modulus, and bond line thickness can significantly affect resonant modes. When a low modulus epoxy is used, a smaller and thinner die is prone to oscillation and resonance, and is more difficult to wire bond than a larger die. The results show that die and die attach system behaves similar to a mass-spring system, where the die is the mass and the die attach acts like the spring. The resonant frequency of such a system does not depend on an external applied force, but only on the mass and the spring constant (stiffness). Study results of wire bonding process on a device using low modulus adhesive are presented. The process parameters that are found to be most significant are ultrasonic (energy, frequency and control mode), bond force, and bond time. It is found that controlling the bond force and ultrasonic energy is key in optimizing the wire bonding process on these devices. If the force and ultrasonic are not controlled properly, a significant portion of the ultrasonic energy is lost in exciting the die and developing the resonance situation instead of bond formation. Since different devices can vibrate and resonate under different conditions, optimizing the bonding process can be tedious and time consuming. To simplify the process development, a response based process is developed with closed loop force and ultrasonic control. This new process feature helps control resonance issues such as smashed bonds while still achieving a robust process with good ball shear and IMC performance. Experimental results of the wire bonding process using the new process approach are presented."
pub.1127093911,(Invited) Nanostructured Silicon Integrated Circuit Thermoelectric Generators with High Specific Power Generation Capacity,"Microelectronic thermoelectric (TE) devices aimed at integrated circuit (IC) and sensor applications such as on-chip thermal management, bio-thermal power for wearable electronics, and microwatt level sustainable power sources for internet-of-things (IoT) sensors have grown in recent interest. While silicon CMOS by far dominates microelectronics technology, Si has historically not been considered as a viable TE material because bulk Si has a very low TE figure-of-merit ZT ~ 10–3 to 10–2 near room temperature. By contrast, modern “high ZT” materials such as the (Bi,Sb)2(Se,Te)3 family have ZT ≈ 1. However, these materials are incompatible with Si CMOS processing and so have not gained widespread adoption into microelectronic ICs. In 2008 two groups [Hochbaum, et al. Nature 451, 163; Boukai, et al. Nature 451, 168] reported that Si nanowires (NWs) can have ZT up to 0.6. Nevertheless, numerous efforts to develop microelectronic TE generators (TEG) using Si NWs or other nano-structured Si thermopiles have not achieved efficiencies better than what is consistent with ZT ~ 10–2. In practice, efficiency is not necessarily the primary concern in many applications but rather how much power a TEG of given size generates from a temperature difference ∆T, as well as cost per Watt generated. Since the maximum power P max generated is proportional both to (∆T)2 and to cross-sectional area A for heat flow, a performance metric of more direct practical interest is the specific power generation capacity Γ P = P max/[A·(∆T)2], as this measures TEG output power scaled to device size and to ∆T. Γ P is an extrinsic device metric that can be engineered by circuit design and management of parasitic impedances, in contrast to ZT which is an intrinsic material characteristic. In this presentation we will describe IC TEGs using nanostructured silicon thermopiles fabricated on an industrial “65 nm” technology node Si CMOS process line following standard CMOS process design rules. The thermopile elements are nanostructured n- and p-type Si “blades” nominally 80 nm wide x 750 nm long x 320 nm tall, with a typical total thermopile area of 48 µm x 36 µm. Depending on design layout and doping, these Si IC TEGs show high Γ P, up to 29 µW·cm–2K–2, with most designs having Γ P near 8.5 µW·cm–2K–2 using a cold side heat sink at room temperature. In terms of power generation ability a Γ P of order 10 µW·cm–2K–2 makes these Si IC TEGs competitive with (Bi,Sb)2(Se,Te)3 based TEGs, although the net efficiency of these Si IC TEGs is still low. Engineering a high Γ P despite low efficiency results from the ability of Si CMOS processing to fabricate a high areal density of thermocouples while still maintaining a low areal packing fraction, that is, to make uniformly a very large number of very small things in a given area, and to carefully control both intrinsic and parasitic electrical and thermal impedances. We find that TEG power increases significantly with decreasing thermocouple wid"

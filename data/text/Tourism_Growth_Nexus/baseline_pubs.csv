pub.1148692814,Revealing the nexus between tourism development and CO2 emissions in Asia: does asymmetry matter?,"Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions in international tourism, economic growth, and CO2 emissions around the globe. However, the relationships between tourism and CO2 emissions are little and unclearly identified. The purpose of the study is to explore the asymmetric nexus between tourism and CO2 emissions in a panel of five high emitters Asian countries covering the period of 1995–2019 by using panel-NARDL-AMG. The empirical results reveal that a positive shock in tourism arrivals increases CO2 emissions, while a negative shock also increases CO2 emissions in the long run. Moreover, a negative shock has a greater effect on CO2 emissions than a positive shock in Asia in the long run. Tourism receipts are expected to maintain the robustness of CO2 emissions in the long run in Asian economies. The authorities should develop and design green international tourism activities in the Asian economies."
pub.1154098282,"Moderation analysis of exchange rate, tourism and economic growth in Asia","This study brings novelty to the tourism literature by re-examining the role of exchange rate in the tourism-growth nexus. It differs from previous tourism-led growth narrative to probe whether tourism exerts a positive effect on economic growth when the exchange rate is accounted for. Using a moderation modelling framework, instrumental variables general method of moments (IV-GMM) and quantile regression techniques in addition to real per capita GDP, tourism receipts and exchange rate, the study engages data on 44 Asian countries from 2010 to 2019. Results from the IV-GMM show that: (1) tourism exerts a positive effect on growth; (2) exchange rate depreciation hampers growth; (3) the interaction effect is positive but statistically not significant; and (4) results from EAP and SA samples are mixed. For the most part, constructive evidence from the quantile regression techniques reveals that the impact of tourism and exchange is significant at lower quantiles of 0.25 and 0.50 while the interaction effect is negative and statistically significant only for the SA sample. These are new contributions to the literature and policy recommendations are discussed."
pub.1158226729,Institutional Environment and Tourism: Moderating Role of Host Countries’ Health System,"Tourism has gradually emerged to become a significant factor for sustainable economic growth around the globe. Along with other variables, the institutional environment has a significant influence on the growth of the tourism industry. Consequently, there are two primary goals for this study: firstly, to improve the body of knowledge already available on the institution-tourism nexus; secondly, to investigate how the health systems of the host countries contribute to the said nexus. To analyze these relations, we collected data from 50 countries across 10 years (2009–2018). We apply multiple regression analysis to a balanced panel dataset of 500 observations. Furthermore, we also used an interactive variable in conjunction with the primary independent, dependent, and control variables of the study to determine the moderating effect of the host countries’ health systems. The study’s findings demonstrated the significance of an efficient institutional structure in boosting tourism. Additionally, the health systems of the host nations play a significant role in strengthening the connection between institutions and tourism, especially in the post-COVID-19 period. Through the creation of institutional frameworks and health infrastructure, the study’s findings will assist policymakers in developing efficient tourism policies. All of the above strategies will eventually lead to a trustworthy, safe, and healthy environment for both locals and visitors."
pub.1144724726,An empirical note on tourism and sustainable development nexus,"The goal of this research is to investigate the impact of tourism on sustainable development in the 10 most visited countries. For this purpose, following the STIRPAT model, the impact of urbanization, energy intensity, and tourism on the newly designed sustainable development index is examined for the period 1995–2015. In doing so, tourism is represented by two different indicators, the number of tourists and tourism receipts. In addition, the impact of tourism on economic growth is analyzed to compare the effects of tourism development on economic growth and sustainable development. While doing this, second-generation panel data methods are used to take into account the possible inter-country dependency. According to the findings obtained in the study, tourism, energy intensity, and urbanization have positive effects on economic growth. On the other hand, the effects of all three factors on the sustainable development index are negative and statistically significant. These findings indicate that the harmful effects of tourism on other dimensions of sustainable development are greater than the beneficial effects of tourism on economic growth."
pub.1163247467,Sustainable electricity consumption in South Africa: the impacts of tourism and economic growth,"The current study examines sustainable electricity consumption for economic growth in a small open and tourist economy. The energy-tourism nexus is evaluated for the relationship between sustainable electricity consumption and the international tourist arrival for the South African economy. The present study leverages on annual frequency data for South Africa from 1995 to 2019 for empirical analysis using the ARDL technique. Accordingly, empirical findings indicate a significant direct connection between the sustainable electricity consumption and the international tourism arrival; the study affirms that tourism-induced energy hypothesis is valid in South Africa. However, from a policy standpoint, alternative energy efficiency mechanisms such as renewable energy systems and emancipation of current energy management capabilities are recommended in South Africa. This is necessary for sustainable eco-friendly tourism that engenders clean energy consumption for the study area. More insights into policy caveats are presented in the concluding section."
pub.1144518376,"Assessing the linkage between energy consumption, financial development, tourism and environment: evidence from method of moments quantile regression","According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), tourism sector ranks high in terms of her contribution to economic growth and employment opportunity generation in most economies. Several studies have been documented in the extant literature on the nexus between emission, tourism, and economic growth. However, the role of foreign direct investment that highlights either pollution haven or halo hypothesis and pivotal role of domestic credit to private sector in an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) environment is lacking in the extant literature. To this end, this study used augmented mean group (AMG) and method of moment quantile regression (MM-QR) approaches to explore the nexus between per capital income and its square, tourism, foreign direct investment, domestic credit to private sector and CO2 emission. Empirical results show that tourism had a negative significant relationship with CO2 emission. Furthermore, income on the other hand had positive relationship with emissions while its square had negative relationship with emissions. This result also shows the presence of EKC indicating the inverted U-shaped curve. FDI has shown a positive significant relationship with pollution which indicates the pollutant haven hypothesis (PHH), and credit to private sector shows a positive relationship with CO2 emission. On the causality analysis from Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test, there was a bi-directional causality between: tourism and CO2 emission, per capital income and CO2 emission as well as domestic credit and CO2 emission. From these outcomes, it shows that tourism development is not detrimental to environmental quality in the Mediterranean region investigated. However, there is need for caution on FDI influx and dirty economic activities that might compromise environmental quality in the study bloc."

Thus, many countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are paying more attention to tourism development as alternative growth path to boost their economies. However, the tourism-induced growth is not void of its environmental issues. To this end, this study using recent econometrics analysis explored the nexus between tourism arrival GDP growth, urbanization, carbon dioxide emission, and foreign direct investment for oil and non-oil sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, that is, to ascertain the real impacts of tourism and FDI on the environmental performance of the regions. Empirical results show that tourism, GDP growth, and FDI dampen the quality of the environment. For instance, a 1% increase in tourism activities worsens the quality of the environment by 1.09%. Interestingly, renewable energy shows statistical strength to improve environmental quality. The causality analysis resonates with the outcomes of the regression by giving credence to one-way causality between tourism and carbon dioxide emission. A similar trend of causality is seen between FDI and carbon dioxide emission and urbanization and carbon dioxide emission. Thus, as a policy prescription, strict environmental guidelines and regulations are necessary for controlling the unhealthy and undue economic activities that are suspected to impact environment negatively."
pub.1155227156,Re-examining the tourism-led growth nexus and the role of information and communication technology in East Asia and the Pacific,"This study revisits the tourism-led growth discourse and differs from the existing literature to examine if information and communications technology (ICT) moderates the relationship between tourism and economic growth in East Asia and the Pacific. Using data on 33 selected countries, the study deploys the Driscoll and Kraay (1998) [1] panel spatial correlation consistent (PSCC) approach, Machado and Santos Silva (2019) [2] method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) and Arellano and Bond (1991) [3] generalized method of moments (GMM) technique. Using a composite ICT index on four indicators ((mobile phones, fixed telephones, fixed broadband, and secured internet servers) derived from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the results which are mostly consistent across the three estimation methods reveal, among others, that (1) ICT moderates the tourism-growth path and the effect is positive and statistically significant; (2) the moderation effect is consistently positive across all quantiles of Q<sub>0.25</sub>, Q<sub>0.50</sub> and Q<sub>0.75</sub>; (3) the results are sustained when omitted variables (growth enablers) - institutions, R&amp;D, and human capital - are accounted for. Policy recommendations are discussed."

However, the uncertainties and risks experienced in the tourism industry and other economy sectors have remained the drawback of most economies and destinations. As such, the panel of 20 selected destinations is investigated via the common correlated effect method to examine the nexus of economic policy uncertainty and tourism development over the period 2001–2017. Interestingly, the result established a long term relationship between the economic policy uncertainty index and outbound tourism expenditures. Specifically, the finding revealed that outbound tourism expenditures are affected negatively by the rise of uncertainty in economic policies, thus suggesting instability of economic-related policy is the bane of tourism development in the destinations. This result stands to have important policy guide for especially for tourism-related activities in the panel of 20 selected countries."
pub.1165749997,"Demystifying the association between economic development, transportation, tourism, renewable energy, and ecological footprint in Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation region during globalization mode","The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) economies have yet to meaningfully contribute to accomplishing Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7) affordable and clean energy, (SDG 8) decent work and economic growth, and (SDG 13) climate action. Dealing with this issue might require a shift or alteration of policy framework that is the major theme of this study. Consequently, this present research inspects the influence of economic growth, transportation, tourism sector development, and renewable energy on ecological footprint using panel time series from 1990 and 2019 for the BIMSTEC region. To evaluate this dynamic nexus between the mentioned environmental pollution drivers of ecological footprint, this study employed the augumented mean group (AMG) and common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG) regression estimators after detection of cross-sectional dependency. The empirical outcomes denote that economic growth and transportation sector of BIMSTEC countries increase the levels of ecological footprint. Conversely, tourism sector development, globalization, and renewable energy protect the ecological excellence in the region. Moreover, it is observed that a unidirectional causality exists from economic growth to ecological footprint, ecological footprint to transportation, tourism to ecological footprint, and globalization to ecological footprint, while bidirectional causality exists between renewable energy and ecological footprint. By observing the positive function of tourism, green energy, and globalization on sustainable environment progress, central authorities are capable to redesign policies concerning supportable efficient technologies and regulate globalization towards green programs and agenda to reduce global warming."
pub.1168989708,Exploring the nexus between economic and environmental issues in the tourism sector at the country level. A replicable framework,"In recent years, the tourism activities take experienced a steady growth in demand, yet it causes ecological damages, such as waste production and carbon dioxide emissions. This paper provides a theoretical framework for testing the interactions among sustainable development and economic growth in the tourism context and demonstrates that sustainability depends on both environmental impacts and some relationships among different factors. In particular, considering some of the key indicators proposed by Agenda 2030 and integrated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the authors focused on the direct influence of tourism to Gross Domestic Product (TGDP), Environmental Performance Indicator (EPI) score, and Carbon Footprint (CF) as indicators that were used together with GDP and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) to test five hypotheses and analyze their interactions for a sample country. The results reveal the statistical significance among these indicators in the light of Sustainable Development Goals n. 8, n. 12, and n. 13. Finally, Municipal Solid Waste, the first visible human effect due to tourism, presents a strong interaction with Carbon Footprint."
pub.1165572095,"Clean energy-led tourism development in Malaysia: Do environmental degradation, FDI, Education and ICT matter?","Concerning tourism, two lines of evidence are available in the literature, i.e., tourism's impact on macro fundamentals and determinants of tourism development. Regarding determinants, researchers have documented positive and negative associations between selected macro fundamentals and tourism development. The study's objective is to examine the impact of clean energy, foreign direct investment (FDI), education, and information and communication technology (ICT) on tourism development in Malaysia from 1990 to 2021. The study employed several econometrical techniques in investigating the empirical nexus, including the Bayer-Hancked cointegration test, ARDL Bound testing, Nonlinear ARDL, Toda-Yamamoto causality, and Fourier TY causality test. Moreover, the study employed dynamic OLS, Fully-modified OLS and CCR for the coefficient robust test. The study indicates that the utilization of renewable energy sources has the potential to alleviate the adverse environmental impacts associated with conventional energy sources. This, in turn, can enhance the appeal of tourist destinations to environmentally conscious visitors. Clean energy sources can provide tourism enterprises with cost-saving opportunities, improving profitability and ensuring long-term sustainability. Furthermore, the study reveals a noteworthy correlation between foreign direct investment (FDI) and tourism development. This implies that FDI plays a significant role in fostering tourism activities within the economy. Moreover, it has been found that education plays a crucial role in fostering tourism growth by positively influencing the quality of services and experiences offered to travelers. Finally, the study emphasizes the positive impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on the growth and advancement of the tourism industry. This is particularly evident in utilizing online booking systems, mobile applications, and immersive virtual tourism experiences."
pub.1130819325,The nexus of water-energy-food in China's tourism industry,"The tourism industry contributes significantly to the growth of the global economy and is considered to be strongly associated with a large amounts of water and energy consumption. In this study, the tourism water footprint (TWF) and the tourism energy footprint (TEF) of 138 sectors were investigated to examine the water-energy-food (W-E-F) nexus in the Chinese tourism industry from 2012 to 2017 by developing the water- and energy-based environmentally extended input-output analysis with the tourism satellite account. This study revealed that the W-E-F supply groups consumed total 15,556 million m<sup>3</sup> of water and 4,964 million tce of energy to support the Chinese tourism industry. The largest contributor to the total TWF is the indirect water use from the food supply group (65%), while the largest proportion of total TEF is contributed by the direct energy use from 11 tourism direct sectors (63%), most especially the air transport sector. A much larger growth of the tourism industry was observed in 2017 compared to that of 2012. The structure decomposition analysis revealed that the growth of the overall water and energy consumption of China tourism is mainly driven by the growth of the total tourism expenditure, i.e. the scale effect. It is the same case for the food supply group associated with the Chinese tourism industry. In contrast, the contribution of the changes to the tourism expenditure composition is relatively low. Furthermore, the growth in water and energy consumption can be offset effectively by reducing the water and energy use coefficient and adjusting the economic production structure of tourism and its associated food supply group. In sum, the food supply and air transport sectors play a crucial role in the water-energy-food nexus of the tourism industry. Therefore, in the future, focus should be placed on improving the water and energy use efficiency of these sectors as well as enhancing their production structures."
pub.1144633959,Effects of tourism and eco-innovation on environmental quality in selected ASEAN countries,"Environmental issues have gained the attention of regulators and researchers worldwide. This present study empirically examines the validation of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in the selected ASEAN economies for the period 1995–2018 in the presence of eco-innovations and tourism. This study assesses the short-run and long-run relationship between carbon dioxide emission, tourism, eco-innovations, and economic growth in ASEAN countries. To fulfil the objectives of the study, Westerlund and Edgerton (Oxf Bull Econ Stat 70:665-704, 2008) and Banerjee and Carrion‐i‐Silvestre (J Time Ser Anal 38:610-636, 2017) co-integration analysis have been applied to estimate the co-integration among variables because cross-sectional dependence (CSD) and slope heterogeneity was present. The short-run and the long-run empirical estimation have been done through cross-sectional auto distributive lag model. The findings provide evidence that an inverted U-shape nexus exists between carbon (CO2) emissions and economic growth in the ASEAN countries, a validation of EKC. Eco-innovations and tourism are found to be the factors that mitigate CO2 emissions. AMG and CCEMG results also confirm the robustness of short-run and long-run results. The findings of the study suggest that governments in ASEAN countries should promote tourism and eco-innovations (i.e., research and development) to mitigate CO2 emission, which poses serious threats to environmental sustainability. Also, tourism and eco-innovations are the drivers of economic growth, and growth reconciles with environmental sustainability in the selected ASEAN countries. This study provides guidelines to the policymakers while formulating the regulations related to environmental degradation."
pub.1157251531,RETRACTED ARTICLE: International tourism and business productivity: does eco-friendly technologies matter?,"This research is aimed at determining whether eco-friendly technologies go beyond and above in providing business productivity in international tourism. For this, the study obtained data from different databases, and this data range consisted of 2010–2020. The study applied the co-integration analysis, random and static technique, regression analysis technique, split analysis technique, and mediating effect tests on Chinese data. This research shows that tourism business innovation contributed 12%, value proposition as 9%, internal marketing as 16%, customer relationship management as 19.3%, tourists motivation as 34.05%, tourists time as 18.94%, green technological adoption as 17.3%, tourists visit intention as 8.11%, and green technical transfer as 28.1% in study model. Thus, the findings confirmed that international tourism and business productivity have a dynamic empirical nexus with the mediating role of eco-friendly technology adoption. Furthermore, such findings are robust empirically and validate the empirical connections among the study variables. These results imply that Chinese tourism industry stakeholders may use eco-friendly technologies to good effect, significantly enhancing tourism business productivity, international tourists’ satisfaction, and tourists’ revisit intentions. Hence, the study also directs practical implications related to the study topicality and China’s tourism industry for prudent growth acquisition."
pub.1160327494,"The nexus between government spending, economic growth, and tourism under climate change: testing the CEM model for the USA","This study examines the impact of government spending, income, and tourism consumption on CO2 emissions in the 50 US states through a novel theoretical model derived from the Armey Curve model and the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. The findings of this research are essential for policymakers to develop effective strategies for mitigating environmental pollution. Utilizing panel cointegration analysis, the study provides valuable insights into whether continued increases in government spending contribute to higher pollution levels. By identifying the threshold point of spending as a percentage of GDP, policymakers can make informed decisions to avoid the trade-off between increased spending and environmental degradation. For instance, the analysis reveals that Hawaii's tipping point is 16.40%. The empirical results underscore the importance of adopting sustainable policies that foster economic growth while minimizing environmental harm. These findings will aid policymakers in formulating targeted and efficient approaches to tackle climate change and promote long-term environmental sustainability in the United States. Moreover, the impact of tourism development on CO2 emissions varies across states, with some US states experiencing a decrease while others see an increase."

According to the results of panel quantile regression model for 17 countries, the tourism-led growth hypothesis is valid in low growth levels, but deviations from this hypothesis are determined after the middle growth level. Also, the CO2 coefficient at low growth levels indicated that sustainable growth is achieved, but no significant results are obtained at subsequent growth levels. Finally, energy consumption supports economic growth at low and medium growth levels. Short-run causality test results illustrated that there is bidirectional causality between GDP and all explanatory variables."
pub.1144785499,"The impact of foreign direct investment, tourism, electricity consumption, and economic development on CO2 emissions in Bangladesh","The study’s goal is to investigate the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI), tourism, electricity consumption, and economic development on CO2 emissions in Bangladesh between 1990 and 2019. Empirical results reveal that FDI, electricity consumption, and economic development variables have significant and positive long-term effects on CO2 emissions. Tourism, on the other hand, has a long-term negative effect. The square of the GDP variable has a substantial negative coefficient. This indicates that in Bangladesh, the nexus between CO2 emissions and economic development is U-shaped inverted. As a result, the EKC postulate is proven to be correct. In the short term, electricity consumption, economic development, GDP2, and tourism have no substantial effect on CO2 emissions. Only the coefficients of FDI are negative and significant. The expected ECM coefficients are also negative and statistically significant. According to these data, the system as a whole adjusts at a rate of 60%. The Granger causality study reveals one direction of causation between electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions and economic development, electricity consumption and economic development, FDI, and CO2 emissions."

We established four plausible hypotheses and verified by employing the autoregressive distributed lags model and Granger causality based on vector error correction model (VECM). Considering the cointegration relationship between the variables, the outcomes of autoregressive distributed lags suggested that tourism increases economic growth, and economic growth induces tourism in the long-run, thus confirming tourism-led development, and growth-led tourism hypothesis; similarly, the tourism generates CO2e emissions, which supported the tourism-led emission hypothesis. The role of renewable energy consumption found to be a significant moderator, thus helping to enrich tourism, accelerating economic growth, and combating CO2e in the country. VECM causal results indicated the significant bidirectional causal linkages between tourism and economic growth—another causality found between tourism and CO2e. There is one-way causality from FDI and renewable energy towards income simultaneously. Overall, the designers of policies will find this study useful for policymaking at government levels for smooth economic growth, investment, and sustainable tourism sector."
pub.1117487736,"Triangular nexus between foreign direct investment, international tourism, and energy consumption in the Chinese economy: accounting for environmental quality","Recently, China is named among the most carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting countries in the world after the United State of America (USA). A major part of Chinese carbon dioxide emissions is as a result of offshore industrial activities which come into the economy as foreign direct investment (FDI). Following this, the present study seeks to investigate the nexus between CO2 emissions, FDI, energy use, and tourism arrivals, and possibly to advise on who will bear the responsibility of offshore CO2 emissions. Utilizing ARDL-bound testing and Granger causality approaches for both short- and long-run effects the author found that economic growth (GDP) has a positive relationship with both tourism arrivals, energy use, FDI, and CO2.This contributes to heavy CO2 emissions which the author classified as the outsourced/offshore CO2emissions in China’s FDI. Tourism arrivals have a bi-directional (feedback) causal relationship with energy use and a uni-directional causal relationship with CO2(transmitting from tourism to CO2). Both FDI and energy use have a bi-directional (feedback) causal relationship; CO2, energy use, and tourism arrivals have a unidirectional relationship with GDP which established the triangular nexus causality among the variables and the impact on GDP. Hence, the policy implication should be geared towards implementing the policies and regulations that will checkmate and reduce the excesses of foreign firms to the environment quality of China and promote environmentally friendly economic activities."
pub.1175817253,"The dynamic nexus between economic growth, renewable energy use, urbanization, industrialization, tourism, green supply chain management, and CO2","Since 2012, China has pursued an ""ecological civilization"" policy to promote green energy, increase environmental protection, and transition to more sustainable growth models. The complicated positive trends in energy consumption, more sustainable economic growth, and ecological management are obscured by China's persistent, significant dependence on fossil fuels, particularly coal. The study aims to analyze how renewable energy use in China affects carbon dioxide emissions and how those impacts change over time, as well as urbanization, industrialization, tourism, and green supply chain management. The DOLS dynamic system method used historical data from 1995 to 2022. The DOLS results show a positive and statistically significant economic growth coefficient in the long term, suggesting that an increase of only one percent in CO₂ emissions rise would be proportional to a surge in economic growth. Furthermore, using renewable energy sources correlates with long-term sustainability negatively and significantly. The results show reducing CO₂ emissions and boosting renewable energy use by 1 %. Furthermore, the long-run coefficients for industrialization and urbanization are positive and statistically significant, indicating that a 1 % increase in either component results in a comparable increase in CO₂ emissions. Sustainable logistics and tourism have negative and statistically significant coefficients, meaning that a one percent increase will gradually decrease carbon dioxide emissions. The estimated findings hold up when using other estimators, such as the commonly used co-integrating regression (CCR) strategy and fully modified least squares (FMOLS). When Granger causality is coupled, the test also catches the variables' causal link. test. To achieve environmental sustainability, the essay suggests using robust regulatory policy tools to curb ecological deterioration."
pub.1130654883,"An investigation into the anthropogenic nexus among consumption of energy, tourism, and economic growth: do economic policy uncertainties matter?","Global warming has been a pressing issue for the past decade as various economic activities have been flagged and are expected to reduce emissions. While previous studies have examined the energy consumption-emissions-economic growth nexus in significant detail, attention is yet to be given to the role of economic policy uncertainties and human activities such as tourism in a carbon function. Thus, this study aims to investigate the long-run relationship between energy consumption, tourists’ arrivals, economic policy uncertainty, and ecological footprint in the top ten earners from international tourism over the period 1995 to 2015. The fully modified ordinary least square and dynamic ordinary least square estimation techniques and the Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality tests were used in the study. Empirical results suggest that economic policy uncertainties in addition to tourism and energy consumption are drivers of environmental degradation. However, the contribution of energy consumption to ecological footprint is significantly moderated by economic policy uncertainties such that a 1% increase in the latter reduces environmental damage by 0.71%. This study suggests that policy uncertainties matter a great deal for energy and environmental policies. Also, green economic growth is possible if the proper implementation of environmental protection policies can restrict the harmful impact of economic activities on the quality of the environment. Based on the empirical findings, vital energy policy recommendations are suggested."
pub.1151575926,Revival of sun-and-beach tourism through the lens of regulatory and risk dimensions of environmental sustainability,"Environmental sustainability is essential in tourism literature, and sun-and-beach tourism (SBT) is one of the most popular subsections of the tourism field. The appropriate policies and strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic to revive SBT growth through the lens of the regulatory dimension (RED) and risk dimension (RID) of environmental sustainability are gaining timely ground to conduct this research. The current study examined the nexus between SBT, RED, and RID utilizing three novel indexes (i.e., weighted sun-and-beach tourism index, weighted regulatory dimension index, and weighted risk dimension index) by employing the principal component analysis within the framework of six stages of empirical estimation strategy. These three novel indexes combine the most commonly used SBT, RED, and RID indicators. This research tested the CSD and homogeneous, then employed the second generation CIPS-CADF panel unit root test, used an AMG estimator, and employed the panel Toda-Yamamoto (PTY) causality test. The findings revealed that the RED positively influences SBT while the RID mitigates SBT. Results also indicate bidirectional causality between SBT, RID, and RED. In other words, changes in RID and RED have predictive power for the SBT, which further highlights the role of SBT on the RID and RED. Therefore, concerned authorities can focus on environmental sustainability design initiatives and appropriate policy/strategy implications to boost SBT."

We present a comprehensive literature review and the effects of tourism development, economic growth, and renewable energy consumption on the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. Specifically, the effects of gross domestic product, renewable energy consumption, and tourism receipts on carbon dioxide emissions in OECD countries are examined utilizing the bootstrap panel cointegration technique and the augmented mean group estimator. The results showed that tourism development has negative and significant effects on CO2 emission in Canada, Czechia, and Turkey, while tourism development has positive and significant effects on CO2 emission in Italy, Luxembourg, and the Slovak Republic. Also, Belgium, France, New Zealand, and the Slovak Republic have shifted towards sustainable tourism practices. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
pub.1128338468,"The asymmetric relationship between globalization, tourism, CO2 emissions, and economic growth in Turkey: implications for environmental policy making","The current study examines the importance of asymmetric modelling of tourism-CO2 emissions relationship by incorporating real income per capita and the newly developed globalization index in a multivariate time series model between 1970 and 2014 for Turkey. We used a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model in analyzing the asymmetric cointegration association between the selected variables. Using Hatemi-J (2012) asymmetric causality testing method, we examined the asymmetric causal relationship among the variables. The empirical outcomes provide evidence for the existence of asymmetric long-run cointegration nexus among the variables. Asymmetric causality results show that both the positive and negative shock of tourism influence the CO2 emissions in the long-term, while in the short-term, only the negative shock of tourism contributes to CO2 emissions. Also discussed are the policy implications with regard to Turkey’s environmental and economic policies."
pub.1141916119,Designing policy framework for sustainable development in Next-5 largest economies amidst energy consumption and key macroeconomic indicators,"Abstract
Global travel and tourism have enjoyed a significant boost due to the progress in air transport. However, the debate on air transport and the influx of foreign investments and global energy demand on economic development remains questionable. Therefore, this study is an attempt to contribute to the body of knowledge in the energy-tourism-led growth hypothesis literature. For this purpose, a novel approach to the effects of international tourism on economic growth is introduced for the Next-5 largest economies, namely (China, India, Indonesia, Turkey and the USA) between 1990 and 2018. Empirical results reveal a positive connection between foreign direct investment and income levels, electricity production and income levels, as well as between urbanization and economic growth. Moreover, the validation of the environmental Kuznets curve and the halo effect of foreign direct investment on the environmental degradation process provides a shred of more substantial evidence and fitting environmental instruments for policymakers. The empirical results encourage sustainable economic growth in these countries, mainly through the attraction of clean and high-technology foreign investment, the increase of the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix and the regulation in the tourism industry. The novel contribution of this study to the empirical literature is the unification in the same research of the TLGH and the EKC for the Next-5 largest economies, establishing recommendations for tourism, energy efficiency and environmental correction process."
pub.1138769447,A bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of tourism-environmental degradation nexus,"This study aims to provide a comprehensive knowledge map of tourism and environmental degradation literature review based on scientific articles published between 1999 and 2020. The study provides an overview of research, influential authors, and journals. The PR China has maintained the lead in academic research with the most contribution in academic research in recent years. Sustainability, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Katircioglu are the most productive journal, academic institution, and author in the field of tourism and environmental degradation, respectively. The degree of research contribution among researchers, institutional and national level, has an upward trend in recent years, but the research contribution among author level is higher than the institutional and national level. Furthermore, co-citation analysis suggests that research articles in the field are closely related. “Investigating the influence of tourism on economic growth and carbon emissions: Evidence from panel analysis of the European Union” authored by Lee is the most cited article. Our analysis of abstracts and keywords shows that climate change, ecotourism, carbon emissions, economic growth, and energy consumption are the hot spots of academic literature. We suggest that research collaboration between developed and developing nations should be promoted in creating sustainable tourism reforms."
pub.1131787042,Exploring the nexus between tourism development and environmental quality: Role of Renewable energy consumption and Income,"Tourism appears as a catalyst for growth and development; however, recent studies have documented that this sector heavily depends on energy sector and as a consequence, entire tourism industry has been blamed for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This study aims to investigate the impact of tourism develop, renewable energy and real GDP on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for G20 economies during the period of 1995-2015. In the presence of panel unit root, Pedroni and Kao methods confirm long-run cointegration among variables. FMOLS results show that a 1% increase in tourism development decreases pollution emissions by 0.05% in long run. The results show that the increase in renewable energy consumption reduces pollution emissions. A 1% increases in renewable energy reduces pollution emissions by 0.15% in long run. There was an inverted U-shaped relation between pollution and real GDP in long run confirming the validity of environmental Kuznets curve. Paper concludes that tourism development can be driving force for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction."
pub.1143309376,"On the nexus between globalization, tourism, economic growth, and biocapacity: evidence from top tourism destinations","Abstract
Several studies have investigated the relationship between tourism, consumption of energy, globalization, and ecological footprint. However, the role of biocapacity alongside tourism development in environmental sustainability is yet to be documented in the extant literature. No doubt, the biocapacity of a country, its level of tourist’s arrival, as well as globalization all contribute immensely to ecological footprint. Consequently, this study looks at long-run and causality connections with a special focus on bio-capacity. The study uses the pooled mean group-autoregressive distributed lag model (PMG-ARDL) methodology to test the causality relationship during 2016 international tourists’ receipt from world tourism organization data files for 10 tourism destinations. Empirical result based on the panel PMG-ARDL confirms the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for the 10 tourism destinations countries investigated. Furthermore, the panel ARDL estimator was used to estimate the short-run and long-run relationships simultaneously between biocapacity, tourist arrivals, GDP per capita, globalization, and ecological footprints. While the Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test was used to establish causality relationships among the highlighted variables. The trade-off between economic growth and environmental quality suggests that tourist arrival dampens environmental quality. In addition, the study finds that growing biocapacity affects ecological footprints negatively. Furthermore, an increase in tourism-related activities, globalization, and economic production has the potential to damage the quality of the environment. To this end, given the study results, there is a need to pursue green tourism which can reduce environmental degradation and destruction of land caused by multiple tourism-related transportation and construction of tourist facilities respectively in the top ten tourist destination countries."

New evidence from nonlinear ARDL approach,"This study investigates the nexus between tourism, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and health spending in Mexico. We applied a nonlinear ARDL approach for the empirical analysis for the time period 1996-2018. Mexico receives a large number of tourists each year, tourism improves foreign exchange earnings and contributes positively to the economic growth. However, tourist activities impose a serious environmental cost in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which increase health spending. The empirical findings suggest that tourism leads to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which resultantly causes a high level of health spending in Mexico. Both short-run and long-run findings reported a significant positive association between tourism, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and health expenditures. Therefore, the government needs legislation to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, besides the use of renewable energy could also help to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and health expenditures in society. This study does not support to reduce the health expenditure, rather it suggests optimal utilization of the funds allocated to the health sector."
pub.1125560855,"Modeling the nexus between pollutant emission, energy consumption, foreign direct investment, and economic growth: new insights from China","Most nations are predominately preoccupied with the need to increase economic growth amidst pressure for increased energy consumption. However, higher energy consumption from fossil fuel has its environmental implication(s) especially in a high industrial economy like China. In this context, the current study explores the interaction between pollutant emission, foreign direct investment, energy consumption, tourism arrival, and economic growth for quarterly frequency data from 1995Q1 to 2016Q4 for econometrics analysis. Pesaran’s autoregressive distributed lag–bound test traces long-run relationship between all outlined variables over the investigated period. Empirical results show positive relationship between pollutant emissions with all other variables with the exception of economic growth. This further exposes the environmental degradation in China with the curtailing strength from the GDP. The Granger causality analysis detects that CO2 emissions and energy consumption show a two-way causality observed. Also, one-way causality existing between growth and foreign direct investment is seen running to pollutant emission. Furthermore, one-way causality is observed among foreign direct investment, energy consumption, pollutant emission, and tourism arrivals with economic growth, and this established their impact on the economic growth which will be a guide to the policy implication on how to ameliorate environmental degradation from the effect of consumption of fossil energy sources and foreign direct investment–induced pollutant emission."

As a result, it is important to unearth the factors which can neutralize carbon emissions to transform the world economy into a low-carbon one. Against this backdrop, this study explores the carbon dioxide neutralizing effects of economic growth, international tourism, clean energy promotion, and technological innovation in the context of five European Union (EU-5) nations during the 1990-2015 period. This study's main contribution is in terms of its approach to test the interaction effect between foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and energy innovation on carbon dioxide emissions. The econometric analysis chronologically involves the employment of unit root, cointegration, causality, and regression methods. Overall, the findings support the inverted-U-shaped economic growth-carbon dioxide emissions nexus to verify the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Besides, the Pollution Haven Hypothesis in the context of the selected panel is also verified as higher FDI inflows are seen to boost the carbon dioxide emission levels. The results also confirm that energy innovation moderates the harmful effect of air transport (a proxy for international tourism) on carbon dioxide emissions during the developing stage of the tourism industry. On the other hand, renewable energy promotion is found to curb carbon dioxide emissions. These findings suggest that the European governments need to enhance investments in their respective renewable energy sectors and simultaneously ensure the development of clean industries, which can collectively help these nations become carbon-neutral in the future."

Accordingly, the current study employed the cointegration and a two-step (system) SYS-Generalized Method of Moments to examine the environmental sustainability effects of income, international tourism arrivals, and labour force vis-à-vis gender unemployment in the panel of (32) Organization for Economic Development and Corporation (OECD) for the period 1995–2016. The study revealed that income growth in the OECD countries and increase in the inflow of international tourists into the OECD member countries are significant endangering factors for the bloc’s environmental sustainability. More striking is the environmental impact of labour force in the panel countries. Intuitively, a positive labour force-environmental degradation nexus is expected; the negatively desirable labour force-environmental degradation nexus in the current study is a justification of (1) the prevailing gender employment/unemployment classifications in the OECD member countries, and (2) the increasing adoption of more environmental friendlier working conditions or operation among the member countries. Moreover, the current study strongly posits a significant policy framework for the governments and stakeholders of the OECD member countries."
pub.1132550294,The mediating role of ICTs in the relationship between international tourism and environmental degradation: fit as a fiddle,"The United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed 17 effective plans linked with three principal aims, i.e., eradicating poverty, conserving the natural environment, and ensuring prosperity for all. Travel and tourism are the leading stream sector through which all the three stated United Nations themes could be achieved efficiently. The future project of Saudi Arabia's vision is also in line with the United Nation SDGs that much emphasized on tourism expansion, innovation, and sustainable development, which directly supports the SDG-8 (i.e., decent work and economic growth), SDG-9 (i.e., industries, innovation, and infrastructure), SDG-12 (i.e., responsible consumption and production), and SDG-13 (i.e., climate change). The study’s objective is to evaluate the country’s e-tourism initiatives and green development agenda in the long-run by using the quarterly data from 1995Q1 to 2018Q4. The study employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for estimating the short- and long-run relationship between the variables. Further, the study developed an “e-tourism index” that combines ICT’s share in tourism income and expenditures items by principle component matrix (PCM). The results show that oil rents, ores and metal exports, and railways goods transportation depleted natural resources, while ICT’s share in energy demand, inbound tourism, and trade openness conserve natural resources via the adoption of advanced technologies, eco-tourism knowledge, and green technology imports in a country. The results confirmed the U-shaped relationship between the country’s per capita income and natural resource depletion in a given period. The positive relationship (negative impact) of air transportation freight and trade openness with carbon emissions is evident in the short-run; however, the result is insignificantly determined in the long-run. The industry value-added and ICT’s share in energy demand substantially delimit carbon emissions through cleaner production techniques and green innovation. The U-shaped relationship in the short- and flat relationship in the long-run is found for carbon-growth nexus. In the long-run, inbound tourism has a positive (negative impact) relationship with carbon emissions that need sustainable tourism policies to delimit carbon emissions. The air-railways passengers carried and trade openness is the main antecedents that influenced fossil fuel energy consumption in the short- and long-run, while in the long-run, tourism income, ICT’s share in energy demand, and industry value-added delimit fossil fuel combustion. The study confirmed the inverted U-shaped relationship between carbon emissions and per capita income in a country. The e-tourism index positively influences the country’s economic growth, mobile share in the energy demand, industry value-added, and railways goods transportation. In the long-run, the mobile share in energy demand and railways goods transported increase while air transport fre"
pub.1158254224,Can tourism development and economic growth mutually reinforce in small countries? Evidence from Singapore,"This study investigates the causal relationships between international tourism development and the economic growth of a global city–state – Singapore – drilling into the temporal details of the tourism-economy nexus in small countries. Many studies have examined whether the tourism-led growth hypothesis or the economy driven-tourism growth hypothesis holds in large developed and emerging countries. Still, relatively few studies examine small countries’ tourism-economy nexus, and the temporal details of the nexus have not been adequately examined. We examine the tourism-economy nexus in Singapore using quarterly data from 1991Q1 to 2020Q4 and the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model, with the long- and short-run dynamics and the feedback loop of the nexus considered. Our statistical findings show that international tourism development leads economic growth by two quarters in Singapore. Also, there are both ‘consistent’ and ‘contemporaneous’ positive feedback loops between tourism development and economic growth, but those loops cannot last for more than a quarter. From the economic perspective, our study reveals that improving tourism activities may accelerate the post-Covid economic recovery of some small countries that rely on tourism. Yet, continuous input is required to sustain the tourism-economy synergy."

Our findings indicate strong short-run and long-run spillover effects, suggesting that policymakers should consider regional tourism development as a key factor for boosting national economic growth."
pub.1133389067,The Relation between Tourism and Economic Growth: A Case of Saudi Arabia as an Emerging Tourism Destination,"This paper examines empirically the relation between tourism and economic growth in Saudi Arabia. The authors try to justify how tourism contributes to the economic growth of Saudi Arabia. There are applied descriptive statistics, unit root test, VAR model and Granger Causality test as an econometric methodology to examine the connection between tourism and economic growth in Saudi Arabia for the annual data in the period from 1990 to 2018. The main empirical results of the study find out that tourism affects positively the economic growth in Saudi Arabia. Also, there is found a positive nexus among tourism and economic growth. Furthermore, CO2 emissions and financial development impact positively the tourism sector, while trade openness predicts a negative effect on tourism. Additionally, CO2 emissions, financial development, and trade openness have a positive impact on economic growth in Saudi Arabia. Finally, the Granger causality test provides evidence of bidirectional nexus between tourism and economic growth in Saudi Arabia. This paper contributes to the current research by explaining the causal nexus among tourism and economic growth in Saudi Arabia during the period from 1990 to 2018, applying a vector autoregressive model and Granger Causality."

Tourism, in the last few decades, has become an indispensable source of income for developing countries, Turkey in particular, and this aspect of tourism has managed to catch the attention of a number of countries, principally developing ones. The tourism literature abounds a number of studies into tourism and economic growth nexus through a variety of methods such as Granger-causality, co-integration, regression analyses. However, there are hardly any studies incorporating input-output analysis. Within this context, this study sets out to examine the tourism and economic growth nexus by means of input-output analysis, covering forward and backward linkage effects, based on the 2002 input-output table, which is the latest one released by TURKSTAT. We estimate significance of the impact of tourism on economic growth. The variables used for economic growth are income and production outputs. The findings are discussed in terms of administrative points."

However, only few studies have analyzed the relationship between tourism growth and poverty alleviation. Therefore, this paper attempts to analyze the tourism-poverty nexus by using the data of 66 countries from 1995 to 2012. Tourism growth is used as an economic indicator to analyze the poverty-tourism nexus correlation. The estimated results suggest that 1) tourism has a significant effect on poverty reduction. 2) The poverty reduction effect of tourism decreases with an increase level of country’s tourism specialization. Thus, in order to achieve the goal of pro-poor tourism, tourism specialization level should be considered. Specifically, tourism sector should cooperate with other industries and develop appropriately."

For this purpose, we run the individual Granger and the panel data non-Granger causality tests for the period from 1995 to 2014. We find the causality from market diversification to economic growth in Egypt and Greece and observe the causality from economic growth to market diversification in France, Morocco, and Turkey. We also find bidirectional causality in Italy, Spain, and Tunisia. The economic benefits of tourism are frequently discussed in the literature. These benefits include creating new job opportunities, pioneering an increase in infrastructure investments, increasing foreign exchange earnings, providing higher tax revenue, and reducing poverty This chapter introduces the first index for the market diversification of tourist arrivals. Using this new index, it revisits the tourism-growth nexus for eight countries in the Mediterranean region: Egypt, France, Greece, Italy, Morocco, Spain, Tunisia, and Turkey.

A growth equation estimation using the bounds test shows that tourism contributes about 0.23% in the long run and 0.19% in the short run, and ICT contributions are 1.07% and 0.89%, respectively. The Granger causality test reveals a unidirectional causality going from capital stock to ICT, ICT to tourism and real per capita GDP to tourism. Hence, the study finds that ICT investment and tourism market development are crucial for Fiji's growth and development."
pub.1145834254,Disclosing the Unnoticed Power of Market Segments In the Tourism Growth Nexus Discussion,"The present study aims at investigating the tourism growth nexus by launching a new approach when conceptualizing tourism expansion. We add to the relevant discussion in two specific ways. First, we claim that tourism is a heterogeneous economic activity and launch the concept of market segments when searching for cointegrating and causality relationships at the interface of tourism and economy, an issue that goes unnoticed and an approach that is not tested so far. We define them in two different ways: business tourism spending and leisure tourism spending. In the analysis, we also take into consideration capital investment spending as well as internal consumption within the tourism industry. Second, we apply second-generation panel data analysis within the Eurozone economic space, which is insufficiently investigated within the concept of tourism growth nexus discussion. Research findings indicate that a unidirectional causality relationship running from business tourism spending to economic growth is present. Hence, if business tourism spending increases (decreases) then economic growth will increase (decrease) too. Additionally, changes to leisure tourism spending will cause changes to economic growth in the same direction and vice versa. Internal travel and tourism consumption as well as capital investment spending within the travel and tourism sector form a feedback hypothesis with economic growth meaning that they are mutually influenced when changes occur. Practical implications indicate that a friendly and attractive tourism ecosystem in terms of investments and innovations will enhance sustainable economic growth and tourism demand in the long run."

It is concluded that while there is bidirectional causal nexus between tourism development and economic growth for Portugal, unidirectional causal nexus from economic growth to tourism development is found for Spain, Italy, Tunisia, Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece. Therefore, the growth-led tourism hypothesis is supported in case of these seven countries. On the other hand, there is no causal relation for Malta and Egypt. The study finds evidence to support the tourism-led growth hypothesis for a group of panel in Mediterranean countries. The results of the overall study suggest that governments of Mediterranean countries should focus on economic policies to promote tourism as a potential source of economic growth."

Using dynamic regressions analysis over the period 1980–2018, namely, a Vector Error Correction Model which also accounts for endogeneity issues in tourism modelling, the results confirm that financial development is associated with tourism growth in the long run. The findings also show that economic growth, income of tourists as well as the availability of hotel rooms are important determinants of tourism. Moreover, it is observed that tourism development also leads to financial development thus confirming a bi-directional causality between these two variables. The bi-directional causality was also confirmed for the financial development–economic growth nexus as well as the tourism-growth nexus. Finally, evidence of the mediating role of economic development in the financial development–tourism development link is reported."

We examined the asymmetric relationship between tourism, economic growth, and CO2 emissions for the period 1991 to 2019. We applied NARDL technique, and Granger Causality to predict results. Moreover, we also employed ADF, PP unit root test, Zivot and Andrews test for structural breaks. The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag is the most appropriate econometric estimator in the case if asymmetric association exists among the variables. The NARDL technique is capable to discover the dynamic association between economic growth, tourism, and CO2 emissions. Our results confirmed the asymmetric nexus between tourism, GDP and CO2 emissions in the context of Pakistan. The results reported that in the short run as well as long run positive and negative shocks of tourism and GDP affect CO2 emissions. The outcomes also revealed unidirectional causality between tourism and CO2 emission, while bi-directional causality between economic growth and CO2 emissions. Likewise, a bi-directional causality has also been reported between tourism and economic growth. The results are very useful for the macro level policy makers in Pakistan, and hopefully will provide significant insight to the relevant stakeholders.Keywords: Tourism, CO2 Emissions, Economic growth, NARDL, PakistanJEL Classifications: L83, Q13, B41DOI: https://doi.org/10.32479/ijeep.10929"

Tourism development is proxied by tourist arrivals, while growth is measured by real GDP. Empirical results show evidence of long-run asymmetric bidirectional causality. Positive shocks in tourism development directly impact growth, while negative shocks in GDP have a negative causal effect on tourism. This latter finding, which supports the growth-led tourism hypothesis, suggests that in the long run, tourism tends to improve following periods of economic weakness, perhaps due to the dollar’s weakness at such times. However, we have evidence only of unidirectional causality running from GDP to tourism in the short run. An important implication of these findings is the need to promote inbound tourism, especially when weakness in the U.S. economy is accompanied by a decline in the value of the dollar."

Pakistan has massive potentials in the tourism sector. The present study analyzes the nexus between tourism and economic growth in Pakistan by using the Gregory Hansen co-integration and ARDL structural break econometrics approach on annual data from 1985 to 2020. The findings obtained through Gregory-Hansen's approach showed that structural break had appeared in the year 2009. For estimating the long-run coefficients structural break ARDL approach has been used. The study shows that tourism receipts significantly escalate economic growth. Furthermore, labor force participation and gross capital formation significantly and positively impacts the economic growth. The study recommends that Pakistan should pay proper attention to the tourism industry to promote allied sectors for achieving higher economic growth."
pub.1163353655,Expanding the tourism energy growth nexus: an empirical analysis within the Eurozone,"This study extends the energy tourism growth discussion by adopting the concept of market segments when investigating tourism proxies. We adopt econometric procedures to identify potential structural breaks and cross-sectional dependence together with appropriate panel data model specifications. Causality tests are also processed to search for the direction of potential linkages. The rationale behind such an approach is to integrate the energy growth nexus discussion with the tourism growth nexus into one specification and investigate holistically potential impacts and causalities under a new, unobserved in relative literature set of variables. Interestingly, we offer to the relevant literature in the following ways: first, the concept of market segments regarding business and leisure tourism spending as a proxy for tourism expansion is used. Second, we also encompass internal consumption, by international and domestic visitors, instead of international receipts when searching for causalities. Third, we consider capital investment spending within the travel and tourism sector. This issue is less visible, if not unnoticed, in relevant studies since the vast majority adopt the concept of foreign investment spending. Our empirical findings confirm the conservation hypothesis, while the feedback hypothesis is also present in our specifications. Practical implications demand effective management within the tourism system to foster pro-environmental behavior and achieve efficient energy use within the economic system."

It also employs the Granger causality test in the frequency domain that distinguishes between temporary and permanent causality for the country‐specific analysis. It shows a cointegration relationship between tourism, financial development and economic growth. It reveals a joint long‐run causality from tourism and financial development to economic growth, and a joint short‐run and long‐run causality from tourism and economic growth to financial development, albeit the joint causality from financial development and economic growth to tourism is tenuous. The individual causality shows a bidirectional causality between tourism and economic growth, between financial development and economic growth, and between tourism and financial development. The country‐specific analysis reveals that tourism is a significant predictor of financial development and economic growth at high frequency rather than at low frequency in most countries. Therefore, African countries should prioritize the policies and programs that can facilitate the development of the tourism and financial sectors in their quest to accelerate economic growth and development."

Secondly, to examine the direction of causality between tourism development and economic growth in Eastern Indonesia over the period 2010-2017. This study employed a panel vector error correction model (PVECM) for the quantitative analysis approach from panel data of 12 provinces in eastern Indonesia. The empirical findings of this study were: 1) In the long run, the relationship between tourism development and economic growth supported the feedback causality hypothesis where changes and expansion in the tourism development affect economic growth and increasing economic growth have an impact on the expansion of the tourism sector  (bi-directional causality). 2) The empirical findings corroborated the growth-led tourism hypothesis in the short run which argues that the achievements of economic growth affect the expansion of tourism development. In the short run, this empirical study only found a one-way causality running from economic growth to tourism development."

A possible transmission channel from the crisis to the economy of Lebanon is tourism. This article investigates the tourism–growth nexus in Lebanon controlling for the instability caused by the Syrian crisis. We use a vector autoregression model with five monthly macroeconomic variables: a novel index for income, number of tourist arrivals, number of Syrian refugees, and casualties in both Lebanon and Syria during the conflict. The results show that the Lebanese economy was resilient to the political instability engendered by the Syrian crisis. The findings support both the tourism-led growth hypothesis and the ancillary growth-led tourism hypothesis. The article concludes that the tourism sector in Lebanon is robust to the political instability engendered by the Syrian crisis."

Design/methodology/approach The authors used the newly introduced econometric technique panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model with two regimes on annual panel data from 1995 to 2018.   Findings Results confirmed that the nexus between the tourism development and housing prices is nonlinear and regime dependent. Moreover, the results showed that the threshold level of economic growth above which tourism development increases the housing prices is 2.63%. The relationship above the threshold value is positive and growth enhancing, while below the threshold, tourism development has a negative effect on housing prices. The economic growth and housing prices also showed the U-shape relationship implying that at a certain level increase in economic growth decreases the housing prices but after a certain level increase in economic growth increases the housing prices.   Originality/value This paper makes a unique contribution to the literature with reference to developed economies, being a pioneering attempt to investigate the nonlinear relationship between tourism development and housing prices and applying more rigorous and advanced econometric techniques like PSTR.

In Sri Lankan experience it was not statistically confirmed. The aim of this study was to test the nexus between the tourism earnings and the gross domestic product in Sri Lanka. To test this nexus this study used time series data during the period of 1970 to 2014, and employed the multiple regressions model. In this study, the gross domestic product in constant price was used as dependant variable and exchange rate, foreign remittance, tourism earning, and inflation rate were considered as independent variables. Based on the regression outcomes, this study found that the tourism positively maintained the nexus on the gross domestic product in Sri Lanka at five percent significant level."

This was inspired by the highly claimed potential of tourism on GDP, against a background where literature cautions that causal linkage relationships are not always direct and obvious, but rather country specific and most likely to change over time. Co-integration and Granger causality were used to assess the causal nexus between the variables. The findings supported a unidirectional causal relationship between GDP and tourism (GDP → TOR) as well as a long-run co-integration between tourism and economic growth. The study findings imply that the country’s rich natural resources may be insufficient to propel tourism growth and drive GDP in the absence of a supportive economic environment. Therefore, the study suggests that efforts to support policy and investments should concentrate more on overall economic development than at tourism per se. This would create an environment conducive for attracting and retaining visitors to the country, and thus boost tourism."
pub.1117969233,Tourism and energy nexus in selected South Asian countries: a panel study,"The main aim of this paper is to analyse the tourism-energy nexus for the selected South Asian countries by incorporating panel data set between 1995–2015. All the concerned variables are integrated at the first-differenced form and cointegrated in the long run. Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel non-granger causality test reveals a unidirectional causality from tourism to energy consumption in the long run, which further has a unidirectional causation effect on economic growth. Our results are expected to guide the policymakers to design appropriate policies for tourism and energy industries to promote sustainable growth in the South Asian countries."
pub.1105726441,The Role of Financial Sector Development in the Tourism- Growth Nexus: A Case of Southern African Countries,"The study explored the impact of financial development on the tourism -growth nexus in Southern African (SADC) countries using the three panel data analysis approaches (pooled OLS, fixed and random effects). Specifically, the study investigated whether financial development is a channel through tourism influences economic growth in SADC countries or if the complementarity between financial development and tourism has a significant positive impact on economic growth in the SADC region? Theoretical and empirical literature review shows that the positive separate impact of tourism and financial development on economic growth is no longer a disputed matter. What has so far not been conclusively studied is whether financial management is a channel through which tourism influences economic growth. It is against this backdrop that the author undertook the current study in order to make a contribution to literature. The study found out that tourism had a significant negative influence on economic growth whereas financial development positively and significantly affected economic growth in the SADC region. The complementarity between tourism and financial development had a positive (fixed effects) and significant positive influence (pooled OLS and random effects) on economic growth in SADC countries, in line with theoretical predictions. SADC countries are therefore urged to improve their financial sector development levels in order to enhance the impact of tourism on economic growth. "

The Toda– Yamamoto long-run causality tests reveal positive unidirectional causality from real GDP to international tourism revenues, as well as positive unidirectional causality from real GDP to the real effective exchange rate. Thus, the results lend support for the economic-driven tourism growth hypothesis."
pub.1053937000,The Threshold Effects of the Tourism-Led Growth Hypothesis: Evidence from a Cross-sectional Model,"This study applies a threshold regression model and considers three tourism specialization indices as the threshold variables in order to explore the nonlinear relation among tourism growth, economic growth, and other macroeconomic variables for a cross-sectional data set of 84 countries. Our empirical results show strong evidence of a nonlinear relation between tourism growth and economic growth, suggesting that it is not continuous and constant. The results do not support the view that one size fits all, and therefore countries with different conditions of tourism development experience various impacts on the tourism–growth nexus."
pub.1093026231,Is the tourism–economic growth nexus time-varying? Bootstrap rolling-window causality analysis for the top 10 tourist destinations,"This article explores the time-varying causal nexus between tourism development and economic growth for the top 10 tourist destinations in the world, namely China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Spain, Turkey, the UK and the United States of America, over the period 1990–2015. To that end, a bootstrap rolling window Granger causality approach based on the modified Granger causality test is used. A new index for tourism activity which combines via principal component analysis the commonly used tourism indicators is also employed. The results of the bootstrap rolling window causality tests reveal that the causal relations between tourism and economic growth vary substantially over time and across countries in terms of both magnitude and direction. It is shown that the causal linkages tend to be more pronounced for a large group of countries following the global financial crisis of 2008. Additionally, Germany, France and China clearly stand out as the countries with the weakest causal nexus, while the UK, Italy and Mexico emerge as the countries that have the strongest causal links. These results have particularly important implications for policymakers."
pub.1157390562,The moderating role of digitalisation in the tourism-growth nexus: evidence from small island economies,"An overwhelming amount of studies has investigated tourism as a driver of growth and there is a wide consensus on a positive relationship (tourism-led growth hypothesis). However, recent studies have also pointed out that the tourism-growth nexus may be conditional on certain elements like development level and infrastructure, education and human capital among others. Another factor which is believed to moderate the tourism-growth link is the level of digitalisation of the destination country and this research claims that countries with higher levels of digitalisation could benefit from increased tourism economic benefits. This study analyses the moderating role of such digitalisation in the tourism-growth link. The research uses annual panel data of 28 small island economies from 1990 to 2019 and applies panel autoregressive distributed lag (PARDL) methodology to analyse the long-run and short-run relationship among the variables. Results confirm the Tourism-led growth hypothesis in both the long run and short run, but more importantly point out that this relationship is moderated or is conditional by the level of digitalisation. In fact, the economic benefit of tourism is found to be higher with increased digitalisation level. Panel Granger Causality tests confirm the causal effect of digitalisation on tourism development as well as a bi-directional causality between tourism development and economic growth. The implications are clear that government and tourism businesses should accelerate the digitalisation process and concentrate on the concept of e-tourism to maximise its return."

pub.1157632956,Tourism Growth and Financial Sector Development Nexus: Evidence from Selected African Economies,"This article tests the tourism growth and financial sector development nexus. Data came from the World Bank and IMF for the years 1995-2020 from 43 selected African economies. We applied System GMM and dynamic CCEMG to estimate short–run effects and JKS Granger non-causality test for causality, FMOLS and FGLS to estimate long–run effects and sets of co-integration tests for co-movements. The findings support mutual reinforcing effects for both inbound tourism growth and financial sector development. Outbound tourism should be monitored and controlled for its negative effects; inbound tourism should be facilitated and promoted for its positive effects. Political stability and trade openness policies should be a priority for both sectors, while foreign direct investments should be monitored and controlled for their ambiguous impacts. In this work, we are able to show that increases in international tourism activities and developments in the financial sector mutually impact each other."

South Europe’s regions during the time period 2000–2014 have been the case study of this work. The Generalized method of moments (GMM) approach used in this study enables testing the existence of determinants of regional economic status, while accounting for factors such as spatial interdependence. The empirical results reveal the existence of the significant conditional convergence hypothesis that is associated with the endogenous growth theory. Also, findings show that tourism and human capital supply seem to positively influence regional income."

The initial results show that the causality runs from tourism to economic growth. Furthermore, the estimated growth regression clearly indicates that the international tourism has a significantly positive impact on the economic growth of Pakistan along with other variables like physical capital and international trade. This implies that the improvement in the tourism sector may enhance the economic growth activities in Pakistan."
pub.1008782276,Exploring the Nexus Between Tourism and Output in Cook Islands: An ARDL Bounds Approach,"Tourism plays an important role in the development of Cook Islands. In this paper we examine the nexus between tourism and growth using quarterly data over the period 2009Q1–2014Q2 using the recently upgraded ARDL bounds test to cointegration tool, Microfit 5.01, which provides sample adjusted bounds and hence is more reliable for small sample size studies. We perform the cointegration using the ARDL bounds test and examine the direction of causality. Using visitor arrival and output in per capita terms as respective proxy for tourism development and growth, we examine the long-run association and report the elasticity coefficient of tourism and causality nexus, accordingly. Using unit root break tests, we note that 2011Q1 and 2011Q2 are two structural break periods in the output series. However, we note that this period is not statistically significant in the ARDL model and hence excluded from the estimation. Subsequently, the regression results show the two series are cointegrated. The long-run elasticity coefficient of tourism is estimated to be 0.83 and the short-run is 0.73. A bidirectional causality between tourism and income is noted for Cook Islands which indicates that tourism development and income mutually reinforce each other. In light of this, socio-economic policies need to focus on broad-based, inclusive and income-generating tourism development projects which are expected to have feedback effect."

Evidence from wavelet analysis,"In this article, we attempt to examine the nexus of trade, economic growth, and international tourism. We resort to wavelet-based analysis to capture the time–frequency-based lead–lag dynamics of this nexus. Considering the monthly data spanning from January 1999 to February 2018 for the United States, we find the evidence that (a) increasing trade leads to higher tourist inflows (in terms of receipts), (b) tourist receipts are lagged by economic growth, and (c) these relationships are significant in the long term. We believe that these results are crucial for policymakers to frame policies regarding tourism in the United States."

The results suggest that institutional quality increases environmental performance but tourism development and output growth reduce environmental performance. While output growth and institutional quality stimulate tourism development, environmental performance index impedes tourism development. Furthermore, tourism development and institutional quality stimulate output growth but environmental performance condenses output growth. The implication for these findings is that policymakers need to pay more attention to institutional quality improvement to mitigate environmental damage caused by tourism development."

The research applied the upset U-molded EKC and the ARDL -models to calculate the time series stationarity variables. The results showed that in the initial enlargement phases, a sophisticated GDP adversely impacts CO2 emissions, then a higher GDP positively influences CO2 emissions. The development of tourism, use of fossil fuels (coal and oil), and population growth show an important influence on CO2 emissions but the use of gas and electricity has little effect on CO2 emissions. In contrast, foreign direct investment besides population development had little effect on increasing CO2 emissions. Retreating foreign direct investment, strengthening the use of sustainable electricity, and improving transportation for explorers, especially the green tourism business, are excellent ways to reduce environmental degradation in China."

Furthermore, we uncover a non-monotonic “M-shaped” curve between human capital and growth when we impose the assumption of imperfect labor substitutability."
pub.1133580990,Chapter 10 The Johansen cointegration method and several others during the evolution of the energy-growth nexus and the broader “X-variable”-growth nexus,"Numerous studies in the energy-growth nexus and other “X-variable” nexus studies such as the tourism-growth nexus, the Environment-growth nexus, or the food-growth nexus have used various approaches to test cointegration. While the ARDL remains the flagship of cointegration methods, other methods had evolved before the ARDL method and some after it, and they too grasp different aspects of cointegration. This chapter presents the essentials of the Johansen-Juselius method of cointegration together with other methods and variants. The chapter does not only aim to show the evolution of these methods in time, but most importantly, it equips new researchers with the whole array of methods, because older methods have not been abandoned from researchers and they are still in use alone or together with other methods in the same piece of research, for reasons of corroboration."
pub.1017098340,Tourism and economic growth nexus revisited: A panel causality analysis for the case of the Mediterranean Region,"Tourism is perceived as an important source of foreign exchange that is used for financing economic growth. This study offers a modern approach to tourism-led growth and investigates the causal relationship between tourism and economic growth in the European, Asian and African countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. The study uses panel data for the period 1998–2011, and adopts a panel Granger causality analysis developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) to assess the contribution tourism makes to economic growth in each country. The results indicate that the direction of causality between tourism and economic growth depends on the country group and tourism indicator. Furthermore, the European countries are better able to generate growth from tourism in the Mediterranean region."
pub.1019800994,Nexus between tourism earnings and economic growth: a study of Malaysia,"Prior studies on Malaysia mainly looked at the cointegration relationship and causality nexus of the tourism sector. In addition to these apects, in this article, we look at the statistical and economic significance of tourism in Malaysia. We explore the short-run and long-run effects of tourism on output per worker in Malaysia using the sample period 1975–2012 where we estimate the respective elasticity coefficients. Given that the data on tourism receipts reported by the World Bank (2013) are only for 1995–2011 at the time of study, we use an exponential trend function based on the available data for tourism receipts as best fit to approximate the missing data. Subsequently, using the data from 1975–2012 and the augmented Solow (1956) model in which tourism receipts (% GDP) is included as a shift variable and hence a proxy for tourism development, we examine the cointegration, elasticity coefficients and causation using the ARDL bounds (Pesaran et al. 2001) and the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) non Granger causality procedure, respectively. The results show that tourism has a lagged marginal negative effect (-$$-$$0.06 %) in the short run and a positive and statistically significant effect in the long-run (+0.26 %). The causality nexus show a bi-directional causation between tourism and capital per worker which supports the notion that tourism and investment activities are mutually reinforcing; and a unidirectional causation from output per worker to capital per worker indicating that economic growth spurs capital accumulation and productivity. Although our findings are not unique due to data constraints, the results nevertheless reveal that tourism has a long-run momentous effect on the economic growth of Malaysia and is a catalyst for boosting investment activities. In this regard, policy focus can be directed towards enhancing tourism infrastructure including technology integration and management, creating more visitor confidence in the global tourism markets, exploiting the major sources of tourism markets with socially desirable and economically beneficial tourist products, and exploring niche markets for tourism expansion which can include links with foreign direct investment."
pub.1047182638,Does tourism expansion effectively spur economic growth in Morocco and Tunisia? Evidence from time series and panel data,"A considerable amount of literature has been published on the relationship between tourism and economic growth. Nevertheless, there is a lack of empirical works for the Middle East and North Africa countries, especially for Morocco and Tunisia. Therefore, assessing the tourism-growth nexus in Morocco and Tunisia is essential. This study uses the Feder's theoretical growth model to explain the relationship between tourism and economic growth in these two countries. Cointegration and Granger causality tests are the main econometric approaches used in this study. Overall, we find that economic growth, tourism and capital are cointegrated in both countries. Furthermore, the results show that tourism Granger-causes economic growth, thus supporting the tourism-led growth hypothesis in Morocco and Tunisia. Therefore, economic growth of these countries can be sustained through the expansion of their tourism sectors."

The dependent variables in four systems of equations are income, CO2 emission, energy use, and tourism development index. Empirics from difference and system GMM diagnosed the feedback effect between energy use and income; also validated energy push CO2 emission in conjunction with EKC for BRI countries. The results supported bidirectional causality between tourism and income; moreover, tourism push emission hypothesis validated for BRI countries. On the other hand, natural resources are contributing to tourism development, energy use, and CO2 emission in BRI countries. Additionally, natural resources are contributing negatively and significantly to income, thus obeying the natural resource curse phenomenon. So, the allocation of funds on green infrastructure are required to improve the environmental quality and benefit through green tourism. Moreover, the implementation of conservation policies on “natural resources” can help the GDP growth, environmental quality, and tourism sector on a single platform."

   the threshold variable for 95% confidence interval. The marginal effects in
   the low inflation regime are higher compared to marginal effects in the high
   inflation regime. The study results support tourism-led growth hypothesis,
   indicating tourism as a one of the main drivers of regional growth. This
   research contributes to rare literature in application of dynamic panel
   threshold model in tourism. As an implication, this study can be used as a
   methodological approach to analyze the impact of different variables (not

Therefore, the ongoing study aims to examine the role of tourism IT adoption, TR management orientation, and tourism agility on the sustainable tourism supply chain performance (STSCP) of Maldives’ tourism industry. The investigation of mediating role of tourism supply chain resilience among the nexus of tourism IT adoption, TR management orientation, tourism agility, and sustainable tourism supply chain performance of Maldives’ tourism industry are also included in the goal of the ongoing study. The data were obtained using questionnaires from the tourism industry employees related to the supply chain process, and AMOS has been utilized for analysis purposes. The results indicated that tourism IT adoption, TR management orientation, and tourism agility positively associate with the sustainable tourism supply chain performance of the Maldives’ tourism industry. The findings also exposed that tourism supply chain resilience has played a positive mediating role among the nexus of tourism IT adoption, TR management orientation, tourism agility, and STSCP of the Maldives’ tourism industry. These findings are guided to the policy developers and implementers that they should increase their focus on the tourism industry that could enhance the country's economic growth."

Such activity highlights a nexus between tourism, social entrepreneurship and community development. This nexus has been investigated somewhat in tourism literature, but lacks empirical backing, as well as theoretical refinement. We argue that a collective perspective on social entrepreneurship in the tourism context is needed, and introduce a concept and framework for ‘Collective Tourism Social Entrepreneurship’ (CTSE). We investigate how CTSE principles are utilized by local communities to combat depopulation and deterioration in two Danish destinations, and find that the CTSE process can create (social) value even if the expected result is never reached."

For this purpose, it is adopted PM2.5 exposure as a proxy of environmental performance indicator. Economic growth, energy consumption, industrial value-added and urbanization are included in model as other explanatory variables. It is applied panel vector autoregression methodology for analyze the relationship. Main result suggests that tourism development causes deterioration in air quality. Furthermore, the U-shaped relationship between growth and pollution is confirmed for the PM2.5, and as urbanization increases, air quality deteriorates. In addition to these, the existence of a bidirectional causality relationship between tourism development and PM2.5 exposure is revealed. The analysis results imply that the nexus among tourism and environment in the Mediterranean countries is also confirmed by a specific environmental performance indicator PM2.5 exposure."

An investigation of the role of tourism-based economic expansion in the nexus of leisure tourism and business tourism," Purpose The gradual expansion of the tourism sector is raising concerns about whether tourism-based economies are conducive to supporting green growth. Hence, the current study aims to analyze the direct impact of tourism motives on green growth along with the indirect impact of tourism-based economic expansion while controlling for country risk and renewable energy.   Design/methodology/approach An unbalanced panel data for a sample of 21 countries comprising OECD and non-OECD economies are employed for the analysis.   Findings  Regression results reveal that leisure tourism (LT) significantly and positively influences CO 2 intensity compared to business tourism (BT). Propensity score matching results show that the most traveled tourist destinations contribute more to CO 2 intensity than those less traveled. Mediation analysis by employing Baron and Kenny’s three-step regression, Sobel’s test and Monte Carlo test shows that tourism-based economic expansion significantly mediates between the nexus of LT and CO 2 intensity.    Practical implications Results of the study provide useful practical implications for sustainable economy and green growth. It recommends to mitigate the challenges of LT, reducing the negative impact and to harness the potential of BT, enhancing the positive influence, through various policies and practices.   Originality/value This study is the first to examine the impact of LT and BT on green growth, to explore the role of destination popularity and the mediating role of tourism-based economic expansion in this relationship.

This paper uses time series data from 1995 to 2016. Advance technique of time series analysis: Johansen Cointegration Approach is used to test the Cointegration among variables. Moreover, the Vector Error Correction (VECM) has been applied to study the long run and short run association among variables. The outcome of this study reveals that the tourism revenue and financial development has positive impact on economic growth in the long run. Variance decomposition and impulse response function also supports the positive association. According to the estimation of Granger Causality also reveals the unilateral direction in short run economic growth to tourism revenue. Providing more credit by financial sector to invest more on infrastructure and promoting Bangladesh as well as insuring proper security for foreign visitors would increase the revenue of this sector, which in turn stimulates economic growth of the country."

We intend to know what policy instruments need to be manipulated so as to achieve economic growth, increase agricultural output and enhance tourism development. From the results, it is evidence that a two –way cointegration exists between economic growth and agricultural output on the one hand, and between economic growth and tourism development on the other hand. The study also observed that a compelling long run relationship exist between agricultural output and tourism development. To achieve sustainable economic growth, policy makers are advised to pursue heavy investment in the tourism industry, adopts improved farming strategies driven by simple technology among others."

Nevertheless, challenges in expansion of renewable energy consumption have resulted in pollutant emissions continuing to be a noteworthy environmental concern in India. This paper investigates the relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and international tourist arrivals in India during 1991-2018, using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag and Vector Error Correction Model frameworks. This study extends the Indian literature on economic growth, energy consumption, and pollutant emissions nexus by including tourism, an energy-intensive industry in the model specification. Results reveal that energy consumption and tourism positively contribute to CO2 emissions. A long-run unidirectional causality running from energy consumption, GDP, GDP2, and tourist arrivals towards CO2 emissions is observed. Our results suggest that sustainable tourism, energy consumption, and economic growth should be at the forefront of the economic development agenda of India."
pub.1169264261,Is tourism expansion the key to economic growth in India? An aggregate-level time series analysis,"The paper aims to probe the tourism-economic growth nexus in the case of India. The paper incorporates a more structural view of sector-specific macroeconomic variables like central government expenditure on tourism (CGET), investment in the tourism industry (IOT), foreign tourist arrivals, and foreign tourist visits as explanatory parameters. Johansen's cointegration and error correction model results support the long-run relationship among the variables. All the independent variables are unidirectional causal on GDP except investment in tourism, which shows long-run bidirectional causality. Thus, the long-run unidirectional tourism-led growth hypothesis is supported. The empirical implications support government and private sector-based resource allocation towards tourism expansion, thereby escalating the country's economic growth."

In the previous chapter, we laid down the theoretical foundations of the connection through the poverty obliteration paradigm. We hypothesize that tourism growth has a double barrel effect on poverty: directly and indirectly through economic growth. We also investigate the conditions that may attenuate the power of tourism in poverty alleviation. We illustrate this hypothesis through six cases. Five of the eight countries are from Central America. They are Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The other case is from Ecuador, located in South America.1"
pub.1167348966,An empiric on geopolitical risk and the tourism–economic growth nexus," Purpose This study empirically examines the moderating role of geopolitical risk on the tourism–economic growth nexus by applying a recent geopolitical risk indicator developed by Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) in a cross-country panel data growth model context for a sample of 24 countries.   Design/methodology/approach A Dummy Variable Least Squares panel data model, nonparametric covariance matrix estimator and SYS-GMM estimation techniques are employed for the analysis. The authors capture the GPR moderating effect by disaggregating the cross-country sample according to low versus high country GPR score and through a GPR interaction coefficient. Several controls are included in the models such as gross fixed capital formation and—consistent with Barro (1990)—government consumption. Trade openness is used to account for the export-led growth effect. In line with neoclassical growth theory (e.g. Barro, 1991), the authors also include the real interest rate, to account for policy makers' commitment to macroeconomic stability, financial depth, as a proxy for financial development, population growth and the level of secondary school education. The authors also control for unobserved country-specific and time-invariant effects.   Findings The research finds that the interaction term of geopolitical risk significantly contributes to the predictive ability of the regression and provides empirical evidence that confirms that only in low geopolitical risk countries international tourism positively and significantly contributes to economic growth. Important theoretical and policy implications flow from these findings.   Originality/value The study not only contributes to advancing academic knowledge on the tourism–growth nexus, it also has impact beyond academia. Many countries have in the past pursued and many continue to pursue, tourism specialization and/or tourism-led growth strategies based on the theoretically well-established and empirically validated positive link between inbound tourism and economic growth. The findings alert policy makers in such countries to the significant moderating role that geopolitical risk plays in affecting the above-mentioned relationship and to the importance of prioritizing geopolitical stability as a policy precursor for the successful implementation of such strategies.

pub.1145548225,Tourism–Growth Nexus in the Presence of Instability,"This paper contributes to the tourism–growth literature by applying the new vector autoregressive-based Granger causality test in the presence of instability to reassess the Granger causality between Hong Kong’s tourism and economic growth. The results of the traditional and recursive Granger causality test under the VAR framework show that the tourism-led economic growth hypothesis (TLEGH) and the economy-driven tourism growth hypothesis (EDTGH) are both unstable in Hong Kong. The results of the vector autoregressive-based Granger causality test in the presence of instability generally support bidirectional causality between tourism and economic growth. However, the relationship between tourism and economic growth is vulnerable to sudden major political incidents, public health incidents, and financial crises. Among these incidents and crises, political events have long-term effects on the relationship between Hong Kong’s tourism and economic growth. In contrast, economic policies, financial crises, and public health emergencies have short-term impacts on the relationship."
pub.1144486974,Impact of Tourism on Economic Growth of Nepal: Is Tourism-Led Growth Hypothesis Valid for Nepal?,"A voluminous study is available on tourism-growth nexus as tourism industry received considerable attention as a potential source of economic growth. This paper empirically examines the impact of tourism on economic growth of Nepal by using time series data of 1976-2020 and applying autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. Real GDP was used as proxy measure of economic growth, which was the outcome variable whereas the variable of interest was tourism receipts. Foreign aid, total volume of trade and ratio of government consumption expenditure to GDP were taken as control variables. The result of ARDL model shows that tourism has no significant impact on economic growth of Nepal in both short-run and long-run. However, total volume of trade has positive and significant effect on economic growth in short-run whereas foreign aid, total volume of trade and ratio of government consumption expenditure to GDP have positive and significant effect on economic growth in the long-run. In such context of tourism and growth relationship, tourism-led growth hypothesis is rejected for Nepal."
pub.1137469426,Tourism development and its impact on economic growth in Pakistan.,"Abstract <p>This chapter discusses in the first instance the development of tourism in Pakistan, delving into the government's support of it and its potential as well as the challenges of the industry. The chapter subsequently investigates the impact of tourism development on economic growth in Pakistan over the period 1980 to 2018 using a dynamic time-series analysis, namely a vector autoregressive framework, which allows for the possibility of endogeneity and causality issues. The results proved the existence of the tourism-led growth hypothesis and that tourism development has contributed to economic growth in the long run; perhaps not as much as it could have given the potential of this sector. A bidirectional causality is also reported between tourism development and economic growth, confirming the self-reinforcing nature of the tourism-growth nexus.</p>"
pub.1150566714,"Time-Frequency Nexus between Tourism Development, Economic Growth, Energy Consumption, and Ecological Footprint in Singapore","Singapore has been listed as one of the top-visited countries and has the highest ecological deficit. Despite the abundance of previous studies, the distinction between short, medium, and long term by decomposing tourism development, economic growth, energy consumption, and ecological footprint has been largely ignored. This study aims to investigate the lead-lag nexus structures between ecological footprint and Singapore's economic activities from 1978 to 2016. By adopting the wavelet analysis and scale-by-scale Granger causality test, the outcomes show that energy consumption positively impacts ecological footprint at high frequencies, while tourism and economic growth positively drive ecological footprint at high and medium frequencies. We also find that the positive impact of macroeconomic variables on ecological footprint has not been evident since 2003. Additionally, the wavelet-based Granger test confirms a bi-directional causal between economic growth and ecological footprint at all frequencies, whilst there is a bi-directional relationship between tourism, energy consumption, and ecological footprint at high frequency. Based on these findings, the research may further strengthen the belief of Singapore’s policy-makers on the promotion of tourism and suggests some helpful lessons for emerging countries."

Considering the endogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and slope homogeneity, this study employed dynamic GMM and D&K estimators for three distinct structural equations. For the CO2 equation, the empirical outcomes supported the EKC, energy lead emission, natural resource-based CO2 emissions, and tourism-led CO2 emissions, and on the other hand, renewable energy helps to curb environmental degradation. For the GDP equation, the role of energy, CO2 emissions, tourism development, and renewable energy is positive and contributes significantly to economic growth. The impact of natural resources is negative and significant, thus postulating the “resource curse phenomenon” in BRI countries. For the energy equation, CO2, GDP, and natural resources are escalating energy consumption; while, renewable energy is negatively affecting energy, which indicates that growth in renewable energy tends to discourage the consumption of fossil fuel-based energy in the BRI countries."
pub.1129262705,A new look at the tourism development and economic growth nexus: International evidence,"This article tests the relationship between tourism development and economic growth in major tourism destinations in the world. The study relies on the quantile autoregressive distributed lag model. The main findings show a nonlinear cointegrating relationship between tourism development and economic growth in France, Mexico, Spain, and Italy. Indeed, in these countries, the long-run cointegrating parameter and speed of adjustment parameter differ across quantiles of economic growth distribution. They also show a nonlinear contemporaneous and lagged influence of tourism development on economic growth except in China and Germany. These differences between countries may be attributed to differences in the relative weight of the tourism industry in the overall economy of each country, whereas the differences across quantiles may be explained by the negative externalities caused by tourism growth. These findings have important policy and decision implications because tourism has differing impacts on economic growth in the short and long run in major tourism destinations. Thus, they may have new and helpful insights in planning for tourism development policies that facilitate the stimulation of economic growth."

The citation analysis reveals that Tourism Management is the leading journal with a total of 2527 citation counts, whereas Tourism Economics is the leading journal with a total of 41 publications on this topic. Juan Gabriel Brida is the most prolific author, whereas Lee and Chang (2008) is recognized as the most influential paper. The content analysis reveals that 58% have applied time series, and 38% have used panel data analysis. Tourism causing growth is the leading result of both time‐series and panel studies. International tourism receipts/earnings/expenditure and the number of international tourist arrivals are the most widely used variables to measure tourism. "
pub.1164892703,Nexus between Tourism Industry and Economic Growth of Nepal,"The tourism sector is essential to economic growth and has the capacity to stimulate the economy. The aim of this paper to assess the relationship between tourism industry and its economic growth. The gross domestic product (GDP) indicates the economic growth and tourism industry development relates to tourist arrivals, length of stay, and gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism. This study is grounded on secondary data collected from the Economic Survey of Nepal and the Nepal Tourism Statistics from 2000 to 2021. The study finds short and long-term causality between tourism industry and economic growth. The tourism development indicators include arrivals of tourist, length of stay, and gross foreign exchange from tourism. The unidirectional causality of economic growth to the length of stay of tourists and tourism to gross foreign exchange earnings were observed in the study. Adequate government strategies for the tourism sector can accelerate economic growth. The policymakers should give adequate attention to diversifying the tourism services, improving infrastructure, encouraging local communities, promoting sustainable tourism, enhancing marketing efforts, and promoting collaborations between the public, commercial sectors and local communities to support tourism industry for the sustained in Nepal."

To this end, we consider three tourism markets––China, Japan and the US––and apply quantile-on-quantile regression. Our results indicate that (i) high quantiles of the Chinese tourist market have the most growth effects, while moderate quantiles of Japan and the US markets accelerate economic growth in Taiwan; (ii) recessions in these three markets during the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the economic growth of Taiwan and (iii) development of these three tourism markets acts as an engine of economic growth during downturn periods."
pub.1139768774,Do countries’ geographical locations moderate the tourism-led economic growth nexus in sub-Saharan Africa?,"Debates on the intricacies of tourism’s potential contribution to economic growth remain imperative and unsettled in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Employing dynamic models and multiple robust estimation techniques, this article empirically tests the tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH) in the case of SSA. Further investigations on how countries’ geographical locations influence the TLGH are conducted. With panel data – spanning from the year 2000 through 2016 – on 40 SSA countries, which were regrouped into coastal, landlocked and islands, the study establishes evidence in support of the TLGH for the full sample. After geographical classifications, tourism’s impact on economic growth is, however, observed to be significantly positive for only landlocked and coastal countries. Surprisingly, the impact of tourism on economic growth is significantly negative for islands within the subregion. The findings hold policy implications for the pursuit of tourism-led growth in the SSA region."
pub.1137895586,Tourism-led and economic-driven nexus in Mauritius: Spillovers and inclusive development policies in the case of an African nation,"This study investigates the dynamic linkages between tourism growth and economic growth in the African island nation of Mauritius using the spillover index framework based on the monthly data from 2003M11–2020M02. The Granger causality results reflect bidirectional static linkages between tourism-led economic growth (TLEG) and economic-driven tourism growth (EDTG). The dynamic spillover findings show a varying magnitude and direction of TLEG and EDTG hypotheses that are time-dependent. These relationships indicate distinct outcomes where tourism growth or economic growth is the net transmitter or recipient of shocks. The level of spillovers is influenced by economic events, climatic disasters and the coronavirus-19 pandemic crisis. Some inclusive and sustainable development policy implications are drawn for Mauritius and other tourism-dependent African countries."
pub.1155622234,Tourism and FDI-Growth Nexus in Upper-Middle Income Countries,"This paper examines the role of tourism in foreign direct investment-growth relation in upper-middle income countries. We deploy static and dynamic panel analysis to evaluate how tourism indicators influence the impact of FDI net inflows on growth using an unbalanced panel data on 29 upper middle-income countries from 2010-2019. The tourism indicators are receipts, arrivals and expenditures. The results from static and dynamic analyses indicate that for the most part (1) FDI and tourism exert asymmetric effects on growth, (2) tourism indicators reduce the negative effect of FDI on growth, (4) trade openness is a positive and significant predictor of growth, and (5) domestic credit negatively contributes to growth. Deductively, results evidence that tourism indicators are critical drivers of economic growth in upper middle-income countries. Overall, tourism receipts show the largest influence on FDI to spur the most appreciable impact on growth. Despite this, the fact that tourism indicators cannot completely eliminate the destructive impact of FDI on economic growth shows that tourism development policies should be based on a greener and sustainable ground, taking into account the effects of the coronavirus."
pub.1174608336,"From pollution to preservation: a dynamic examination of tourism, globalization, and environmental resilience in top-tier economies","Tourism is an important growth driver for global economies in today's globalization era. The increase in tourism activities has caused policymakers to worry about carbon emissions from related tourist transportation movements and how it might affect environmental quality. Several scholars have investigated the nexus of tourism-related CO2 pollution to solve this puzzle; however, the issue persists. In this vein, this study contributes to evaluating the nexus among tourism, globalization, and environmental quality in the top ten most polluted economies from 1995–2020. We employ the dynamic common correlated effect (DCCE) methodology. Additionally, the DCCE technique estimates econometrics tools to resolve the concerns of cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity. Study results demonstrate that tourism has positive environmental effects over the long term. Globalization, gross capital formation, and economic growth all positively affect CO2 emissions. Interestingly, interaction terms results show the real effect of all variables on the environment. The government of the top ten most polluted countries can play an important role in ensuring sustainability by encouraging sustainable tourism, environmental-friendly globalization, and favorable gross capital formation for the environment and economic growth.Graphical abstractThe long-run findings"
pub.1169518732,"The dynamic nexus among carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption, and tourism development in Sri Lanka","The study examines the dynamic nexus among carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption, and tourism development in Sri Lanka. The tourism sector is one of the fastest-growing industries throughout the globe. This sector significantly contributes to the national development of a country in various ways, not only in developed countries but also in developing countries. However, activities related to the tourism sector contribute to environmental damage, such as transportation, establishing tourism destinations, discouraging wages, high presume on endangered species, and developing foreseeing fire, etc. Scholars for various studies have found conflicting results about the relationship between growing tourism and environmental degradation. Therefore, based on the ARDL cointegration analysis for the period 1990-2019 in Sri Lanka, this paper examines whether the tourism development has contributed to environmental damage, energy consumption, and economic growth. Statistical analysis of the data demonstrates that CO2 emissions in Sri Lanka are negatively correlated with tourist arrival (TR) but positively correlated with tourism receipt (TR) and energy consumption (EC) in the long term. Further, the findings highlight that there is no significant relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in Sri Lanka. The findings of this research ensure that the tourism industry can adjust to shifting energy conditions and economic dynamics by pointing policymakers in the direction of workable strategies that strike a balance between energy efficiency, economic growth, and sustainable tourism development."
pub.1003840912,Assessing the dynamic economic impact of tourism for island economies,"Using a panel data of 19 island economies for the years that span from 1990 to 2007, this study explores the potential contribution of tourism to economic growth and development within the conventional augmented Solow growth model. Since economic growth is argued to be essentially a dynamic phenomenon we employ GMM method to account for these issues. The results show that tourism significantly contributes to the economic growth of island economies. Moreover, the tourist-growth nexus is observed to be a dynamic phenomenon and granger causality analysis reveals a bi-causal relationship between tourist and growth. Comparative analysis with samples of developing and developed countries shows that tourism development on island economies may have comparatively higher growth effects."
pub.1171843244,The Regulation and Inequality Nexus in Microfinance and Tourism Sectors,"This paper examines the complex nexus between regulation and inequality in Zimbabwe’s microfinance and tourism sectors. Rural Small to Medium Enterprises in Tourism (SMETs) is typical in the informal sector. However, SMETs in rural areas face financial, regulatory, and exclusionary constraints. This paper follows a qualitative literature review methodology guided by an exploratory design. In addition, one secondary case study was included to highlight the lived realities of SMETs. Findings indicate a complex connection between regulation and inequality in the economy. Overregulation leads to corruption, marginalization, and exclusion of small business activities. SMETs are constrained because they need access to finance for business growth. Thus, the nexus between the two variables profoundly impacts policy. The government must entangle the relationship for policy directions in the microfinance and tourism sectors. The paper concludes that the nexus between regulation and inequality needs urgent attention. The paper’s originality is based on using a systematic literature review to assess how regulations affect microfinance’s ability to fund rural SMETs so that these areas could have economic opportunities that would improve the livelihoods of people residing in these areas, thereby addressing inequalities. Furthermore, it contributes to the debates on the complex relationship between regulation and inequality of two sectors (microfinance and tourism) in Zimbabwe. It also informs future lines of research on the subject. Due to noted limitations on the research design used, more comprehensive empirical studies are required to understand the complexity of the nexus.
Plain Language Summary This paper explores the link between regulation and inequality in Zimbabwe’s microfinance and tourism sectors, with a focus on rural Small to Medium Enterprises in Tourism (SMETs). It employs a qualitative literature review methodology. One secondary case study is included to understand the constraints faced by SMETs in rural areas. The results indicate that overregulation leads to corruption, marginalization, and exclusion of small business activities, hindering SMETs’ access to finance and business growth. The paper highlights the urgent need for policymakers to address the complex nexus between regulation and inequality and calls for further empirical research to understand the intricacies of the relationship. It contributes to debates on the regulation-inequality connection and offers insights into the future lines of research. However, it has limitations due to the research design, highlighting the need for more comprehensive empirical studies."
pub.1150144313,Examining Factors That Influence the International Tourism in Pakistan and Its Nexus with Economic Growth: Evidence from ARDL Approach,"Tourism has played an influential role in the global economies. It is considered the third largest socio-economic sector and contributes about 9% to the world economy’s GDP. Tourism enhances investments, creates job opportunities, harnesses entrepreneurship, and secures heritage and cultural values and norms. However, tourism faces serious challenges in developing countries, especially in Pakistan. Therefore, the main aim of the current study is to examine the influential factors that affect the tourism sector and exhibit the nexus between tourism and economic development in Pakistan. The study collected data from the Global Terrorism Index (GTI), Pakistan Tourism Statistics, and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for the period from 1995 to 2017. The results of the study present that terrorism, which hampers peace and certainty, tourism expenditure and inflation rate, has a strong influence on the tourism sector in Pakistan. Moreover, the study also disclosed that tourism boosts the long-term macro-economic factors and leads to the economic development of Pakistan."

Despite the positive implication of tourism, it imposes a serious environmental cost such as environmental pollution. Brazil receives a large number of tourists each year that potentially affects economic growth and development. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of tourism on GDP and CO2 emissions in Brazil. We used a nonlinear ARDL approach to examine the nexus between tourism, economic growth, and CO2 emissions in Brazil for the period 1995–2018. The outcomes of this study reveal both short-run and long-run associations between tourism, GDP per capita, and CO2 emissions in Brazil. Nevertheless, both tourism and economic growth cause significant deterioration of the environment quality in Brazil. These findings suggest that the policymakers shall look for more sustainable and eco-friendly economic growth and tourism policies to preserve the environmental quality in Brazil."

Moreover, recent studies have included environmental variables in their analyses, although they tend to use a country-level approach despite the fact that tourism development takes place at a regional level. This study analyzes the relationship between tourism, economic growth, and the environment in Spain during 2004–2021, using an innovative approach that analyzes the data at a regional level. The hypothesis is that tourism affects economic growth and the environment. Using econometric analysis through CS-ARDL and causality analysis, the short- and long-term relationships of the three analyzed variables have been identified, adjusting these estimates according to the presence of cross-dependency between the regions. The results verified the positive effects of tourism on economic growth, and the adverse effects of carbon dioxide emissions on tourism. Theoretical and policy implications are suggested, and limitations are discussed."

The results show that tourism development and economic growth are interdependent in Germany; whereas tourism development induces economic growth in China and Turkey, the reverse is true in Spain. Causal relationships between renewable energy and economic growth give credence to theories of renewable energy‐led growth in Spain and growth‐led renewable energy in China, Turkey, and Germany. Whereas the Italian and U.S. models demonstrate a bidirectional relationship, the Spanish, Italian, Turkish, and U.S. data show a causal link stemming from tourism development. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed within the realm of macroeconomics and sustainability."
pub.1153335769,Tourism-Energy-Environment-Growth Nexus: Evidence from India,"This paper examined the dynamic linkages between tourism development, energy consumption, environmental degradation and economic growth in the context of the Indian economy. The short-run findings establish a chain-link between tourism development, economic growth, energy consumption and environmental degradation. Foreign tourist arrivals positively contribute to economic growth which in turn increases per capita energy use thereby raising CO2 emissions – a major cause of environmental degradation and consequential adverse effects on tourism development. The long-run findings, although inconclusive, are only indicative of short-run observations. Therefore, the policy focus should be on devising promotional strategies for encouraging the extensive use of clean energy for environmental protection. Such a policy base can be instrumental in fostering the development of India tourism and also, be pivotal for achieving sustainable economic growth."
pub.1121929359,The relationship between tourism and sustainable economic growth in the Republic of Benin,"This paper examines the nexus between tourism revenue and economic growth to the Republic of Benin throughout for 1995–2015. Specifically, this document examines the dynamic link between the three variables within a vector error correction model using the Johansen technique of co-integration, as well as the CUSUM test. The result confirms the tourism-led growth hypothesis that tourism has had a positive impact on economic growth in the developing countries, particularly in the Republic of Benin. Similarly, the CUSUM test CUSUM and CUSUMSQ statistics are well within the 5% critical bounds, implying that short- and long-term coefficients in the ARDL-Error Correction Model are stable. The result suggests that governments in developing nations will promote and increase international tourism demand to attain sustainable economic growth and development."

There have been numerous studies explaining how economic growth can affect various dimensions of human development. Further, additional arguments have been generated to indicate that tourism may also be the vehicle with which to impact human development and economic growth. However, the literature on the nexus between human development, economic growth, and tourism is riddled with mixed results. The results from this study suggest the presence of three unique long-run relationships. First, tourism does not promote human development. Instead, it is the degree and measure of human development that promotes tourism by creating a lopsided relationship. Second, a virtuous cycle between human development and economic growth exists. Third, the study found a unidirectional causality supporting the economics-driven tourism growth, meaning that tourism growth is a product of economic growth but not vice versa. The study concludes with implications for tourism development in the case of Ecuador."

Employing Quantile regression, the results revealed that TMD contributes to the economic growth of low- and lower-middle-income countries only at the lower, and lower-to-intermediate quantiles. In high-income countries, TMD not only has no significant effect on economic growth at lower quantile of GDP, but its effect tends to be negative at higher quantiles. Our findings indicated that TMD strategies work better at lower levels of economic growth than at higher levels of economic growth."

The study employed three cointegration tests (Bayer & Hanck, Fourier ADL and ARDL) to analyze the long-term nexus among the variables. Results indicate that tourism, growth, and energy consumption effect CO2 positively both in the long and the short-term. VECM causality results indicate that tourism, economic growth, and energy consumption are the causes of CO2 emissions. Also, CO2 emissions, economic growth, and energy consumption are the causes of tourism in the long-term. This finding indicates that the tourists pay attention to the environmental quality of the country that they travel."

An assessment is provided in this study to examine the Malaysian tourism market dynamics. A series of macroeconomic variables has been utilised to model tourism demand and examine causal linkages among tourism and economic growth. Spanning from 2000 till 2018 on a monthly basis, the Markov regime switching regression provides an overview of tourism market performance and potential influences during recession and expansion periods of the Malaysian tourism cycle. Notably, the results present a reference chronology of the crises happening over the past two decades, the Granger causality of the variables, and different behavioural changes of the variables as well for both recession and expansion periods. Significant relationships have been revealed in this study that suggest that overall international tourism can drive economic growth and vice versa."
pub.1154205685,Global Perspective on Tourism-Economic Growth Nexus: The Role of Tourism Market Diversification,"The tourism industry is well-known as a powerful driver of the economic growth of destinations. However, socio-political and financial fluctuations in the countries of origin and destination make the tourism industry more volatile and less beneficial to economic growth. The tourism market diversification (TMD) strategy supports the stabilizing of the industry and spurs the economic growth of destinations via several channels, e.g. minimizing the risk of over-dependence on one market and stabilization the number of foreign tourists and tourism receipts. We analyzed the effects of the TMD strategy on the economic growth of 75 destinations over the period 1995-2018. By applying the dynamic system GMM estimator, we found that the TMD strategy accelerates the economic growth of destinations. Our results are robust regarding different samples of countries. The growth effect of the TMD on the low and lower-middle-income groups is significantly higher than on the high and upper-middle groups."

pub.1145554686,Tourism Development and Economic Growth in BIMP-EAGA: A Conceptualization with Panel Data Evidence,"The tourism–growth nexus within the subregional economic group comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines has been virtually unexplored with respect to the exchange rate. The baseline hypotheses are growth-led tourism and tourism-led growth, whereby a model is conceptualized with respect to international prices and exchange rates. Data for the 2004–2018 period are analyzed using error corrections, causality, and panel cointegrating regressions with the consideration of cross-sectional dependence using state-of-the-art empirical methods. Significant findings, aided by a conducive exchange rate, favor the tourism-led growth hypothesis. The exchange rate is determined to be a crucial reason for divergence from and convergence toward the long-run equilibrium. The depreciation of the exchange rate appears to be the major factor supporting a sustainable tourism-led growth performance; hence, spillover effects are also expected to other countries in the Association of Southeast Asia Nations."

The increasingly important role of tourism and the limelight the tourism sector has been enjoying of late, on the one hand, and on the other, the lack of sufficient coverage of tourism-growth nexus studies in Africa in general and in SSA in particular, motivated this study. Unlike most of the known panel data-based studies on tourism development and economic growth, this study has split the sub-Saharan African countries into low-income and middle-income categories. The results of the study show that tourism expenditure negatively affects economic growth, while tourism receipts have the opposite effect in SSA. The findings are robust to the low-income sub-sample, while only the effect of tourism expenditure is robust in the middle-income sub-sample."

The panel two-stage least squares (2SLS) model is applied to analyse tourists from Australia and New Zealand into the sampled countries. The findings suggest that the aviation industry positively influences tourists travelling into the region. Tourism demand in the region is not very sensitive to income level of source markets. Our study justifies government support for the SPR’s aviation sector, and calls for regional cooperation between the aviation and tourism sectors."
pub.1141726480,"Investigating the nexus between CO2 emissions, economic growth, energy consumption and pilgrimage tourism in Saudi Arabia","Every year millions of Muslims go to Saudi Arabia to fulfil pilgrimage worship, thus Saudi Arabia is such a religious centre brings with it various consequences. In this context, this paper investigates the nexus between CO2 emissions, economic growth, energy consumption and pilgrimage tourism in Saudi Arabia for the period of 1968–2017. The dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and fully-modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) methods are employed in this study. FMOLS results prove that energy consumption, number of pilgrims and oil prices have a positive effect on CO2 emissions and GDP has a negative effect on it, while DOLS results imply that only energy consumption has a positive effect on carbon emissions. In addition, there is unidirectional causality from CO2 to pilgrimage tourism and from pilgrimage tourism to oil, and there is bidirectional causality between pilgrimage tourism and GDP. Therefore, the environmental cost of pilgrimage tourism is inevitable. Reflections of pilgrimage visits to Saudi Arabia as a belief tourism are dealt with for the first time in this paper. In addition, our more specific purpose is to determine the environmental impacts of Muslims performing the pilgrimage, during their religious worship."
pub.1128657061,Contextual factors influencing tourism-led growth: do social and political background matter?,"Formulated almost two decades ago, tourism-led growth hypothesis is still a subject of rigorous scientific scrutiny. Although there is no doubt that methodological issues have seriously undermined the efforts to draw definite conclusions, open questions could also be a result of ignoring a broader context in which tourism and growth interact. It still remains unclear how some important contextual variables, such as social and political factors, affect the verification of tourism-led growth hypothesis. In this regard, this paper is an attempt of both, a demonstration of an advanced econometric technique applied to investigate the true nature of relationship between tourism and economic growth as well as an exploration of the influence of some, possibly very important, contextual variables on tourism-growth nexus. Specifically, the initial level of poverty and the level of political freedom are hypothesized to have a significant impact on the verification of tourism-led growth hypothesis. This is tested by utilizing a dynamic panel data model with the System GMM estimator, as recommended in recent literature."
pub.1165891588,"Governance, tourism and inclusive growth in Africa","Abstract The use of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita as a measure of economic growth has been recently subject to wide criticism by many economists. It has been observed that although some countries have experienced economic growth in recent years, income inequality and poverty continue to be exacerbated. Recently, sustainable development goal 8 has been geared to promote inclusive growth. Considering this fact, this study expands the literature by examining the relationship between tourism development and inclusive growth for a panel of 44 African countries over the period 2000–2020. Further, the study also adds to the literature by examining the moderation of governance quality on the tourism‐inclusive growth nexus. The investigation is made using the generalized method of moments as an estimation technique. The result indicates that tourism and governance quality appear to promote inclusive growth. Moreover, the results indicate that good quality of institutions or governance could complement tourism development to promote inclusive growth, as positive synergies are apparent from the role of governance in moderating the incidence of tourism on inclusive growth. Policy implications are discussed."
pub.1160472679,Growth-Led Tourism and the Role of Exchange Rate," We re-visit the growth-led tourism hypothesis to examine the role of the exchange rate in the nexus. Using yearly data on Sri Lanka from 1995 to 2018, preliminary tests reveal a long-run association between tourism receipts, economic growth, and the official exchange rate. Consistent robustness results from a battery of econometric techniques validate that the connection holds autonomously and interactively. Conclusions drawn from the linear models suggest that a percentage change in economic growth increases tourism by 0.8% to 1.2%. Likewise, the exchange rate boosts tourism by 0.006% to 0.008%, on average, ceteris paribus . For the most part, the interaction of the exchange rate with economic growth upholds the ""growth-led tourism"" hypothesis. We also find that the results hold across the conditional distribution of tourism. Additional evidence from the margin plot reveals that the effect of economic growth on tourism is positive as the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciates. The upward trend of the plot within the 95% confidence interval shows that currency depreciation enhances the impact of economic growth on tourism. These are novel contributions to the literature as it suggests that currency depreciation in Sri Lanka is pro-tourism. Policy recommendations are discussed. "
pub.1113041522,"Tourism Industry and Economic Growth Nexus in Beijing, China","In the developing economy, tourism is the most visible and steadiest growing facade. Tourism is considered one of the rapidly increasing elements for economic development from the last two decades. Therefore, the proposed study used vector autoregression (VAR) model, error correction model (ECM), and the Granger causality to check the relationship between the tourism industry and economic growth based on the data of the Beijing municipal bureau of statistics from 1994 to 2015. Gross domestic product (GDP) is used as a replacement variable for the economic growth index, while internal tourism revenue is used as a tourism industry indicator. The study supports the tourism-led growth hypothesis proposed in the existing literature in a different survey of tourism and economic development. The results show that there is a strong relationship in the tourism industry and economic growth in the context of Beijing, and at the same time, tourism creates a more significant increase in long run local real economic accomplishments. The results of the VAR model confirm that in the long run, Beijing’s economic growth is affected by domestic tourism, while the ECM model shows unidirectional results in the short term. Similarly, there is a one-way causal relationship between the tourism industry and economic growth in Beijing, China. The empirical results are in strong support of the concept that tourism causes growth."
pub.1024241028,Evidence of the water-energy nexus in tourist accommodation,"The water-energy nexus is critical to solving multiple resource challenges simultaneously, but has rarely been considered in tourism, despite evidence that tourism can be both energy and water intensive. A database of 876 environmentally certified hotels globally was used to explore the resource use, savings achievements and existence of different nexuses. . Differentiated by accommodation type (vacation, business, and villas), the research established robust benchmarks for energy (175–420 MJ per guest-night), water (358–1338 L per guest-night) and waste (2.1–2.9 L per guest-night), and found that annual improvements in resource intensity are in the order of several percent, with the first years of being in a certification program yielding the largest reductions. Absolute decreases in resource use over time could not be observed, raising concerns that efficiency gains are outweighed by growth. The relationship between all three resource indicators was significant, but particularly pronounced for the water-energy nexus, indicating the intrinsically close relationship between ‘water for energy’ and ‘energy for water’. The main contribution of this research is to provide an important knowledge basis for harnessing this nexus. Taking a nexus approach to resource savings in tourism is an important step towards achieving not only relative but also absolute reductions."
pub.1111396838,"Threshold Effect of Tourism Development on Economic Growth Following a Disaster Shock: Evidence from the Wenchuan Earthquake, P.R. China","To examine whether tourism can effectively stimulate economic growth following a disaster shock, we apply a panel threshold regression technique to test the threshold effect of tourism development on economic growth of the 36 Wenchuan earthquake-affected counties in 2008–2016. The empirical results using the panel fixed-effects model show that tourism significantly contributes to economic growth, supporting the validity of the tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH) for the disaster-affected destinations. The results of the panel threshold regression model also indicate a threshold effect of tourism development on economic growth, implying that counties with different conditions of tourism specialization and industrial structure experience different impacts on the tourism-growth nexus. Specifically, the estimated coefficients of tourism on economic growth decrease with the levels of tourism specialization and industrial structure exceeding the threshold value. Based on the Tourism Area Life Cycle theory (TALC), we further divide the 36 disaster-stricken counties into six types based on the evolution of tourism specialization: Exploration-stage type, involvement-stage type, transition-stage type, development-stage type, consolidation-stage type, and stagnation-stage type. The empirical findings and managerial implications discussed are generally applicable to policymakers seeking new ways to invigorate the economy in other disaster-affected destinations."

We examine the nexus among tourism, urbanisation, and CO2 emissions in South Asia by providing empirical evidence using panel data analysis. Design – Annual data from 1995-2019 is collected from the World Development Indicator 2020 for five South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan. Methodology – Durbin-Hausman panel cointegration and LM Bootstrap panel cointegration tests are conducted to check long-run cointegration. Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test is used to detect causal relationship among the variables. Moreover, the PDOLS, PMG ARDL, c-up FMOLS and Generalised Linear Model are used to estimate long-run coefficients of the variables. Findings – We reveal unidirectional causalities running from urbanisation to tourism, urbanisation to CO2 emissions, and tourism to CO2 emissions. Additionally, when heterogeneity of the variables is taken into account, both tourism and urbanisation show positive and significant effect on CO2 emissions in the long-run. Originality of the Research – To our knowledge, no previous study investigates the relationship among tourism, urbanisation and CO2 emissions is South Asia. Our results will guide policy makers to design policies that will promote urbanisation and tourism growth in an environmentally sustainable way."
pub.1145830263,The Tourism Industry and Economic Growth Nexus in Lesotho,"Tourism-led economic growth hypothesis has been a widely studied topic yet Africa has been slow to generate information in this area. Almost all economies globally utilise tourism to accelerate economic growth because the industry is linked with foreign exchange income, employment opportunities, and increased foreign investment. Therefore, this study focuses on exploring and demonstrating the economic impact of the tourism industry on Lesotho’s economy by specifically focusing on tourism as a source of income, employment, investment, and export. Secondary research approach was utilised by conducting a comprehensive literature review to generate information for this research. The findings of this study revealed that tourism activities positively influenced Lesotho’s economy from 2014 to 2019. The results support the tourism-led economic growth hypothesis by noting a positive contribution to Lesotho’s economy in terms of the gross domestic product, employment and investment. Furthermore, Lesotho’s tourism development impediments were noted to include infrastructure inadequacy, low levels of tourism collaborations and investment, and improper marketing and management of tourism organisations.

pub.1163377052,A new look to the tourism and economic growth nexus: A clustering and panel causality analysis,"Abstract This paper explores the dynamic relationship between tourism and economic growth using panel data for 144 countries over the period 1995–2019. The study was carried out in two steps. First, the set of countries was classified by considering simultaneously two criteria, tourism and the economic development of the countries over time. Two classifications of homogeneous countries with four clusters each are obtained using a non‐parametric methodology and two tourism indicators. Second, the Granger causality was tested for each of the identified groups and the entire sample. The results determined that there were significant differences between clusters and that causality from tourism to economic growth could only be verified for the group of countries with low income and low tourism. This relationship was confirmed by estimating impulse response functions, which showed a positive response of economic growth to innovations in tourism. The tourism sector could, therefore, be a way out of poverty and generate development and prosperity in low‐income countries that are in the early stages of tourism development."

To determine the direction and the sign of the causality, study first test the existence of cross-sectional dependence among the countries and slope homogeneity across the countries. The empirical findings of the study produced varying results for countries reflecting the heterogeneity among the sample countries. Results also provide evidence of tourism-led growth, economic-driven tourism growth, feedback, and neutrality hypotheses. Moreover, results show evidence of tourism induced external competitiveness and vice-versa. Therefore, even though the study's empirical results have a significant implication for policymakers, regulators, and sector representatives.

This study is conducted to explore the impact of tourism, economic growth, globalization, and human capital on environmental degradation in RCEP countries during 1995–2016. By adopting Bayesian random-effects regression to capture individual variations across countries, the findings show that tourism development improves environmental quality, while economic growth and globalization positively drive environmental degradation. The empirical result also finds that the influence of human capital on environmental damage is positive but not significant. These findings are expected to strengthen the belief of RCEP policymakers in promoting sustainable tourism."

To this end, the panel VAR (Vector Autoregressive) approach is employed to analyze the annual data over 2000–2021 for 40 developing Asian countries. The major findings confirmed the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis only for economic growth in the industry and services sectors. In addition, there are bi-directional linkages between economic growth in all three sectors and tourism development, revealing the existence of both TLGH (the Tourism-led growth hypothesis) and ELTG (Economic Lead Tourism Growth) hypotheses. Regarding the value of the growth rate of CO2 (Carbon dioxide) emissions, the growth rates of all variables in the previous period positively impact it. In contrast, the growth rate of the green energy index negatively affects the value of the growth rate of carbon emissions in the examined Asian developing economies. Developing green financing markets and promoting green culture are two recommended practical policies by this research."
pub.1164302135,"Empirical evidence, methodologies and perspectives on tourism, energy and sustainability: A systematic review","The high dependence of tourism activities on energy consumption, and particularly on non-renewable energy, is a major barrier to building sustainable tourism models. For this reason, the analysis of tourism and energy use is a growing field of study within sustainability debates. Despite this, there is a gap in the literature and, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study that critically reviews the vast literature on the energy-tourism nexus. This paper aims to fill this gap in tourism knowledge. The main objective of this article is to conduct a systematic review of scientific studies with a quantitative empirical basis that examine this nexus, trying to answer the following questions: What are the main methodologies used to approach the tourism-energy nexus? which indicators or variables are relevant?; is there a consensus on the results?; and what are the main lines of discussion on the use of energy in tourism? To this end, we particularly focus on the main methodologies, results and perspectives during the period 2001–2021. A total of 1,189 articles were reviewed by abstract and title, 236 were included for the full review and 163 were finally selected. The results show how the nexus and energy dependence of tourism is assessed mainly from four major methodological groups: G1) econometric models, regressions and other statistical methodologies (67% of the sample); G2) surveys, questionnaires and energy audits (15%); G3) Life Cycle Analysis (13%) and G4) other approaches and environmental impact indicators to assess the relationship between energy and tourism (5%). The analysis between the causal relationships between tourism development, economic growth, energy use, environmental degradation and energy efficiency of accommodations are the main issues evaluated, considering a wide range of indicators/variables. Based on the gaps and limitations found in the literature review on tourism and energy, it is discussed how some findings should be interpreted with caution due to their methodological approaches and differences. Finally, some of the main lines of future research in this field are also presented."
pub.1138633410,A New Intuition into Tourism-Inclusive Growth Nexus in Turkey and Nigeria (1995 – 2018),"Abstract This paper examines the symmetric and asymmetric causal relationships between tourism and inclusive growth in Turkey and Nigeria over the period 1995Q1-2018Q4. The study employs a bootstrap simulation method with leverage adjustments to achieve the objective of the study. The method is used to see whether positive or negative tourism shocks cause inclusive growth and whether positive or negative inclusive growth shocks cause tourism activity. The results show no evidence of asymmetric causality between tourism and inclusive growth, while there is evidence of symmetric causality running from tourism to inclusive growth in Turkey. On the other hand, there is neither symmetric nor asymmetric causal relationship between tourism and inclusive growth in Nigeria. In sum, both neutrality and tourism-led growth hypothesis hold in Turkey, while Nigeria gives credence to neutrality hypothesis. The recommendations coming from the findings are that the tourism sector in both countries, Nigeria in particular, should be repositioned for better performance and effectiveness in stimulating inclusive growth. Rather than focusing on pro-poor and micro-based tourism policies that favour selected communities and localities, tourism should be included in development plans nationally, in order to ensure wider participation and more encompassing trickle-down effects on the citizenry. Furthermore, both countries should implement policies that will stimulate their tourism sectors for a larger and more significant contribution to real GDP."

To fulfil this purpose, &ldquo;non-linear autoregressive distributed lag&rdquo; (NARDL) modelling was performed on the time series data collected from Pakistan for 26 years. The unit root test, co-integration test, long-run estimation, and NARDL estimations were applied to the data to generate findings. The present study revealed the presence of significant asymmetric associations between environmental degradation and tourism demand and economic growth and tourism demand. It is found that the increase and decrease in economic growth cause the tourism demand of Pakistan to increase. Results further indicate that the increase in environmental degradation in Pakistan causes its tourism demand to reduce. The current study tends to be theoretically significant and practically beneficial for Pakistan's policymakers. It will help them realize the role of economic growth of the country and environmental degradation in shaping Pakistan's tourism demand and thus help them develop and implement better policies for the growth of the tourism sector.</p>"

pub.1140627678,Tourism‐induced pollutant emissions in Mediterranean countries: Evidence from panel causality analysis,"Abstract There are ample studies that document the tourism‐led growth for single countries and/or a specific region. The nexus on international tourist arrival‐induced pollutant emissions and energy consumption has been ongoing in the related literature. This is pertinent, given its inherent implications for environmental sustainability. This study explores the growth impact of international tourist arrivals on quality of the environment in terms of a causality relationship for 16 selected Mediterranean countries by a multivariate framework; this is based on tourism‐led growth and the tourism‐induced pollutant emissions model for annual data from 1995 to 2014. Our model, therefore, explores the dynamic causal links between tourism, growth, energy, and the environment. We employ the panel causality technique (Emirmahmutoglu and Kose 2011) that allows for heterogeneity and correlations across cross‐sections. The data shows correlation among international tourism, economic growth, energy consumption, and pollutant emission. The findings from the causality analysis support the evidence on tourism‐induced pollutant emissions and energy consumption as well as the validity of the tourism‐led growth hypothesis. The findings also suggest that international tourism is a catalyst for energy consumption and economic growth, which translates into pollutant emissions, implying insightful policy prescriptions."

However, the global challenges of greenhouse gas emission have been acting as a detriment in sustainable tourism-led economic growth for India. In this study, the relationship between economic growth, hydropower consumption, and CO2 emission has been revisited for India by including tourism polynomials and energy intensity in the Environmental Kuznets Curve specification. The unique outcome provides evidence of “Inverted N-shaped” relationship between tourism and CO2 emission. Further, the negative impact of hydropower consumption suggests that a higher proportion of hydropower in the Indian energy mix would help to achieve its sustainable development goals while accelerating its economic growth. The outcome suggests sustainable tourism practices aligned with capital investment and hydropower promotion to achieve environmental sustainability in India."

Feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) and Panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) are employed for empirical examination of the liaison between the said variables. In the leading six economies, we find evidence for the N-shaped Kuznets curve. Fiscal decentralization (FDC), economic growth (EG), and energy security (ES) promote tourism. Other controls, such as tourism development and urbanization, are also included in the core model to check the robustness of the results. Our findings are insensitive to the integration of the other controls and econometric models. We find a positive relationship between urbanization, tourism development, and tourism, emphasizing the importance of tourism development and urbanization.

Tourism, contributing to the economic development of both developed and developing countries, includes environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development with this structure. Therefore, analyzing tourism development and environmental quality nexus is a crucial issue for policymakers to design effective policies for a sustainable life. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the impacts of tourism investments on the ecological footprint in the six countries (Ecuador, Egypt, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Tunisia and Sri Lanka), which are in the top 20 countries, fastest-growing in terms of tourism GDP over the period of 1995–2014. In addition to tourism investments, our quadratic EKC model includes economic growth, energy use and individual internet use as independent variables. Empirical findings reveal that tourism investments and internet uses have negative impacts on ecological footprint. On the other hand, energy consumption increases environmental degradation. Also, the existence of the EKC is confirmed in these countries."

The investigation introduced a framework termed Tourism-Poverty Interdependence Diamond that conceptualizes the relationships between tourism development, economic growth, human development, and poverty, which conventionally have been studied in a fragmented way. The framework was tested for several key tourism markets of Honduras, a Central American country where about half of the population lives in poverty. Using time-series data, the methodology involved unit root and cointegration testing and three-stage regression application. The results were tourism market-specific (contextual), suggesting that Honduras's tourism-poverty connection is mostly direct. The study advances our understanding of the complexities between tourism development and poverty and provides a blueprint to policymakers and destination managers on creating a better synthesis between tourism development and poverty alleviation."

This analysis conducted to extract the influence of terrorism on tourism in Pakistan, expending the latest dataset and incorporating some additional factors like FDI, human capital, and economic growth for 1980-2016, using ARDL bounds test. The evidence shows that terrorism has an inverse relationship with tourism in the long run that is statistically significant. Economic growth, FDI, and human capital are the increasing factors of tourism. Terrorism may cause to create insecurity and devastating recreational places. There is a need to resolve the issue of terrorism to enhance tourism in Pakistan. It may help tourist authorities to understand the nature of the impact of terrorism on the tourism industry in Pakistan.Keywords: Terrorism, Tourism, ARDL, Human Capital, Economic GrowthJEL Classifications: L83, Z32, J24, F43DOI: https://doi.org/10.32479/ijefi.10674"
pub.1166252585,"Exploring the Nexus among Tourism, Information Communication Technology and Economic Growth: A Case Study of Nigeria","The research investigates the relationship between economic growth and tourism as well as information and communications technology (ICT) between 1995 and 2021. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) process and an enhanced Solow framework for cointegration analysis; we examine how these variables interact. The findings demonstrate that, when all three are forced to depend on one another, economic growth, foreign tourism receipts—which act as a stand-in for tourism—and mobile cellular subscriptions—which indicate the pervasiveness of ICT—all display cointegration. At the 1% level, both ICT and tourism have long-term statistically significant effects. ICT and tourism have short-run coefficients of 0.006 and 0.03 respectively. Furthermore, at the 1% level, the interaction term (LNTOUR*MCS) of tourism receipts and ICT is associated with a long-run coefficient (0.148) that indicates a positive and statistically significant effect on economic growth. This finding highlights the importance of fostering the mutually beneficial interaction between the development of technology and the growth of the tourist industry as key factors in Nigeria's economic prosperity."
pub.1112863708,Tourism–growth nexus in Pacific Island Countries: A panel study on information and communication technology as a contingent factor,"Growth in tourism earnings, aside from adding real resources in terms of foreign exchange and rising income in the organized sector of the hospitality industry, has given rise to employment opportunities in the informal sectors of the Pacific Island Countries (PICs). The spread of information and communication technology (ICT), on the other hand, has facilitated faster and smoother international tourism and provides greater opportunities for tourists travelling in interior islands for ecotourism and home stays at affordable costs. In this article, we assess the role of tourism with ICT as a contingent factor on economic growth in a panel study of five selected PICs. The results show that in the long run, tourism and ICT contribute around 0.25 and 0.02%, respectively. The interaction term of tourism with ICT is positive and statistically significant, indicating they act as complements. The complementary relationship begins to work when ICT reaches a certain threshold level."
pub.1173225985,Overseas Capital Streams and Economic Growth Nexus: Pragmatic Insights from Nepal,"The objective of the present research is to ascertain the impact of foreign capital inflows, including grants, loans, remittances, and income from tourism, on the economic growth of Nepal. This study utilizes secondary data acquired from several Nepalese economic surveys and World Bank reports. The data consists of 35 data points spanning from the fiscal years 1987/88 to 2021/22. The link between foreign capital inflows and GDP growth in Nepal is examined using fundamental statistical approaches like quantile regression, trace and Max-Eigen cointegration tests, and descriptive statistics. The results show that Nepal's grants, debt, foreign remittances, tourism earnings, and GDP growth co-integrate over the long term. Notably, 80.5 percent of Nepal's GDP growth fluctuation is accredited to foreign grants, loans, remittances, and tourism income. While foreign loans and grants are not statistically significant in and of themselves to measure GDP growth, foreign remittances and tourism income are. For every percentage increase in the median value of remittance and tourism income, the GDP grows by 0.251 and 0.816 percent, respectively. More revenue from tourism than from remittances goes towards Nepal's economic growth. Legislators can, therefore, enact suitable measures to encourage the expansion of the tourism industry"
pub.1144603330,International Tourism and Economic Growth: Empirical Evidence from BRICS Countries,"The aim of the study was to examine the tourism-growth nexus in the context of BRICS nations. For this purpose, the augmented neo-classical growth framework has been employed a panel data model approach over the sample period spanning from 1995 to 2019. The estimation was conducted using PMG based ARDL regression. The results lend support to the tourism-led growth hypothesis when the capital formation and human development exert a positive impact on the long-run real economic growth in BRICS economies. So, the policies meant for tourism sector development can contribute to long-run economic growth through an increase in the share of gross capital formation in the gross domestic product and with the help of improved human development. Therefore, the policy focus should be on infrastructure development, the promotion of investment opportunities, and the development of healthcare and education in BRICS countries. The use of a macroeconomic framework in the analysis is the novelty of this study."

It has also raised our awareness of the role sustainability needs to play in our economic activities. This study investigated how sustainable tourism has contributed to economic growth in Kenya.  Research Methodology: Eviews 10 software was used to analyze the time-series data. Drawing on data from 1995 to 2020, Johansen co-integration, Granger causality, and regression approaches were used.  Results: The study found out that tourism employment and GDP are positively connected to economic growth in Kenya. The causality was unidirectional from economic growth to tourism contribution to GDP and employment, with a long-run linkage of the study determinants.  Limitations: Since this research used the secondary sources of data, similar studies in the future may concentrate on the primary data sources to investigate the relationship between tourism employment and economic advancement.  Contribution: At the new normal in the post-Covid-19 period, the study suggests that legislators and tourism policymakers should focus on the policies aimed at promoting sustainable tourism. Sustainable tourism should be managed following the three pillars of sustainability.  Keywords: Development, Domestic, Moderate, Regional, Scenario"
pub.1138939227,"An Assessment of the Impact of the Tourism Sector on Regional Economic Development in Gauteng Province, South Africa","South Africa is facing three main developmental problems, including high levels of poverty, unemployment, and inequality. The tourism sector allows for a relatively easy entry into the local market for small businesses and entrepreneurs and has the potential to create jobs and subsequently, income. Tourism development could be utilised as a driver for economic growth and development. The main objective of this research was to assess the impact of the tourism sector on economic growth and development in South Africa, focusing on the Gauteng Province which, is the economic hub of the country and even Africa. The methodology utilised was based on a quantitative design, using secondary time series pooled panel data approach including, all the municipal entities in the region. Annual data from 2000 to 2019 were used to analyse the impact of tourism on economic growth and development. Tourism variables include measurements such as tourism spending and international tourism trips. Results confirm the tourism-growth nexus and the sector allows ease of market entry for small businesses, resulting in employment creation and income for the poor in developing regions if promoted via effective policy implementation, even in regions where tourism is not the leading sector."
pub.1169796453,"Exploring the Nexus between CO2 Emissions, Trade, and Sustainable Economic Growth: A Novel NARDL Approach","This study investigates the nexus between CO2 emission, trade, Gross domestic product (GDP), and tourism in Pakistan during 1990-2019. We examined the asymmetric relationship between CO2 emission, international trade, Gross domestic product (GDP), and international tourism number of arrivals in Pakistan. Data Stationarity has been tested using the Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF), Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS), and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests for unit roots. We used the NARDL technique. Then a Granger Causality helped estimate the relationship between these environmental variables. If there is an asymmetric association between these variables, we estimate the non-linear auto-regressive distributed lag, which is the most applicable econometric estimate. The ARDL technique can potentially explore the dynamic nexus between CO2 emission, tourism, GDP, and trade. Our findings suggest a dynamic relationship between tourism, trade, CO2 emission, and GDP from Pakistan's perspective. The outcomes reveal that negative and positive shocks to trade, GDP, and tourism affect CO2 emissions in the short and long term. The Granger Causality findings also determined that causality is directed from Tourism toward CO2 emission, while unidirectional causality was found between CO2 emission and tourism. In this study, the graphs of the CUSUM and CUSUMQ determined the functional stability of the established relationship. This indicates that this model is a suitable and valuable strategy tool. Therefore, an increase or decrease in the macroeconomic series will cause variation in carbon emissions in Pakistan in the long -term. The finding benefits macro-level policymakers and will provide important insight for the relevant stakeholders."
pub.1123953086,Is tourism development a catalyst of economic recovery following natural disaster? An analysis of economic resilience and spatial variability,"This article constructs one index system of economic resilience, measures the economic resilience index, and investigates whether tourism stimulates economic recovery following the Wenchuan earthquake shock. The empirical results show that the economic resilience index (ERI) using the TOPSIS method presents an increasing trend for all the disaster-affected counties from 2008 to 2016, indicating that the economy in all the counties continues to recover from the Wenchuan earthquake; however, there is a large spatial variability amongst them. Most counties with a tourism-based economic model have lower resilience index but higher average growth rate than those without. The effect of tourism on economic resilience utilizing Quantile regression method shows that the coefficients on tourism specialization vary across the quantiles of the economic resilience index, indicating the existence of a nonlinear tourism-growth nexus."
pub.1121112349,"The nexus between tourism and urban risk: Towards inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable outdoor tourism in African cities"," Sub-Saharan Africa is set to increase its tourism sector in urban areas. However, its cities are also settings for numerous struggles over future developments coupled with excess urban risks. The nexus created by the relationship between urbanization, urban growth, urban governance, poverty and inequality, and ecological degradation is altering the sustainability of urban tourism in Sub-Saharan African cities. Inspired by the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 11; making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, this study critically analyses the linkages between risk, justice, inclusion, trust and power relations in urban spaces with the aim to strengthen tourism governance in Sub-Saharan African urban settings. Document analysis is adopted to draw evidence and critically analyse the sustainability of tourism in the three Sub-Saharan cities: Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Harare, Zimbabwe. The study reveals that tourism development in Africa is dominantly underpinned by neoliberal development strategies which threaten the sustainability of tourism in African cities. It, therefore, argues for good governance through strong sustainability institutions which strengthen the regulative mechanisms, processes and organizational culture which empowers local communities. Sustainable tourism approaches that are resilient centred have a potential to promote urban tourism in Sub-Saharan African cities."
pub.1140420925,Assessing the Impact of Terrorism on African Tourism Demand,"Many African states are relying on or have identified tourism to accelerate their growth and the continent has become the world’s second fastest growing tourist industry. However, African states have also not been spared by increasing terrorism attacks during the past decades, probably hindering the growth of this sector to certain extent. This study examines the relationship between terrorism and tourism for a sample of selected African countries over the period 1995 to 2017. Given the dynamic nature of tourism demand and the possibility of endogenous relationships in the terrorism-tourism nexus, dynamic panel data analysis, namely a Panel vector error correction model (PVECM) is employed. The results confirm that terrorism negatively affects tourism demand in Africa and this can be explained by the reactive psychology of tourists to the various aggravated terrorist attacks in the countries. Moreover, the findings show that an increase in tourism may have resulted in an increase in terrorist attacks, hence confirming a bi directional causality between tourism and terrorism."

Thus, the present article investigates the impact of eco-product innovation, eco-process innovation, eco-organizational innovation, eco-tourism policies, and social media on sustainable tourism development in Indonesia. This article has used primary data collection methods like questionnaires to collect the data from the selected respondents. The research also applied the smart-PLS to check the association among variables and test the hypotheses. The results revealed that eco-product innovation, eco-process innovation, eco-organizational innovation, eco-tourism policies, and social media have a positive nexus with sustainable tourism growth in Indonesia. This shows that through social media, the tourism firms keep in contact with the stakeholders, can have information, and share their own ideas with them. In this way, they can keep their tourism practice innovative and according to the requirements of stakeholders. This article guides the regulators to develop effective policies that improve sustainable tourism growth using eco-innovation and eco-tourism policies."
pub.1072796240,The nexus between tourism demand and output per capita with the relative importance of trade openness and financial development,"This article revisits the tourism-growth nexus in Malaysia using time series quarterly data over the period 1975–2013. The authors examine the impact of tourism using two separate indicators – tourism receipts per capita and visitor arrivals per capita. Using the augmented Solow production function and the autoregressive distributed lag bounds procedure, they also incorporate trade openness and financial development and account for structural breaks in series. The results show the evidence of cointegration between the variables. Assessing the long-run results using both indicators of tourism demand, it is noted that the elasticity coefficient of tourism is 0.13 and 0.10 when considering visitor arrivals and tourism receipts (in per capita terms), respectively. Notably, the impact of tourism demand is marginally higher with visitor arrivals. The elasticity of trade openness is 0.19, that of financial development is 0.09 and that of capital share is 0.15. In the short run, the coefficient of tourism is marginally negative, and for financial development and trade openness, it is 0.01 and 0.18, respectively. The Granger causality tests show bidirectional causation between tourism and output per capita, financial development and tourism and trade openness and tourism demand, duly indicating the feedback or mutually reinforcing impact between the variables and providing evidence that tourism is central to enhancing the key sectors and the overall income level."

pub.1144236931,Moderation analysis on tourism–growth–emissions nexus in South Asia,"This study makes significant incursion into the tourism literature by investigating whether per capita (PC) income moderates the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on tourism development in South Asia. With an unbalanced panel data on six South Asian countries from 1995 to 2019, the study engages a battery of analytical techniques which includes the Prais–Winsten panel-corrected standard error to probe the discourse. Findings reveal, inter alia, that at the 1% level, (1) carbon emission is a significant and negative predictor of tourism, (2) the impact of emission on tourism differs significantly across South Asia, (3) economic growth is a significant and positive predictor of tourism, (4) the impact of growth on tourism differs significantly across South Asia and (5) growth reduces the devastating impact of emissions. Country results are mixed. Specifically, emissions reduce tourism in Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka but boosts tourism in Nepal and Pakistan. Conversely, economic growth increases tourism and reduces the devastating impact of emissions in Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, whereas it reduces tourism and increases the devastating impact of emissions in Nepal and Pakistan. Although the study submits that growth is a critical driver of tourism in South Asia, the moderating impact of growth is not sufficient to attenuate the total negative impact of carbon emissions. In addition, the lack of consistency of the results across the selected countries suggests that PC income and carbon emissions levels are greatly dispersed. Causal relations align with the underlying results, and policy recommendations are discussed."
pub.1174354835,"Heterogeneous Impact of Tourism Development, and Economic Growth on Ecological Footprint in Singapore","In a few past decades, Singapore has maintained rapid economic growth, and has been listed as one of the top-visited countries. As a result, Singapore currently holds the world’s highest ecological deficit, signifying a situation where the demand for natural resources and ecosystem services in the region surpasses its sustainable capacity to regenerate and provide those resources. This study is conducted to investigate the nonparametric nexus structures between ecological footprint and Singapore’s economic activities from 1980 to 2016. By adopting the quantile regression and quantile-on-quantile methods, the outcomes show that tourism development and economic growth positively impact ecological sustainability at low-medium quantiles. At high quantiles (above 60% quantile) the outcome finds these impacts are inverted. That means at high of tourism development and economic growth, two macroeconomic variables might contribute to ecological sustainability. Based on these findings, the research may further strengthen the belief of Singapore’s policy-makers on promoting tourism and suggests some helpful lessons for emerging countries."

Empirical evidence is based on annual data from 1995 to 2016 for a panel of 14 selected countries around the Mediterranean Sea region. The findings from the bootstrap panel cointegration test proposed by Westerlund (2007) confirm the long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables under inspection. Subsequently, the Panel Pooled Mean Group Autoregressive Distributed model (PMG-ARDL) estimations suggest positively significant relationships between tourism and economic growth both in short-term, and long-term periods. Thus, this study joins the group of studies that lend support to the tourism-led growth hypothesis. This result was further substantiated by the results of the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) causality analysis, as feedback causality was observed between tourism and economic growth, while unidirectional causality was seen from foreign direct investment to economic growth. That is in support of the foreign direct investment-driven economic growth hypothesis. Strikingly, no causal relationship was observed between domestic credits and economic growth."

The result supports evidence for the symmetric causality in Henan, showing significant one-way Granger causality from ITRs to real gross domestic product (RGDP). They also indicate that Hunan has significant one-way Granger causality from RGDP to ITRs.

The data has been downloaded from World Bank Development Indicators with their natural logarithmic forms. At the empirical part of the study GDP per capita annual data (%) represents economic growth and international tourism receipts (of % total export) have been chosen as an indicator of tourism sector. The model has been tested with dynamic panel data analysis. Firstly preliminary tests have been applied to be sure about the the homogeneity of series (Delta test) and the cross-section depence (CDlm test) of each individuals. After that second generation unit root test (Hadri Kurozomi-2012) used to find out the level of stationary. Durbin-H co-integration test showed that there is co-integration between variables and finally Hurlin-Dumetriscu causality test (2012) does not support tourism-led growth hypothesis. So there is one-way causality from economic growth to tourism for selected countries. "
pub.1132132456,Is tourism a spur to economic growth in South Africa? An empirical investigation,"In this study, the dynamic Granger-causality between tourism development and economic growth in South Africa was empirically examined during the period 1995-2016. The study was motivated by the limelight that the South African tourism sector has been enjoying in recent years, on the one hand, and the lack of sufficient coverage of tourism-growth nexus studies in many sub-Saharan African countries, on the other hand. The study used two tourism proxies, namely tourist arrivals and tourism revenue, to examine this link. In addition, the study used exchange rate and foreign direct investment as intermittent variables in a multivariate Granger-causality model in order to address the omission-of-variable bias. Using the auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL)-bounds testing approach, the study found that although the direction of causality between tourism development and economic growth in South Africa is sensitive to the proxy used and the time under consideration, in the main, a feedback relationship tends to predominate in the short run. The study, therefore, recommends that short-term policy efforts be directed at developing the tourism and the real sectors as both sectors have been found to reinforce each other in the short run, irrespective of the tourism proxy used."
pub.1143357601,"Analysing Association in Environmental Pollution, Tourism and Economic Growth: Empirical Evidence from the Commonwealth of Independent States"," Clean and green environment along with sustainable development is the prime objective of every state. We explore empirically the nexus between tourism, environmental pollution measured by carbon (CO 2 ) emissions, population, trade, foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth in six countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States over 1995–2018. Traditional panel estimation technique is employed, where the Hausman test suggests fixed-effects over random effect estimator. We also employed the robust least squares (RLS) estimator to confirm the empirical estimates. Results show that a 1% increase in CO 2 will attenuate the economic growth by 0.14% and that 1% raise in the tourism activities can boost growth by 0.04%. Both the fixed-effect and RLS estimates reveal that tourism, population growth and trade contribute significantly to economic growth, whereas CO 2 adversely affect growth. The Granger causality test shows a two-way causality between economic growth and CO 2 and between growth and trade. Empirical results also indicate a one-way causality between growth and FDI, population and FDI, population and CO 2 along with population growth and tourism. These findings suggest that adopting effective policies that can expand trade, enhance FDI and promote the tourism sector with minimum environmental damage will ultimately accelerate sustainable economic development.

pub.1053690045,Tourism development and economic growth–a nonlinear approach,"We use cross sectional data (1995–2005 yearly averages) for 88 countries to investigate the nonlinear relationship between tourism development and economic growth when a threshold variable is used. The degree of tourism specialization (qi, defined as receipts from international tourism as a percentage of GDP) is used as the threshold variable. The results of the tests for nonlinearity indicate that the 88 countries’ data should be separated into three different groups or regimes to analyze the tourism-growth nexus. The results of the threshold regression show that when the qi is below 4.0488% (regime 1, 57 countries) or above 4.7337% (regime 3, 23 countries), there exists a significantly positive relationship between tourism growth and economic growth. However, when the qi is above 4.0488% and below 4.7337% (regime 2, 8 countries), we are unable to find evidence of such a significant relationship. Further in-depth analysis reveals that relatively low ratios of the value added of the service industry to GDP, and the forested area per country area are able to explain why we are unable to find a significant relationship between these two variables in regime 2’s countries."
pub.1132017337,Exploring the Tourism-Poverty Alleviation Nexus in the Brics Group of Nations,"The tourism-poverty alleviation nexus is becoming an increasingly significant subject of academic inquiry within the tourism economics discourse. Using time series data from the World Bank (1995–2017) in a P-ARDL model, the present study explores the relationship between tourism (receipts from exports, the travel subsector, hospitality and accommodation subsector) and poverty alleviation (final household consumption) with tourism arrivals as the control variable within the context of the BRICS group. The results suggest that receipts from the travel subsector and exports met the a priori expectation – positively influencing poverty alleviation within BRICS nations in the long run. Contrastingly, receipts from the hospitality and accommodation subsector did not meet the a priori expectation of a positive sign, with the results indicating statistical insignificance in the long run. However, receipts from the hospitality and accommodation were found to only influence poverty alleviation in the short run. Relatedly, the results suggest that increases in consumption associated with growth in tourism arrivals did not influence poverty in the BRICS. The results point to the heterogeneity of the influence of tourism on poverty alleviation, whereby certain dimensions of tourism contribute to poverty alleviation in the long run and others do so in the short run. Based on these findings it is recommended that BRICS countries harness their tourism potential and promote intra-BRICS tourism to maximise the positive impact of travel and tourism export receipts on household consumption, which catalyses poverty alleviation."

However, quick growth and tourism development may increase the income gap between the higher- and lower-income classes. This study is conducted to analyse the lead-lag connectedness between three vital macroeconomic variables and income inequality from 1978 to 2019 in Singapore, a top-visited country. By adopting wavelet techniques, the outcomes reveal that tourism development (TO) positively drives income inequality (IE) at medium- and high-frequency, while economic growth (GDP) strongly impacts IE at medium frequency. Similarly, human capital (HDI) negatively influences IE during the same period. Based on these findings, the research suggests helpful lessons for Singapore and emerging countries in reducing income inequality."

Interruptions in international travel have led to the collapse of the tourism-related service industry, which is the backbone of the economies of many small islands and developing states. This paper focuses on the Maldives, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, which is one of the top ten most tourism-dependent economies. Adopting the Solow production function, the paper examines the tourism and economic growth relationship using nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) methodology. The analysis shows that tourism earnings and economic growth have a significant asymmetric relationship. The result further reveals that the magnitude of the negative impact of the decline of a given size in tourism earnings on growth is of much larger magnitude than that of the positive impact of the same size rise in tourism earnings. The negative impact of tourism is found to be more pronounced in the long run. ICT spread, measured by the rise in mobile subscriptions, is positively associated with growth and has emerged as a significant contingent factor. We suggest policy measures to step up the recovery progress and growth."

pub.1126588191,Modeling tourism and fear nexus in G4 countries,"In this paper, we examine whether there is a causal relationship between migration-related fear and tourism. To achieve the objective, a lag-augmented vector autoregressive (LA-VAR) model that generates country-specific causality test results is employed. The period covered extends from 1995Q1 to 2016Q4. To control for omitted variable bias, we include real gross domestic product per capita as an additional variable. Empirical results provide evidence of one-way causality running from migration-related fear to tourism, and neutrality hypothesis is confirmed in the relationship between migration-related fear and economic growth, and between tourism and economic growth. Although the study confirms the fear-induced tourism hypothesis, it however further submits that other determinants such as exchange rates and real gross domestic product are much more important than fear in determining the number of arrivals at a destination."
pub.1158550744,The Nexus between tourism-energy-environmental degradation: Does financial development matter in GCC countries?," Environmental sustainability, energy consumption, and tourism are the most discussed topics in the literature. However, limited studies have catered to the relationship among these variables. From this perspective: the current study aims to find the nexus between tourism, energy alternatives, financial development, and pollution emissions by targeting the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies. We employ the data of six GCC economies for the years 2000–2019 and adopt fully modified ordinary least square and generalized least square approaches to establish the regression. The findings reveal a positive impact on the number of tourist arrivals (ITAs) while a negative impact on tourism receipts on pollution emissions. Similarly, fossil fuel energy (FFE) shows a positive while renewable energy depicts a negative relationship with CO 2 emissions. This positive impact of tourist arrivals and fossil fuel energy was moderated by financial development. In addition to individual analysis, the developed financial sector can help to reduce the negative externalities of ITA and FFE. The empirical analysis further documents the positive impact of all control variables including foreign investment, economic growth, and gross capital formation on CO 2 emissions. Based on empirical results, it is recommended to bring financial development into the picture to reduce the negative impact of ITA and FFE on environmental quality. This study put forward the literature by adding innovative thoughts regarding the moderating role of financial development in the nexus between tourism, energy alternatives, and CO 2 emissions. "
pub.1120373431,Impact of Corruption and Insurgency on Tourism Performance: A Case of a Developing Country,"Insurgency and corruption have consistently remained the bane of economic growth and development of a tourist destination. As such, the impact of corruption indices and insurgency on tourism development in Nigeria is examined by using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. The finding posits a significant long-run relationship of insurgency-corruption indices-tourism receipts nexus. Also, the result reveals that insurgency significantly hampers tourism performance by causing a decrease in the number of tourism arrivals. The impact of corruption on tourism receipts in the long-run depends on the characteristics of the index. For instance, only the social protection and quality of public administration indices exhibit a long-run, positive and significant impact on tourism receipts. The study presents contemporary policy mechanisms to unlock the country’s tourism opportunities."
pub.1182017369,Nexus Between Strategic Sustainable Tourism Investment Projects and Sustainable Growth and Development of Kenya's Coast Region,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between strategic sustainable tourism investment projects and the sustainable growth and development of Kenya's coastal region, focusing on Mombasa and Kwale counties. The study assessed the impact of tourism investments on economic growth, environmental conservation, and social development, with a view of identifying challenges and opportunities for maximizing sustainable tourism benefits. A descriptive research design was employed, and data were collected from 117 respondents representing various stakeholders in the tourism sector, including government officials, private sector investors, and community-based tourism groups. The study utilized both quantitative and qualitative data analysis methods, including descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as thematic analysis of key informant interviews. The results revealed a significant positive correlation between sustainable tourism investments and regional development, demonstrating that these projects contributed to employment creation, infrastructure development, environmental preservation, and community empowerment. However, challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and insufficient government support were identified as key barriers to achieving full sustainability. The study concluded that strategic sustainable tourism investments are critical to the growth and development of Kenya's coastal region, and it recommended enhanced public-private partnerships, increased investment in infrastructure, and stronger policy frameworks to support sustainable tourism initiatives. These findings highlight the importance of stakeholder collaboration in ensuring that tourism contributes to long-term sustainable development.. Keywords The key terms for this study are sustainable tourism, strategic investments, economic growth, environmental conservation, social development, public-private partnerships (PPPs), communitybased tourism (CBT), marine ecosystems, infrastructure development, and thematic analysis."
pub.1050310085,"Effect of tourism on economic growth of Sri Lanka: accounting for capital per worker, exchange rate and structural breaks","We explore the nexus between tourism, exchange rate and economic growth in Sri Lanka over the period 1980–2014. Using the augmented Solow (Q J Econ 70(1):65–94, 1956) framework and the ARDL bounds procedure whilst accounting for structural breaks using Bai and Perron (J Appl Econ 18(1):1–22, 2003) multiple break tests, the short-run and long-run association and impacts are examined. The results confirm the presence of a long-run association between tourism receipts (% of GDP), exchange rate, capital per worker and output per worker. The regression results show a 1% increase in tourism receipts results in a 0.03 and 0.06% increase in output per worker in the short-run and long-run, respectively. A unidirectional causality is noted from tourism to output per worker; from exchange rate to output per worker and capital per worker; and from output to capital, in per worker terms. Finally, we note that although structural breaks periods have negative association with economic growth, they are not statistically significant."
pub.1129807103,Foreign Direct Investment and Tourism Development in Africa,"This study examines the nexus between foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow and tourism development. Using annual data for 44 countries in Africa from 1995 to 2014, and three different specifications of panel autoregressive distributed lag model, the study investigates short-run and long-run dynamics between FDI and tourism development. The study finds a significant positive relationship and a bidirectional long-run causality between FDI inflows and tourism development. In addition, the results show a negative short-run relationship between exchange rate and tourism development. Furthermore, there is evidence that economic growth and political stability are important determinants of tourism development. A major policy implication for African countries is that creating a politically stable environment and sustaining a growing economy help attract FDI inflows to boost tourism development."
pub.1174441508,Exploring energy and tourism economy growth nexus with DEA-based index systems: The case of sustainable development of tourism destinations,"The promotion of sustainable tourism to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals has garnered considerable attention. This paper aims to present a comprehensive analytical framework with data envelopment analysis (DEA) based index systems for examining the interaction between energy and the economic growth of tourism, with a specific focus on tourism destinations within the Yangtze River Delta region of China. The significance of energy in enhancing tourism economy efficiency is established by treating energy input as separable and disposable, while non-energy inputs are considered quasi-fixed. Subsequently, a quasi-fixed energy input directional distance function within the DEA framework has been developed to assess tourism economy efficiency. Furthermore, this paper explores the relationships among environmental pollution, tourism carbon emissions, and tourism economy growth using coupling coordination and decoupling models, respectively. The results indicate that, although improving, there remains a gap for tourism destinations to achieve integrated development between environmental and economic systems. The decoupling type of tourism destinations transitions from expansive negative decoupling to strong decoupling, and the relationship between tourism economic development and tourism carbon emissions tends to be coordinated. This paper provides an empirical study on the measurement of tourism economy efficiency and the relationship between carbon emissions, environmental pollution, and tourism performance. It advances understanding towards implementing sustainable and integrated regional development strategies."
pub.1127474700,Tourism – economic growth nexus. The case of Romania,"The development of tourism is usually associated, in positive terms, with economic development, foreign currency inflows, employment opportunities, infrastructure improvements, sustainable development and poverty alleviation. However, the nature of the tourism-growth relationship is still a matter of academic debate, and, perhaps, an expression of the inconsistencies and contradictions of public policies designed to support this industry. Researchers and practitioners have not yet come to an agreement on a number of fundamental questions: does tourism stimulate economic growth or the converse, and whether the causality, if it does exist, is uni or bidirectional, is constant or can change its direction in the medium - or long run. The present paper investigates the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and international tourism in Romania, over the 1995–2016 period. Our results show that the causal effect of the GDP on the international tourist arrivals and on the international tourism receipts is significant in the long run in Romania. In the short-run, we find a unidirectional causal relationship from the international tourism receipts to GDP, and a bidirectional causal relationship between GDP and the number of international tourist arrivals.

pub.1144236941,Tourism and Development Theory: Which Way Now?,"Tourism has long been explored through the lens of development theory. David Harrison was one of the earlier academics to do so, subsequently turning his attention to critiquing the relevance of such theory to tourism, concluding that although much tourism research has been framed within it, development theory has contributed little if anything to knowledge and understanding of the tourism-development nexus. Recognising David Harrison’s contribution to the field, this paper reviews his critique of development theory as related to tourism before going on to suggest that the increasingly popular notion of degrowth offers an alternative conceptual lens though which tourism and development may be viewed. More specifically, it argues that within the context of the global environmental crisis and the need to address growth-inspired excessive production and consumption, degrowth can be considered a viable approach to or theory of development that demands attention in the context of tourism."
pub.1182198711,"Examining the Nexus between Tourism Investment, Renewable Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions in Indonesia","The tourism industry undoubtedly contributes positively to economic growth. However, numerous studies show that tourism can have diverse impacts on environmental quality. This study focuses on exploring the correlation between investment in the tourism sector, the renewable energy consumption, and the contribution of tourism-related sectors to CO2 emissions within the period 2000 – 2017 using a case study in Indonesia. By employing the distributed lag method with the Koyck approach, this study found that investment in the tourism sector in Indonesia has a statistically positive and significant correlation with CO2 emissions. Conversely, renewable energy consumption, as the control variable, exhibits a significant negative correlation with CO2 emissions. The findings suggest that the existing investment policies in Indonesia are not aligned with environmental sustainability, supporting the pollution haven hypothesis. To address this, the study underscores the need for stronger commitments to transitioning from fossil-based to renewable energy sources, ensuring that future tourism investments contribute to both economic growth and environmental preservation."
pub.1158375685,"An Investigation of Tourism, Economic Growth, CO2 Emissions, Trade Openness and Energy Intensity Index Nexus: Evidence for the European Union","Tourism has become one of the most important sectors in many countries, significantly contributing to their economic growth and development. However, the expansion of tourism has also brought about various environmental and social challenges. The relationship between tourism, economic growth, trade openness, and the environment is diverse and complex. The objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the international tourism development index, GDP per capita, CO2 emissions, trade openness index as well as the energy intensity index in EU 27, over the 1995–2019 period. A composite index for international tourism was developed using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Panel Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach is used to reveal the long- and short-run impact of GDP per capita, CO2 emissions, trade openness index as well as the energy intensity index on the tourism development index. Panel ARDL estimates confirm some of our research hypotheses: at the level of EU countries, there is a short-run relationship between tourism and GDP per capita, but only in a few EU countries, trade openness influences tourism development index. Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test confirms long-run feedback relationship between tourism development index and trade openness, between tourism development index and CO2 emissions, and between tourism development index and GDP and unilateral causality running from tourism development index towards energy efficiency."

                    Purpose
                    Although it is a widely accepted fact that climate change can negatively impact on tourism demand and affect the economies at the socio-economic level, empirical studies on the climate change tourism development nexus has been quite scant, especially for the case of island economies that are heavily dependent on tourism. This study aims to supplement the literature on climate change and tourism by empirically assessing the relationship between climate change and tourist arrivals for the case of 18 small island developing states over the period from 1989 to 2016.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This paper uses dynamic panel data techniques, namely, a panel vector autoregressive framework, which accounts for dynamic and endogeneity issues.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results from the analysis confirm the existence of a significant relationship between climate change and tourism demand in both the long-run and short run. Further analysis shows a bi-directional causality between climatic change and tourism demand while the study also confirms the tourism led growth hypothesis.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications

The research employs a dynamic time series econometrics framework, namely a vector error correction model (VECM), to account for potential dynamic and endogenous relationship in the FDI–tourism nexus. Analysis of the finding shows that FDI has a positive and significant effect, albeit relatively lower compared to the other classical factors of tourism development, in the long run. Interestingly, a bicausal effect is observed in the long run while an indirect link between FDI and tourism development via the economic growth channel is found."

The analysis was performed using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, Philips-Perron test, Engle-Granger cointegration, and Granger causality tests. The results revealed that a long-run equilibrium relationship among variables while there is a disequilibrium in the short run. The estimated error correction term is theoretically acceptable and approximately 5 per cent yearly correction of its disequilibrium in the short run was found. Granger causality test presented a long-run unidirectional causality which is running from tourism to economic growth and thus findings confirm the tourism-led growth hypothesis in Sri Lanka tourism and development spectrum. Therefore, tourism has a significant positive impact on economic activities in the long run. Findings further emphasize that benefits of the economic development must be transferred to the further development of tourism to maintain a bilateral causality which is an important concept in this regard. It provides the rationale for the further development of productive policy strategies to attract more tourists to the country and upsurge visitor expenditures during their stay in Sri Lanka since Sri Lanka has significantly developed its accommodation capacities. Findings further reveal that the tourism sector must be developed parallel to the economic development to boost the growth through tourism. Therefore, all sectors, the government, private bodies, and voluntary organizations must become active partners in this endeavour, and policy implications need the focus of every aspect of enhancing tourism as a growth engine."
pub.1140974764,The implication of technological innovation and tourism development on FDI-growth-environment nexus in Association of Southeast Asian countries: a simultaneity modeling analysis,"This study examines the causal link between foreign direct investment inflows, ecological footprint, and economic growth using panel estimators from five Southeast Asian countries from 1990 to 2017. Results show that technological innovation, ecological footprint, and FDI inflows all have a positive impact on economic growth. Technological innovation and economic growth are both significant and positive determinants of FDI inflows. While FDI inflows, tourism, and the effects of economic growth are all positive factors, they all contribute to Southeast Asia’s ecological footprint. Moreover, we have found two-way causal link between ecological footprint and tourism, technological innovation, and ecological footprint. The results also revealed a one-way causal relationship between FDI inflows, industrialization, technological innovation, and tourist arrivals. Therefore, ASEAN countries are encouraged to foster environmental awareness among travel service providers by incorporating environmental concerns into their operations and activities, such as green restaurants, green hotels, green destinations, and green transportation."

However, the<strong> </strong>relationships between tourism and CO2 emissions are little and unclearly identified. The purpose of the study is to explore the dynamic link between tourism and CO2 emissions in a panel of five high emitters Asian countries covering the period of 1995-2019 by panel-NARDL-AMG. The empirical results reveal that a positive shock in tourism arrivals promotes CO2 emissions, while a negative shock also increases CO2 emissions. Tourism receipts are expected to maintain the robustness of CO2 emissions in long run in Asian economies. The authorities should develop and design green international tourism activities in the Asian economies. </p>"

However, tourism demand is sensitive to many factors, especially the political stability of destination countries. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of political instability on international tourism demand. To this end, this study implied two-dimensional analyses using the gravity model through pooled ordinary least square (POLS) estimator. We pay special attention to tourism demand distribution by employing a data set of 200 destination countries between 1995 and 2020. Our empirical results depict that political instability in destination countries finds a negative effect on international tourism demand. Moreover, a radical decline in GDP is observed in the sub-period of 2006–2020 due to the global financial crisis and its aftershocks, which badly affect tourists' attraction to destination countries. This study offers new insights for tourism policymakers and businesses."

Since then, various diggings have been happening in academia. Amongst them tourism and eco-innovation receives the heap due to its contribution to economic development. The study, thereby, examines the impact of tourism, economic growth and eco-innovation on environmental degradation in China. The secondary data has been extracted from World Development Indicators (WDI) database from 1988 to 2020. The nexus among the variables have been examined using Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (NARDL) model. Findings reveal that international tourism receipts, expenditures and number of tourist arrival, GDP, national income and inflation are positively correlated with environmental degradation, while sustainability-oriented eco-innovation is related negatively in case of China. This study has provided help to the regulators while developing new policies regarding environmental degradation by controlling emissions from economic and tourism development and using sustainability-oriented eco-innovation."

This study examines the causal relationship between terrorism and tourism and economy impact in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Manipur using the asymmetric nonlinear autoregressive-distributed lag (NARDL) approach. The study is an attempt to investigate the ‘tourism–terrorism–economy’ relationship which has hitherto been not widely studied. The estimates based on the Granger causality approach demonstrate that there is causality among terrorism, tourism and economic growth (proxied by state gross domestic products—SGDP) in the short run for all the three study states. The results indicate positive relation between SGDP and tourism in all the three states and between SGDP and terrorism in Assam and Manipur. However, the relation between SGDP and terrorism is negative for Jammu and Kashmir. The results indicate that the relation between the three study variables is highly contextual and cannot be generalized across tourist destinations."

We observed that the nexus between TD and HD for the entire dataset is not highly convincing; TD has an insignificant effect on the human development index (HDI). Furthermore, the nature of the relationship depends on the countries’ current status of development. The study used a threshold regression framework to split the dataset based on per capita GDP, urbanization level, and trade openness, and the results revealed four different situations in the relationship between tourism and HD. The most prominent finding is the U-shaped relationship between tourism growth and human development. We find that the initial stages of tourism growth for low-income countries is not linked to supporting human development. The non-linear panel threshold model's estimation shows that HD on the destination population on account of TD depends on its country-specific characteristics. Therefore, each country needs to develop appropriate tourism and business policies based on their current economic parameter value threshold to promote HD."
pub.1153328009,Nexus Between Tourism Sector Output and Macroeconomic Indicators in Nigeria,"Tourism has become one of the largest export industries worldwide and a key sector necessary for the socioeconomic growth of nations. Tourism’s considerable and recognized roles as a foreign exchange earnings source, employment generation, and public income, amongst others, towards the growth of an economy have drawn much attention. The sector’s performance is somewhat dependent on the macroeconomic variables in an economy. Thus, this study examines the relationship between tourism sector output and macroeconomic variables in Nigeria, covering the period 1991-2020. Tourism sector output proxied by tourism sector contribution to the GDP was employed as the dependent variable. At the same time, interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation rate, and money supply were the independent variables. The autoregressive distributed lag was employed to analyze data for the study. The ARDL’s result cointegration test shows a long-run relationship between the variables employed, and a significant relationship exists between the dependent and independent variables. Based on the findings, the study recommends that interest rate, foreign exchange rate and inflation as they impact the tourism sector’s performance. These variables tend to impact the tourism sector’s performance and, as such, should be monitored and controlled."

We also revisit its situation having the “longest lockdown in the world” and look into iterations of socioeconomic models, business platforms, and other elements that lead to the dream of a postpandemic sustainable tourism industry. In this inquiry, we highlight the importance of elements of the built environment, both at the macroeconomic level and at the micro units of business, civil society, and the tourism sector at large. While there has been a substantive discussion on the nexus of the tourism and built environment sectors, little has been devoted to the challenges these intertwined sectors faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest complementation of practices from the macroscale to the microlevel tourism and built environment sectors, and vice-versa, which will ensure the full complementation of the sectors.

Based on a two-way fixed effects model for a global sample of 100 countries from 2003 to 2020, this study highlights the tourism-CO 2 emissions nexus is negatively moderated by the digital economy. Specifically, while tourism development results in increased CO 2 emissions, our research shows that the digital economy can mitigate this negative impact. Furthermore, heterogeneity analyses reveal that this moderating effect is particularly pronounced in high-income countries. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers in fostering the growth of the digital economy in support of sustainable tourism development. "

Document analysis was adopted to obtain data, this was thematically analysed. The key finding is that military coups are detrimental to tourism. They retard tourism growth by eroding the strides and gains painstakingly made over time through the building of international goodwill. Anholt's hexagon on nation branding is used to suggest strategies that politically disturbed nations can adopt to rejuvenate their tourist destinations."

The growing influx of foreign and domestic tourists has put increasing strain on the island’s natural resources, including its freshwater sources and marine environment. This review chapter addresses conflicts within the tourism–environment–security nexus as a consequence of the increasing resource scarcity associated with the unfettered growth of tourism. This involves a fundamental conflict between economic growth and environmental preservation and – more specifically – between the promotion of the tourism industry and the protection of traditional wet-rice agriculture and cultural heritage. The ongoing transformations of Bali’s communal water management (subak) system and the threat to coastal and marine environments by the controversial Benoa Bay Reclamation Project are particularly highlighted. The authors explore conflicting views over the value of natural resources through a discussion of different approaches to achieving a balance between economic, ecological and socio-cultural goals. This includes investigation of rights-based and polycentric approaches to resource governance as well as attempts to foster qualitative growth through the promotion of ecotourism and other niche markets."

This study investigates the impact of agricultural tourism integration (ATI) on agricultural green total factor productivity (AGTFP) in China, filling a research gap in understanding the complex dynamic nexus. We examine the mediating role of the agricultural industrial structure adjustment index (AISAI) and the threshold effects of ATI and human capital level (HCL) using a panel dataset of 30 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2021. The empirical results reveal three key findings: (1) ATI has a significant positive impact on AGTFP growth; (2) the AISAI partially mediates the relationship between ATI and AGTFP; and (3) ATI and HCL have a double-threshold effect and a single-threshold effect on the ATI-AGTFP nexus, respectively. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of ATI in promoting AGTFP varies across different stages of integration and levels of human capital development. The empirical results contribute to the literature on rural development strategies by providing an in-depth understanding of how ATI influences agricultural productivity and sustainability. Based on these findings, we propose targeted policy recommendations to optimize ATI strategies and invest in human capital to improve the resilience and sustainability of rural economies in China."
pub.1026399939,"Exploring the nexus between tourism, remittances and growth in Kenya","Recently there has been a surge in remittances inflow to Kenya while tourism receipts appears to be declining, albeit gradually. In light of these developments, the paper explores the plausible effects of tourism and remittances on per worker output. We use the annual data over 1978–2010 periods and the ARDL bounds approach within the augmented (Solow in Q J Econ 70:65–94, 1956) framework. The regression results show that tourism has a marginal net negative effect in the short-run however positive effect in the long-run. Remittances, on the other hand, have a net positive effect in short-run and negative effect in the long-run. The key results from the Toda–Yamamoto Granger non-causality (Toda and Yamamoto in J Econom 66:225–250, 1995) results show a unidirectional causation from remittances to output per worker; and from output per worker to tourism. A unidirectional ‘combined effect’ of all variables causing output and remittances, respectively are evident as well. Conclusively, tourism is one of the leading drivers of Kenyan economy. To boost gains from tourism, the sector needs to align policies to the Kenya 2030 strategic framework with significant focus on expanding markets, boosting investment, and growth. Remittances market need to be further developed strategically with the view to improving Kenyan migrant led growth initiatives with plausible links to tourism development."
pub.1132125650,"The Risk of Water, Energy, and Food Nexus under Regional Metabolism for Multi-Sector City","The Urban Nexus system creates another risk characteristic of resource metabolism. Urban metabolism has complex effects from multi-levels and multi-sectors resulted from the changes socio-economic. It is crucial to implement effective urban governance; in particular, resource metabolism creates a new nexus risk by dramatic growth in urban areas. The resource metabolism associates with water, energy, and food consumption on an urban scale that drives the intensity in resource metabolism. Therefore, this study estimates the FEW intensity of the nexus and demand side in material flow analysis by organizing into four categories of resource metabolism, including supply side, process side, demand side, and final sink. This research compares different characteristics for a small island dominated by tourism and a multi-sector city dominated by increasing economic activity. The resource intensity on the demand side and resource service systems are evaluated to identify the nexus intensity and risk for FEW nexus at the urban scale. This study determines that constraints for resource service systems are complex, and suggests that resource consumption intensity is higher in that particular nexus and demand sector. To avoid excessive loads on resource metabolism, sustainable resource management should implement trade-off strategies after analyzing the resource metabolism for urban nexus."
pub.1049735027,Two sides of the same coin: Dutch rural tourism entrepreneurs and countryside capital in Sweden,"This article contrasts Sweden's tourism policy considering sustainable growth and increased employment with experiences and evaluations of Dutch rural tourism entrepreneurs in Sweden. The study employs notions of countryside capital, investigating the effects on Dutch rural tourism entrepreneurs of experiences with Swedish national tourism policy aims and local populations. A tourism-migration nexus occurs where the entrepreneurs are attracted by countryside capital before migration and use this capital in their firms to attract new tourists after migration. Interviewees tell of experiences which frustrate optimal utilization of countryside capital. In combination with flexible attitudes conceptualized as multi-local living and strategic switching, this results in the risk of losing the entrepreneurs' socio-economic impetus for lagging rural areas. The article relates this loss to incomers' rural tourism business transfers after the initial start-up phase and questions the alleged transition from countrysides of production to countrysides of consumption."

The estimated results report a positive nexus between tourism activity and GG at the highest quantiles in the long run. In the end, important policy suggestions are provided for accelerating sustainable GG in China."
pub.1149755611,"Energy intensity, tourism development, and environmental degradation nexus: further evidence from Small Island State in South Asia","The tourism industry is considered as a vital factor of economic growth but its impact on the environment also grabs the attention of researchers. The prime objective of the study is to find the effect of energy intensity and tourism on environmental degradation in the Maldives. For this purpose, energy intensity along with tourism is modelled in the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis context. A long run relationship is established among variables through cointegration technique after it is found that all variables are integrated of order one. Results show that energy intensity is contributing to environmental degradation in not just long run but also in short run whereas tourism leads to environmental degradation in long run while it curbs environmental degradation in short run. This study confirms existence of EKC hypothesis in the Maldives. Causality analysis reveals unidirectional causality from income into carbon emissions and tourism. Policies are recommended for sustainable tourism in the Maldives."

More specifically, we will expand the information base of human development from Sen’s poverty index (S index) to include the human development index (HDI). We noticed in the previous chapter that the S index reveals information regarding the incidence of poverty, how poor is the poor, and how income is distributed among the poor. Incidence, depth, and distribution of income among the poor recounts those among the poor who get more income. The S index provides valuable information with regard to the role of tourism in reaching out to the poor and lifting them out of poverty, as illustrated in the case of Ecuador1."
pub.1174308047,Digital Economy and Regional Tourism Development: The Mediating Role of Information Search from a Spatial Spillover Perspective,"Although studies have confirmed the positive nexus between the growth of the digital economy and regional tourism development, little light has been shed on the mechanism in between. This research made the first attempt to identify the mechanism through which the digital economy affects regional tourism development with consideration of spatial spillover effects using China’s prefecture-level city multisource panel data from 2011 to 2019. The findings reveal that information search is a mediating channel through which the digital economy affects regional tourism development, with significant spillover effects. The spatial spillover effects of the digital economy on regional tourism development become stronger as the distance between cities increases. However, because of competition effects, the information search in neighboring regions may restrict tourism development in the focal region. Results from this study deepen our understanding of the relationship between the digital economy and regional tourism development, thus providing insights for policymakers on regional cooperation in the context of digitalization."

This study investigates the effect of air travel on environmental degradation in BRICS nations. The study used feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) to evaluate the environmental Kuznets curve using data spanning 1995 to 2018. The study finds evidence of N-shaped EKC in the economies of the BRICS nations. We also find a positive relationship between tourism, urbanization, and environmental degradation (as measured by CO2 and SO2 emissions from civil aviation) and a negative relationship between economic development and environmental degradation. To achieve sustainable growth and environmental protection and promote green technology, the BRICS governments should devise policies that address the aviation industry’s short- and long-term needs."

Despite the obvious benefits of tourism, it comes at a high price for the environment in the form of pollution. Brazil's annual tourist influx has the potential to boost economic development and damage the country's ecosystems. The objective of this investigation is to analyze, using time series data ranging from 1990 to 2019, the effects of tourism and economic growth (GDP) on carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in Brazil. The stationarity of the data was examined by employing unit root tests, and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique was used to investigate the link between the factors, taking both the long- and the short-run into consideration. This research shows that there are long-term and short-term ties between Brazil's tourism industry, GDP, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Yet, both tourism and economic expansion have had serious negative effects on Brazil's ecology. These results indicate that in order to maintain environmental quality in Brazil, policymakers need to pursue more eco-friendly economic expansion as well as environmentally conscious tourist regulations.</p>"

pub.1167342841,The role of digital public services in promoting international tourism: empirical evidence from European regions," Purpose The present study investigates a nexus between digital public services (DPS) and international tourism empirically.   Design/methodology/approach This article analyzes the nexus of DPS and international tourism by using the international sample of 23 European countries in the span of nearly 10 years from 2011 to 2019. Various econometric techniques, including the panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) model and the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) model, are employed to confirm the author’s findings. Furthermore, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method is applied to measure the short- and long-run effects of DPS on international tourism developments.   Findings Tourism is positively influenced by digitalization, implying that the enhancement of digital public service usage results in the development of the tourism industry. However, when looking at the effect of DPS in the short term, a negative impact can be found on tourism, as the density reported in the previous analysis stated a negative response to the tourism density. This effect spans the course of several facets, such as international tourism arrivals, international tourism receipt, international tourism, receipts (% of total exports) and global tourism expenditure (% of total imports). Although the result is unfavorable in the short term, digitalization promises great prospects for tourism in the long term. Notably, an improvement in economic growth, financial development as well a reduction in the pervasiveness of corruption and an improvement of environmental quality are transmission channels through which DPS have favorable influences on tourism activities.   Practical implications The author’s findings are vital for managers and policymakers to establish a comprehensive grasp of digitalization's role in deciding tourist adoption. This is because digitalization has been proven to play a role in determining tourism adoption.   Originality/value The present study is the first to examine the relationship between DPS and international tourism empirically. The author is also the first to distinguish the effects of digitalization in the short and long run. "
pub.1154025439,"Toward environmental sustainability: Nexus between tourism, economic growth, energy use and carbon emissions in Singapore","Singapore is a renowned tourist destination; however, the country's rapid economic growth has led to rising energy consumption and carbon emissions. This study aims to examine the factors that contribute to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Singapore, including tourism, economic growth, and energy use. The dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) approach was used to analyze time series data from 1990 to 2020. The results of the empirical study revealed that the tourist coefficient is positive and significant. A 0.50% increase in CO2 emissions relates to a 1% increase in tourism activities over time, according to the findings. In addition, the result indicates that the economy's long-run growth coefficient is significantly negative. This shows that a 1% economic growth will reduce CO2 emissions by 0.03% in the long run. Furthermore, a positive and statistically significant correlation for energy consumption suggests that a long-term increase of 1% in energy consumption is associated with an increase of 0.88% in CO2 emissions. To promote the emergence of sustainable development and a low-carbon economy, this article proposed policy recommendations addressing the reduction of emissions and the promotion of ecologically responsible and sustainable tourism while boosting the utilization of renewable energy technologies."
pub.1124117367,The Nexus Between Seniors' Tourism Expenditure and Well-Being in China,"An examination of the two-way relationship between tourism expenditure and life satisfaction for seniors is undertaken in this article. This examination uses panel data on China's seniors and tracks the same seniors over 3 years. Results show that there is bidirectional causality between tourism expenditure and life satisfaction, casting doubt on previous studies that do not consider this two-way relationship. This empirical relationship highlights the importance of a two-pronged policy strategy— a government policy committed to social tourism programs for seniors who may not be able to afford travel and those who reside in rural areas. Another government strategy is to address aged concerns related to mobility and health to improve well-being and the provision of appropriate facilities for leisure travel. Senior tourism demand was found to be income inelastic and this result means that senior tourism can buffer Chinese economic growth in times of economic crisis and uncertainty, making the twin policy strategy a worthwhile consideration."

Does renewable energy help in achieving carbon neutrality goal?"," Purpose The current study aims to ascertain the association between tourism development, economic growth and environmental quality by using the short-run and long-run autoregressive distributive lag model.   Design/methodology/approach Tourism development has a major role to play in improving a nation’s economic growth. However, it is also blamed for exacerbating environmental pollution because of its massive use of energy (non-renewable energy).   Findings  The major findings of this research show that renewable energy (RE) use and gross domestic product (GDP) negatively impact carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions in South Africa. Tourism arrivals and CO 2 emissions negatively impact GDP, while capital positively impacts GDP in the long run.    Practical implications This research recommends the use of RE, since it reduces carbon emissions, and capital, as it remains the major driver of economic growth.   Originality/value The originality of the current research is that it uses long-period annual time series data from 1971 to 2019 of South Africa, one of the largest tourist nations in Africa. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no studies have examined South Africa in this context and minimal research has been conducted to ascertain the impact of the tourism industry on the environment, despite the accusations directed toward it.

pub.1176084428,"Intricate nexus of FDI, remittances, emigration, tourism and growth: Navigating economic landscape of Croatia","Research background: In Croatia, a small-open and growing economy that lags behind more developed countries, globalisation has had a considerable impact on economic stability. The globalised world economy, characterised by international trade, capital flows and migration, has strongly influenced the economic landscape of Croatia. Although foreign direct investment (FDI) and remittances are fuelling economic growth, emigration poses a major challenge. In addition, the vital tourism sector in Croatia emphasises these relationships and can increase overall economic prosperity. Purpose of the article: The main purpose of this study is to analyse the causal relationships between FDI, remittances, emigration and economic growth in Croatia. In addition, it examines the causal relation between FDI, remittances and tourism growth. Moreover, this study examines the relationships between emigration and FDI, as well as emigration and remittances. Methodology: This study adopted a methodological approach that includes time series analysis and panel data analysis to consider the complexity of this issue in more detail. Specifically, the study applied a two-pronged approach such as time series analysis to investigate the causal relationships between FDI and emigration, FDI and tourism growth, remittances and emigration as well as remittances and tourism growth. In parallel, panel data analysis devoted itself to analysing the subtle inter-relationships between FDI, remittances, emigration and their combined effects on economic growth using the same methodological approach. Findings & value added: Key findings show several causal relationships in the Croatian context: emigration substantially affects FDI, remittances influence emigration patterns, a bidirectional causal relationship exists between FDI and tourism growth and tourism growth boosts remittance flows. FDI boosts economic growth in Croatia, which, in turn, causes the flow of remittances and patterns of emigration. The importance of this study lies in highlighting the potential significance of FDI and remittances, as well as the crucial role of tourism in Croatia while emphasising the potential threat posed by emigration to the Croatian economy. These findings provide a crucial framework for policymakers to design targeted strategies that navigate these inter-connected factors, ensuring sustainable economic growth in similar small, growing economies worldwide."
pub.1172842101,"Global nexus between tourism and sustainable futures: the role of economic growth, globalization and renewables","Focusing on SDG-12, “sustainable consumption and production”, this study investigates the effect of tourism, globalization, economic growth, ICT, renewables, and forest area on domestic material consumption and material footprint in 129 countries from 1995 to 2019. The environmental Kuznets curve has been validated between tourism and domestic material consumption in all income groups like high (turning point: 39.509), upper-middle (turning point: 38.054), and lower-middle (turning point: 32.481) income countries. The Driscoll–Kraay regression shows that domestic material consumption decreases due to an increase in renewable energy (all panels), forest area (all panels), and ICT (high and lower-middle income countries). The increase in domestic materials can be attributed to economic growth (all panels) and globalization (high, lower-middle, and low income countries). The decline in material footprint is driven by tourism (high, lower-middle, and low income countries), renewable energy (low income countries), forest area (high and lower-middle income countries), and globalization (upper-middle income countries). Policymakers could focus on tourism, renewable energy, and forest to control the excessive use of material inputs. Resource efficiency, eco-innovation, and cleaner production are preventative policies, to control the deterioration of the ecosystem. All these measures would lead to a sustainable future.Graphical abstract"
pub.1140715075,How does energy investment affect the energy utilization-growth-tourism nexus? Evidence from E7 Countries," Tourism is an important driver of economic growth for several countries in the world. However, the rise in tourism activities has raised concerns regarding emissions resulting from tourist activities such as transportation as well as the consequent effect on the quality of the environment. Hence, this study examines the impact of tourism and other factors such as investments, energy utilization and economic growth on carbondioxide (CO 2 ) emission in the emerging industrialized seven countries namely (China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia and Turkey) for the period 2000 to 2018. The study uses the Pool Mean Group Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PMG-ARDL), ordinal least square (OLS), dynamic ordinals least square (DOLS) and fully modified least square (FMOLS) estimators as well as Dumitrescu and Hurlin Causality Test. Long run regression estimates reveal that a increase in tourism activities lower carbondioxide emissions in the E7 countries which can be traced to the adoption of environmentally friendly tourism. Furthermore, investment in energy and economic growth, the majority of the regression results point that both factors lower carbondioxide emissions in the emerging seven (E7) countries while energy consumption is a driver of CO 2 emissions in the E7 countries. The study suggests that the implementation of environmentally friendly tourism be sustained to continually improve the quality of the natural environment in the blocs. Similarly, strict regulations of economic activities in line with the protection of the environment are advised while the use of renewable energy is needed to reduce emissions in the E7 countries. "
pub.1148717427,Significance of Air Transport to Tourism-InducedGrowth Hypothesis in E7 Economies,"The study seeks to examine the significance of the tourism-induced growth hypothesis from the perspective of air transportation among seven emerging (E7) countries, including China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, and Turkey. The combined impact of energy consumption and globalization was also factored into the analysis in order to draw cogent implications for environmental quality as energy demand in E7 economies continues to rise amidst growing urbanization in recent times. The study leverages on second-generational panel data estimators, namely cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag, augmented Mean Group, and Dumitrescu-Hurlin Causality techniques. Having established a long-run equilibrium relationship among the outlined variables, the result validates the pertinent role of air transport in enhancing economic growth as a percent rise in airline passengers' arrivals significantly enhances growth in the E7 economies by 0.77%. In addition, the feedback causality between the variables also strengthens the pivotal roles of air transport in economic growth, thereby giving credence to the tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH) in the E7. However, there are detrimental environmental implications for the E7 when considering the causal nexus between economic growth and the dynamics of carbon-inducing energy consumption among the countries. Hence, investments in clean energy and transport infrastructures are recommended to ensure a sustainable environment where the tourism industry can flourish."

pub.1174210669,"Examining the nexus between technological innovation, FDI, economic growth and tourism in selected countries: A simultaneous equation model approach","The current study examines the impact that technological innovation, foreign direct investment, economic growth, and globalization have on tourism in top 10 most popular tourist destinations in the world. The information on the number of tourists, foreign direct investment, growth in gross domestic product, GFCF, use of FFE, and total energy consumption were extracted from the World Development Indicators. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) database was used for collecting the statistics about technological innovation.  The source ETH Zurich has been utilized to gather panel data for the time period 2008 to 2022 to calculate the KOF Index of Globalization. Theoretically, FDI and Economic growth are the endogenous variables for the Tourism model. Whereas, TI, Glob, Energy Consumption, and GFCF are the exogenous variables. Hence, the analysis is based on the System Equation—Simultaneous equations, after checking identification that confirms the problem of simultaneity in system of 3 equations. The empirical outcomes suggest that TI, FDI, globalization index, GDP growth, and energy consumption are the most important factors that contribute to an increase in tourism. Likewise FDI as the endogenous variable is favorably impacted by globalization, technological innovation, fossil fuel energy consumption, gross fixed capital formation, and tourism. Nevertheless, the coefficient of GFCF is only insignificant in the study. While, globalization, TI, and FFE are also favorably affecting the FDI. GDP growth is the second endogenous variable in this research, and it is positively influenced by globalization, FDI, and tourism in the case of the top 10 nations that are most frequently visited by tourists."

This study presents a new perspective on the growth of tourism by considering its impact on conventional energy consumption, real income level, and emission via the channel of globalization. Sequences of econometric tests were conducted to validate the hypothesized claims between tourism development and growth impact on conventional energy consumption and pollution proxy by ecological footprints, globalization GDP per capita, biocapacity, and tourists for the case of France. Empirical evidence from the Granger causality test presents a uni-directional causality from ecological footprints to GDP per capita and from biocapacity to ecological footprints. The correlation matrix shows interrelation amongst series with biocapacity significantly correlating with ecological footprints with tourist’s arrival having a positive correlation with ecological footprints and a negative one with biocapacity. GPD per capita was found to positively affect the ecological footprints and have a negative correlation with biocapacity and a significant relationship with tourists' arrivals. Additionally, globalization exerts a positive impact on ecological footprints, and its effect on biocapacity was found to be negative although globalization's effect on tourists’ arrivals and per capita GDP is significant. The ARDL estimation indicated biocapacity as a neutral agent for ecological footprints, tourist arrivals having a negative impact on ecological footprints, and globalization significantly affecting ecological footprints. From these findings, it is evident that tourism growth has a significant impact on energy consumption and pollution. Policy recommendations were also provided in this study accordingly. "

Nevertheless, the accelerated growth of tourism in various nations might lead to significant environmental consequences due to heightened energy consumption. This surge in energy usage contributes to the exacerbation of global warming through the amplified release of carbon dioxide (CO2). In light of the increasingly evident impacts of climate change on the natural environment, a multitude of endeavors have been undertaken with the aim of attaining ecological sustainability. The objective of this study is to examine the dynamic effects of economic growth, energy consumption, and tourism on carbon emissions in Brazil by analyzing time series data spanning from 1990 to 2019. The stationarity of data was assessed through the application of unit root tests, while an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach was employed to analyze the relationship between the components, accounting for both the long-term and short-term dynamics. The empirical results indicate that a 1% rise in economic growth, energy consumption, and tourist arrivals leads to environmental deterioration by causing a respective increase in CO2 emissions of 1.37%, 1.06%, and 0.57% in the near term, and 0.72%, 0.62%, and 0.16% in the long term.

This study explores the interplay between tourism and these UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, employing a bibliometric analysis of scholarly literature, with findings processed through Iramuteq software. The investigation reveals that academic discourse connects tourism to 13 of the 17 SDGs outlined in the UN’s 2030 Agenda, with a predominant focus on SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth. Notably, the analysis uncovers a discrepancy in the scholarly treatment of SDG 14 – life below water, which, despite being earmarked by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) as a critical area for tourism, receives limited attention, in contrast to SDG 11 – sustainable cities and communities. The study concludes that the academic exploration of the nexus between tourism and the SDGs has been relatively superficial, lacking depth in the context of the broader tourism and sustainability discourse."

The rapid rise of tourism in several nations may have serious environmental effects due to increased energy usage that increases carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and worsening global warming. Due to climate change's growing effects on the environment, several efforts have been made by numerous countries worldwide to achieve carbon neutrality and environmental sustainability. Moreover, effective energy production prediction is crucial to establish an equilibrium between traditional and clean energy sources. However, there is a research gap investigating the environmental impacts of tourism within the framework of energy-economy-environment nexus in Kuwait's context that propelled the development of this pioneering investigation. The present study's objective is to determine how economic growth, energy consumption, and tourism affect carbon emissions in Kuwait. This study analyzes Kuwait's time series data from 1995 to 2019 by using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method that analyzed the components' relationships, allowing for long-term and short-term dynamics. The results show that increasing economic growth, energy consumption, and tourist arrivals increase CO2 emissions in Kuwait. This article proposes policies to achieve carbon neutrality in Kuwait by expanding renewable energy use and promoting sustainable tourism to boost the economy."

Anchoring on the trickle-down theory and the tourism-led growth hypothesis, this study fills this void in the literature based on data for 48 African countries for the period 1996–2020. We provide strong evidence robust to several specifications from the GMM estimator to show that, though unconditionally both tourism development and governance reduce income inequality in Africa, the effect of the former is amplified in the presence of good economic, political and institutional governance. Particularly, we find that control of corruption and political stability are keys for propelling Africa’s tourism sector to contribute to the equalization of incomes across the continent. Policy recommendations are provided in line with SDG 10, and Aspirations 1 and 3 of Africa’s Agenda 2063."

The South African experience of evolving a strong pro-poor focus in LED planning is distinctive in the international context of writings on LED. Pro-poor LED is increasingly the outcome of the application of measures and programmes that are linked to the approach of pro-poor tourism in both rural and urban areas of South Africa. Two studies are presented of Alexandra township, Johannesburg and the Madikwe Game Reserve in North West Province as examples of pro-poor tourism as a form of pro-poor LED. It is argued that the growth of pro-poor tourism initiatives in South Africa suggests that the country is currently a laboratory for the testing and evolution of new approaches towards the planning of LED that potentially will have relevance for other countries in the developing world."

One of the emergent issues associated with tourism industries is the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and the impacts of transformative digital technologies. Globally, it has been rightfully pointed out that digital technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years and are now considered as game-changers for tourism industries. However, although the business-centric view of digital opportunities associated with the 4IR has received significant attention, the policy-centric examination of the 4IR and tourism industries nexus remain under the radar in Australia. This chapter responds to this gap and draws on the three pillars of the Automation Readiness Index (EIU 2018a, b) – innovation, education and employment policies landscapes – in order to explore the challenges and the potential way forward for the AFS sector within tourism industries."
pub.1146904017,Does Good Governance Influence Foreign Tourist Inflows?,"In recent years, tourism has emerged as a key driver of economic growth, as countries are increasingly proactive in improving governance standards to enhance tourism competitiveness in attracting foreign tourists. This article explores the nexus between good governance and international
 tourism in the US during 2008–2019 using the continuous wavelet transform method and maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform method to examine the comovement and lead-lag relationships in the time–frequency domains. We find significant interrelatedness between good governance
 indicators and international inbound tourism indicators in the medium- and long-run frequency domains as the governance indicators like control of corruption, regulatory quality, the rule of law, and voice & accountability substantially affect tourist arrivals. As a robustness measure,
 we provide additional evidence using Indian data. Overall, our results provide strong evidence that good governance matters for foreign tourist inflows, thereby enhancing the tourism competitiveness of the host country. The policy implication is that countries must enhance their good governance
 to boost sustainable tourism competitiveness in attracting tourist inflows."
pub.1165226866,Analyzing the nexus between tourism and CO2 emissions: the role of renewable energy and R&D,"This study aims to investigate the relationship between tourism development, renewable energy consumption (REN), research and development (R&D) expenditure, and CO2 emissions in 12 emerging markets and middle-income Europe spanning 1999–2020. We applied the panel autoregressive distributed lag and the Driscoll–Kraay estimator to determine the relationship between variables. According to both estimators’ results, a U-shaped relationship exists between economic growth and CO2 emissions. This result indicates that the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is invalid in these countries. Furthermore, REN and R&D contribute to decreasing CO2 emissions and stimulating sustainable development. However, the impact of tourism development on CO2 emissions is found to be negative in panel autoregressive distributed lag but positive in the Driscoll and Kraay estimator for fixed and random effects. Moreover, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test reveals a two-way causal relationship between R&D and CO2 emissions and a one-way causal linkage running from economic growth, the square of economic growth, and tourist arrival to CO2 emissions. Overall, our results prove the existence of a relationship between international tourism and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, our results suggest some policy recommendations for policymakers to reduce CO2 emissions through REN, R&D, green economic development, and establishing an ecologically friendly tourism policy."
pub.1141590612,"Investigating the nexus between GDP, oil prices, FDI, and tourism for emerging economy: Empirical evidence from the novel fourier ARDL and hidden cointegration","This study is conducted to investigate the nexus between GDP, FDI, oil prices, and tourism using yearly data from 1995 to 2017. The integration order is investigated by applying the ADF, PP and Zivot and Andrews unit root tests that identify the integration order in the presence of one endogenous break. After identifying the unique order of integration, this study applies the Fourier autoregressive distributed lag model (FADL) to investigate the evidence of a long-run relationship. Moreover, the Maki (2012) test confirms the results of FADL in the presence of multiple breaks. This study also confirms the hidden cointegration among the negative components of the variables using the FADL test. Moreover, oil prices and tourist arrivals have a negative and positive effect on GDP under the symmetric framework. However, the effect of FDI is insignificant. Furthermore, the negative component of oil prices have a negative and significant effect, while negative components of FDI and tourist arrivals have positive and significant effect on GDP under the asymmetric framework. The results of the symmetric and asymmetric causality suggest the existence of a causal relationship from FDI to GDP and tourism. This highlights the importance of FDI that affects GDP and tourism. The findings suggest that more inward movement of FDI promotes tourism using the channel of oil prices and GDP. This study also validates the FDI-led growth hypothesis for Turkey in both symmetric and asymmetric (positive components). This highlights that the Turkish government must promote tourism to attract more FDI by ensuring sustainable development."
pub.1157447293,Does Social Media Moderate the Link Between Tourism and Economic Well-Being? Evidence From the Iterated Gmm Approach,"The relevance of social media to tourism and, subsequently, economic well-being is demonstrable in the target marketing of tourism products and services to potential customers at tourist destinations. Using a dataset from the 40 most visited countries across different continents over the period 2009 to 2020, this study investigates the effect of tourism and social media on economic well-being. It also examines the role of social media as a moderating factor in this relationship. The study adopts the tourism-led growth hypothesis as the main theoretical rationale to explain the underlying relationship between tourism, social media, and economic well-being. The empirical analysis is conducted using the iterated generalized method of moments (GMM). The results show that tourism development helps to promote economic well-being, while social media has a dampening effect. Additionally, the findings indicate that a high level of social media penetration has a significant and positive moderating effect on the nexus between tourism and economic well-being. This suggests that social media-driven tourism can significantly improve the economic well-being of destination countries. Conducive macroeconomic conditions and political stability are also concurrent with the contributory effects of tourism on the economic well-being of destination countries."
pub.1130868457,Locale-varying relationships between tourism development and retail property prices in a shopping destination,"Existing literature has inadequately examined the nexus between tourism and property prices. Additionally, it mainly focuses on hotels and housing, thereby overlooking other property categories (e.g., retail properties). The relationship between tourism development and retail property prices in shopping destinations (e.g., Hong Kong and Singapore) may hinge on the locale. More specifically, the relationship may be different in the tourist precinct or popular tourism shopping area (PTSA) and the unpopular tourism shopping area (UTSA). This study examines locale-varying relationships between tourism development (measured by tourist volume and tourism expenditure) and retail property prices from 2002Q1 to 2014Q4 in Hong Kong using standard and error-correction-model-based (ECM-based) Granger causality tests. Results of standard Granger causality tests indicate that tourism development Granger causes the increase in retail property prices in the PTSA but not in the UTSA. Moreover, results of ECM-based Granger causality tests further verify the robustness and plausibility of the tourism-led growth (in retail property prices) hypothesis in the PTSA. In other words, we find that tourism development measures can be used to better predict changes in retail property prices in the PTSA than simply referring to the price history."
pub.1101882277,The Causal Nexus Between International Tourism and Economic Development,"A bootstrap panel Granger causality test is applied to examine the causal relationship between international tourism receipts and economic growth in China's 12 western regions for the period from 1995 to 2015, accounting for both dependency and heterogeneity across regions. The empirical results of this study support evidence for the growth hypothesis in the regions, such as Guangxi, Tibet, and Shaanxi. A reverse relationship supports evidence on the conservation hypothesis for the regions, such as Chognqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. A reciprocal causal relationship was found in Guangxi and Tibet, whereas the result of a neutrality hypothesis supported 5 of these 12 western regions (i.e., Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang). The empirical findings of this study provide important policy implications for China's 12 western regions."

The study employed Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS) approach to estimate the long-run equilibrium relationships amongst the variables. The results indicate that there is a co-integrating long-run relationship among the studied variables and provide empirical evidence showing that an increase in the growth of infrastructure spending (GINFR) 1 unit leads to an increase in the growth of GDP (GGDP) by 0.374 unit, an increase in the tourism revenues (TR) 1 unit leads to increase in the growth of GDP (GGDP) by 0.155 unit, and an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) 1 unit leads to an increase in the growth of GDP (GGDP) by 0.055 unit. What distinguishes this paper is that it is one of the rare studies that went beyond the short effect of mega-events on the host country and investigated the long-term economic impact of the most important macro variables associated with mega-events on economic growth.   Doi: 10.28991/esj-2021-01323 Full Text: PDF"

pub.1173929971,"Is there a conservation relationship between tourism, economic output, and forest areas?","Abstract This study employed advanced panel data analysis, accounting for cross‐sectional dependence and heterogeneity, to investigate the impact of tourism development and economic output on forest areas in major international tourist markets. The research was guided by forest transformation hypothesis (FTH). The study assessed the validity of FTH, examined the influence of tourism, and identified the income level at which a turning point occurs. The results revealed a heterogeneous impact of tourism on forested areas across major international tourist markets. Specifically, tourism development encouraged afforestation in Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but led to deforestation in China. In contrast, no significant relationship was observed between the tourism‐forest area nexus in Türkiye and Thailand. Additionally, the study provided evidence supporting FTH in the relationship between economic growth and forested areas in Italy, Spain, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Given these findings, the paper underscores the strong heterogeneity among the individual countries and their tourism, economic development, and forest areas. Consequently, country‐specific sustainable policies are advocated over generic approaches in the fight against deforestation."

Given the present growth trajectory of the tourism industry, we examine the selected South Asian countries' tourismrenewable energy nexus. Design - We obtain data (1995 to 2018) from the World Bank (2018) and the BP Statistical Review of World Energy (2018). Methodology - Second generation cointegration tests were conducted to verify the cointegrating relationship. DCCE and ARDL-PMG methods were used for long-run estimation. DumitrescuHurlin panel causality test was conducted to check long-run causalities. Finally, Variance Decomposition analysis was used to assess the effect of tourism on REs in the future Findings - Tourism and renewable energy consumption are positively associated in the long-run. Unidirectional causalities are observed from tourism to renewable energy uses at both the aggregate and disaggregate levels. Furthermore, tourism can significantly explain the predicted variation in the use of different renewable energies for the next 15 years. Originality - To our knowledge, this is the first study conducted to analyse the relationship between tourism and renewable energy consumption at both aggregate and disaggregated levels in South Asia. We also propose tourism-friendly renewable energy policies that may be key for continuing sustainable tourism development in the selected South Asian countries."
pub.1165298595,TOURISM GROWTH AS A DRIVER OF MIGRATION PATTERNS: EVIDENCE FROM CROATIA,"Purpose – This research investigates to what extent local economic growth driven by tourism was able to prevent emigration from local areas. The relative economic prosperity of the Western Member States is considered to have had a large pull effect on immigrants following the enlargement of the EU to Central and Eastern European states. A similar pattern has been established in Croatia, where a mass exodus of the population has been recorded in the years following the 2013 EU Accession. Methodology – To do so, we use the newly released Population Census data from 2021, along with data from the earlier Census, to create a panel dataset of all municipalities and cities in Croatia and estimate the role of tourism. These data sources overcome the measurement errors in previously available annual migration data from the Ministry of Interior and allow for a more disaggregated analysis using detailed variables on the age and sex profile of citizens. We estimate a linear regression model using Ordinary Least Squares with the difference in population change as the dependent variable and measures of tourism development as the independent variable. Findings – We find evidence that the size of tourism is negatively associated with the size of emigration from the local area. We then investigate the mechanisms behind the relationship between local tourism growth and emigration, testing whether tourism is more correlated with emigration of younger or older individuals, men or women. Contribution – This paper is the first to shed light into the empirical nexus between tourism growth as the cause of the retention of population. Policy wise, it gives important insights into understanding how economic opportunities are key for individuals’ decision to emigrate that could be relevant for policymakers interested in ways to retain local populations. Finally, methodologically, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first research to explore migration patterns using the 2021 Census."
pub.1125428043,"The Nexus Between Agriculture and Tourism in the Island of Crete, Greece","The relationship between agriculture and tourism in the island of Crete, Greece has been studied. Both agriculture and the tourism industry contribute more than 50% in the Gross Domestic Product of the island. The linkages between agriculture and tourism in many tourism-dominated communities and rural areas worldwide have been reviewed. The current status of agriculture and the tourism industry in Crete has been examined as well as the agro-tourism development in the island during the last few decades which is considered a typical example of agriculture-tourism cooperation. The healthy tasty Cretan diet is based on locally produced food ingredients and it is famous all over the world. Therefore, it could be further promoted by the tourism industry in the island. Increased use of local gastronomy could improve the competitiveness of the Cretan tourism industry which is currently based on mass tourism and the “sea, sun and sand” model. This could be a springboard to the local agricultural production of the island to partly cover the demand for catering in the tourism industry. Various new policies and measures are required for increasing the linkages in these two sectors. The use of locally produced agricultural products would replace foodstuff transported to the island from long distances, reducing the carbon emissions due to their transportation. Strengthening the linkages between agriculture and tourism in Crete would trigger growth in both sectors, offering many economic, social and environmental benefits to the island."
pub.1135287023,Analysing the relationship between foreign real estate investment and tourism development,"The primary aim of this research is to analyse the effect of Foreign Real Estate Investment (FREI) on tourist development using a panel dataset of 33 countries over the time period 2000–2016. Given the potential dynamic and endogenous relationship in the FREI-Tourism development nexus, this paper employs a Panel Vector Error Correction Model (PVECM) and a comparative analysis is further conducted by segregating the sample into sub-samples of developed and developing countries. The empirical results indicate that FREI is positively significant, although to varying extent, in explaining tourist growth. There is also evidence of reverse causality, as tourism is observed to also affect FREI in a positive and significant way, at least in the long run. This study is believed to contribute to the debate by bringing additional evidences in the developing countries context while also analysing the link between tourism development and FREI in a comparative setting of developed countries and developing countries."
pub.1127233623,More or Less Sustainable? Assessment from a Policy Perspective,"Sustainability of tourism destinations has become the main focus in planning and managing tourism development. Despite existing legislation and an institutional framework to safeguard balanced tourism growth, many destinations fail to properly address it. So far, studies are limited in exploring sustainable tourism impacts from a policy perspective. This study follows previous ones in using the triple bottom line sustainability approach to define tourism impacts. It argues, in particular, for a nexus between understanding of policy perception and sustainability, and it applies this to tourist destinations in Serbia to determine whether they are operating sustainably. For this purpose, the data were collected using a combination of multiple methods, involving interviews with policymakers and content analysis of strategic documents. This study further suggests a model that assesses the extent of the sustainability of tourist destinations. The results illustrate the importance of understanding policy perceptions in shaping and facilitating sustainability and informing policy enablers on how to improve and reform current tourism development. The model can be adopted and applied to any tourist destination facing an inevitable need to re-shape their tourism development plans and policies, while the implications address the need to build a participative policy approach to sustainable tourism development."

This study delves into the 'aquaculture tourism' concept by exploring the symbiotic relationship between pearl farming and tourism in Lombok, focusing on the critical role of Public Relations (PR) in amplifying this nexus. Through consultations with multiple stakeholders, this research identifies the power of PR to craft a compelling narrative surrounding the unique qualities of Lombok's pearls, emphasizing their origins and sustainable farming practices. Key findings suggest that strategic PR can bridge the understanding between tourists, local communities, and industry stakeholders, by fostering two-way communication. The emphasis on sustainable and harmonized practices resonates with global sustainability trends, positioning Lombok as a model for integrating luxury with eco-conscious tourism. This research is a template for regions looking to balance economic growth with environmental responsibility, advocating for a future where luxury and sustainability coexist harmoniously."
pub.1167317012,Examining the tourism-induced environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for India,"This paper revisits the debate on the possible impact of tourism sector development on carbon emissions using annual time series data from 1980 to 2019. The present study is a pioneering attempt to estimate the threshold point for tourism-induced environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for India. For this purpose, the autoregressive distributive lag model and block-exogeneity Granger non-causality test have been employed. The empirical results confirm a long-run cointegrating relationship between tourist sector development, real GDP per capita, energy consumption, urbanization and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in India. The results also indicate a positive and significant association between the tourism sector, economic growth, and carbon emissions in the long run and support the tourism-induced EKC hypothesis in India. Further, the study finds a long-run and short-run causal nexus between the variables. The findings also emphasize the need to rely less on the use of fossil fuels and instead transition to green energy production in the tourism industry. Given the size of the tourism industry in India, such practices would make a meaningful contribution to inclusive and sustainable development in the country."

Design/methodology/approach The study uses a variety of time series procedures, including the bounds test, Granger causality test, impulse response functions and generalized variance decomposition to analyze the relationship between monthly tourist arrivals (TA) to the USA, real gross domestic product (GDP) and real effective exchange rates.   Findings Results suggest that GDP Granger causes TA in the USA in the long run, indicating the economy-driven tourism growth hypothesis. Additionally, a shock to GDP generates a positive and significant effect on TA that persists in the long-run, while exchange rate shocks only have a significant effect in the first six months.   Research limitations/implications Different tourism sectors may exert different degrees of influence on the economy. The use of aggregate data on TA in the analysis assumes homogeneity in the industry, thus, only represents the average relationship between tourism and GDP.   Practical implications This study provides insight that shapes the investment, marketing, sustainability decisions of the public and private sectors aim at increasing tourist flows to drive economic development at the national, state and local levels.   Originality/value Though several studies have examined the factors influencing the international tourist demand of the USA, this is the first to investigate the causal relationships between tourism, GDP and exchange rates for the USA. It is also the first in the US tourism literature to account for the nature of interactions between the three variables because of innovations in the system. "
pub.1151449392,Towards sustainability: Dynamic nexus between carbon emission and its determining factors in Mexico,"Global climate change, aggravated by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly emissions from carbon dioxide (CO2), poses significant threats to the environment, development, and sustainability. Mexico is a prominent tourist country experiencing continuous economic growth, rapid urbanization, and agricultural productivity which is causing higher energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The current research explores the dynamic effects of economic growth, fossil fuel energy use, renewable energy use, urbanization, tourism, and agricultural productivity on CO2 emissions in Mexico. Time series data from 1990 to 2019 were analyzed using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) method. According to the estimations, a 1% rise in economic growth, fossil fuel energy use, urbanization, and tourism will raise CO2 emissions by 0.45%, 1.77%, 0.10% and 0.04%. Furthermore, a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption and agricultural productivity may result in reductions in CO2 emissions of 0.66% and 0.20%. This article put forward policy recommendations in the areas of low-carbon economy, promoting renewable energy use, sustainable urbanization, eco-friendly tourism, and climate-smart agriculture which would ensure environmental sustainability by reducing emissions in Mexico."

pub.1158101937,Impact of water–tourism–ecosystem nexus on the sustainable development of eco-city,"Abstract
                  Tourism places substantial stress on regional land use that can lead to ecological deterioration, greater pollution, destruction of natural habitats, and increasing threats to species already in danger of extermination. Improved quality of life is made possible through the Fuzzy Hamacher Correlated Geometric (FHCG) method to observe the growth of multiple attributes in a water-based leisure tourism eco-city. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, land use maps, and an executive segment satellite image are the main areas of attention for eco-cities as the main focus, which are supported by ecology and environmental space. Hence, FHCG-GIS has designed an environmental carrying capacity in eco-cities that can be increased through tourists who can be accepted in a specific location to fulfill the needs of water tourism, help the destination sector, protect the environment, and reduce the effect. A sensible outcome for evaluating the planning conditions in an eco-city can be found in the estimated indicators of water leisure tourism environmental carrying capacity, predicated on an analysis of scenic geographical resources and tourism economic conditions, and the results of the scenic area's integrated limits using barrel extrapolation."
pub.1174693244,Sports Tourism,"The domain of sports tourism occupies a central position in contemporary discourse, embodying a complex nexus of cultural, economic, and marketing influences. Originating from ancient civilizations and epitomized by events like the Olympic Games, has evolved into a global phenomenon with enduring cultural and societal significance. This study employs an analytical approach to explore the foundational principles and operational facets of sports tourism, emphasizing its pivotal role in facilitating cultural exchange and driving economic development. The symbiotic relationship between sports and tourism manifests prominently in the organization and promotion of sporting events, which not only stimulate economic growth but also contribute to community welfare by generating revenue, enhancing infrastructure, and fostering employment opportunities, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, the intersection with sports marketing enables brands to capitalize on unique sporting assets, enhancing consumer engagement and destination promotion. In essence, sports tourism represents a dynamic convergence of culture, economics, and marketing, offering significant avenues for academic exploration and practical implementation. By leveraging the synergies between sports and tourism, stakeholders can effectively harness the sector׳s full potential to foster socio-economic advancement and deliver enriching experiences on a global scale."
pub.1145282117,TOURISM DEMAND AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN VIETNAM: FRESH INSIGHTS BASED ON THE PARTIAL AND MULTIVARIATE WAVELET APPROACHES,"This study aims to examine the interaction among tourism revenue (TOV), the real exchange rate (REX), and economic development in Vietnam throughout 1995–2019. Using the bivariate and multivariate wavelet frameworks, we examine the lead–lag connectedness, co-movement and dynamic associations between these indicators across various time and frequency domains. By doing so, we employ wavelet transform coherence (WTC), cross-wavelet transform (XWT), partial wavelet coherence (PWC) and multiple wavelet coherence (MWC) frameworks. The findings indicate low covariance but a positive and robust nexus between tourism demand (TOV), economic growth (gross domestic product (GDP)), and the REX in the time–frequency space. In the long run, interdependence between variables is primarily negative and weak. The outcomes of PWC and MWC reveal that REX and GDP determinants affect the TOV–GDP and TOV–REX relationships under different frequencies, respectively. These results are of interest and significance to the Vietnamese government and policymakers as the outcomes have important implications for informing their decision-making."
pub.1110780075,Role of Financial Sector Development as a Contingent Factor in the Remittances and Growth Nexus: A Panel Study of Pacific Island Countries,"Except for emergencies and for technical assistance for raising skills and institution building, foreign aid to Pacific island countries (PICs) for budgetary support has been phased out since the late 1990s. Because of the small sized domestic markets, foreign direct investment (FDI) is small and is confined to development of tourism infrastructure. On the other hand, inward remittances received from the rising number of islanders migrating overseas for work are increasing, far exceeding aid and FDI. However, influence of remittances on economic growth depends on financial sector development (FSD) for mobilizing the savings from the remittance receipts for domestic investment. This paper assesses the role of FSD in the nexus between remittances and economic growth through a panel study of five major PICs, namely Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu.  The study findings show that the ongoing efforts for strengthening FSD have to be stepped up by focusing on financial inclusion through spread of branchless banking and promotion of  information and communication technology."

The study delves into the phenomenon of ‘revenge tourism’ and its far-reaching implications, emphasising the boomerang effects it triggers. This study proposes conceptual framework that examines the boomerang effects of revenge tourism (economic, environmental and social) and explores their relationship with the SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG14 (Life below water). The study finds that the boomerang effects of revenge tourism positively impact all three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It establishes a positive relationship between ‘tourism demand’ (RT1) and its ‘economic impact’ (BE1), along with a positive connection between ‘travel behaviour’ (RT3) and both its ‘environmental impact’ (BE2) and ‘social impact’ (BE3). Additionally, a positive effect of ‘destination image’ (RT2) on ‘travel behaviours’ (RT3) is observed. This underscores the tourism industry's inherent capacity to navigate and mitigate economic repercussions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The study concludes by emphasising that while COVID-19 is temporary, sustainability implies permanence through optimal resource utilization and maximising benefits for conservation and local communities.

This study aims to investigate the dynamic impacts of economic growth, energy use, urbanization, and tourism on CO2 emissions in Singapore. Time series data from 1990 to 2019 were utilized by employing the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) approach. The DOLS findings show that the long-run coefficient of economic growth is negative and significant, indicating that a 1% rise in economic growth will result in a 0.99% reduction in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the coefficient of energy use is positive and significant which reveals that an increasing 1% of energy use is linked with a rising of 0.52% CO2 emissions in the long run. In addition, the long-run coefficient of urbanization is positive and significant, implying that rising urbanization by 1% causes a 1.90% increase in CO2 emissions. Moreover, the coefficient of tourism is positive and significant, which specifies that an increase in tourism activities by 1% is associated with a 0.45% increase in CO2 emissions in the long run. The estimated results are robust to alternative estimators such as ordinary least squares (OLS), fully modified least squares (FMOLS), and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). Furthermore, the pairwise Granger causality test was utilized to capture the causal linkage between the variables. This article put forward policy recommendations toward environmental sustainability by establishing strong regulatory policy instruments to reduce environmental degradation."
pub.1139030284,Baby-boomers hitting the road: the paradoxes of the senior leisure tourism,"An increasing growth of older people has caused significant socioeconomic transformations for almost all sectors of society, including the tourism industry. In the last decades, older adults have become an important target group for the leisure tourism market on a global scale. It is estimated that older individuals, especially the representatives of the baby-boom generation, will be responsible for a relatively large share of all holiday spending, and that senior tourism will become the fastest and biggest potential driving force in the hospitality markets. Yet, senior tourism is still a marginal branch in aging and tourism studies. This article aims to address this gap by highlighting the complex nexus of recreational later-life mobility, active engagement and successful aging. It interrogates whether the senior tourism market liberates and empowers older adults, or further perpetuates age-related inequalities and reinforces consumerist pressures and the ideals of a good old age. To answer this question, it sheds light on the positive aspects of leisure travels in later life, such as an enhanced sense of well-being, happiness and psychological health. As a counterargument, the article shows how the senior leisure market, constructed around neoliberal Western notions of successful aging, further deepens discrimination among older adults."

To become competitive within the attraction sector there is a need to have a combination of attractions, like sightseeing, shopping, entertainment, gaming, culture and recreation and these plays an important role in determining the competitiveness of a destination. The increase in tourist activity creates an environment where all stakeholders within the tourism system have an opportunity to exercise their function in the most appropriate way. This however does not occur without challenges and clearly, from general observations, the Tourism sector is faced with several challenges in Durban such as the lack of synergy between the stakeholders within the tourism system; standards and quality between various groups differ which impact on service delivery, price structure and foreign expectations; sustaining a high cost capital and labour intensive industry throughout the year; domestic tourists having to compete with currency fluctuations; and the social, political, economic and technological challenges. The development of a competitive model would contribute to tourism sustainability, which is vital for the economy, growth and further development of the Tourism sector in Durban, South Africa."

Holding the importance as one of the leading contributors to economic growth, and accommodating a large percentage of the labor force, this study has investigated the impact of Covid-19 on the tourism economy of Beijing (the capital of China), which is one of the leading tourist destinations of China. For this purpose, primary data with 385 sample sizes have been collected via random sampling techniques from the tourism-related respondents. This data has been analyzed using the simple descriptive analysis, graphical estimations, and categorization techniques. The findings of the study show that Covid-19 exerts a negative influence on the tourism and hospitality sector. Specifically, a reduction in the international tourists' arrival has reduced revenue generation, indirectly reducing the contribution to the GDP by many factors. These factors include an increase in the unemployment ratio, cut-off salaries, increases in expenditures, and a decline in the tax payments. However, lack of adequate response from the government in the context of the tourism sector has further fueled the adverse outcomes of Covid-19, leading the industry to a shut-down condition for most firms in this geographical area."

Water, both fresh and salt, is directly or indirectly implicated throughout the SDGs, and tourism both depends on clean water and exacerbates water problems. However, there has been limited discourse that maps water-centric knowledge and its relationship to the SDGs within the sustainable tourism literature. This bibliometric analysis, consequently, draws on a database of 220 relevant journal articles to identify affiliated themes and assess their relationship to the SDGs. Findings categorise the knowledge base into three first order themes, with water situated respectively as resource, attraction and hazard. This literature indirectly supports the Agenda through specific SDGs of poverty eradication (#1), sustainable economic growth (#8), and sustainable consumption (#12). Direct links occur between the themes and specific SDGs, as with resource (#6, sustainable management of water for all), attraction (#14, life beneath the sea) and hazard (#13, climate change action). Future research in the tourism and water nexus should consider deeper engagement with priorities as outlined in the SDGs."

Many researchers have investigated the link between tourism and CO 2 emissions, but there is no clear picture as the results are contradictory. This study is an attempt to compliment the literature related to tourism and environmental quality.    Design/methodology/approach The study adopted the autoregressive distributed lagged (ARDL) model to investigate the short- and long-run estimates simultaneously. The study further applied Granger causality to find out the direction of causalities. To arrive at long-run robust estimates, the study used dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) model.   Findings  The results found that tourist receipts have no significant impact on environmental quality, while growth and energy consumption are the main determinants of CO 2 emissions in Pakistan. The Granger causality test confirmed unidirectional causalities from GDP and energy consumption toward CO 2 emissions, while tourist receipts do not affect environmental quality. DOLS technique confirmed the long-run estimates of ARDL model.    Research limitations/implications The result of the study complements the literature by adding new evidence regarding the nexus of tourism and environment. Findings of the study are important for policymakers and regulatory bodies to place their focus on the development of tourism sector (services sector) rather than energy-intensive manufacturing activities to sustain the growth of the country in higher quartiles, as tourism receipts have no significant negative externalities toward environment, while energy use is one of the key determinants of environmental degradation.   Originality/value  This study used time series data over the period 1980-2016 for Pakistan to inspect the dynamic relationship between tourist receipts, economic growth, energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.

pub.1147661878,Renewable energy and transitioning towards sustainable tourism: Inferences from kernel density and nonparametric approach,"This study considered a panel of twenty countries characterized by tourist glut to investigate the role of renewable energy towards sustainable tourism transition. We used a nonparametric kernel density approach to facilitate the analysis and examine the distributional dynamics; besides, using a nonparametric quantile regression approach to trace nexus through different strata. Kernel density estimates reflect multimodality character across the countries. Quantile estimates reveal the negative impact of economic growth on carbon emissions across all quantiles. The coefficient of the international tourist arrival is positive and significant in lower quantiles; nevertheless, it turns out to be negative at higher quantiles implying tourist arrivals reduce carbon emissions. Non-renewable energy consumption positively affects carbon emissions but negatively impacts international tourist arrivals. On the other hand, renewable energy consumption negatively affects carbon emissions but affects the international tourist arrivals positively. This study intends to guide policymakers to hold back fossil fuel dependence for sustainable tourism."

Consequently, reducing emissions and improving environmental conditions are now a global priority for promoting sustainable growth and preventing the adverse consequences of global warming and climate change. However, there is a paucity of research employing econometric methodologies to investigate the potential of emission reduction factors, particularly in the case of the Philippines. Thus, the present study explored the dynamic effects of economic growth, renewable energy use, urbanization, industrialization, tourism, agricultural productivity, and forest area in the Philippines in order to accomplish environmental sustainability by lowering CO2 emissions. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach and the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) methodology were used to scrutinize time series yearly data from 1990 to 2020. According to the estimates, a 1% rise in economic growth, urbanization, industrialization, and tourism will raise CO2 emissions by 0.16%, 1.25%, 0.06%, and 0.02% in the Philippines, respectively. Furthermore, a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption, agricultural productivity, and forest area may result in CO2 emissions reductions of 1.50%, 0.20%, and 3.46%, respectively. Furthermore, the pairwise Granger causality test was employed to capture the causal relationships between the variables.

Moreover, testing of tourism-induced environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is included in the analysis in terms of transportation sector-based pollution. The U-shaped correlation between economic growth and transportation sector-based emissions in all quintiles is revealed, as well as tourist arrivals are found to increase emissions up to higher quintile levels. At lower quantile levels, an increase in tourist arrivals increases the emission level by approximately 0.06%, while at medium quantile levels this positive effect is approximately 0.07%. This result indicates the necessity of considering emissions from the transportation sector in the tourism-induced EKC for new policy insights. In addition, the findings highlight the environmental impacts caused by tourism through the prism of transportation sector."
pub.1172116164,Sustainable Tourism in India: An Integrative Approach for Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation,"In recent decades, the concept of pro-poor tourism has emerged as one of the integral mechanisms that benefit the poor and the underprivileged sections of society. Eradication of poverty is a top priority of human development that is mentioned in the United Nations (UN) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Given the expansion of the tourism industry at present in India, the sustainability of this sector is significant, particularly in the rural and remote areas for the facilitation of income-generating opportunities to these vulnerable sections of society at large. The present research study aims to find out the various factors that determine the growth and expansion of the Indian tourism industry and to evaluate how such factors correlate with the alleviation of poverty in India. A panel regression is fitted to find out the nexus between the growth and expansion of the tourism industry in India and its impact on poverty alleviation standards. The selected dimensions, viz. number of tourists visited, per capita income at the state level, index of poverty as measured by headcount ratio, inequality index measured by GINI coefficient, economic specific variables such as literacy rate and infant mortality rate, and state of instability in states measured as by frequency of incidence of crimes in the region are being employed in the study. The estimated model reveals that the effects of tourism development have significant and bountiful outcomes in reducing poverty in India during the study period 2005–2018, as indicated by the estimated coefficient value of (−0.0655), controlling for the selected economic and state/region-specific variables."
pub.1150650677,"Hell Is Empty, and All the Devils Are Here: Nexus between Toxic Leadership, Crisis Communication, and Resilience in COVID-19 Tourism","Sustainable travel has been redefined by the pandemic, as tourism destinations continue their struggle to stay resilient and vibrant. The COVID-19 crisis has fueled a lackluster performance and declined tourism growth worldwide while imposing serious threats to employees’ resilience across the globe. However, little is known about the interaction between the global tourism crisis and employees’ resilience in toxic leadership environments. To augment the existing understanding of the way employee resilience unfolds to respond to a crisis under toxic leadership, we draw on predictive research involving the UAE tourism industry. The UAE’s economy was forced to shrink largely due to its long-lasting dependency on inbound tourism. Hence, the study data were collected from 412 employees working in the hospitality and tourism industry in the UAE. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the impact of toxic leadership on crisis communication and employees’ resilience in the UAE’s tourism industry. The results showed that both employee resilience and crisis communication are negatively influenced by toxic leadership in COVID-19 tourism. Furthermore, crisis communication positively influences employee resilience, and significantly mediates its relationship with toxic leadership. Interestingly, the findings suggest that the toxic work culture constantly blurs the lines of communication, and, ultimately, the contagious behavior of toxic leaders overwhelms the resilience of employees while they respond to a crisis. The theoretical and practical implications of this research are not confined to toxic leadership; however, the strategies to nurture crisis communication and employee resilience for sustainable tourism are presented in an evolutionary perspective based on the conservation of resources theory."

The perception of international tourists about security measures and risks is a key factor affecting destination choices, tourist flow and overall satisfaction. Thus, we investigate the impact of armed forces personnel, prices, economic stability, financial development and infrastructure on tourism.   Design/methodology/approach This research used data from 130 countries from 1995 to 2019, which were divided into four income groups. This study employs a two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) technique and a novel tourism index comprising five relevant indicators of tourism.   Findings A 1% increase in armed forces personnel expands tourism in all income groups – 0.369% High Income Countries (HICs), 0.348% Upper Middle Income Countries (UMICs), 0.247% Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and 0.139% Low Income Countries (LICs). The size of the tourism-safety coefficient decreases from high to low-income groups. The impact of inflation is significantly negative in all panels, excluding LICs. The reduction in tourism was 0.033% in HICs, 0.049% in UMICs and 0.029% in LMICs for a 1% increase in prices. The increase in the global tourism index is more in LICs (0.055%), followed by LMICs (0.024%), UMICs (0.009%) and HICs (0.004%) for a 1% expansion in the gross domestic product (GDP)/capita growth. However, the magnitude of the growth-led tourism impact is greater in developing countries. A positive impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow was found in all panels like 0.016% in HICs, 0.050% in UMICs and 0.119% in LMICs for a 1% increase in FDI inflow. The rise in the global tourism index is 0.097% (HICs), 0.124% (UMICs) and 0.310% (LMICs) for a 1% rise in the financial development index. The increase in the global tourism index is 0.487% (HICs), 0.420% (UMICs) and 0.136% (LICs) for a 1% rise in the infrastructure index.   Research limitations/implications Empirical analysis infers important policy implications such as (a) establishment of a peaceful environment via recruitment of security personnel, use of safe city cameras, modern technology and law enforcement; (b) provision of basic facilities to tourists like sanitation, drinking water, electricity, accommodation, quality food, fuel and communication network and (c) price stability through different tools of monetary and fiscal policy.

By recruiting 466 tourists who had stayed in Airbnb accommodation in Istanbul, Turkey via travel-related Telegram, Twitter, travel blogs, and Facebook groups, this study revealed the importance of the platform and its features in enhancing service attractiveness, perceived authenticity and experience. Furthermore, the results revealed that visitors’ experiences have an influence on Airbnb likability, where Airbnb likability influences their intention to re-visit and to recommend. Significant implications for tourism planning, management and researchers are highlighted."
pub.1121860477,Over-tourism and sustainable consumption of resources through sharing: the role of government," Purpose Over-tourism signifies the dilemma of managing tourism growth in cities. With growing media sensationalism and an oversimplification of the phenomenon of over-tourism, its academic theorization has become extremely important. Using Macau, a Special Administrative Region of China as a case in point, the purpose of this paper is to theoretically explore the nexus between over-tourism and sustainable consumption in cities, highlighting governments’ inevitable role in this successful convergence.   Design/methodology/approach The study is based on a selective systematic literature review (SLR) of existing studies in the form of both news material and academic journals. It investigates the growing concern of over-tourism and the contribution of sustainable consumption grounded in strong political support. It also adopts a case study approach with specific reference to Macau.   Findings The general overview of the literature provides evidence of an age-old concept that has re-emerged to make local residents’ voice more pronounced. Generally, the studies concentrate on understanding residents’ attitudes, the perceived impact of over-tourism, community resilience and sustainable strategies to tackle the problem. Most popular studies are recent (i.e. 2018 and beyond) and empirically set in developed cities of Europe.   Research limitations/implications The SLR used in the current study requires further empirical testing to validate some of the proposed concepts in the literature.   Practical implications The study highlights the role of government in ensuring that sustainable consumption is sustainably implemented in the context of over-tourism.   Originality/value Given the re-emergence of over-tourism, yet with few theoretical discussions on the concept, this study serves as a knowledge-base for future studies both empirically and theoretically.

The narrative “Economic Structure”—services, manufacturing, and agriculture—has been on a secular decline overshadowed by the “Structural Reforms”—competitiveness, transparency, and governance. We observe the rise and fall of the “Washington Consensus”—privatization and liberalization—and the rise to dominance of the “Washington Constellation,” a collection of many disparate terms such as productivity, tourism, and inequality. We interpret these changes through the lens of a nexus of the changing pool of economic ideas, the power structure within organizations, and the shocks that trigger a shift of narratives and their translation into policies."

Since very few literatures discuss about the nexus of income, energy consumption, FDI, trade, tourism, and environment using panel data in ASEAN, this research tries to fill that gap. This topic needed to be studied because those variables are still pioneers for ASEAN countries to achive economy growth and development. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the impact of income, energy consumption, FDI, trade, in this case export and import, and tourism on CO2 emission. This paper uses panel data from five ASEAN countries during 1995-2014. This paper uses pooled mean group (PMG) or known as panel ARDL as method. The results show that FDI tends to increase CO2 emission, in line with Pollution Haven hypothesis. Energy consumption, export, and tourism also increase CO2 emission. Another result shows that rise of import helps decrease CO2 emission in those countries."

FDI into TTH province fluctuates unpredictably, so the study investigates the causal relationship between the triangular variables over the whole period (1995–2019) and the shortened period (2003–2019). The ARDL model is the most optimal choice due to the heterogeneity of stationary characteristics and short time series data. The shortened period has established more statistically significant short- and long-term Granger causal relationships, excluding the economic crisis effect. The Granger causality test only underlined a unidirectional short-term relationship running from FTA to FDI in the shortened period. Policies for economic development in TTH province need to strengthen the coordination between foreign investment and tourism so that all economic sectors can jointly create spillover effects on economic growth."
pub.1144236930,Exploring the tourism-CO2 emissions-real income nexus in E7 countries: accounting for the role of institutional quality,"The purpose of this study is to explore the long-run and causality relationship between tourism development and the real income level in an environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) framework for emerging industrialised economies (E7). The newness of our study to the tourism literature is the inclusion of institutional quality and tradeto the mix. The inclusion of the additional variables in the econometrics setting is worthwhile to circumvent omitted variable bias. Second-generation panel estimation techniques, in conjunction with the Driscoll-Kraay robust estimator, have been employed to accommodate cross-sectional dependency in the panel under review, as well as for robustness of coefficients and estimates. The Empirical results affirm the presence of the EKC phenomenon and tourism-induced emission in E7 economies, thereby suggesting that sustainable tourism has a deteriorating impact on economic growth in the examined industrialised countries. Similarly, real GDP per capita and non-renewable energy also dampen the quality of the environment, as indicated by the robust regression of AMG and CCEMG. Hence, an increase in non-renewable energy and tourism demand increases CO2emission in E7 economies. Additionally, we observe that the quality of institution improves the quality of the environment, thus, indicating that the role of good governance (institutional quality) improves the quality of the environment in E7. Furthermore, there is a need for a paradigm shift to sustainable tourism development alongside the adoption of the polluters pay principles to mitigate the adverse implications of the consumption of non-renewable energy. More insights are presented in the concluding section."
pub.1149626648,Nexus Between Emission Reduction Factors and Anthropogenic Carbon Emissions in India,"Emission reduction and environmental quality improvement have become global priorities to support sustainable growth and mitigate the harmful consequences of global warming and climate change. However, there is limited research employing econometric methodologies to investigate the potential of emission reduction components, particularly in India. Thus, the current research examined the dynamic impacts of economic growth, renewable energy usage, urbanization, industrialization, tourism, agricultural productivity, and forest area on carbon dioxide emissions in India. The Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares method was used to analyze time series data from 1990 to 2020. The empirical results revealed that economic growth, urbanization, industrialization, and tourism all contribute to environmental deterioration by increasing carbon dioxide emissions in India, whereas enhanced renewable energy use, agricultural productivity, and forest area improve the quality of the environment by lessening carbon dioxide emissions. The results provided insights into the possibility of renewable energy utilization, agricultural output, and forest areas to accomplish environmental sustainability in India. This article offers policymakers more reliable and detailed content for designing effective measures focusing on low-carbon economies, promoting renewable energy utilization, sustainable urbanization, green industrialization, eco-friendly tourism, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable forest management in India. Additionally, the findings of the study may guide other developing nations seeking to implement effective sustainability approaches while also increasing climate change mitigation and adaptation measures."
pub.1146128727,NEXUS OF CLIMATE CONDITIONS WITH ENERGY ENVIRONMENTAL GROWTH INTEGRATION: HOW DO ECONOMIC INDICATORS MATTER?," There has been a change in economic research from focusing on economic growth to focusing on sustainable development when it comes to economic development. This research aims to examine the link between China’s socioeconomic progress and the degradation of the environment. Between 1995 and 2018, the information in this study was collected. We looked at factors including the percentage of tourism in total exports, total and renewable energy consumption and GDP per capita when calculating the emissions they have on the environment. CO 2 emission shows long-term causation, but the feedback causality hypothesis holds in the short term between the variables of concern. There is a one-way correlation between GDP, CO 2 emissions and the use of renewable energy; access to better water, sanitation and electricity; access to renewable energy; and access to improved water, sanitation and electricity to CO 2 emissions. It was shown that CO 2 emissions, GDP and energy usage had a positive long-term correlation. In contrast, tourism, renewable energy and access to better water and sanitation all had a negative long-term correlation. GDP’s contribution to future CO 2 emission fluctuations ranges from 7% to 25%, with energy use at 7%–15%, renewable energy use at 1%–4.5% and tourism at 5.8%–10%. Meanwhile, access to better water, sanitation and electricity is at 9%, 1.13% and 3%, respectively, according to the variance decomposition analysis. Sustainable development in China necessitates a strong policy to adopt renewable energy sources, sustainable tourism growth and improved access to safe drinking water, sanitary facilities and power.

Housing Financialisation and Post-pandemic Activism,"During the last decade, following years of austerity and rapid growth driven by tourism, real estate, and external investment, Lisbon has become a paradigmatic case of the financialisation/crisis nexus in the housing field. The simultaneous emergence and growth of social movements for the right to housing has been widely documented, with some accounts focusing on anti-financialisation struggles. In this article, we present the repertoires and claims of four activist groups and platforms born between 2022 and 2023 and discuss how Portuguese social movements are contending with the increasing centrality of financialisation in housing. In sum, we present three broad patterns of rescaling – intersectionality, internationalisation, and relations with political parties – in relation to the general endeavour to build a mass movement."
pub.1000667493,Peace through Tourism: A Critical Look at Nepalese Tourism,"Tourism, the world’s largest and one of the fastest developing economic sectors, virtually affects every region and nation of the world due to its potential contribution to international understanding and poverty reduction. Nepal is no exception. The remarkable growth of tourism at present (peace time) has been progressing through its four progressive theoretical models/platforms (e.g., advocacy, cautionary, adaptancy and knowledge-based platforms) with each having both peace potential and limitation. In this scenario, there is likely growing attention and look at tourism with a passion for its peace prospective.‘Peace’, a vital and most cherished dream of humanity, is a state that not only indicates the absence of direct violence but also sustains peaceful relationships among all levels and segments of society and between society and nature.Tourism is sensitive to conflict and responsive to peace. There are both opportunities and challenges for the peace responsiveness of tourism in Nepal. Nepalese tourism, which passed through a decade long (1996-2006) armed conflict, serves a concrete illustration of this nexus of tourism and peace with the dual attributes of tourism for conflict and peace. However, this paper envisages that it is a community-based village tourism supported by sustainable structures and actions, backed by proper implementations of tourism regulations, framed with appropriate codes of conduct and materialized by the integrated effort and partnership actions of all (non-scientific and scientific) stakeholders that can be the most viable option for achieving the noble goal of peace through tourism in Nepal. In this context, this paper exemplifies it with an innovative example of a research-linked and empirically executed case of Machhapuchchhre Model Trek (MMT) in Western Nepal. MMT is footed at the knowledgebased platform on transdisciplinary approach in which the scientific (e.g., researchers) and both academic and non-academic (e.g., local communities, local government, tourism practitioners, tourists, etc.) actors approached in an integrated effort to transform local tourism initiatives as peace promoting and conflict mitigating.This paper finally recommends the knowledge-based approach to Nepalese tourism as important not only for bridging the earlier three platforms but also for fulfilling the dual (mass as well as small-scale community-based village tourism) needs of Nepalese tourism at present and thus succeed on peace aspirations through tourism.

pub.1175798209,The integration and challenges of digital economy with the tourism industry: Evidence from the Yellow River Basin in China,"As the global economic landscape evolves, the digital economy becomes a central domain, gradually deepening and widening its confluence with diverse fields. This study aims to systematically explain the intricacies and dynamics of the amalgamation of the digital economy with tourism within the Yellow River Basin. The study builds an evaluative framework based on integrative development mechanisms; this study measures the combined development between the tourism industry and the digital economy between 2011 and 2021. After this quantification, it delves into their unified growth spatiotemporal nuances and discerns impediments based on an obstacle degree analysis. As far as development is concerned, a paradigm of “dual-track convergence” is observed in the Basin, showcasing the gradual ascension of digitalization and diversification of tourism. Regarding the coupling coordination degree (CCD), the nexus between the two exhibits temporal dynamics of a “spiral ascent followed by a transient descent” and a spatial “U-shaped differentiation,” undoubtedly reflecting the vivacity and heterogeneity inherent in their integration. Regarding impediments, the analysis reveals a multifaceted dynamism of barriers across various strata. Systemically, the tourism sector encounters escalating hindrances, with digital infrastructure and market breadth constituting predominant sectoral bottlenecks. On the indicator plane, critical limiting factors include tourism's foreign exchange earnings, the influx of inbound tourists, the proliferation of web pages, e-commerce turnover, and the count of corporate entities within the software and information technology services domain. This study is based on the theory of collaborative development and offers nuanced recommendations by dissecting the co-progress of tourism and the digital economy. The insights tendered herein profoundly impact China and the global community in fostering the common proliferation in both fields."
pub.1169601413,Exploring perceived risks and investment opportunities towards green hydrogen-powered airplane adoption in the tourism industry,"The electrolysis technology of water molecules has emerged as a renewable fuel at the same time as the world searches for new ways to address global warming and tries to save environmentally damaged sectors such as tourism and travel. Nowadays, these two sectors are striving to realize the sustainable travel concept. In the context of intensified attempts to combat climate change, there is a growing interest in air travel being carbon-neutral to surrounding environments. As such, hydrogen has been proven to be an alternative fuel in the travel industry, as it is generated from oxygen molecule separation in water post-usage. This fuel is capable of cooling the marine environment but is clean and free of organic pollutants and is called “green hydrogen."" Accordingly, this paper explores perceived risks and investment opportunities towards green hydrogen-powered airlines adoption in the tourism industry. Based on a quantitative approach, adoption portability antecedents of these airplanes in the Egyptian travel and aviation industry were investigated from a tourism and environmental expert perspective. WarpPLS 8 findings showed that investment opportunities for adopting these airplanes positively affected their adoption portability, while perceived risks of adopting these airplanes negatively affected their adoption portability in the tourism industry. Moreover, investment opportunities to adopt these airplanes reduced the negative nexus between perceived risks and these airplanes adoption portability. Based on these findings, a long-term plan for alternative energy growth can be found in tourism roadmaps for clean hydrogen adoption developed globally."

In the Eastern Caribbean, competition for potable water between tourism and local domestic needs has seen a growth of desalination treatment plants. The need for water by the tourism sector peaks during the dry season when availability is at its minimum. While desalination has been utilised to meet growing demands, hotels and resorts are now required, in many cases, to treat wastewater to a high standard to meet environmental standards so that the coastal areas, on which these hotels and resorts depend, are protected. This paper discusses the potential of wastewater reuse in the main tourism-dependent islands in the Eastern Caribbean. The nexus between desalination and wastewater reuse allows the hotels and resorts sector to reduce the overall costs of water supply, overcome shortages in the dry season and meet stringent wastewater disposal requirements, as it was found that wastewater reuse can meet up to 38% of total needs. In many of the islands, there are suitable conditions for promoting wastewater reuse."

Given SMTEs’ operational sizes, the need to enhance their knowledge base through their networks to stay competitive is heightened. This research examines how the absorptive capacity (AC) affects the dynamic between formal and informal networks and business management performance of SMTEs. The study focuses on four sub-sectors in Terengganu, Malaysia: hotels and resorts, travel agencies, restaurants, and handicrafts. The study analysed survey data from 119 entrepreneurs using a hierarchical regression model. The results showed that the nexus between the use of formal networks and business management performance is significantly mediated by AC, while no significant relationships were found with the use of informal networks. The study emphasizes the importance of formal actors in promoting knowledge flows and enhancing coastal destination development and competitiveness."

This increase in demand is linked, in part, to the important Chinese diaspora in Hungary whose members play the role of hosts in VFR travel. This paper aims to explore the social relations—guanxi—within the Chinese diaspora living in Budapest and its influence on VFR travels back and forth China. Results of the survey with 202 Chinese immigrants reveal the strong nexus between migration and VFR travel. The Chinese hosts who have been living in the country for two decades behave differently in their guanxi compared to those who have settled in Budapest recently. The article provides several practical contributions to local destination management organizations and tourism service providers to successfully reach Chinese hosts, such as providing commissions, coupons, and getting discounts."
pub.1157690197,Institutional Performance and Tourism Arrival Nexus in BRICS Countries: Evidence from Nonlinear ARDL Cointegration Approach,"Tourism is significantly influenced by institutional quality. The strength of institutions is also important for the growth of tourism because poor institutions may inhibit tourists from entering a region. Over the years, there have been rare studies on the association between institutional quality and tourism in BRICS Nations by using NARDL. Using the NARDL model & institutional theories, this study looks at the asymmetric effects of institutional quality on tourist arrival in the BRICS countries from 1996 to 2021. The findings suggest that a gain in institutional quality will boost Tourist arrival for the BRICS countries to examine the interrelationships among variables both long and short run and NARDL shows a positive relation between the expansion of tourism in the BRICS countries. This study examines the asymmetric effects of institutional quality and energy consumption on visitor arrival. The long-run asymmetries between institutional quality, energy use, and tourism in the BRICS countries. Furthermore, the study finds that neglecting the series’ inherent nonlinearities may lead to misleading inferences. The policy argued that in order to increase investment in institutional quality and energy consumption, appropriate measures must be taken, including deregulation of economic activity, the development of The implementation of adequate regulatory frameworks and tax constructions, the development of port infrastructure, a road network, a rail system, and telecommunications facilities, the achievement of trade-related clarity trade-related adaptability and the expansion of the nation's infrastructure in to accommodate more tourists. As a result, recommendations for measures to improve tourist arrival, promote high-quality institutions, and stop environmental damage were suggested. As a result, the present study offers the BRICS countries a foundation for their policies."
pub.1137056445,Emerging Industry: Identifying the Effective Institutional Factors on the Exploitation of Entrepreneurial Opportunities of Sports Tourism Industry in Developing Countries,"The aim of this study is to identify the effective institutional factors on the exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities of the sports tourism industry in developing countries. This research is a qualitative study, the systematic method of Strauss and Corbin (1990) has been used to analyze the data. Interviewing is the main method of collecting data in this research, which semi-structured interviews were done with 45 members of the research community. According to Shane and Vankataraman individual-opportunity nexus framework (2000), interview questions were drafted and simultaneously with data collection from interviews, data analysis was performed. Based on the research results, 75 indicators affecting the exploitation of entrepreneurship opportunities in sports tourism were identified. Our research findings show that the necessary institutional arrangements in regulatory/legal/administrative dimensions (rule of law, government policies), normative/cultural (social norms, values and beliefs), cognitive/educational (promotion of elite knowledge, promotion of social knowledge) and guidance measures/supporter (public sector support, private sector support, complementary attraction and information technology) can improve the rate of entrepreneurial behavior in this area by increasing the ability and willingness of entrepreneurs to take advantage of entrepreneurial opportunities in the field of sports tourism. Finally, according to the research results, it can be suggested that for the growth of the sports tourism industry in developing countries, The existence of a legal, normative, supportive and educational environment will affect the ability and desire of market participants to identify and exploit the entrepreneurial opportunities of this emerging industry."
pub.1151075033,"The nexus between greenhouse gases, economic growth, energy and trade openness in Vietnam","This study explores the nexus between greenhouse gases (GHG) with economic growth (GDP), fossil fuel consumption (FEC), renewable energy (REC) and trade openness (TRO) in Vietnam by using the panel ARDL approach from 1980 to 2018 through the data set retrieved from the World Bank (2022). The results show that all four factors impact GHG emissions, in which GDP has the most substantial impact, followed by REC, FEC and TRO in the first-order model. While GDP, FEC and TRO have positive effects on GHG emission, REC indicates a negative effect, which means that more REC could reduce the release of GHG. However, the coefficient of this factor is only −0.311 compared to 0.622 of GDP at the same 1% significance level. The selected model seems to fit the investigated data with an adjusted R2 of approximately 0.929. The results also demonstrate that the second and third forms of GDP to GHG emissions are unsuitable for the data. Based on the analysis results, the study also proposes some policy implications which reduce the intensity of GHG but still promote economic growth as follows: (1) reduce greenhouse gas emissions the contribution to GDP growth such as industry, construction, transport, agriculture, tourism services which green technology; (2) reduce the use of fossil energy and replace it with renewable energy sources; (3) perfecting the legal framework to encourage economic sectors and businesses to effectively use natural resources, especially re-valuing the cost of carbon emissions."
pub.1149438809,"The Nexus Between CO2 Emission, Economic Growth, Trade Openness: Evidences From Middle-Income Trap Countries","In recent years, the carbon dioxide emissions generated by the massive consumption of fossil energy have been increasing year by year, resulting in more and more obvious greenhouse effect, and the occurrence of climate disasters around the world has become more and more frequent. This study analyses the long-term effects of economic growth, trade, foreign direct investment (FDI) and gross domestic product (GDP) on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Latin American countries that are in the middle-income trap (MIT). Using annual time-series data for the period 2000–2020, the results of middle-income countries of Latin America are compared with higher-income countries (Singapore, the United States, and South Korea) and an upper-middle-income country, China. Specifically, we examine the role of sector value addition to GDP on the CO2 emission nexus for middle-income economies, controlling for the effects on GDP, FDI, and trade. Using regression and path analysis (multiple regression) we find that for higher-income countries FDI, GDP and trade are the important variables that have a strong positive impact on CO2 emission, but that positive impact is weak in MIT countries, which makes this study significant as it highlights important variables needed for MIT countries to remain focused. Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model results also explore that FDI, GDP growth and trade variables can significantly accelerate the environmental quality by CO2 emission, while tourism/travel services and education do not much impact the environment. Hence, our paper provides solid ground for developing a sustainable and pro-growth policy for MIT countries because they are plagued by the decline or stagnation of economic growth."

The aim of this study, therefore, is to account for economic complexity index (ECI), Brexit and other crisis episodes in the growth-energy-emissions nexus. Theoretically, the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model is assessed by adopting a One-step System Generalized Method of Moment (Sys GMM) on data for 26 EU member states over the period from 1995 to 2018. For the first time, an EU-macro regional analysis is conducted with and without the UK. Empirical results reveal that an increase in tourism, real GDP per capita, and energy use across the four EU macro regions leads to increase in carbon emission. In some regions, it was observed that tourism, ECI, Brexit, and the Greece bailout have no significant impact on carbon emission. This suggests that the increase in international travel, complexity of the economy, and financial crisis do not accelerate environmental crisis in such regions. However, where such factors are statistically significant, Brexit and the Greece bailout crisis both heighten emissions. Particularly, when the UK is excluded, Brexit and the Greece bailout crisis increase and reduce emissions, respectively. The EKC hypothesis, however, holds in either scenario. Based on these empirical findings, vital policy directions are suggested for a post-Brexit EU-UK energy and environmental relations."

Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore effective strategies for achieving environmental sustainability. In this context, we investigate the nexus between sustainable tourism, renewable energy, technological innovation, and environmental quality. Our study utilizes panel data from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries, covering the period from 1995 to 2020, and categorizes the sample into distinct income clusters. Employing rigorous empirical methods such as panel quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL), panel unit root tests, ordinary least squares (OLS), and the Wald test, we uncover significant insights. Notably, our findings reveal that sustainable tourism and technological innovation exhibit robust negative long-run associations with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all economic groups. Furthermore, renewable energy demonstrates a significantly negative long-run relationship with GHG emissions in low-income economies (specifically, 0.8%, 1.2%, and 1.2% at the 50th, 70th, and 90th quantiles, respectively). The comprehensive analysis, encompassing the entire sample, underscores the significantly negative link between sustainable tourism, technological innovation, and GHG emissions in both the long-run and short-run. Additionally, our Wald test results validate the dynamic integration and parameter consistency over time. In light of these findings, we advocate that all stakeholders in BRI economies embrace environmentally conscious growth strategies and innovative technologies to achieve lasting environmental sustainability."

The quality of institutions is also germane for tourism development, as weak institutions may discourage the arrival of tourists into a country. This study examines the asymmetric impact of energy consumption (EC) and institutional quality (IQ) on tourist arrival (TA) in Pakistan for the period 1984–2017 by employing the non‐linear autoregressive distributive lag model. The bounds test result reveals a long‐run relationship among the variables used in the model. The findings of the study suggest an asymmetric relationship among EC, IQ and TA. The results imply that an improvement in IQ will increase TA. From the results, it can be said that reducing environmental pollution by switching into clean sources of energy may have an indirect positive effect on the tourism industry. Therefore, policies for enhancing TA, quality institutions and curtailing environmental degradation were suggested."

This study explores the present state and trends of research in this field with the objective of attaining a sustainable system in future scenarios. Specifically, this analysis delves into the water–energy–CO2 nexus of the Colombian island of San Andrés. Currently, there is no energy generation from the water sector, with 76.18% of water consumption directed towards the cooling of thermal power plants and a mere 1.54% of the energy employed for water extraction, desalination, and purification. In 2019, the island’s total energy consumption reached 138 ktoe (kilotons of oil equivalent), and renewable energies have yet to contribute to the system. These findings emphasize the necessity for the island to implement measures that will bolster its sustainability, self-sufficiency, and resilience. This entails mitigating and managing the intensity of resource consumption, particularly in areas experiencing economic growth.

Initially, we applied the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for assessing the long-run relationship among the variables. We got confronted with the issue of Multicollinearity as we found the intercorrelations among the independent variables. Therefore, we adopted the alternative approach of Oridnary Least Square technique (OLS) for guaging the relationship between renewable energy and economic growth. We ran two different OLS equations, in the first equation we took renewable energy as dependent and economic growth as independent varibiable. In the second equation, we took economic growth as dependent and renewable energy as independent variable. In both of the cases, the results confirm that there is insignficnat realtionship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth. The reason could be that UAE is primarly dependent upon avaiation, tourism, hotelling, construction and real estate industries for revenues generation.Keywords: Renewable Energy, Sustainable Development, Economic Growth, Fossil Fuels, United Arab Emirates.JEL Classifications:Q01, Q4, Q42DOI: https://doi.org/10.32479/ijeep.11559"

Nevertheless, even small initiatives, like the one presented, can have significant positive impact on local development, because they can be replicated by the indigenous population and are sustainable. These projects are deeply embedded in the local context; they originate from specific contextual needs and aim to improve the well-being, using local resources and tapping on local potential. According to this logic, Olga’s Italian Corner is a project that aims on one side to foster educational development and on the other side to find ways to support financially the activities of the Youth Community Training Centre (YCTC).

Despite its antiquity, its rise dates largely from market liberalization in 1978. Leveraging its traditional role as a petty market center, it relied on an early start and subsequent agglomeration economies to grow these markets. The demand for goods in these markets begot manufacturing of these goods, creating backward linkages. The growth of these markets led to its unique version of internationalization — “shopping tourism” and as a venue for conventions. This pattern of growth, dubbed the “Yiwu model” is distinctive in that it relied on home-grown small trading enterprises, as opposed to the better-known model of large firms — foreign investment nexus found in export zones. Also distinctive is the strong role played by the Yiwu government working hand-in-glove with private entrepreneurs to seize opportunities and overcome challenges. This partnership will need to overcome challenges that come with this model of growth."

Rural tourism is one of the products with the greatest potential for growth within the tourist offer of the island of Gran Canaria, as it combines sustainable development and respect for the natural environment. Among the renewable energies with high applicability in rural environments, we highlight photovoltaic solar, low-temperature solar thermal and the methanation of waste and wastewater generated in tourism. This article shows a methodology adapted and developed for the study of the water-energy-waste nexus, considering parameters of waste generation, water and energy consumption, the occupied area and potential renewable energy generation in rural houses in Gran Canaria and evaluates their environmental profitability. It has been concluded that applying these renewable technologies can significantly reduce the carbon and ecological footprint of the activity of rural houses based on the available surface. This contributes to achieving the energy and environmental objectives proposed by the EU to achieve decarbonization by 2050."
pub.1173242230,"Investigating the nexus between social globalization, energy transition, tourism, and environmental quality: Evidence from quantile regression","Abstract  Escalations in economic development and the concomitant upsurge in social globalization (SG) in the largest economies have enhanced the utilization of fossil fuels, which in turn has stimulated carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Given that reducing global warming is one of the essential means to disrupt climate change and attain sustainable development, this study examines the interlinkages between SG, energy transition (ENTR), international tourism (ITU), and CO 2 emissions. As environmental issues are widespread in the largest economies, this investigation analyzed the data from the 10 largest economies using the Method of Moments Quantiles Regression (MM‐QR) from 1995 to 2020. The study found that ENTR plays a significant role in decreasing emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. Alongside this, increasing social globalization also curbs CO 2 emissions and facilitates environmental sustainability. Apart from this, the findings demonstrate a progressively increasing contribution of ITU and economic growth to enhancing environmental degradation. Furthermore, results indicated that carbon emissions are not influenced by reductions in political risks in the member nations. Finally, policies to support environmental sustainability are discussed. "

In view of these remarkable occurrences, tourism has been earnestly considered in the national sustainable development plans of many developing countries and a subject of many international conferences on the Sustainable Development Agenda. For instance, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development has at its core in the eradication of poverty, while at the same time preserving the planet, eliminating climate change and addressing other societal needs such as the creation of jobs, health, education, gender equality and empowerment for all. As a sector that constitutes around 10% to the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment, tourism has the potential to contribute to the advancement and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 12 (responsible consumption and production) 14 (life below water) and 15 (life on land) since it has been adopted as a win-win advancement of both natural resources conservation and human development nexus.For many developing countries such as Botswana the tourism sector is promoted not only to serve the planet but people as well. Due to the heavy reliance on the country’s natural resources, achieving sustainable tourism development is central to Botswana. Using the concepts of Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) and sustainable tourism development, this chapter adopts a case study design, informed by a qualitative research approach and uses document analysis to explore, synthesize and discuss tourism development in Botswana. The chapter uses the CBNRM and eco-certification programmes to analyse socio-economic prospects, standardization prospects and opportunities and challenges experienced through these programmes. Results indicate mixed outcomes. Although sustainable tourism in Botswana has led to some form of community participation and empowerment, natural resource conservation, a range of livelihood options and employment opportunities, there are still a number of challenges being experienced. These include the passive participation of locals in the sector, poor backward and forward tourism businesses linkages, foreign ownership of tourism facilities, environmental impacts challenges and institutional frameworks that continue to marginalize and/or alienate local communities from participating in the sector. Regardless of these difficulties, sustainable tourism development in Botswana has prospects of contributing to the sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, to reconcile the challenges and prospects facing tourism development in Botswana, environmental sustainability should be the guiding principle, and this requires a planning process that contributes positively to the needs of tourists and tour operators while being considerate to the socioc"

Thus, we're going to select an econometric model, an Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL) applied to a sample of 10 MENA countries. Our aim is to measure, long-run and short-run impact of the number of arrivals, the Foreign Direct Investment, government health expenditures, the energy consumption and the population growth rate on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. All variables are observed from 1995 to 2020. The methodology adopted in this work is as followed: First, the statistical indicators for the sample are calculated. Secondly, the temporal series stationarity is checked by realizing tests of first and second generation. The Pedroni ARDL and Pesaran cointegration tests are then applied. Finally, Granger causality for panel data is used. The causality analysis between variables is carried out using the Dumitrescu and Hurlin's test. Findings reveal that, in the long term, tourism sector and energy consumption have significant and positive impact on CO<sub>2</sub>. But the economic growth and population growth influenced it negatively and they are statistically significant. In the short term, the dependent variable is statistically impacted by economic growth. The degrees and magnitude of the individual effects of the various variables on the Carbone dioxide emissions vary from country to an other. There are bidirectional and unidirectional relationships causality between different variables. Our findings can be helpful for policy makers seeking to achieve the sustainable development goals in MENA region."
pub.1140093949,Nexus of Terrorism and Tourism: Empirical evidence from South Asian Countries,"Purpose: To investigate the deleterious role ofterrorism towards tourism, this study analyzed time series data over the period 1980-2016 for South Asian countries including Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted the Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL) model to investigate the short and long-run estimates simultaneously. The study further applied Granger causality to find out the direction of causalities.
Findings: Utilizing the ARDL model, the result indicates that there is strong negative short and long-run relationship between terrorism and tourism in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. The unidirectional causalities from terrorism, per capita GDP, and terrorism intensity towards tourist's receipts have their implication for the country in terms oftourism development.
Research limitations/implications: The fact that the number of reviews has been used as a proxy is a limitation and adds a provisional character to our results and encourages the replication of our analysis with data on the effective occupation of the accommodation, to which we did not have access to in our case. Similarly, if possible, other smaller Latin American cities could bestudied.
Research implications: In the perspective of policy implementation, the govemment of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh must take quick actions to control terrorism since it is destructive to the tourism industry as well as in light of its negative effect on economic development of a country. Moreover, the govemment should expand the business and employment opportunities notjust in light of the fact that unemployment is harmful to economic growth yet additionally to spare the economy from terrorism as unemployed people can easily become the puppets of terrorist groups by paying them and to feed their families.
Originality/value: This study utilized time series data over a period 1980-2016 for South Asian countries (Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) to investigate the deleterious role ofterrorism towards tourism."
pub.1175434893,Strategic resilience nexus: Connecting pioneering and sustainability orientations,"Abstract This work analyzes, under a strategic approach, the role of organizational resilience (OR) in connecting pioneering orientation (PO) and sustainability orientation (SO), thus filling a significant and unexplored gap in the literature. The empirical study was conducted on a sample of 223 companies in the cultural tourism industry in Spain. The results show a total mediating effect of OR in the relationship between PO and SO in its economic, environmental, and social dimensions and a partial effect in the case of the cultural dimension. The study highlights the U‐shaped curvilinear relationship between PO and OR, reflecting a brake on the growth of OR when companies have a strong tendency to enter the market early. Companies should adopt the role of early followers to strengthen resilience and achieve a strong strategic commitment to sustainability."
pub.1153904342,Correlation between nitrous oxide emissions and economic growth in Vietnam: An autoregressive distributed lag analysis,"In this study, a panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach was employed to investigate the nexus between N 2 O emissions and economic growth in Vietnam with respect to six parameters, i.e., gross domestic product (GDP), foreign direct investment (FDI), gross fixed capital formation (GDI), industry (IND), services (SEV), and trade openness (TRO), respectively, from 1994 to 2018. The obtained results revealed that all factors impact N 2 O emissions and that the increase in GDP, IND, and FDI could reduce the emissions, with coefficients of −0.011, −0.022, and −0.015, respectively. On the other hand, GDI, SEV, and TRO significantly increased the N 2 O emissions, with coefficients of 0.015, 0.006, and 0.001, respectively. The adjusted regression of this model was 0.982. Based on the analysis results, the study also proposed some policy implications as follows, which reduce the intensity of N 2 O emissions while simultaneously promoting economic growth: (1) Reduce SEV and TRO toward the contribution to GDP growth, such as IND, construction, transport, agriculture, and tourism SEV; (2) increase the use of IND and GDI; and (3) perfect the legal framework to encourage economic sectors and businesses to effectively use natural resources, especially re-valuing the cost of carbon emissions."

The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was implemented in the basin to work towards the goal of simulating nutrient loading. A key conclusion of this review study is for the local population to have advocacy for the “zero wastewater discharge to Lake Atitlan” initiative to bring long-term benefits to lake water quality. One of the recommended policy decisions is to seek external financing from international agencies like the World Bank at low-cost interest (IDA Loans) to implement waste management systems and pay this external debt by putting a small but affordable tax on tourists visiting the lake. Once a culture of zero municipal effluent discharge to Lake Atitlan is adopted by the local population, the livelihood of residents will become sustainable and the standard of living will increase because of improved water and air quality, making Lake Atitlan a haven of tourism for Guatemala and lifting its economy."
pub.1144426655,Effect of Foreign Direct Investment in Tourism on Economic Growth,"There are various aspects of Indonesia that can be offered to tourists, including beautiful nature, rich culture, relaxing spas, tasty local food and many more. Millions of foreign tourists come into the country annually and it is increasing every year. Tourism industry has become an important part of the economy. Consequently, the government highly encourages foreign direct investment (FDI) to help this industry grow even more. However, there has not been much empirical research on the nexus between FDI in tourism industry (TFDI) and economic growth, especially in the case of Indonesia. This research gap is important to be filled since concepts can be misleading without support from actual data. Therefore, this research examines the effect of TFDI on economic growth with the inclusion of three absorptive capacities, which are human capital, trade openness and financial market development. It is imperative to find out whether TFDI actually benefits the host country’s economy, particularly due to the efforts the government has exerted to draw foreign investment in. The data are taken from 2000 to 2019 covering 20 years and analysed using least squares regression. Data from 2020 is not included in the analysis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tourism industry is certainly hit hard by the pandemic and therefore data after COVID-19 spread in Indonesia is an anomaly. Since it is a global crisis that cannot be solved easily nor quickly, it should not be included in the analysis to avoid getting misleading results. The results show that TFDI exerts significant negative effect on economic growth unless its interaction term with financial market development is introduced into the equation. It shows that it is dangerous for the government to simply encourage TFDI without paying close attention to the development of the local financial market. This is an interesting finding since absorptive capacities have been analysed in the case of aggregate FDI but rarely used in sectoral FDI. This research found that supporting factor is crucial for TFDI in Indonesia as it changes the effect from significant negative to significant positive. Therefore, without its presence, TFDI can damage the local economy instead of fostering it. The government should not only focus on attracting foreign investors but also work on improving local conditions to ensure benefits from foreign investors can be felt locally. Researchers can explore sectoral FDI further by including more absorptive capacities. Limitations of this research include limited data, indicators and research methodology used. These limitations can be used as directions for future research. In addition, researchers should explore a wider variety of indicators to better represent the economic variables, such as using quality focused human capital proxy instead of quantity focused. This chapter discusses foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia's tourism industry and its effect on the nation's economic growth. Th"

inequality, utilizing panel data spanning from 1992 to 2020. Globalization is
measured by the World Bank global-link indicators such as FDI, Remittance,
Trade Openness, and Migration while income inequality is measured by Gini
Coefficient and the median income of 50% of the population. The fixed effect
panel data analysis provides empirical evidence indicating that globalization
tends to reduce income inequality, though its impact varies between developed
and developing countries. The analysis reveals a strong negative correlation
between net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and inequality in
developing countries, while no such relationship was found for developed
countries.The relationship holds even if we consider an alternative measure of
inequality. However, when dividing countries by developed and developing
groups, no statistically significant relationship was observed. Policymakers
can use these findings to support efforts to increase FDI, trade, tourism, and
migration to promote growth and reduce income inequality."

pub.1139536205,DESTINATION IMAGE ANALYSIS AND ITS STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS: A LITERATURE REVIEW FROM 1990 TO 2019,"Purpose of the study: ""Image"" not only exists in the market of consumer goods as well as tourism but also is the criteria usually used by consumers to make decisions. However, little literature is concerned with a comprehensive analysis of its development trajectory, application domains, and strategic implications. This study aims at conducting an extensive review of DI's current literature to examine the key concept of consumer behaviors.
 Methodology: Based on Scopus, this paper surveys the development trajectory of destination image using a literature review with the solo keyword “destination image” from 1990 to 2019.
 Main findings: The findings indicate that the development of destination image begins in 1995 and the overall growth is steady and strong. There are three development waves, such as 2002-2007, 2008-2013, and 2015-2019. These 908 articles were scattered across 182 different journals. Besides, all these keywords related to counties/areas are mostly equipped with tourism competitiveness as well.
 Applications of this study: This study reveals five problem domains of destination image including environment and government, destinations, tourists, culture, and others, respectively. This would call the attention of the executives and authorities concerned with environmental sustainability, adaptability/responsiveness of strategies, destination competitiveness, capabilities development, resource allocation, and tourist behavior (e.g., decision-making and post-purchase intention).
 Originality/Value: Based on the nexus between “environment-destination-tourist”, this study proposed a strategic map of DI to future researchers and field workers of great interests to operationalize and conceptualize its coverage."

                    Purpose
                    This paper aims to examine the relationship between tourism development and income inequality, closely linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, for the case of a large sample of 83 countries (and subsamples) over the period 1990–2019.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This study uses rigorous dynamic panel data analysis, namely, a Panel Vector Autoregressive Error Correction model, which takes into account both dynamic and endogenous relationships in the tourism-inequality nexus.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results provide strong support that tourism development has an income inequality reducing effect (albeit relatively small with a reported elasticity of 0.05). Subsamples analysis reveals that the impact of tourism on income inequality varies and is relatively larger in developing economies and those tourist-dependent economies, as compared to developed economies. In fact, it is reported that a 1% increase in tourism development reduces income inequality by 0.46% for developing and 0.56% for tourist-dependent economies as compared to only 0.02% in developed economies. It is further observed that tourism may affect income inequality indirectly via economic growth.

pub.1128262699,The Effect of Food and Energy Security on Political Stability,"Since both food security and energy security are countries strategic objective, this study typically advocates a deep understanding of the concept of political stability to incorporate food and energy security as a new pillar of conflict management based on an empirical understanding of the nexus and its effect. We used food deficit as proxy for food security and energy imports for energy security from the World Bank database. Using the panel fixed effect method on data for more than 150 countries from 2008 to 2016, we identified a highly significant positive effect of economic growth, tourism and high institutional quality on stability. Destabilizing factors were also detected such as corruption and arable land scarcity. The negative effect of food insecurity was illustrated after the introduction of the squared term of food deficit. Energy imports also have a destabilizing effect. These results for the effect of food and energy security effect holds robust to various control of other determinants in our regression. This study calls for more attention to the energy and food strategy within a country. Keeping peace and stability in the world will require development effort and technological exchange between countries in terms of food strategy and renewable energy plans. These measures will boost economic growth and improve the quality of institutions which will help fighting corruption."
pub.1140145292,Economic Growth and Environmental degradation nexus in Sri Lanka,"The environmental Kuznet curve (EKC) hypothesis suggests that at the initial stage of development, as the economy grows, environ-mental degradation rises until a turning point is reached whereby the pollution and degradation begins to decline while the economy continues to grow (it follows an inverted U curve). Is the environmental Kuznet curve (EKC) hypothesis applicable to Sri Lanka? What factors are responsible for environmental degradation in Sri Lanka? This study seeks to provide answers to these fundamental questions. Sri Lanka is one of the emerging economies in South Asia with an average annual growth rate of 4.16% in the last five years and the industrial sector contributing 25% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This hypothesis is tested for Sri Lanka. This study also investigated the major factors behind environmental pollution and degradation in Sri Lanka. Annual data from 1971-2014 was used in estimating the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. Carbon (CO2) emission was used as a proxy for environmental degradation while real per capita income was used as a proxy for growth along with other explanatory variables. An autoregressive distributed lag model was used. Results showed that neither the EKC hypothesis nor the pollution haven hypothesis are applicable to Sri Lanka. Long term estimates revealed that increasing energy consumption leads to increasing CO2 emissions. Secondly, it was observed that energy consumption, urbanization, trade openness, tourism and financial development are among the key factors responsible for the quality of the environment. The policy implication is that the Sri Lankan Government, in conjunction with the private sector must adopt energy saving and environmental friendly technologies and production processes in order to save the environment."

To address this gap, this study aims to investigate the tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH) through the lens of institutional quality, drawing on evidence from African economies.   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a longitudinal design, involving panel data on 43 countries over an 18-year period, and the data were analyzed using the difference generalized method of moments model.   Findings Results indicated that international tourism earnings contributed to economic growth in the selected economies. However, institutional quality negatively moderated the tourism–growth relationship on the continent, particularly in low-income economies, while reinforcing this link in middle-income countries.   Originality/value This study provides new insights into how the TLGH varies across different levels of institutional quality and development.

pub.1159754684,Climate Therapy and the Making of a Slavic Riviera on the Yugoslav Coast,"Abstract Beginning with the profound geopolitical changes created by the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the creation of the Czechoslovak and Yugoslav states, this article examines how medical knowledge about maritime climate and sea-based therapies was mobilized in Czech popular touristic writing about Yugoslavia's Adriatic coast in the 1920s. The analysis of archival documents as well as non-specialist medical publications of Czech or Prague-trained doctors show that Czech tourists and curists (travelers in search of health treatments) were offered a freeform, all-encompassing therapeutic environmental approach. Inspired by Neo-Hippocratic principles, doctors stressed the importance of factors such as salt water, clean air, temperature variation, sunshine, flora, and modern facilities for disease prevention or the restoration of one's health. These doctors’ relative success in promoting the therapeutic virtues of the Adriatic Sea is explained in large part, this article argues, by a broad nexus of intertwined interests (such as the growth of tourism, concerns about public health, and the influence of Neo-Slavism) embedded in the project of transforming the Adriatic Sea into a therapeutic site."
pub.1088417049,Integrating CLMV countries through trade and investment,"This chapter examines the experience of the so-called CLMV countries – Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam – in opening up their once centrally planned economies to trade, foreign direct investment (FDI) and the global market. The result has been fast growth and macroeconomic stability for Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR. They even bounced back from the global crisis of 2008-09 because their export growth in apparel, tourism, agricultural products and hydropower is sound and their trade and investment linkages with their big regional neighbours have strengthened their economies. Today, however, they must explore the agenda for future, better growth and engage in a second generation of microeconomic reforms to support human and social development. Myanmar is at a different stage altogether – it is only now following up tentative political freedoms with economic liberalisation. The first section of this chapter sets the scene, tracing the history of CLV’s gradualist approach to economic transition over the past 20 years. The following two sections explore the trade-FDI nexus, i.e. the relationship between economic liberalisation and strong trade and FDI growth (which accounts for higher shares of gross domestic product (GDP) than in ASEAN-6) and also look at how CLV have eased into the global market, joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) and signing trade agreements. The next section considers major changes in the product composition and market distribution of CLMV’s exports and how their big neighbours have been engines of growth. The chapter then looks to the future arguing that CLV countries now need to usher in further reform by improving infrastructure and skilled labour through educational reform, and sharing the benefits of growth across society. The chapter concludes by arguing that CLV must address poverty and income disparities, while Myanmar still has its economic transition ahead of it."
pub.1157854604,Water- food- energy- ecosystem nexus model development: Resource scarcity and regional development,"Demographic, economic, social, and climate change are all putting pressure increasing on natural resources through global energy, food, and water demand growth, which threatens the well-being of the ecosystems. To address this scientific and political challenge, a dual-purpose optimization tool has been proposed with the approach of minimizing the environmental effects and development costs of the region in line with resource consumption management, which optimally takes resources from the ecosystem, and regarding development approach (ecotourism development in this study), it has suggested the optimal strategy to improve the economic benefits. Moreover, this model is able to propose some effective management policies on resource planning at the regional level. This approach has been applied to Shif Island in the south of Iran. The main results are: (i) The regional potential has the possibility of increasing more than 2067 tourism numbers per year, which can compensate for a large part of the regional development costs. (ii) The regional management strategy of wastewater and solid waste resources with the view of the nexus approach development of the system (development of the eco-industrial park) and the ecosystem (the relationship between the soil and plant model) and the system development models in line with the regional demand), can reduce waste production to about zero and provide more than 90% of the region's fertilizer needs in order to improve the ecosystem's performance. (iii) In this model, the producers of materials and energy are the main inputs of the ecosystem, and the outputs of the ecosystem include the outputs of the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing process in the remote areas, as well as mineral resources (industrial raw materials and fossil resources), renewable energy, etc. Consumers consist of humans and living organisms of the urban-rural ecosystem. In general, in this paper, the aim is to develop a practical method for analyzing the symbiosis of living and non-living parts of the ecosystem in terms of water- Food-Energy and Ecosystem nexus model. In this regard, a hybrid technology model has been suggested to minimize the dynamic cost of changes in line to reach an optimal path for the development of living and non-living interaction."
pub.1117667581,The value of indigeneity in the tourism and hospitality industry in Aotearoa – manaakitanga,"Hospitality within the Indigenous paradigm of manaakitanga (translated as ‘warm hospitality’) is founded on an ‘ethic of care’. This ethic of care creates the space for a multi-dimensional wealth, encompassing “spiritual, cultural, social, environmental and economic well-being” [1]. This is similar to the UNWTO’s sustainable development goals, which are underpinned by the three dimensions of economic, socio-cultural and environmental sustainable development [2]. Manaakitanga in Māori contexts such as marae and many iwi (tribal) organisations demands a values-centred approach that is based on the principle of reciprocity. This form of exchange extends beyond the economic focus of traditional business models and, when applied to non-Māori contexts, demands a degree of culturalising commerce rather than commercialising culture. In the global tourism and hospitality industries, Indigenous cultures have become more significant to countries as a means to differentiate themselves from others [3]. Indigenous cultures are appealing to emerging tourism markets and the resultant economic benefits have led industry stakeholders, throughout the global-local nexus, to include Indigenous cultures in national tourism and hospitality offerings. In the context of the New Zealand tourism and hospitality industry, Māori culture is presented in several key ways. For example, the use of manaakitanga in New Zealand tourism marketing [4] highlights and promotes the significance of the culture to the nation. Tourism and hospitality can both support economic development as well as promote the uniqueness, authenticity and beauty of Indigenous cultures that encourages visitation, differentiates nations and showcases national pride. The tourism and hospitality industry is not always beneficial, however, to the actual Indigenous communities from which the intellectual property is derived. There is evidence that shows the use of deep and meaningful cultural values are sometimes misunderstood, exploited and not reflected in actual practice within the industry. Indeed, analysis of the engagement of Māori women in the hospitality industry, for example, shows that there are distinct inequities in employment [5]. While these inequities are not unique to tourism and hospitality, the evidence shows that Māori women in service-sector employment, such as hospitality, are disproportionately represented in low paid, lower skilled, precarious work [6]. It is a paradox that Māori women’s contribution as the face of the industry is not associated with decent work and career progression. This paper follows a presentation delivered at the Critical Hospitality Symposium in 2018, where the concept of manaakitanga was critically applied to a range of ‘hospitality’ contexts as a point of social analysis. The importance of sustainable development in the industry lends well to engaging in further research on how Māori cultural frameworks can be used to address inequalities in hospitality as a start"

pub.1181781316,"Pentecostal Charismatic Christianity (PCCs), Religious Pilgrimage and Local Livelihoods in Harare","Since the late 2000s, new mega-Pentecostal Charismatic Churches (PCCs) attracting thousands of people who fill their enormous auditoriums have emerged. Led by youthful prophets, these new megachurches have decolonised hegemonic understandings of Pentecostal religiosity and mobility. While increasing scholarly attention has been paid to the rapid growth of Pentecostal Charismatic Churches (PCCs) in Zimbabwe and Africa, limited research has been done on PCCs, religious tourism and urban livelihoods. This chapter examines the complex nexus between Pentecostal religious pilgrimage and livelihoods, including the economic contribution of religious pilgrimage in Harare. Based on ethnographic and qualitative research from 2014 to 2016, the chapter examines the ‘south-south’ and ‘north-south’ Pentecostal religious pilgrimage and its contribution to urban livelihood and economy. Participant observation, in-depth interviews, informal conversations and observations were conducted with 40 participants who included religious tourists, local congregants, informal traders and church officials to understand the ways in which religious pilgrimage during mega-events such as ‘Nights of Turnaround’ and ‘Judgement Nights’ and ‘Billionaires Mindset Summits’ (re)shap(ed) livelihoods and local economies."
pub.1173832283,"Sustainable Development Across Pacific Islands, Lessons, Challenges, and Ways Forward","This timely and ambitious volume—a product of close research collaboration with the United Nations Multi-Country Office for Micronesia—is conceived as a holistic “journey” across various domains of progress in a region that, despite fundamental common traits, remains vast and diverse. Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) have (too) often been identified with elements of vulnerability, whether these be social, economic, or environmental in nature. While these factors cannot be overlooked, this volume aims to showcase not only the long-standing and emerging challenges but, perhaps more importantly, the opportunities, the resilience, the resourcefulness, and the ambition that local socioeconomic development patterns in the Pacific already encompass. Beyond PICTs themselves, we hope that the analyses collected in this book will contribute to highlighting the global significance of the human–nature nexus in the current Anthropocene. Often captured in the concept of “small islands, big oceans”, the importance of the region and its islands and peoples transcends the geographical remoteness and small size of many PICTs."
pub.1173075352,"Conservation-Based Tourism Development, Climate Change, Inclusion of Locals, and Post-human-Wildlife Co-existence Conflicts","There is a growth in knowledge on complex interaction between people and parks. However, conservation-based tourism development, climate change, local inclusion, and post-human-wildlife co-existence conflicts in African Transfrontier Conservation Areas, is still limited especially as joint field. The study area is described and presented using maps and cartographic illustrations to picture territorial boundaries. The discussion upholds evidence on symbiotic linkage between the effects of climate change and communities whose livelihoods are impacted by these effects. The increase in population and migration into lands close to national parks has led to humans encroaching on wildlife habitats, exacerbating human-wildlife co-existence conflicts. On the other hand, conservation-based tourism development initiatives are perceived by locals as only involving elite communities, excluding many. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns have exacerbated the impact of the above-raised factors. There is a paucity of information about this complexity from the perspective of the human behavioural lens. In this context, effects, challenges, trends, opportunities, and solutions/practices are yet to be explored. This chapter aimed to fill the gap by assessing trends and patterns in research-based knowledge, with Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, as a case study while setting a research agenda for the research community in post-COVID-19 health crisis. A critical-scoping review analysis was used while following Creswell qualitative analysis framework to analyse research data from Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Sabinet databases between 2000 and 2023. Based on maps, and cartographic illustrations, there are territorial changes over the period as society (territorial boundaries, activities, cultures and learnt behaviours of people), environment (climatic changes, and composition of biodiversity) and COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures propelled a ‘cause-effect’ for human-wildlife co-existence conflicts (illegal hunting of wildlife and over-harvest of herbs and wood included). Within this context, the study unveiled four areas, namely: (i) limited evidence on local community/household (stakeholders) engagement; (ii) a paucity of human-behavioural focused models/theories in post-human-wildlife conflicts; (iii) limited knowledge of the nexus between the topics under consideration and multi-disciplinary research; and (iv) the need to document theory-in-practice, strategies, potential opportunities, and solutions to challenges. The study assessed the trends and patterns prevailing in conservation-based tourism development, climate change, local inclusion, post-human-wildlife co-existence conflicts and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures in communities around Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. There are changes in vegetation, land use as well as the composition of biodiversity. Conservation authorities should balance perceiv"

Another interesting concept closely connected with the halal concept is the safety and quality products and conducts better known as toyyiban. Hence, the halal concept should include toyyiban, or the better terms are Halalan Toyyiban, which can be translated as permissible and wholesomeness Meanwhile, the Halal industry is defined as an industry that produces and offer good quality products and services which under Sharia law. Sharia law is the law that governs Muslims' everyday conducts. The Halal industry includes sectors such as food, cosmetics, ingredients, pharmaceutical, chemicals, livestock, logistics, tourism, and most notably the Islamic finance and banking sector Halal exports are growing steadily while the performance is still very far from the targeted growth. Thus, an understanding of the determinants of Halal export flows is essential. This study aims to investigate the nexus between Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Muslim population, Halal Certificate, and distance of Halal export. The method employed in this study is the Qualitative method. Content analysis is formed to prove the relationship between those independent variables with Halal export. Limitations and future study recommendations were discussed at the end of this research."

The present study contributes to fill this knowledge gap by delineating a statistical procedure that investigates, at the municipal scale in Italy, the association between two composite indexes of sustainable development (SDI) and desertification risk (ESAI). Based on a refined knowledge of the local context, results of a geographically weighted regression delineate two distinctive territorial models reflecting the mutual interplay of sustainable development and desertification risk in Italy. The level of sustainable development was negatively associated with desertification risk in Southern Italy, a region classified as ‘affected’ based on the Italian National Action Plan (NAP) to combat desertification. These findings document a traditional ‘downward spiral’ between local development and early desertification processes, suggesting that a high desertification risk is associated with local contexts having structural conditions that lead to unsustainable development, e.g., population growth, industrial development, tourism pressure, crop intensification, agricultural mechanization, and land abandonment. In non-affected regions such as Northern and Central Italy, the level of sustainable development was positively associated with desertification risk, indicating that sustainability conditions can be unable, at least in some local contexts, to assure a significant containment of environmental degradation. Policy strategies reconnecting local development with more specific environmental conservation targets in development countries are increasingly required to adapt to (and differentiate on the base of) heterogeneous local contexts."
pub.1181640585,Blue economy of Bangladesh and sustainable development goals (SDGs): a comparative scenario,"Blue economy has the potential to promote economic growth, improve livelihoods, and create jobs while protecting marine ecosystems. This research uses a comprehensive analysis of secondary data sources to assess various blue economy sectors, including maritime transport, fisheries, aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, marine tourism, marine biotechnology, and ocean mining. By examining the blue economy experiences of developed nations like the United States, Canada, Japan, Norway, and Australia, the study identifies the best SDG practices and strategic lessons applicable to Bangladesh. In the case of Bangladesh, the research focuses on the blue economy initiatives, opportunities, and challenges associated with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The blue economy and SDGs nexus in the context of Bangladesh demonstrates that out of 17 goals, 12 SDGs (SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, SDG 14, SDG 16 and SDG 17) are linked with blue economy practices in Bangladesh. However, in the case of developed countries, only six SDGs (SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 12, SDG 13, SDG 14) are connected to the blue economy because of the diversity of blue economy practices across the countries. Situated along the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh has significant potential to utilize its marine resources for sustainable development. However, it faces challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, regulatory gaps, environmental risks, and limited technological advancements. The study thus emphasizes the need for integrated policy frameworks, stakeholder coordination, investments in sustainable infrastructure, public–private partnerships, technological innovation, and community engagement."
pub.1093027325,The Heritage Value of the Craft Sector in Fast-Growing Cities,"Culture is a key dimension in the history of cities where the design of urban development strategies combines the aim to preserve the wealth of cultural heritage with the search for contemporary progress. Along the centuries, arts and crafts have always occupied an important place in the life of cities because they contribute to preserve local identity and traditions through skills, they provide jobs and contribute to the local economy, and they are a source of interest for cultural tourism. Historically, artisan workshops are to be found in cities, where the high concentration of people and products provides the perfect framework for buying raw materials and selling the final products in markets. Today, workshops have often been substituted by industrializations and those left are increasingly being forced out of the city or to die to leave space to new businesses. What is the place of handicraft today? Is there still a strong linkage between handicraft and places? And what has been the role of public policies in encouraging (or discouraging) this kind of activity in the past century? The article discusses these questions and provides examples taken from the observation of the historical and sociopolitical context of handicrafts in India. The conclusion reflects over handicraft as a marginalized sector with great potential to become a driver of sustainable development in cities."

Industries such as energy, food, and tourism and the systematic destruction of the environment through global capitalism are scrutinized for their contribution to global warming. Ideas of ‘state–corporate crime’ and ‘ecocide’ are introduced and explored in this concise overview of criminological writings on climate change. This sound and robust application of theoretical concepts to this ‘new’ area also includes commentary on topical issues such as the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate agreement.

Part of the New Horizons in Criminology series, which draws on the inter-disciplinary nature of criminology and incorporates emerging perspectives like social harm, gender and sexuality, and green criminology. Leading green criminologist Rob White asks what can be learned from the problem-solving focus of crime prevention to help face the challenges of climate change. Part of the New Horizons in Criminology series. This chapter defines and describes the concept of ecocide, which refers to the destruction of ecological systems and habitats. This includes the everyday activities that contribute to climate change and thus to ecocide on a larger and small scale. The chapter then introduces the notion of state–corporate nexus by examining how industries, supported and abetted by governments, contribute to global warming. Indeed, pro-capitalist ideologies and practices ensure continued economic growth at the expense of ecological limits. As such, effective responses to climate change need to address the deep-seated inequalities and trends within the treadmill of production that go to the heart of the ownership, control, and exploitation of resources. The crime of ecocide is rarely embedded, however, in state legislation. This is, in part, because the state is directly implicated in perpetuating activities that contribute to global warming."
pub.1171387683,Residents’ Perceptions of the Impacts of Tourism on the Quality of Life in a Tourist Island Destination: Evidence from Tobago,"Tobago, the smaller island of the twin-island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is heavily tourist penetrated and almost exclusively reliant on tourism for its sustenance. Tobago is touted as beautiful, peaceful and tranquil and is generally referred to as ‘The Capital of Paradise’. However, the moniker ‘The Capital of Paradise’ is being dissipated due to the increasing reliance on tourists and tourism which has the attendant ‘blessings and blights’, including, but not limited to, economic development, increased crime and impacts on the quality of life. While tourism has a great potential to enhance residents’ quality of life, a limited number of studies have been conducted on the issue. Additionally, while there is some scholarship on the tourism-quality of life nexus, the views of residents in tourist island destinations are hardly used to inform these studies. As a result of this lacuna, the current article presents the perceptions of residents of Tobago, a tourist island destination in the Caribbean, regarding their perceptions of the impacts of tourism (local and foreign) on the quality of life (socio-cultural, economic, and environmental) on the island. Data were gathered from thirty (N=30) residents of Tobago using a qualitative approach via semi-structured interviews, analysed using thematic analysis and presented in a descriptive manner. The results indicate that tourism had not improved the quality of life for residents in Tobago, crimes committed in Tobago were conducted by homegrown criminals, and that increased crime in Tobago was not a result tourism. Four themes emanated from the study (increased crime, growth and development, localized criminals, and fear of crime). Implications for policy and practice are also discussed.
Tobago, la isla más pequeña de la República de Trinidad y Tobago, está muy turística y depende casi exclusivamente del turismo para su subsistencia. Tobago es conocida por su belleza, paz y tranquilidad, y se la suele llamar ""la capital del paraíso"". Sin embargo, el apelativo de ""Capital del Paraíso"" se está disipando debido a la creciente dependencia de los turistas y el turismo, que conlleva ""bendiciones y plagas"", como el desarrollo económico, el aumento de la delincuencia y el impacto en la calidad de vida. Aunque el turismo tiene un gran potencial para mejorar la calidad de vida de los residentes, el número de estudios realizados al respecto es limitado. Además, aunque existen algunos estudios sobre el nexo entre turismo y calidad de vida, las opiniones de los residentes en los destinos turísticos insulares apenas se utilizan para fundamentar estos estudios. Como resultado de esta laguna, el presente artículo presenta las percepciones de los residentes de Tobago, una isla turística del Caribe, sobre el impacto del turismo (local y extranjero) en la calidad de vida (sociocultural, económica y medioambiental) de la isla. Se recopilaron datos de treinta (N=30) residentes de Tobago utilizando un enfoque cualitativ"
pub.1173842583,Revisiting Nuclear Legacy in Marshall Islands: The Implications of Transitional Justice and Trans-science,"In relation to Marshall Islands, “nuclear legacy” refers to the long-term environmental, health, and socio-cultural impacts of the United States’ nuclear weapons programme conducted in the islands from 1946 to 1958. The legacy still takes a toll on the daily lives of the Marshallese. Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll, two nuclear weapon testing sites, are still largely uninhabitable, and many cancer cases have occurred among the Marshallese exposed to fallout and residual radiation. Beginning with the first petition filed with the United Nations Trusteeship Council by members of the Marshallese Congress in 1954 (Marshall Islands and United Nations Trusteeship Council in Petition from Marshallese people concerning the Pacific Islands, 1954), for 70 years Marshall Islands has condemned the injustice of nuclear testing and advocated for the need to assist its affected sites and people. As a result of their continued efforts, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution (A/HRC/RES/51/35) in October 2022, reaffirming the importance of the human rights of Marshallese people who have suffered from health and environmental damages and forced displacement. The resolution has influenced the international power balance regarding nuclear legacy issues. This chapter revisits Marshall Islands’ nuclear legacy and examines its related diplomacy. The study also addresses emerging geopolitical and institutional frameworks regarding various nuclear tests in the Pacific. Recommendations as to the ways forward are made from the perspectives of human rights, science–social relations, and the roles of Marshall Islands and the United Nations Multi-Country Office for Micronesia, implying a nexus of transitional justice and trans-scientific issues with regard to the nuclear legacy in Marshall Islands."
pub.1144683570,Chapter 5 Hybrid forward/reverse osmosis (HFRO): an approach for optimized operation and sustainable resource recovery,"Water is paramount among all resources and plays a multidisciplinary role in the water–food–energy nexus. Owing to its vital role in daily life, scarcity of water has become the biggest challenge of the 21st century. Projected situations are even more alarming, which is attributed to population growth, rapid urban sprawl, industrialization, tourism activities, and climatic variation. Given that, water reclamation using reverse osmosis (RO) has become an indispensable component of water supplies to overcome the challenge of meeting emerging water demand. However, RO membranes suffer from fouling which results in enhanced feed channel pressure, increased membrane cleaning frequency, permeate quality deterioration, and shortened membrane life. In addition, poor selectivity of RO membranes against contaminants of emerging concern found in wastewater (i.e., pharmaceuticals, personal care products, perfluoro compounds, pesticides, etc.) is distressing owing to their potential health issues. The use of a hybrid forward osmosis–reverse osmosis (FO–RO) configuration has recently emerged as an attractive approach to overcome these limitations as it demonstrates sustainable membrane performance due to the high selectivity of the FO membrane and its osmotically driven working principle. This chapter presents the configuration, applications, and benefits of hybrid FO–RO. In particular, the chapter provides a brief introduction of FO and RO, followed by their technological advancements, challenges, and limitations. The application of FO and RO as a standalone and hybrid process for wastewater reclamation, desalination, simultaneous desalination, and wastewater reclamation is presented. Furthermore, use of the combined approach for other applications such as resource recovery, concentration of challenging or sensitive liquid foods and beverages, and concentration of wastewater for subsequent treatment units are reviewed with process performance and cost optimization as the main focus. Finally, the commercially installed hybrid FO–RO plants are discussed as case studies."
pub.1140686065,Responses to Covid-19 from Kiwi hospitallers,"The global impact of COVID-19 has been dramatic and research into that impact is beginning to emerge within the tourism and hospitality literature. The research reflects both theoretical and geo-graphical/regional perspectives. Some examples are as follows: an exploration of the impact of COVID-19 on the hotel industry in China considering disaster management [1]; research into the nexus of COVID-19 and hospitality resilience [2]; the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian tourism and hospitality industry [3]; an analysis of how COVID-19 has impacted restaurant firms’ stock market returns in the United States of America [4]. In Aotearoa New Zealand, during September 2020, we conducted research with 11 providers of hospitality who were responsible for a total of 105 food and beverage outlets. Those outlets comprised of 22 cafés, 4 restaurants and 79 takeaways. The longevity of our 105 participant businesses averaged 11 years and three months. Their locations ranged from Auckland, the Central Plateau, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Invercargill. Our participant businesses are detailed in Table 1. Table 1: Details of the 11 participants and their businesses Market segment Participant’s role Number of outlets Years in business Company annual income ($) Cafés Owner 1 7.5 900k – 1m   Director 20 24 250k – 2m   CEO/owner 1 13 No response Restaurants Owner 1 6 2.8–3m   Owner 1 2 2.8–3m   Owner 1 11 1.5–1.8m   Owner 1 3 700–750k Takeaways CEO 1 22 No response   Owner 1 3 270–300k   Owner 1 13 2m   Brand manager 76 17 4–4.5m We located several themes that were important to our participants; four of them are discussed below. Theme 1: The economic impact of COVID-19 Turnover was down, and businesses had experienced reduced spending per head. However, countering that was the realisation within some businesses that COVID-19 also represented opportunities for innovation. Those opportunities were driven by factors that included the increased business use of social media, and human contact (albeit at a distance). Because customers were socially distanced, ordering from home and consequent home deliveries represented opportunities for business growth and renewal. Additionally, COVID-19 changed the labour market from an employee-driven model to one benefitting employers. Key to that was the Government’s wage subsidy scheme. Theme 2: Government policy and COVID-19 There was not universal participant support for the Government’s COVID-19 policies. For many respondents, working through policy proved stressful. Participant dissatisfaction was fuelled by comparisons to the Australian Government’s hospitality initiatives. Yet, despite that, our participants also realised that New Zealand’s ‘severe’ COVID-19 response placed the nation in a positive position for a quick business recovery. Theme 3: Government COVID-19 recovery/assistance packages Our participants anticipated that normal business would return with 18–36 months. However, they also noted that more government interventio"
pub.1093026154,Landscape Quality and Multifunctional Agriculture: The Potential of the Historic Agricultural Landscape in the Context of the Development of the Contemporary City,"If we examine the costs and benefits of agricultural activity in terms of its productivity, it is clear that the fate of the historic agricultural landscapes has been sealed for sometime. It is, however, necessary to reflect on the traditional role held by agricultural activity: it does not solely involve the production of consumer goods but also continuous and careful maintenance of the territory. But this second job is not directly compensated. The abandonment of marginal lands and the traditional forms of agriculture, the destruction and degradation of traditional irrigation systems, the removal of the walls, hedgerows and tree lines that marked borders, the neglect of roadsides and terracing, the abandonment of low-yield or unmarketable crop varieties can led to the alteration of historic ecosystems, the interruption of natural food chains, and a significant reduction in biodiversity. Desertion of the mountains and the forests has initiated processes of hydrogeological instability or put large swathes of land at risk of fire, while expected construction in peri-urban areas has discouraged any land maintenance or improvement work. Today, the costs of these phenomena are only partly at the expense of the agricultural producer, but they have certainly not disappeared, being in charge of the community. We need to promote a new way in agricultural activities and find new forms of economic support for them. It will be to seek the involvement of farmers in other, socially necessary, activity, such as hydrogeological analysis of the soil, landscape maintenance, protection of biodiversity, environmental management of the territory, cultural and environmental tourism, the preservation and management of cultural goods in rural areas, and energy saving. This is what we name ‘multifunctional’ (Huylenbroek Van and Durand (2003), Jones (2002), Plieninger and Spek (2006), Palang et al. (2015) agriculture. The paper illustrates, starting from a project realized in Milano in occasion of the 2015 Expo and promoting a multifunctional approach to agriculture, a proposal of an agricultural park for the protection of the cultural landscape of the Hakka settlements situated on the borders of the Chinese city of Hui Yang (Guangdong)."
pub.1149182941,"The Risk of Water Conflicts in Aotearoa-New Zealand, Emergence and Intensification","This book focuses on water disputes in New Zealand: a country where such conflicts are assumed to be non-existing. Rarely are water disputes examined in areas where water resources abound, and where the political framework that governs their access and use is strong. Environmental security literature has devoted a significant amount of attention to the nexus between resource abundance and conflict. Important research has assessed this relationship by focusing on non-renewable resource wealth as a causal determinant of conflict, but little is known about the conditions that influence the emergence and intensification of conflict in water abundant environments. By most accounts, New Zealand is one of the most water-rich countries in the world. Even though violent conflict over water does not normally materialize in New Zealand, conflicts and incompatible claims motivated by water bottling, the growth of some types of agriculture, tourism, and water treatment strategies, continue to surface. Little, however, is known about how and why these conflicts emerge and intensify in a country such as New Zealand. To address this lacuna, this project asks the following research question: How and why does the commercialization of freshwater influence the emergence and intensification of hydropolitical conflict in New Zealand? This study presents two central arguments. First, that the introduction of a commercial enterprise motivates the emergence of hydropolitical conflict intentionality if the enterprise is incompatible with the interests of local communities. And second, hydropolitical conflict risk intensifies in accordance with the level of trust that communities pose upon the approval and appeals process that supports a commercial operation. To test these arguments, this study examines the effects of water bottling and water chlorination on the towns of Ashburton (Canterbury) and Glenorchy (Otago), by employinga tripartite analysis comprised, first, of a conflict intentionality and engagement assessment, second, of a comparative case study analysis, and third, of a conflict intentionality classification. The data suggests that hydropolitical conflict risk is low when communities trust the approval and appeals process behind any given commercial operation. Water-based conflict risk however is likely to escalate when local communities lose trust in the above processes and the institutions that administer them."
pub.1111511047,"The Impact of Climate Change on Our Life, The Questions of Sustainability","This book introduces the highly topical issue from many different angles, sensitizing readers to the various challenges to human life posed by climate change, identifying possible intentional and inadvertent anthropogenic factors and consequences, and seeking socially and environmentally viable solutions. The book begins by examining the impact of the climate change discussion on science, politics, economy and culture – from its historical origin in the first Club of Rome Report and  its inclusion in the UN's SDGs to the Paris Agreement and beyond. Comprising 12 chapters, it analyses the factors which caused the catastrophic 2014 Kelantan flood in Malaysia, focusing on the Kuala Krai district and discusses mud architecture in Wadi Hadramout, Yemen and mitigating the expected effects of climate change on this unique architecture and cultural heritage. It also examines the economic costs of climate change on health and the increased burden on individual expenditures and national health systems. The role of climate change in the water-energy nexus and efforts to increase efficiency in energy and water end-use to increase Queensland’s agricultural sector’s resilience in Australia is addressed, as is water security and climate change issues in developing countries and the potential of partnership procurement strategies for managing sustainable urban water supply in Nigerian cities. It also includes a chapter offering a new approach to waste management, exploring to what extent waste can complicate our daily actions and influence environmental decay, and recommending that renewable materials be sorted and separated from other types of materials to avoid cross-contamination, to increase the value of the materials, and to ease the process of manufacturing. Subsequent chapters identify factors sustaining the municipal solid waste management and practices in Ajdabiya city in Libya, and look at accounting disclosure remedies by exploring areas in which sustainability reporting could expand beyond corporate environmental reporting to additional disclosures, curbing recklessness in pursuing merely economic goals. The book shows – from the perspective of agriculture – how human activities can increase the negative impacts of climate change on lifestyle in Malaysia, suggesting alternative lifestyles and encouraging international cooperative efforts. The last chapters evaluate the impacts of various environmental factors on the local tourism sector in Pakistan, and discuss strategies to tackle climate change, focusing on the opportunities and risks of climate engineering. Since these risks encompass inadvertent negative effects and targeted abuse for covert weather warfare and terrorism that violate the UN’s ENMOD convention, the author recommends viable alternatives to deal with climate change."
pub.1036800738,Second Homes and Regional Population Distribution: On Administrative Practices and Failures in Sweden,"Résidences secondaires et répartition régionale de la population : des pratiques administratives et de leurs échecs en Suède.  Dans l'ensemble du monde industrialisé, suite au développement de formes flexibles de travail et à l'émergence de modes de vie plus mobiles chez les retraités, les ménages disposent d'une capacité croissante à répartir leur temps entre plusieurs lieux distincts, ce qui a renouvelé leur intérêt pour l'acquisition de résidences secondaires. Cet attrait renouvelé a particulièrement bénéficié aux zones rurales où la consommation des ménages de seconds résidents contribue aux activités économiques locales. Toutefois, le séjour, souvent long, dans les résidences secondaires amène à se demander si, en définitive, celles-ci ne sont pas des premières résidences, du moins sous l'angle de la relation que les propriétaires entretiennent avec elles. En raison du lien existant entre le volume de la population régionale, le niveau d'imposition et les transferts publics, la réponse à pareille question est cruciale. En effet, en tant que touristes, les propriétaires de résidences secondaires ne sont pas enregistrés dans la municipalité hôte comme résidents : leur présence impose des coûts croissants pour la collectivité locale en matière d'offre de services mais sans bénéfice via les transferts publics. L'objet du présent article est de mettre en évidence la distribution spatiale de la population saisonnière et d'estimer son impact sur les structures démographiques et économiques des zones rurales. Une base de données géographiques originale, couvrant l'ensemble des résidences secondaires en Suède, est mobilisée pour examiner cette question. À partir de l'exemple de la Suède, il est démontré que les pratiques administratives actuelles désavantagent les municipalités rurales sur le plan financier.
The increased capacity of households to allocate their time in several places as a result of both the growth of new flexible forms of work and a more mobile retirement lifestyle has contributed to a renewed interest in second homeownership all over the industrialized world. This has been of particular benefit to rural areas where the consumption of second home households contributes to rural business. However, the often long-lasting visits to second homes raises question as to whether second homes are, in reality, first homes in terms of the owners' relationship to place. The answer to this question is of considerable importance due to the nexus between regional population figures, taxation and public transfers. Considered as tourists, the second homeowners are, however, not registered in the host community thereby leaving municipalities with increased costs for service supply, but without benefits from public transfers. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to uncover the hidden seasonal population patterns caused by second home tourism and to estimate their impact on the demographic and economic structure of rural areas.

pub.1174869784,A case study of economic development through sanitation interventions in African countries,"Abstract The novelty of the study is based on the empirical examination of the impact of water and sanitation improvements on economic development outcomes in selected African countries. While previous research has primarily focused on the macroeconomic effects of water resources or broad development indicators, this study takes a more granular and comprehensive approach to unpack the nuanced relationship between various water and sanitation variables and a range of economic development outcomes. This study's aim is threefold: first to examine the influence of different dimensions of water and sanitation improvements (e.g., access, quality, reliability) on economic development; second; focus on the potential mediating factors that water and sanitation interventions affect economic development; finally, propose policy implications for designing sustainable water and sanitation programs to promote inclusive and resilient economic growth in less developed countries. By addressing these questions, the findings of this research paper contribute significantly to the academic understanding of the water‐sanitation‐economic development nexus, particularly in the understudied African context. The study provides valuable, context‐specific insights that can inform policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking evidence‐based strategies to foster sustainable development through targeted water and sanitation interventions. This research highlights the positive association between water and sanitation improvements and a range of economic development outcomes, including GDP, employment, foreign investment, and tourism. The results underscore the substantial potential economic benefits of investing in sanitary infrastructure and reliable sanitation systems, making a stronger case for prioritizing water and sanitation as key drivers of sustainable development in less developed countries. Overall, this research paper fills an important gap in the literature and offers crucial insights to promote inclusive and resilient economic growth through water and sanitation interventions in Africa and beyond.
摘要 本研究对“水和卫生设施的改善对选定非洲国家的经济发展成果的影响”一事进行了实证研究。虽然以往研究主要聚焦于水资源或广泛发展指标的宏观经济影响, 但本研究采取了更细致和全面的方法来揭示“水和卫生设施的不同变量”与“一系列经济发展成果”之间的微妙关系。本研究有三个目的:第一, 研究水和卫生设施改善的不同维度 (例如, 获取、质量、可靠性)对经济发展的影响。第二, 聚焦于“水和卫生设施干预措施影响经济发展”一事的潜在中介因素。第三, 提出一系列政策启示, 用于设计可持续水和卫生设施计划以促进欠发达国家经济增长的包容性和弹性。通过研究这些问题, 本研究论文的结果对关于水‐卫生设施‐经济发展关系的学术理解作出了重大贡献, 特别是在研究不足的非洲情境下。本研究提供了有价值的、针对具体情境的见解, 这些见解能为“寻求循证战略以通过有针对性的水和卫生设施干预促进可持续发展”的政策制定者、从业者和研究人员提供参考。本研究强调了水和卫生设施改善与一系列经济发展成果 (包括国内生产总值、就业、外国投资和旅游业)之间的正相关关系。研究结果强调了“投资卫生基础设施和可靠的卫生设施系统”一事所带来的巨大潜在经济效益, 这更有理由将水和卫生设施作为欠发达国家可持续发展的关键驱动力。总体而言, 本篇研究论文填补了文献中的一个重要空白, 并提供了重要见解, 用于通过水和卫生设施干预以促进非洲及其他地区经济增长的包容性和弹性。.

pub.1131719080,Revisiting Mackay Online,"IntroductionIn July 1997, the Mackay campus of Central Queensland University hosted a conference with the theme Regional Australia: Visions of Mackay. It was the first academic conference to be held at the young campus, and its aim was to provide an opportunity for academics, business people, government officials, and other interested parties to discuss their visions for the development of Mackay, a regional community of 75,000 people situated on the Central Queensland coast (Danaher). I delivered a presentation at that conference and authored a chapter in the book that emerged from its proceedings. The chapter entitled “Mackay Online” explored the potential impact that the Internet could have on the Mackay region, particularly in the areas of regional business, education, health, and entertainment (Pace). Two decades later, how does the reality compare with that vision?Broadband BluesAt the time of the Visions of Mackay conference, public commercial use of the Internet was in its infancy. Many Internet services and technologies that users take for granted today were uncommon or non-existent then. Examples include online video, video-conferencing, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), blogs, social media, peer-to-peer file sharing, payment gateways, content management systems, wireless data communications, smartphones, mobile applications, and tablet computers. In 1997, most users connected to the Internet using slow dial-up modems with speeds ranging from 28.8 Kbps to 33.6 Kbps. 56 Kbps modems had just become available. Lamenting these slow data transmission speeds, I looked forward to a time when widespread availability of high-bandwidth networks would allow the Internet’s services to “expand to include electronic commerce, home entertainment and desktop video-conferencing” (Pace 103). Although that future eventually arrived, I incorrectly anticipated how it would arrive.In 1997, Optus and Telstra were engaged in the rollout of hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) networks in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane for the Optus Vision and Foxtel pay TV services (Meredith). These HFC networks had a large amount of unused bandwidth, which both Telstra and Optus planned to use to provide broadband Internet services. Telstra's Big Pond Cable broadband service was already available to approximately one million households in Sydney and Melbourne (Taylor), and Optus was considering extending its cable network into regional Australia through partnerships with smaller regional telecommunications companies (Lewis). These promising developments seemed to point the way forward to a future high-bandwidth network, but that was not the case. A short time after the Visions of Mackay conference, Telstra and Optus ceased the rollout of their HFC networks in response to the invention of Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), a technology that increases the bandwidth of copper wire and enables Internet connections of up to 6 Mbps over the existing phone network. ADSL was sign"
pub.1131718931,Enabling Capabilities: Innovation and Development in the Outer Hebrides,"Image 1: View from Geodha Sgoilt towards the sea stacks, Uig, Isle of Lewis. Image credit: George Jaramillo.IntroductionOver the cliffs of Mangerstadh on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis, is a small plot of land called Geodha Sgoilt that overlooks the North Atlantic Ocean (Image 1). On the site is a small dirt gravel road and the remnants of a World War II listening station. Below, sea stacks rise from the waters, orange and green cliff sides stand in defiance to the crashing waves. An older gentleman began to tell me of what he believed could be located here on the site. A place where visitors could learn of the wonders of St Kilda that contained all types of new storytelling technologies to inspire them. He pointed above the ruined buildings, mentioning that a new road for the visitors’ vehicles and coaches would be built. With his explanations, you could almost imagine such a place on these cliffs. Yet, before that new idea could even be built, this gentleman and his group of locals and incomers had to convince themselves and others that this new heritage centre was something desired, necessary and inevitable in the development of the Western Isles.This article explores the developing relationships that come about through design innovation with community organisations. This was done through a partnership between an academic institution and a non-profit heritage community group as part of growing study in how higher education design research can play an active partner in community group development. It argues for the use of design thinking and innovation in improving strategy and organisational processes within non-profit organisations. In this case, it looks at what role it can play in building and enabling organisational confidence in its mission, as well as, building “beyond the museum”. The new approach to this unique relationship casts new light towards working with complexities and strategies rather than trying to resolve issues from the outset of a project. These enabling relationships are divided into three sections of this paper: First it explores the context of the island community group and “building” heritage, followed by a brief history of St Kilda and its current status, and designation as a World Heritage site. Second, it seeks the value of developing strategy and the introduction of the Institute of Design Innovation (INDI). This is followed by a discussion of the six-month relationship and work that was done that elucidates various methods used and ending with its outcomes. The third section reflects upon the impacts at the relationship building between the two groups with some final thoughts on the partnership, where it can lead, and how this can represent new ways of working together within community groups. Building HeritageCurrent community research in Scotland has shown struggles in understanding issues within community capability and development (Barker 11; Cave 20; Jacuniak-Suda, and Mose 23) though most focus on the "
pub.1131720132,Counterculture and Alternative Media in Utopian Contexts: A Slice of Life from the Rainbow Region,"Introduction    Utopia has always been countercultural, and ever since technological progress has allowed, utopia has been using alternative media to promote and strengthen its underpinning ideals. In this article, I am seeking to clarify the connections between counterculture and alternative media in utopian contexts to demonstrate their reciprocity, then draw together these threads through reference to a well-known figure of the Rainbow Region–Rusty Miller. His trajectory from iconic surfer and Aquarian reporter to mediator for utopian politics and ideals in the Rainbow Region encompasses in a single identity the three elements underpinning this study. In concluding, I will turn to Rusty’s Byron Guide, questioning its classification as alternative or mainstream media, and whether Byron Bay is represented as countercultural and utopian in this long-running and ongoing publication.     Counterculture and Alternative Media in Utopian Contexts    Counterculture is an umbrella that enfolds utopia, among many other genres and practices. It has been most often situated in the 1960s and 1970s as a new form of social movement embodying youth resistance to the technocratic mainstream and its norms of gender, sexuality, politics, music, and language (Roszak). Many scholars of counterculture underscore its utopian impulses both in the projection of better societies where the social goals are achieved, and in the withdrawal from mainstream society into intentional communities (Yinger 194-6; McKay 5; Berger). Before exploring further the connections between counterculture and alternative media, I want to define the scope of countercultural utopian contexts in general, and the Rainbow Region in particular.     Utopia is a neologism created by Sir Thomas More almost 500 years ago to designate the island community that demonstrates order, harmony, justice, hope and desire in the right balance so that it seems like an ideal land. This imaginary place described in Utopia (1516) as a counterpoint to the social, political and religious shortcomings of contemporary 16th century British society, has attracted accusations of heresy (Molner), and been used as a pejorative term, an insult to denigrate political projects that seem farfetched or subversive, especially during the 19th century. Almost every study of utopian theory, literature and practice points to a dissatisfaction with the status quo, which inspires writers, politicians, architects, artists, individuals and communities to rail against it (see for example Davis, Moylan, Suvin, Levitas, Jameson). Kingsley Widmer’s book Counterings: Utopian Dialectics in Contemporary Contexts reiterates what many scholars have stated when he writes that utopias should be understood in terms of what they are countering. Lyman Tower Sargent defines utopia as “a non-existent society described in considerable detail and normally located in time and space” and utopianism as “social dreaming” (9), to which I would add that both in"

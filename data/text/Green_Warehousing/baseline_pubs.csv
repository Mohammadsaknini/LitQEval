pub.1147188227,Green grain warehousing: bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review,"Grain warehousing contributes persistent environmental effects in the food supply chain because of its long-term storage feature and distribution requirements. Thus, it has attracted a number of interdisciplinary researchers to the investigations of green grain warehousing (GGW) over the past decades. This paper presents a valuable comprehensive literature review on the existing publications on this topic via bibliometric analysis and systematic review based on 37 papers obtained from three common international academic databases, namely Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. We concluded a framework of existing literature with proposing three macro-themes (energy-saving in transporting, environmental harmony, and green deinsectization) as well as a classification of commonly used methods. The results revealed that (1) the increase in research interests over years was found; (2) there are differences in the attention of GGW among countries. Most of the scholars from developing countries focused more on the green operational technologies or strategies, while most of the scholars from developed countries placed their research focuses on keeping grain quality and developing environment-friendly deinsectization approaches with low emission or chemical alternatives; (3) grain quality started to become the most popular hotspot in recent years; (4) the researchers tended to use more comprehensive methodologies or combined methods to conduct their works. Accordingly, we proposed potential research directions. The contribution of this work is to extend current literature and to offer reference to scholars and practitioners for future research and operation in GGW."
pub.1160762931,Sustainable production-inventory system for perishables under dynamic fuel pricing and preservation technology investment,"Abstract
In the production and inventory management of perishables, environmental considerations are gaining prominence. By reducing carbon emissions from various supply chain processes, such as production, transportation, warehousing, and waste disposal of perishable items, the present study aims to minimize the overall cost to the manufacturer through an optimized investment in green technology. Additionally, cycle time and preservation technology investment are optimized to decrease deterioration and revenue loss in order to minimize cost. The originality of the present research lies in the following considerations. Due to an increase in fuel price, the transportation cost of every subsequent order will also increase, thus resulting in an increase of average delivery cost in a production cycle. We investigate the impact of changes in fuel prices on transportation costs and production inventory model policies due to the volatile nature of fuel prices. The function of transportation cost can be used to calculate transport costs in the future. The deterioration rate is a random variable with a double triangular distribution. Precisely, the demand for any product depends on the product’s price; therefore, linear price-dependent demand is considered. Per unit production cost is a function of direct material cost, tooling cost, and manpower cost. Taking into account all the aforementioned parameters, this paper simultaneously optimizes green technology investment, preservation investment, and cycle time. To achieve the solution of the proposed sustainable production system, an optimization technique for the nonlinear function is employed. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the model. A special case of a numerical example demonstrates that the expected value of the total average cost is reduced by 10.723% when investments are made in both green and preservation technology, whereas investments in green technology alone result in a cost reduction of only 2.15%. Then, managerial implications and a discussion of findings are proposed after a sensitivity analysis that examines the model’s response to key parameter variation. The study concludes with a discussion of the limitations of current work and possible future scopes."
pub.1148219287,Quality and selling price dependent sustainable perishable inventory policy: Lessons from Covid-19 pandemic,"This paper addresses the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on the warehousing of perishable items facing demand-side shocks, mainly those with selling price and product quality dependent demand, for example, fresh fruits, meats, vegetables, packed foods, etc. Along with demand-side issues, such an inventory system consumes a significant amount of energy in terms of freshness, increasing carbon tax and dwindling the firm's total profit. We formulate two-warehouse inventory models of perishables items using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) dispatching policy under two different Covid-19 lockdown scenarios. The two-warehouse system primarily consists of an owned warehouse (OW) and a rented warehouse (RW). Two different lockdown scenarios are considered as; (i) the lockdown during the consumption of goods in OW and (ii) the lockdown during the consumption of goods in RW. The demand rate is assumed to decline and surge by a finite volume as lockdown is forced and relaxed. The proposed models help in assessing the impact of lockdown on (i) product quality, (ii) product cost, (iii) inventory level, (iv) freshness keeping efforts, (v) investment in green technologies, and (vi) carbon cap and trade policy. We determine the above six parameters to maximize the firm's total profit. The key findings of this model suggest that yield is primarily affected due to carbon cap and trade policy, lockdown period, item price, backlogging, and variation in the holding costs in OW and RW. These models may assist the small, medium, and large firms involved in perishable or cold supply chains to assess the effect of Covid-19 like disruption and take corrective measures to maximize their profit."
pub.1159369729,A scenario-based sustainable dual-channel closed-loop supply chain design with pickup and delivery considering social conditions in a natural disaster under uncertainty: a real-life case study,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing the potential of online markets to sell products has become increasingly important for creating competitive advantages and ensuring the growth and survival of businesses. The pandemic has disrupted traditional business practices, and with social distancing measures in place, consumers have turned to online channels to meet their needs. As a result, businesses that have adapted quickly to online markets have been able to maintain their customer base and revenue streams. Thus, considering the potential of online markets is of utmost importance in the current pandemic situation. In this regard, the present research aims to provide a practical framework for creating a green and sustainable closed-loop supply chain network (SCLSCN), including the integration of online markets, to assist managers in making decisions that support economic, environmental, and social goals. Accordingly, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) optimization model was designed under uncertain demand and disruption caused by natural disasters in Iran's home appliance industry. The study also considered changes in the capacities of online and marketplace sales channels, revealing a significant reduction in costs at each stage. The results show that the increase in demand has a direct impact on the production level, warehousing, and transportation costs, leading to social impacts on the model. However, the current system cannot handle an increase in demand of more than 20%, requiring managers to make decisions to increase production capacity or build new factories. Thus, the study highlights the importance of considering online markets as a means to adapt to disruptions caused by the pandemic and maintain a competitive edge."

This chapter explores the consequence of risk warehousing, focusing on the warehousing of credit risk and to do so follows the approach of Kenyon and Green. One consequence of risk warehousing is the presence of profits and losses, which are subject to taxation. This leads directly to the introduction of Tax Valuation Adjustment (TVA). The effect of including tax is to give rise to a further XVA, TVA. In the case of risk warehousing tax will come into play in two different situations. The chapter discusses taxation, credit valuation adjustment (CVA), hedging and regulatory capital, warehousing CVA risk and double semi‐replication. The introduction of double semi‐replication has led to a set of equation where there is a potential optimisation."
pub.1167594102,Low-carbon supply chain coordination through dual contracts considering pareto-efficiency,"Considering the growing green awareness and increasingly stringent emission regulations, heavy-emitting supply chains are required to re-schedule their operations for environmental responsibility. Although coordination helps the supply chains overcome the decentralised disadvantages to achieve desirable profits, literature considering option contracts under emission constraints, especially combining warehousing contracts, remains scarce. This paper fills this research gap with the novelty in the dual-contract-coordinated decision analysis for achieving profit maximum and emission reduction targets considering customers’ green awareness through option and warehousing contracts, based on the originality of using the Lagrange-Stackelberg optimisation method, which overcomes the difficulty in expressing the first-mover’s decisions and simplifies the problem-solving process. Analytical and numerical results show that Pareto-efficient coordination can be fully achieved by the option contract if the warehousing contract ensures the same inventory costs before and after coordination. Otherwise, partial coordination also raises insiders’ profitability only through the option contract. Purchasing extra emissions with green investment is the best in most cases. The contract-maker should deliberate its contract settings including the option and wholesale prices, as well as warehousing, to develop Pareto-efficient coordination. Sustainability comes at a cost, but coordination raises profitability and emission mitigation in a well-built ETS market."

Such measures are examined by discussing the related impacts, motivations and barriers that could influence the measures' adoption. Starting from the framework, directions for future research in this field are outlined.   Design/methodology/approach The proposed framework was developed starting from a systematic literature review (SLR) approach on 60 papers published from 2008 to 2022 in international peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings.   Findings The framework identifies six main areas of intervention (“green strategies”) towards green warehousing, namely Building, Utilities, Lighting, Material Handling and Automation, Materials and Operational Practices. For each strategy, specific energy-efficiency measures and solutions towards environmental impact reduction are further pinpointed. In most cases, “green-gold” measures emerge as the most appealing, entailing environmental and economic benefits at the same time. Finally, for each measure the relationship with the measures' primary impacts is discussed.   Originality/value From an academic viewpoint, the framework fills a major gap in the scientific literature since, for the first time, this study elaborates the concept of green warehousing as a result of energy-efficiency measures and solutions towards environmental impact reduction. A classification of the main areas of intervention (“green strategies”) is proposed by adopting a holistic approach. From a managerial perspective, the paper addresses a compelling need of practitioners – e.g. logistics service providers (LSPs), manufacturers and retailers – for practices and solutions towards greener warehousing processes to increase energy efficiency and decrease the environmental impact of the practitioners' logistics facilities. In this sense, the proposed framework can provide valuable support for logistics managers that are about to approach the challenge of turning the managers' warehouses into greener nodes of the managers' supply chains.

pub.1004792390,A Nonlinear Integer Programming Model for Warehousing Sustainable Logistics,"The warehouse management problem is a critical issue in Operation Management. In modern competitive market, many firms are automating their basic warehouse activities in order to be cost effective. However, traditional mechanized warehousing systems (MWS) still represent the 75 % of the overall installations. In MWS, forklifts are adopted for the load handling. The adoption of efficient “internal logistic strategies” could help in reducing time required and costs of warehousing activities. In recent years, many firms adopted green supply chain practices (GSCP) in order to improve their environmental performances while also achieving economic goals (Wu et al. 2015). Furthermore, in planning Smart City logistics, warehousing in port or railway station storage areas is being receiving wide attention since they contribute effectively to a sustainable development of modern cities. Under this perspective, an optimal “internal logistic strategy” allowing to jointly minimizing jointly costs and environmental impacts of warehousing activities has to be adopted. The aim of this study is to develop a Nonlinear Integer Programming Model to solve a storage location assignment problem (SLAP) for optimizing the environmental performance of the internal logistic activities in a warehouse. Suitable storage strategies are identified on the basis of the type of the forklifts adopted (internal combustion or electric engine equipped) as well as the sizes and the weight of the loads to be handled."

pub.1173737570,Enhanced Green Logistics: Sustainable Distribution and Warehousing with IMU Positioning,"Abstract The objective of the green logistics distribution model is to minimise environmental pollution and energy usage by employing clean energy, optimising transport routes and enhancing transport efficiency. Nonetheless, current studies on green logistics distribution models and warehousing planning exhibit certain drawback, such as imprecise location accuracy and decreased distribution revenues. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach that combines inertial measurement unit (IMU) and binocular vision, leveraging multisource information positioning. Specifically, the method integrates data collection and preprocessing modules to gather crucial logistics distribution task information, encompassing IMU data, image data and vehicle data. The visual and inertial positioning module consists of two components: visual positioning based on the grey centre method and IMU positioning based on the integral essence. Finally, an adaptive Kalman filter is employed to merge the results of visual positioning and IMU positioning, thus producing the ultimate logistics vehicle positioning result. The proposed method effectively addresses existing challenges in the green logistics distribution model and warehouse planning. In particular, the experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed in this study reduces the location error by 8%. Furthermore, logistics and distribution costs are reduced by 11 %, contributing to the promotion of sustainable and environmentally friendly logistics operations."

pub.1168652441,A Novel Parts-to-Picker System with Buffer Racks and Access Racks in Flexible Warehousing Systems,"With the tremendous development of the logistics industry, the global market of automated warehousing has been growing rapidly. Meanwhile, the warehousing industry shows drawbacks, such as low storage capacity and poor efficiency. By comparing and analyzing the shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS), miniload automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS), and KIVA system, a novel efficient parts-to-picker approach in flexible warehousing systems is proposed. Among them, buffer racks and access racks, associated with the access of automated mobile robots (AMRs) and stackers are used. The results show that compared with other parts-to-picker systems (such as the KIVA system), this system provides a significant increase in storage capacity (more than three times), and the picking efficiency is also very high at various layout scales, where the picking efficiency is no less than the KIVA system when the number of AMRs reaches the max. The novel system is suitable for small-, medium-, and large-scale warehouses in terms of showing high capacity and producing excellent space utilization. More importantly, this system can easily compete with its traditional counterparts by using a layout of high density without much increase in cost. This sustainable improvement realizes the efficient utilization of spatial resources and provides important support for the construction of green supply chains."

pub.1160541393,Why are Sustainable Warehouses Imperative to Green Supply chains in India? A Comprehensive Outlook of Present Status and Initiatives,"Population, production, and consumption are experiencing an ever-increasing clash with environmental, economic, and social difficulties as India quickly progresses towards overtaking China as the world's fifth-largest economy in terms of GDP and already surpasses China of sheer numbers. The nation's warehousing industry is seeing unprecedented expansion due to the ever-increasing demand from this vast populace, which, in contrast to other countries, is statistically superior in the median age of the below-30 age group and their consumption needs across sectors. Also, this sizable population is gravitating more and more towards buying goods and services from suppliers who make a point of publicizing their sustainability activities in storing these goods in light of the mounting damage that people are inflicting on the health of the earth. The widespread use of social media and its built-in advertising capabilities continue to play a significant but growing role in communicating these benefits to the general public. In addition to relying largely on road transport, India's logistics environment is seeing a proliferation of warehouses to support distribution, value-added services, and storage. Even though transportation contributes mainly to the carbon footprint of logistics, warehouses are a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and score well on the sustainability index (SI). Compared to innovations used to reduce emissions in the transportation vertical, green warehousing projects are still in their infancy. As a result, this study analyses the existing situation and sketches out the roadmap required to take advantage of the opportunity to reduce emissions in the Indian warehousing sector while steadfastly retaining economic viability."

pub.1137875525,Energy Consumption in a Distributional Warehouse: A Practical Case Study for Different Warehouse Technologies,"Energy consumption by distribution warehouses has become an essential component of green warehousing and research on reducing the carbon footprint of supply chains. Energy consumption in warehousing is a complex and multilayered problem, which is generally considered in the literature in relation to its detailed components, not as part of comparative studies. In this article, the authors consider six cross-sectional variants of warehouse technology, from manual to fully automatic, and analyze the energy consumption of a warehouse in various configurations. A methodology for estimating storage space and determining energy consumption is proposed. The energy balance of the warehouse variants includes energy for material handling equipment operation, energy consumption for building maintenance (heating, cooling, lighting, etc.), and energy generated by the photovoltaic system on the roof. Then, the operational costs of the variants are estimated and, on their basis, an automation index is determined. The index allows for a comparative analysis of energy consumption and the mechanization and automation of a warehouse. It is shown that a significant part of the energy is spent on maintaining a warehouse building, especially in the case of facilities with a low degree of automation."

pub.1110319268,Greening up in logistics: Managerial perceptions of small and medium-sized enterprises on sustainability in Zimbabwe,"‘Sustainability’ and ‘going green’ have become buzzwords in today’s business world. In logistics, greening up in a sustainable way in the future suggests the need to identify innovative measures that go beyond merely reducing carbon emissions. The purpose of this article was to explore managerial perceptions on green logistics barriers, applications and the importance of green logistics in Zimbabwean small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A qualitative research approach that utilised semi-structured interviews to collect data from five SME managers and one government official was used. Using a thematic deductive line-by-line content analysis approach, this article principally found that internal barriers such as costs, lack of resources and knowledge are major barriers impeding the adoption and application of green logistics in Zimbabwean SMEs. Poor infrastructure and roads were reported to be the common external barriers of green logistics adoption in SMEs. The article also found that most of the participant SMEs in Zimbabwe were not yet applying green logistics, although some were striving towards practising packaging optimisation, warehousing, inventory management optimisation, along with transport optimisation and efficiency (particularly, route optimisation and fuel efficiency). From the themes, the study found that green logistics is important to the few environmentally conscious SMEs. The importance of green logistics identified were the creation of brand loyalty, good brand image, the possibility of attracting government support, cost saving, as well as improving the firm’s profitability in the long run. Conclusions were drawn and recommendations to both firms and government were made."

pub.1173485223,Transport sector technological shifts and intersectoral linkages in Latvia,"The rapid changes in the transport and logistics sector in connection with various major global events have shown the strengths and weaknesses of each country’s economy. The study uses general scientific research methods (analysis, synthesis, induction and deduction). The paper is based on principles of generalization, concretization and abstraction. The input-output model together with other methods are applied to identify current and model future trends. Technological shifts in land transport (NACE H49) and warehousing and support services (H52) are examined and modelled, as well as the cross-sectoral impact and overall economic performance. The results argue that due to the replacement of technologies and external factors, land transport has increased value added per unit produced in 2010-2020. Findings justify the claim that land transport has the potential to apply more efficient technologies to increase wages and use additional profit for investments demanded by the EU Green Deal. However, the warehousing and support services have relatively lower value added per unit produced, and due to external shocks and global events, no notable improvements have been identified. Policymakers are recommended to elaborate more focused policy activities to ensure that sustainable solutions result in a competitive transport sector."

pub.1157128445,SSD-Based Carton Packaging Quality Defect Detection System for the Logistics Supply Chain,"Abstract With the deepening of green and sustainable development and the rapid development of the social economy, the modern logistics industry has also developed to an unprecedented level. In the logistics supply chain, due to the high value of the items inside the arrival carton, appearance inspection must be carried out before warehousing. However, manual inspection is slow and ineffective, resulting in the waste of manpower and packaging carton resources, which is not conducive to sustainable development. To address the above problems, this paper designs a logistics supply chain carton packaging quality defect detection system based on improved Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) in the context of green sustainable development. The Implicit Feature Pyramid Network (IFPN) is introduced into SSD to improve the feature extraction ability of the model; the multiscale attention mechanism is introduced to collect more feature information. The experiment shows that the mAP and FPS of the system on the self-built data set reach 0.9662 and 36 respectively, which can realise the detection of the appearance defects of logistics cartons and help promote green sustainable development."

pub.1008985317,Integration of logistics outsourcing decisions in a green supply chain design: A stochastic multi-objective multi-period multi-product programming model,"This paper develops a programming model, which combines logistics outsourcing decisions with some strategic Supply Chains’ planning issues, such as the Security of supplies, the customer Segmentation, and the Extended Producer Responsibility. The purpose is to minimize both the expected logistics cost and the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions of the Supply Chain (SC) network, in the context of business environment uncertainty. First, we define a general structure of the closed-loop SC. Second, we provide constructive models to roughly estimate the insourcing and outsourcing logistics costs, and their corresponding GHG emissions. Third, we establish a stochastic plan based on a scenarios approach to capture the uncertainty od demand, capacity of facilities, quantity and quality of returns of used products, and the transportation, warehousing, and reprocessing costs. Fourth, we suggest a programming model, and an algorithm based on the Epsilon-constraint method to solve it. The result is a set of optimal non-dominant green SC configurations, which provide the decision’ makers with optimal levels of logistics outsourcing integration within a decarbonized Supply Chain, before any further low-carbon investment."
pub.1181939432,Green warehousing practices: Assessing the impact of PV self-consumption enhancement strategies in a logistics warehouse,"Logistics facilities, while critical to industrial systems, significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating improved operations, energy use, and renewable energy integration. The use of distributed renewable energy sources, with their intermittent and unpredictable generation, disrupts energy balance and leads to curtailment issues. This places a significant load on the electrical grid, increasing emissions and environmental problems, hindering the effective use of renewable energy. To address these challenges, modifications can be made to existing warehouses to increase their self-consumption. Empirical studies assessing the impact of such modifications, particularly in the logistics field, are lacking. This work contributes to the ongoing research by proposing a simulation-based approach that evaluates multiple scenarios for a real-world logistics facility to enhance the self-consumption ratio. This analysis is based on a conceptual framework providing a roadmap towards sustainable warehousing practices. The study simulates and presents multiple scenarios, including the base case, electrification of the heating system, and an opportunity charging strategy for MHE, aiming to enhance self-consumption, while examining environmental and economic performances, followed by a sensitivity analysis. Findings demonstrate a 25% increase in self-consumption and significant energy consumption reduction (-110 MWh/year) and CO2e emissions (-67.8 tons CO2e/year) for the final proposed scenario."

Commodities from energy sources derived from fossil fuels are becoming increasingly expensive with the embargo against the largest oil and gas producing country in Europe, namely Russia, making world oil and gas prices soar in 2022. Likewise, conditions in Indonesia where the largest non-reversible energy source produced, namely coal for most of our power plants, has also increased due to soaring demand in other parts of the world that lack oil and gas due to the effects of war. So this study looks at and observes directly the application of solar panel technology and innovation with solar energy sources that are converted into electrical energy for lighting needs in the fields of plantations, mining, warehousing and also in the marine sector for the needs of fishing boats. The results of this study indicate a very good level of feasibility in the warehousing and marine business sectors. We can maximize this solar panel because there are abundant sources of sunlight in Indonesia, so that a circular economy will be created in terms of the utilization of energy sources and will end in the creation of a green environment because sunlight is a renewable energy source that is so environmentally friendly and on a large macro scale it also will help the government to reduce subsidies for fuel oil due to use in the marine sector which is very dependent on this energy."

pub.1110531779,Green supply chain network design: A review focused on policy adoption and emission quantification,"We review the literature on green supply chain network design between 2010 and mid 2017, focusing primarily on models and methodologies that explicitly include carbon emissions and environmental policies. We find that supply chain network design has mostly incorporated four policies: carbon cap, carbon offset, cap-and-trade and carbon tax. All four policies succeed to achieve substantial emission reductions with a slight increase in total cost; mostly by configuring the supply chain to use lower-emitting resources. We investigate the prevalent sources of emissions within the supply chain. As expected, transportation contributes about one third, followed by power-intensive processes such as manufacturing, storage and warehousing. Other sources are raw material extraction and sourcing, facility construction and operation, and disposal. We observe that there is a lack of models that capture the complex nature of emissions. Nonlinear tax rates, multivariate emission functions and uncertainty are only considered in few papers. But most importantly, we find that the effect of emissions on demand is rarely accounted for."

                    Design/methodology/approach
                    An integrative review of extant literature on green human resource management and sustainable green logistics was conducted, and an integrative model developed.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Improving environmental performance is a key way that businesses can improve their corporate social responsibility and brand image. The resulting model includes expanded components of GHRM (training, development, compensation, awards and recognition, recruitment, and performance management) and of SGLOG (transportation and shipping, warehousing, packaging, and reverse logistics). Categories of shipping and transportation include the following facets: transportation intensity, modal split, emissions intensity, energy efficiency, and vehicle utilization efficiency. The model also highlights the mediating role of management and employee attitudes, knowledge, and skills in the GHRM-SGLOG link, as well as their interaction.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    Green human resource management is associated with sustainable green logistics. This association is theoretically mediated by management and employee attitudes, knowledge, and skills. Top management support and influence of other stakeholders are key facilitators.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications

pub.1150750410,Conceptual principles of the green technologies introduction in the logistics activities of Ukrainian companies in the context of the implementation of European environmental programs,"The article reveals the essence of the conceptual approach to ""green"" technologies in the logistics activities of enterprises. The concept of ""green"" technologies has been clarified as technologies that use environmentally safe production processes and supply chains in comparison with the production methods traditionally used at enterprises. The role and opportunities of Ukrainian environmental logistics in the European Green Deal have been studied. It has been established that the European Green Deal is a program of the European Union aimed at protecting the climate and the environment. This program is aimed at making the economies of the European Union countries more resource-efficient, canceling greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and separating economic growth from the use of natural resources. Currently, Ukraine is only planning to join the European Green Deal, declaring in the National Economic Strategy the intention to achieve climate neutrality by 2060. The state and general trends of the development of strategic logistics infrastructure projects of Ukraine in the context of the implementation of the Green Deal and Digital Europe programs are analyzed. The Europian Green Deal is a dynamic instrument that is at the stage of formation. The purpose of the article is the development of theoretical and methodological foundations, applied recommendations regarding the prospects of ""green"" technologies in the logistics activities of Ukrainian enterprises: their concepts and features of implementation within the framework of the European Green Deal and Digital Europe programs, ""European Union for the Environment"" (EU4Environment), development of sustainable logistics in Ukraine, features of application in specific logistics processes, problems and prospects, logistics strategy of Ukrainian enterprises. The process of applying ""green"" technologies in supply chain management is analyzed. In the logistics chain, processes related to supply, production, warehousing, transportation and distribution are involved, therefore, logistics activities are focused not only on the internal business processes of the enterprise, but also have a significant impact on the environment and contribute to the emergence of negative environmental consequences. In connection with the above, the concept of ""green"" (sustainable) supply chains, which provides for a minimal harmful impact on the environment during the implementation of logistics business processes, has recently become widespread."

pub.1136574850,A sustainable inventory model with controllable carbon emissions in green-warehouse farms,"Global warming has become a sensitive issue, and many countries are trying to control CO2 emissions by investing in many projects and promoting green industrial practices. This study proposes a sustainable price-reliant demand inventory model with controllable carbon emissions to reduce the CO2 emissions from farm warehousing activity. This study extends previous research that has proposed a sustainable inventory system with greenhouse facilities by controlling carbon emissions through green investment. This study involves an investment in energy-efficient green technology in a two-warehouse inventory system to curb carbon emissions during the transportation of products from the owned to the rented warehouse and also to the final customers. Two warehouses are frequently used in practice to avoid stock-out situations and make the business more profitable. Case 1 represents the model with allowable shortages, and Case 2 represents the model without shortages. Pricing strategies and a hybrid payment scheme are applied throughout this study to make the business more profitable as well as to entice new customers. The retailer has to prepay some portion of the purchasing cost, with the payment scheme requiring multiple installments. Non-instantaneous deterioration is considered in this study to show the lifetime of product freshness in the presence of a constant backorder. A nonlinear model is proposed, and a solution algorithm is suggested. A real case study is introduced, which provides an illustration of the proposed model. The examples are solved and are followed by a sensitivity analysis that reveals the validity of the model, and conclusions are presented."

However, recent years have shown that warehouse areas are also being developed in less invested spaces, including regions with little industrial development and focused on preserving natural assets. W&Is consume large shares of land, attract high volumes of truck movement and greatly affect the environment. The aim of this research is to analyse spatial changes in the distribution of W&Is in the north‐eastern part of Poland, called Europe's green lungs, with particular emphasis on changes in land use mix, road accessibility, the size of neighbouring cities and existing W&Is. The share of the W&Is in the built‐up areas of the Warmian‐Masurian region is for the present 7.14%. The largest W&Is are concentrated in the western part of the region. In the period from 2014 to 2022, this area increased by 311.77 ha. Both the government and the public must work together to facilitate effective regulation of warehousing externalities and equitable distribution of associated environmental influences."
pub.1141691487,Controllable carbon emissions in an inventory model for perishable items under trade credit policy for credit-risk customers,"The incorporation of credit risk and environmental regulations has been attended to considerably in the literature of inventory models; however, papers rarely developed a model considering both of these issues concurrently. Thus, jointly incorporate these two challenges makes sense to address the mentioned gap in the literature and outline insights for future works in practice. This study develops an inventory model for deteriorating items which (a) items deteriorate continuously and have their specific expiration dates; (b) carbon is emitted due to ordering and warehousing operations when a cap-and-tax policy is regulated and emissions can be controlled by investing in green technology; (c) two levels of trade credit is offered when the customer must pay a prepayment. The purpose of this study is to compare the retailer's total profit for different values of upstream and downstream trade credit periods to achieve efficient pricing and replenishment decisions. An algorithm is developed to find the optimal value for the investment in green technology. Numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis are elaborated to validate the mathematical formulation. Finally, findings are summarized and managerial implications are addressed."

pub.1106341081,Business analytics for systematically investigating sustainable food supply chains,"From farm to fork, food supply chains threaten the environment in a range of different ways. Stakeholders in food chains seeking to go green have a twofold problem, comprising limited resources and too many eco-options to choose from. Hence, this study aims to narrow the field of such options, based on a careful assessment of past successful choices when going green. Specifically, it utilizes business analytics to derive insights on food supply chains' environmental sustainability from numerous data sources, and transforms this intricate information into managerial knowledge of food supply chains in general, and sustainable food supply chains in particular. The analytical results reveal eight crucial characteristics of sustainable food supply chains: devices/software, eco-innovation, organizational culture, warehousing, transportation, food loss/waste, equipment, and regulation. Among these, the two most important drivers of successful sustainability implementation are found to be eco-innovation and food loss/waste. Lastly, this study applies relational view theory and natural resource based view theory to the analytical results to create new sustainable food chain strategies and to extend the application of those theories to sustainable food chain management."

pub.1160221783,How Effective Is Reverse Cross-Docking and Carbon Policies in Controlling Carbon Emission from the Fashion Industry?,"The present consumer behavior is manipulated by “fast fashion”, where purchasing new, trendy, affordable clothes is preferred over recycling old ones. This changing mannerism has escalated the GHG emissions from the fashion industry. Energy-intensive raw material production, preparation, and processing contribute to considerable emissions. The management of the returned goods from the primary market and further processing through the secondary outlets indulge in reverse logistics. In this paper, efforts are made to minimize the total cost and the carbon emission amount during the process of managing the return articles from the primary market to the reverse distribution center, further processing of the articles at the secondary outlet, and the return of the unsold or excess articles from the secondary outlet. Reverse cross-docking has been implemented in managing the return articles, while environmental concerns over GHG emissions have been addressed by investing in green technology under a strict carbon cap policy. In this research, return articles from the primary and secondary markets, rework of the returned articles, and disposal of the impaired returned articles have been considered. The carbon emission cost at all stages of transportation, rework, or disposal has also been incorporated into this model. A constrained mixed integer linear programming model is proposed and solved considering green investment. A numerical example has been formulated to investigate the effect of green technology on the total cost. The results portray that, though the total cost increases by nearly 2% due to investment in green technology, it ensures a considerable drop of 23% in the carbon emission amount. Also, the result is successful in establishing that reverse cross-docking is a better option than traditional warehousing in terms of minimizing the cost."
pub.1154616418,Opportunity or Challenge? Carbon Emissions Reduction under New Development Pattern of Dual Circulation,"China’s economic development strategy is undergoing an evolution from foreign to domestic circulation mainly, and at the same time faces the rigid constraints of “carbon peak before 2030” and “carbon neutrality before 2060”. However, both domestic and foreign trade also have an important impact on carbon dioxide emissions. To this end, this paper uses China’s 2017 multi-regional Input-Output table to systematically simulate the impact of the new development pattern on carbon emissions from the comprehensive perspective of production and consumption. Our simulations find that when the foreign circulation disappears, the total economic output will be hit hard, and carbon emissions will be greatly reduced; when the foreign circulation orientation weakens and the intensity of the domestic circulation is increased, the total economic output will increase to varying degrees, but the total carbon emissions will also increase by a certain extent. Among them, the increase in carbon emissions at the living end accounts for a considerable proportion, while the carbon emissions of electricity, heat production and supply, transportation, warehousing and postal services, metal smelting and rolling processing industries at the production end increase more. From a policy perspective, the government should promote green production and green consumption to achieve a balance between economic growth and carbon emission reduction."

Therefore, enterprises around the world have to manage the environment wisely, while avoiding negative effects on it. The aim of the paper was to examine the use of green and reverse logistics in the conditions of sustainable development in enterprises in Slovakia. The intention of the paper was to provide a theoretical overview of green and reverse logistics at home and abroad on the basis of the elaboration of a scientific bibliographic-information apparatus. Subsequent practical implementation of the questionnaire research and statistical verification of research results provides a basis for practical recommendations and conclusions for enterprises operating in Slovakia. The research topic of the paper was green and reverse logistics in companies in Slovakia. The research problem was the implementation and use of modern logistics under the influence of the environment. Based on these facts, statistical hypotheses were determined and subsequently tested. Descriptive statistics and inference statistics were used to interpret the research results. Based on the research, we found that the dominant position in green and reverse logistics in Slovakia was achieved by large production enterprises from the automotive industry, which operate in western Slovakia. The analysed enterprises in Slovakia use voluntary tools of environmental policy and the most important environmental tool is corporate social responsibility. Elements of environmental policy are used primarily in the logistics process of warehousing and storage. The biggest barrier in the implementation of elements of environmental logistics analysed by enterprises is the lack of financial resources. The implementation of green logistics and reverse logistics enables the analysed enterprises in Slovakia to improve customer-supplier relations. We can say that despite the government’s efforts, measures to minimize the environmental impact and growing public awareness of environmental issues, environmental problems persist. Initiatives can be seen at the global and national levels of enterprises that make quick decisions and set up new processes in environmental management."
pub.1125683276,Spatio-temporal Mapping of Green House Gas Emission in Urban Settings using a Vehicle Mounted IoT Enabled Pollution Sensing Modules,This paper represents the spatial variability in the pollution by virtue of industrial and residential areas located in almost all the urban settings located at different places. Hence the pollutant gases data of a few locations cannot give an accurate overall estimate of the pollution index of the city. Hence a Spatio-temporal mapping is required to get a fair idea about the pollution in different areas at different times and would also help in identifying any high pollution zones so that remedial actions can be taken to reduce the effluent emissions. This work focuses on the use of IoT enabled gas sensing nodes which are proposed to be mounted on any public transport vehicle or administration vehicle of the focused city to get a continuous indication of the concentration of various greenhouse gases and to use an open-source database management system for warehousing and retrieval of Spatio-temporal pollution data through web-interface
pub.1158610535,"Digital transformation, environmental disclosure, and environmental performance: An examination based on listed companies in heavy-pollution industries in China","This study comprises an empirical analysis of how digital transformation affects environmental performance after constructing a multidimensional evaluation framework to measure environmental performance.

pub.1093826893,Extended Abstract: Perceptions and E-Textbooks: Insights into Challenges Faced by Publishers,"Electronic books-or e-books-is a general term that refers to the publication, distribution, and reading of all forms of publications online, not just books, but also newspapers, magazines, and journals. Because they cost less to publish than the materials they replace and do not require printing, shipping, or warehousing, e-books are believed to offer significant convenience, cost-savings and green alternatives for consumers and increased publishing flexibility and an opportunity to revive sagging readership levels for publishers. As a result, some industry insiders see e-books as the inevitable future of publishing, especially in textbook publishing, offering publishers the opportunity to more easily published revisions while reducing the admittedly costly investment students must make in textbooks. Recent sales figures suggest that, several years after the introduction of e-books, they are still struggling to gain a foothold on the textbook market. This study explores why."
pub.1168597367,Joint green dynamic order batching and picker routing problem using PSO with global worst experience,"With the increasing importance of various countries’ initiatives on reducing carbon emissions (e.g., carbon border adjustment mechanism, CBAM), intelligent order picking systems have assisted electronic retailers in realizing a green supply chain. Previous studies on picker routing operations focused on adopting offline static customer order information to carry out operational decisions. However, in practice, the customer order information is updated dynamically; and high-efficiency warehouse layouts have been increasingly concerned. Therefore, this study creates a mixed-integer programming model for minimizing both the total carbon footprint and the total penalty cost for delayed orders in the joint order batching and picker routing problem with dynamic arriving orders and shipping time constraints in a high-efficiency fishbone warehouse layout. To solve this complex problem, a particle swarm optimization algorithm that integrates the swarm’s previous global and local worst experiences and a migration mechanism is further proposed to increase solution quality and computing efficiency. In addition, a three-dimensional space for the warehouse floorplan and shipping time constraints is designed to divide orders into batches to address the constraints. Theoretical analysis of this algorithm is conducted, and experimental analysis shows that this algorithm finds superior solutions than current practical strategies, to offer a valuable reference for carbon emission reduction in greening warehousing."
pub.1167969317,Unveiling the Potential of Apricot Residues: From Nutraceuticals to Bioenergy,"Stone fruits, such as the apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.), are frequently consumed. As such, a substantial volume of apricot waste is generated at each stage of the food supply chain, including harvesting, processing, packaging, warehousing, transportation, retailing, and eventual consumption. This generates tons of waste annually on a global scale. The significant amounts of phenolics present in these wastes are primarily responsible for their antioxidant capacity and the subsequent health advantages they provide. As such, apricot pulp by-products could be a valuable reservoir of bioactive compounds, such as tocopherols, polyphenolic compounds, proteins, dietary fibers, etc. Moreover, apricot kernels are also recognized for their abundance of bioactive compounds, including polyphenols and tocopherols, which find utility in diverse sectors including cosmetology and the food industry. Both conventional and green methods are employed, and generally, green methods lead to higher extraction efficiency. The antimicrobial properties of apricot kernel essential oil have been widely recognized, leading to its extensive historical usage in the treatment of diverse ailments. In addition, apricot kernel oil possesses the capacity to serve as a viable resource for renewable fuels and chemicals. This review examines the potential of apricot waste as a source of bioactive compounds, as well as its utilization in diverse applications, with an emphasis on its contribution to health improvement."
pub.1155708141,Cold supply chain of leafy green vegetables: a social network analysis approach," Purpose Cold supply chain technology is critical for extending the shelf life of perishable leafy green vegetables. This study aims to investigate the concept of managing leafy green products using cold supply chain technology and visualise the findings.   Design/methodology/approach  Using expert interviews and data visualisation approaches, this study examines how organisations deal with the complexity of cold supply chain processes and networks. Thematic data analysis was conducted. Two types of software were used to accomplish the research objectives. The first software used AntConc version 3.5.8 with word frequency ( N -gram) analysis, whereas the second software, VOSViewer offered co-occurrence network visualisation and cluster analysis.    Findings The findings show that the appropriate design of cold chain technology is critical in ensuring the freshness and quality of leafy green vegetables. The primary goal of managing the complexity of the cold supply chain is to achieve product freshness and energy efficiency. Regardless of the importance of energy efficiency, cold supply chains require warehouse management solutions for transportation and storage.   Practical implications This study found that proper design and selection of appropriate technology in the cold supply chain have driven the companies to improve the firms’ competitive advantage while delivering the best quality of perishable leafy green food products. In addition, the freshness, quality, safety, and health of leafy green vegetables will be determined by the company’s capacity to handle long-distance transportation and select the appropriate distribution channels and storage. Warehouse management system technology was found to be secondary compared to cold chain technology, although distribution and warehousing practices are critical for supply chain performance.   Originality/value This study has established the conceptual indicators based on best practices and outcomes for the cold supply chain. This study argued that cold supply chain management and performance should be monitored independently. Furthermore, the theory of technological adoption can be expanded to include product nature as a driver. Finally, this study has established cold chain best practices based on a perishable supply chain perspective. The findings of this study can promote healthy foods to solve zero hunger and achieve sustainable development goals. Although this study demonstrates that technology improves supply chain practises, cold storage and logistics benefit the most from technological advancements. In contrast, non-cold supply chains benefit from technology-driven improvements in performance. "
pub.1166069326,A fuzzy multiobjective linear programming approach for green multiechelon distribution network design," Purpose Distribution network design involves a set of strategic decisions in supply chains because of their long-term impacts on the total logistics cost and environment. To incorporate a trade-off between financial and environmental aspects of these decisions, this paper aims to determine an optimal location, among candidate locations, of a new logistics center, its capacity, as well as optimal network flows for an existing distribution network, while concurrently minimizing the total logistics cost and gas emission. In addition, uncertainty in transportation and warehousing costs are considered.   Design/methodology/approach  The problem is formulated as a fuzzy multiobjective mathematical model. The effectiveness of this model is demonstrated using an industrial case study. The problem instance is a four-echelon distribution network with 22 products and a planning horizon of 20 periods. The model is solved by using the min–max and augmented ε -constraint methods with CPLEX as the solver. In addition to illustrating model’s applicability, the effect of choosing a new warehouse in the model is investigated through a scenario analysis.    Findings  For the applicability of the model, the results indicate that the augmented ε -constraint approach provides a set of Pareto solutions, which represents the ideal trade-off between the total logistics cost and gas emission. Through a case study problem instance, the augmented ε -constraint approach is recommended for similar network design problems. From a scenario analysis, when the operational cost of the new warehouse is within a specific fraction of the warehousing cost of third-party warehouses, the solution with the new warehouse outperforms that without the new warehouse with respective to financial and environmental objectives.    Originality/value The proposed model is an effective decision support tool for management, who would like to assess the impact of network planning decisions on the performance of their supply chains with respect to both financial and environmental aspects under uncertainty.

pub.1135529370,"Examining the Interconnections Between Sustainable Logistics Practices, Environmental Reputation and Financial Performance: A Mediation Approach","As environmental awareness and the patronage of logistics services grow, there is a growing demand for the logistics sector to provide more sustainable environmental services, and although the logistics sector performs functions such as reverse logistics, packaging, inventory management, transportation, warehousing, waste management, distribution, etc., which are very core to economic growth, they also significantly contribute to greenhouse effect and consume huge amounts of resources. This study, drawing on the institutional theory and the natural resource-based view, explores the framework through which sustainable logistics practices such as sustainable transportation, reverse logistics and management of waste, sustainable packaging and distribution, green monitoring and evaluation, and sustainable information sharing influence environmental reputation and financial performance. The study adopted partial least square structural equation modelling technique in analysing data due to it having more statistical power. The findings of the study showed that sustainable logistics practices had enormous influence on environmental reputation and financial performance. In terms of mediation, environmental reputation had no mediation effect between waste management and financial performance but partially mediated the relationships between sustainable transportation, sustainable information sharing and financial performance, while fully mediating the relationships between reverse logistics, sustainable packaging and distribution, green monitoring and evaluation, and financial performance. This study concentrated on the logistics sector; thus, this study results will provide vital data to both scholars and practitioners in comprehending the call and need to integrate sustainable policies and strategies into business and industrial operations to ensure environmental preservation."
pub.1174716958,The Role of Logistics and Infrastructure in Promoting International Trade,"This study aims to explore the role of logistics and infrastructure in promoting international trade. Through systematic analysis of relevant theories and practical impacts, the research finds that logistics and infrastructure play key roles in reducing transaction costs, enhancing trade speed and reliability, and promoting market connectivity and integration. Specifically, an efficient logistics system can optimize transportation, warehousing, distribution, and inventory management, thereby improving the overall efficiency of international trade. Meanwhile, modern transportation, information and communication, and energy infrastructure provide robust support for international trade, facilitating efficient global supply chain operations and economic growth. However, the logistics and infrastructure sectors also face challenges such as infrastructure aging, cross-border logistics barriers, environmental issues, and sustainability concerns.

pub.1145583257,The Organizational and Economic Mechanism of Implementing the Concept of Green Logistics,"The article analyses the preconditions for shaping and developing the concept of a green economy. The stages of the evolutionary development of the circular economy are considered: work with waste; environmental performance strategies; maximum conservation in the era of resource depletion. Having analysed the scientific opinions on the emergence of “circular economy”, the paper has found out that this concept is identified with the terms “round economy”, “cyclical economy”, “recovery economy”, “closed-cycle economy”, “green economy”. The approaches of different scientific schools to the category of “circular economy” are analysed and conventionally systematized into 12 groups: closed-cycle economy; renewable resource economy; alternative to traditional linear economy; global economic model; closed-loop economic system based on R-principles; the concept of economic development; sustainable development strategy; a ""green"" economy instrument; business philosophy; economic activity; use of production waste; recycling of secondary raw materials. There is proposed the authors' formulation of the circular economy as an innovative approach to organizing logistics processes based on the closed movement of resources with their minimum losses in the form of waste and the maximum involvement of secondary resources in production in order to achieve sustainable development of logistics systems. The article identifies the barriers preventing the implementation of the circular economy concept, among them being regulatory, institutional, economic, financial and investment, market, technological, informational, and cultural. The article considers the best practices of effective implementation of circular economy solutions on the example of Finland. The indicators of the development of the green technologies market in the world and the national logistics system of Ukraine under conditions of a circular economy are analysed. It has been established that many conceptual approaches to the definition of the terms “green logistics” and “environmental logistics” are generally accepted and have a broader meaning, without taking into account the functioning specificity of various spheres of economic activity, including transport and logistics. Scientific views on interpreting the essence and content of the concept ""green logistics"" are generalized. It is proposed to consider the term ""green logistics"" from three angles: a circular economy instrument; a component of business corporate social responsibility; and a type of economic activity aimed at reducing the negative impact on the ecosystem and the environment. In order to effectively implement the concept of green logistics, an organizational and economic mechanism has been developed, the main elements of which are: diagnostics of the current state, features and trends in the logistics systems' development, taking into account the environmental component; exogenous and endogenous factors affecting the development of logi"
pub.1157929399,LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY,"The aggravation of ecological problems at the global level, as well as the need to solve the economic and social problems of humanity, require the implementation of important economic transformation measures. The circular economy (or closed-loop economy) is a form of production organization related to extending the life cycle of products and minimizing harmful disposal and waste. It is also about sharing, renting, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as much as possible. As with any type of economic model, the functioning of the circular economy requires a corresponding logistics system. In this context, together with the acceptance of the concept of ecological efficiency and ""green"" economy in many countries, the new approach of ""green logistics"" has emerged in international practice. The purpose of this article is to generalize theoretical approaches and to substantiate the conceptual provisions of logistical support for the development of the circular economy in the conditions of global transformations. Methodology. The methodological basis of the study is the scientific work of scientists on the problems of green economy, circular economy, environmental management, waste management, logistics management. The research was conducted using general scientific methods: analysis and synthesis - to summarize the existing conceptual approaches and regulations, scientific developments on the development of the circular economy, greening of logistics systems, green logistics, clarification of terminology; classifications - to systematize theoretical approaches to the definition of ""green logistics"" proposed by various scientific schools; structural and logical generalization - to determine the key logistics approaches to the development of the circular economy and the principles of green logistics for the implementation of circular business models. Results. In order to present the specific aspects of circular economy logistics, the opinions of researchers from different countries were studied to outline a related synthetic vision. After conducting the study, the current characteristics of the circular economy were identified. Then the current international trends in logistics development were identified. An important trend is the development of ""green"" logistics. It has been found that many conceptual approaches to the definition of the terms ""green"" logistics and environmental logistics are generally accepted and have a broader meaning, without taking into account the specifics of the functioning of different areas of economic activity, including the transport sector and logistics activities. Scientific views on the interpretation of the nature and content of the concept of ""green"" logistics are generalized. It is proposed to consider the concept of ""green"" logistics as a tool of circular economy. It offers companies a number of advantages and is based on certain principles. As a synergy effect, the massive im"

This phenomenon indicates that people have begun to realize the high environmental costs of their actions and are beginning to address this situation. From the perspective of environmental economics, this research focused on urban land use and explored the relationship between land use change and social metabolism flow through canonical correlation analysis (CCA). An empirical study was conducted in Shanghai to prove that urban land management could be seen as a means of balancing the social metabolism flow. First, for urban land use quantity, increasing the warehousing and traffic land areas could significantly affect the metabolism amount; meanwhile, the cultivated land and urban green land had crucial roles in controlling metabolism amount. Second, for urban land use efficiency, the intensity and efficiency of social metabolism could be influenced by land use efficiency, which indicated that a highly efficient industrial estate and storage land use could decrease the intensity of material consumption. These findings provide the government with new ideas and methods for urban planning and land management."

The exploitation of opportunity charging might improve LIB adoption, which is still prevented by the high investment cost. Since opportunity charging is affected by the system organization, the relationship between LIB and organizational variables is a meaningful work direction to reduce warehouses’ environmental impact, which is underrepresented by the current literature. The present paper aims at filling this gap by investigating the implications of organisational variables on LIB adoption in warehouses where handling activities are performed with forklift trucks. Based on an in-depth review of the literature and semi-structured interviews, the research presents an input-process-output model linking organisational variables and LIB forklift related costs with an application to a real case. This paper is original as it extends findings from the research fields of production and mobility to the warehouse arena, and it opens room for further research on warehouse sustainability. The paper also offers insights to warehouse managers making decisions about LIB adoption for their electric forklift fleets. This is particularly meaningful to reduce warehouse environmental impact, since MHE power source significantly contributes to greenhouse gases emissions."

In this study, we take an RMFS as the research object and combine the connected issues of storage location assignment and path planning into one optimization problem from the perspective of collaborative optimization. A sustainable mathematical model for the collaborative optimization of storage location assignment and path planning (COSLAPP) is established, which considers the relationship between the location assignment of goods and rack storage and path planning in an RMFS. On this basis, we propose a location assignment strategy for goods clustering and rack turnover, which utilizes reservation tables, sets AGV operation rules to resolve AGV running conflicts, and improves the A-star(A*) algorithm based on the node load to find the shortest path by which the AGV handling the racks can complete the order picking. Ultimately, simulation studies were performed to ascertain the effectiveness of COSLAPP in the RMFS; the results show that the new approach can significantly improve order picking efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and lessen the operating costs of the warehouse of a distribution center."

This paper presents a case study of a Portuguese roasted coffee company. The production process in the company begins with the storage in warehouses and in silos and continues through blending, roasting, grinding and finally packaging and warehousing. These processes are carried out in order to get different requirements in terms of freshness, aroma, flavour and coffee color. A mixed integer (MIP) model for production planning has been built, taking into account as main decision variables, the type of coffee to load in each silo in each period. The objective is to produce the coffee as near as possible to a due date in order to maintain the freshness and satisfy the clients demand. The company needs the model to embed in a decision support system that allows them to test coffee orders acceptance and to define at the beginning of each day how the silos must be loaded.

In this paper, the whole life cycle cost model of power supply chain is constructed and solved by improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). This algorithm combines the advantages of standard PSO and genetic algorithm (GA), avoids their disadvantages effectively, and realizes the effect of complementary advantages. This paper proposes using the sum of the costs associated with warehousing, transportation, and service penalties in the supply chain of electrical power projects as the objective function, thereby achieving the goal of optimal supply chain costs. In this study, the improved PSO algorithm is used to optimize the objective function, and the optimization results are compared with those of standard PSO algorithm and GA, revealing that its convergence is superior to the other two algorithms. Considering the influence of different factors on the cost, the superiority of the improved PSO algorithm is further verified."

The lack of discipline in the supervision and implementation of spatial regulations resulted in inconsistencies between urban spatial planning and land use facts. This study aims to see the inconsistency between spatial planning of the city with the real conditions in the field so it can be used as an evaluation material to optimize the planning of the urban space in the future. This study used satellite image interpretation, spatial analysis, and projection analysis using markov cellular automata, as well as consistency evaluation for spatial planning policy. The results show that there has been a significant increase of open spaces during 2001-2015 and physical development was relatively spreading irregularly and indicated the urban sprawl phenomenon. There has been an open area deficits for the green open space in 2015-2031, such as integrated maritime, ports, and warehousing zones.

The Moderation Panel Data Regression Analysis was used in this study with samples from 33 provinces in Indonesia in 2010-2019 using non-probability sampling. The fixed effect model was chosen as the best model, using the inflation moderating variable shows that the mining and quarrying sector; the transportation, warehousing and communication sectors have a negative relationship, meaning that inflation can be a moderating variable. As for the manufacturing sector; electricity, gas, air sector; development sector; the trade, restaurant and hotel sectors have a negative and insignificant relationship and the agriculture, fishery and forestry sectors have a positive and insignificant relationship, inflation is also not moderate because high or low inflation doesn’t give effect on high financing that sectors, the focus of Islamic banking is on the real sector that drives energy consumption. Therefore, this research can serve as input for the Islamic Financial Institutions in prioritizing several environmentally friendly sectors to support Indonesia's green taxonomy, namely the service sector, the construction sector, the electricity, air and gas sector, the mining sector which have a positive but insignificant relationship because the market share of Islamic banking is still small compared to conventional banking."

In fact, as the demand for data processing and warehousing is increasingly growing, data centres are subjected to deep scrutiny due to their high-energy consumptions and costs. In addition, the impact of data centres is worsened by the use of polluting diesel generators to provide backup power, which contributes directly to increase the emission levels of CO2 and NOx. In that context, the aim of this work is to investigate the performance of a novel zero-emission cryogenic energy system serving a 1MWel data centre; the cryo-system uses liquid Nitrogen for the combined generation of cooling and power during the sudden utility grid events (power outage & peak demand). A steady-state thermodynamic model is developed covering single-stage and multistage designs; the proposed model considers electrical-load-following as the control strategy for the cryo-system and the consumption of liquid Nitrogen as the objective function to be minimized. Exergy analysis is used to assess the irreversibility distribution in the whole system. The results show that the cryogenic polygeneration for data centre leads to promising values of Power Usage Effectiveness. The results also indicate that the multistage process reduces the hourly consumption of liquid Nitrogen of about 30% compared to the single-stage process."

This study considers an integrated two-echelon green supply chain with carbon emission from production, warehousing, transporting, deterioration of items, as well as disposing waste. The deterioration rate is controlled by utilizing preservation technology investment. Also, for the fast-growing business, the suppliers offer credit period to the retailer, and the same credit period is offered by retailer to end customers, which works as an influential strategy for attracting new customers and has a positive impact on sales. The whole model is studied in an inflationary environment. The discussed model was solved analytically and obtained the optimal solution in a quasi-closed form solution; and simultaneously optimizes the optimal time and preservation technology cost in a two-echelon supply chain model considering controllable deterioration, waste, and carbon emission. To illustrate the present study, a numerical analysis and a sensitivity analysis have been presented. The convexity is obtained analytically as well as graphically. The objective is to minimize total cost and to reduce total carbon emissions. The analysis of the proposed model shows that the optimal results are quite realistic and can be applied to minimize total cost and reduce total carbon emission of supply chain integration."

Thus, it is practical to determine the speed configuration for each movement. To be responsive, it is reasonable to set the speed as fast as possible. However, high speed leads to high energy consumption which is undesirable in the context of green warehousing. Given that the speed changes dynamically, it is important to have an advanced optimization model for balancing both objectives and providing accurate estimation. This study proposed metamodel-based simulation–optimization (MSO) allowing to jointly optimize four speed-related variables namely horizontal speed (x), vertical speed (y), fork or depth speed (z), and acceleration/deceleration under the dynamicity of AS/RS. A case study was given in a warehouse comprising five cranes and ten racks. Using Desirability Function Analysis, the optimal speed configuration is obtained efficiently for minimizing travel time and energy consumption of AS/RS. The result also shows that row-based storage provides better responsiveness and energy efficiency than random-based storage. Further, rack design also indicates a significant impact on the AS/RS speed configuration."

However, a limited amount of quantitative studies and report covers both impacts on specific sectors or industries and national level impact. Two development scenarios on technology application effects are modelled with input-output model for Latvia’s economy obtaining results for 64 products of economic activity (NACE Rev2), and additional regional development examined (NUTS 3 disaggregation). The modelling results claim that if more land transport services (+10%), postal and courier services (+10%), and hence electricity (+10%), are demanded, but less warehousing and support services for transportation (−5%) due to digital solutions and more efficient technologies then the national economic output increase by 0.8%, amid aggregated sectors the largest impact is on wholesale (+1.7%) and industry (+1.3%) and regionally impact is between +0.85% (in Pieriga region) and 0.72% (in Vidzeme).

pub.1154307326,The failure of collaborative agglomeration: From the perspective of industrial pollution emission,"The green transformation of economic growth mode is one of the keys to promote high-quality development. This paper starts with the collaborative agglomeration of manufacturing and producer services, demonstrates the impact of collaborative agglomeration on industrial pollution emission through theoretical analysis, and then uses panel data of 285 prefecture level cities in China from 2004 to 2019 to verify the relationship between them. The results show that collaborative agglomeration significantly increased industrial pollution emission, but the effect mainly existed in small and medium-sized cities, cities with more development zones, cities with provincial high-tech industrial parks and the observation range from 2009 to 2015. The results of subdividing producer services show that transportation, warehousing and postal services, finance, information transmission, computer services and software industries have intensified industrial pollution emission in the collaborative agglomeration with the manufacturing industry. Mechanism analysis shows that collaborative agglomeration fosters the city's “low-level innovation preference” and promotes the expansion of the number of enterprises characterized by the entry and extension of the duration of highly polluting enterprises. It objectively forms a “quantity-priority orientation”, thus increasing industrial pollution emission. The above conclusions mean that the development of urban industry at this stage should be based on quality and efficiency, rather than pursuing the disordered expansion of quantity. This paper provides beneficial policy implications for reducing local governments' blind behavior and awakening the awareness of environment-friendly economic growth."

A Special Area Management Plan (SAMP), combined with appropriateanalytical tools and community support, provides a model from which a comprehensive community-level approach to resource management can take place. In Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, a SAMP was initiated to address loss of green space, watershed management, water quality issues of nutrient loading and pesticide use, and the health and spatial extent of shellfish. The Murrells Inlet SAMP model illustrates an effective methodology for incorporating science and technology into coastal and ocean resource management and bridging the gap between science and technology and coastal resource managers. The current structure of data warehousing limits the ability of resource managers to access and incorporate appropriate data and information into the decision-making processes. The Internet Mapping System (IMS) presentation developed for the Murrells Inlet SAMP is a model for data mining, data housing and sharing the broad spectrum of relevant data for managing coastal resources. This IMS also functions as an educational, outreach, and data dissemination tool that is designed to be highly functional and user-friendly."
pub.1175592535,Bi-Objective Inventory Policy with Comprehensive Environmental Factors Formulation and Service Level Constraints,"As firms and consumers engage with environmental issues, decisions for inventory control need to entail this perspective of sustainability. Most green inventory models employ methods such as carbon caps or taxes for dealing with environmental sustainability. This problem can be more generally tackled via an explicit estimation of the environmental drivers of maintaining inventory in a warehouse, paired with the economic perspective within a transparent multi-objective optimization framework. With this goal, this paper builds on a detailed estimation of environmental and cost factors for a continuous-review inventory policy. The bi-objective problem is tackled by keeping the objective functions separate. In particular, the modeling of greenhouse gas emission or cost performance factors for the inventory encompasses factors that can depend on the decision variables, taking into account aspects such as warehouse location, building characterization, energy usage, and transport requirements. The effects of the emission drivers on the multi-objective optimization decisions are analyzed, considering that the problem can be constrained by multiple service level measures. Stockout response can be multifaceted and different service level measures capture different aspects of inventory shortages, affecting the resulting efficient solutions differently. The results highlight the impact of aspects such as warehouse location and supply capacity on solutions for the multi-objective inventory problem. Managerial decisions are thus influenced by warehousing and supply attributes via a traceable link to specific cost and emission determinants."
pub.1164971143,Ranking model to measure energy efficiency for warehouse operations sustainability,"Implementing sustainable or green strategies in warehouse management has become increasingly important. The environmental impact can be assessed by evaluating resource usage and productivity. A proper method for assessing the sustainability of internal processes can provide a valuable tool for companies to understand what is being done correctly and what needs to be improved to comply with new guidelines. For this paper, a case study at Arvato warehousing provider for end consumer products was conducted, and a rating mechanism model for warehouses was developed. Data on energy consumption and productivity were collected from output of 13 warehouse units (modules). From the collected data, a set of KPIs, an index system, an automation categorization system, and a ranking system were created to help with decision making, problem identification, and solving. As result, this paper demonstrates the impact of different material handling systems on energy consumption and found that a higher level of automation does not always translate into operating more efficiently in terms of sustainability. Instead of reporting absolute numbers, this study created an index that displays relative values, making it much easier to identify the most efficient modules. Additionally, this study takes the automation index a step further by creating three categories of automation levels in addition to the percentage that indicates how advanced the technology in a warehouse is, allowing for the creation of groups of warehouses and the comparison of their performance."

pub.1147071505,"Heterogeneous Urban Thermal Contribution of Functional Construction Land Zones: A Case Study in Shenzhen, China","Anthropogenic interferences through various intensive social-economic activities within construction land have induced and strengthened the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects in global cities. Focused on the relative heat effect produced by different social-economic functions, this study established a general framework for functional construction land zones (FCLZs) mapping and investigated their heterogeneous contribution to the urban thermal environment, and then the thermal responses in FCLZs with 12 environmental indicators were analyzed. Taking Shenzhen as an example city, the results show that the total contribution and thermal effects within FCLZs are significantly different. Specifically, the FCLZs contribution to UHI regions highly exceeds the corresponding proportions of their area. The median warming capacity order of FCLZs is: Manufacture function (3.99 °C) > Warehousing and logistics function (3.69 °C) > Street and transportation function (3.61 °C) > Business services function (3.06 °C) > Administration and public services function (2.54 °C) > Green spaces and squares function (2.40 °C) > Residential function (2.21 °C). Both difference and consistency coexist in the responses of differential surface temperature (DST) to environmental indicators in FCLZs. The thermal responses of DST to biophysical and building indicators in groups of FCLZs are approximately consistent linear relationships with different intercepts, while the saturation effects shown in location and social-economic indicators indicate that distance and social-economic development control UHI effects in a non-linear way. This study could extend the understanding of urban thermal warming mechanisms and help to scientifically adjust environmental indicators in urban planning."

pub.1147099655,Increasing Throughput in Warehouses: The Effect of Storage Reallocation and the Location of Input/Output Station,"Automatic warehousing systems are a sort of green technology that is becoming increasingly popular in the logistics business. Automated Storage/Retrieval Systems (AS/RS) are one of the most significant components of advanced automated logistics and manufacturing systems. The majority of AS/RS systems use input/output (I/O) points located in the lower left corner of the rack. These systems are reaching their maximum capacity because of their layout design limitations. Breakthrough solutions are needed to enhance the performance of existing systems. In this study, we examined how the location of I/O station can affect the total travel time. Another strategy for enhancement is a two-step preparation method. In this strategy, the allocation of the storage is changed, in the idle time, to be closer to the I/O point to reduce the service time for a class-based storage assignment. An analytical model was used to introduce for the first time optimal configurations of this strategy. We tested the suggested strategy using a simulation model created using R software, specifically designed for this purpose. Results showed that the two-step preparation strategy took between 1.2 and 1.9 h before the shift starts. The enhancement on throughput is almost the same for both possible locations of the I/O point. The results also showed that the two strategies (location of the I/O point and reallocation of storage) could increase throughput by about 21% to 28%, depending on parameters such as the number of orders and the height of the storage rack."

However, there is still a lack of fast and effective methods for how quickly identifying the spatial characteristics of urban renewal to dynamically grasp the renewal effect. The purpose of this study is to identify the renewal characteristics of urban industrial land based on the POI (Points of Interest) data and RS data of the Internet map, and to provide an innovative method for better understanding the renewal effect of urban industrial land and its spatiotemporal evolution characteristics. The results show that: 1) Since the decentralization of non-capital functions in Beijing, industrial development has spread from a high degree of agglomeration to the whole area. The number of high-density areas has decreased from nine to five, and the number of medium-density areas has increased significantly.2) Land-use types in the six districts of Beijing have changed, warehousing and logistics land and industrial land have been reduced greatly, and the number and area of park green space have greatly increased.3) The level of matching between RS image interpretation and POI data is uneven. RS interpretation is accurate for large-scale feature recognition, and POI data are sensitive to small-scale industries. In conclusion, In the process of identifying the renewal feature of urban industrial land, POI and RS data can respectively obtain certain results. The integration of POI and RS can better identify the temporal and spatial changes of the industry."
pub.1142947500,Napa,"Google services continuously generate vast amounts of application data. This data provides valuable insights to business users. We need to store and serve these planet-scale data sets under the extremely demanding requirements of scalability, sub-second query response times, availability, and strong consistency; all this while ingesting a massive stream of updates from applications used around the globe. We have developed and deployed in production an analytical data management system, Napa, to meet these requirements. Napa is the backend for numerous clients in Google. These clients have a strong expectation of variance-free, robust query performance. At its core, Napa's principal technologies for robust query performance include the aggressive use of materialized views, which are maintained consistently as new data is ingested across multiple data centers. Our clients also demand flexibility in being able to adjust their query performance, data freshness, and costs to suit their unique needs. Robust query processing and flexible configuration of client databases are the hallmark of Napa design.
                  Most of the related work in this area takes advantage of full flexibility to design the whole system without the need to support a diverse set of preexisting use cases. In comparison, a particular challenge we faced is that Napa needs to deal with hard constraints from existing applications and infrastructure, so we could not do a ""green field"" system, but rather had to satisfy existing constraints. These constraints led us to make particular design decisions and also devise new techniques to meet the challenges. In this paper, we share our experiences in designing, implementing, deploying, and running Napa in production with some of Google's most demanding applications."
pub.1140568664,Research on the Spatial Effect of Urban Construction on Heat Island Effect in Shanghai Based on Remote Sensing Data,"Since the twentieth Century,global urbanization process is constantly accelerating,while the landscape pattern dominated by vegetation was gradually replaced by the landscape pattern dominated by artificial buildings.The change of climate and temperature caused by the expansion of urban construction land and the population aggregation,has aroused widespread concern.Under the background of national new type urbanization,improving the urban environment is the inevitable path to the new type urbanization. Urban heat island effect is the most prominent feature of human activities impact on temperature,and it has many effects on environment,economy,society,health and so on. Among the existing researches related to urban heat island effect,the influence of urbanization on it has not been paid enough attention.Therefore, the research on the effect of urban construction on the heat island effect is incompletable,and the method is limited to the quantitative analysis as the spatial analysis is insufficient. Based on the existing research,while under the background of urban planning major,taking Shanghai as a typical case, this paper concentrates on the urban heat island effect under the influence of Shanghai urban construction. First of all,this paper takes the Landsat-7 ETM+ remote sensing image data of Shanghai in 01/08/2000,28/07/2010 and 28/07/2016 as the basic research data.ENVI software is used to retrieve land surface temperature on the thermal infrared band.Then this paper divides the heat island effect level,analyses the spatiotemporal distribution of land surface temperature in different years in Shanghai,and summarizes the evolution characteristics of urban heat island effect, analyzing the spatial impact of urban construction related factors such as urban scale, spatial structure and land use. Analysis shows that city construction land expansion will aggravate the urban heat island effect.The increment of built construction in the city,the size of the resident population,as well as the population density have significant correlation with urban heat island effect,but the spatial distribution of population density and spatial distribution of heat island effect has no significant correlation.In various types of landuse,residential,industrial and mining,warehousing, commercial services,and transportation land can significantly aggravate the heat island effect, land types like green land, water area and farmland,etc can produce urban cold island effect in some individual area.At the same time,the location, area and shape of the green space and water area have an effect on the distance of reducing the heat island effect."

pub.1039773298,Sustainable Design of Packaging Materials,"The development and production of products in a more sustainable way has received special attention in recent years. In particular, packaging products range from single materials with simple designs as well as complex ones that include different materials (cardboard, woody boards, paper, plastics, etc.). A comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts of a product’s life cycle comprises functions from the extraction of raw materials to waste management and disposal (i.e., the life cycle-assessment perspective). Thus, the knowledge of the environmental impacts of packaging products used in a specific production sector is a factor of major importance not only with the aim of improving the environmental performance of products and/or processes but also to fulfill the requirements of the ecological/green products market. One of the most valid tools to assess and reduce the inherent environmental burdens associated with products is ecodesign or Design for the Environment (DfE). This methodology consists of applying environmental criteria to the development of a product and implies a change of how we regard that product. The assessment of environmental improvement of the product’s entire life cycle is also considered for a comprehensive analysis. To demonstrate the application of DfE in the ecodesign of packaging products, a wooden storage box was assessed. Different types of materials, such as timber, plywood, engineered woods, plastics, brads, hoods, and/or staples, can be considered in the manufacture process. This type of box is often used for packaging when mechanical resistance is required for heavy loads, long-term warehousing, or adequate rigidity. Moreover, when such a box is used in the food sector, its production chain must include fitosanitary thermal treatment. According to the assessment by means of DfE methodology, the relevance of the raw materials chosen, as well as their origin, can greatly influence the associated environmental burdens, which can also be confirmed quantitatively by LCA. Thus, a correct methodological adaptation of the concept of “eco-briefing” as a tool for communication among environmental technicians and designers, includes the simplification of the analytical tool used and the application of the life cycle-assessment methodology, which facilitates the environmental analysis, are required to obtain new formats of packaging materials designed within a sustainable perspective."

One of the sub-districts in the city of Bandung which has various supporting facilities such as housing, rice fields, shopping centers, hospitals, and schools is Rancasari District. Rancasari Subdistrict, which is located in the south of Bandung City, every year always experiences rapid population growth and development from various aspects. These rapid changes and developments are also inseparable from the influence of detailed urban spatial plans and zoning regulations. The residential area is one of the things that is being considered, followed by other sectors that are starting to be built, such as trade and services, the main road that connects between cities, and the busy traffic causes the area to become congested. As a result, green land such as rice fields is reduced so that there is a lack of useful drainage to prevent flooding. In this study, it will be seen how changes in land value zones are affected by RDTR and zoning, in Rancasari District by referring to the Land Value Zone Map and Land Use Map so that they can identify and map the changes that occur every year to the land.

One of the reasons is the lack of education owned by the surrounding population so that many families do not have a good life. In addition, as one of the areas located on the seafront, the Muara Angke area is one area that is busy with warehousing activities that trade in marine products so that part of the existing land is used as a place to work and trade. This causes problems in this area, such as the reduction of green land and public space for the surrounding population. The observations, data, and aspirations of community needs that have been collected will form a building that will answer the problem with a project design that will apply the third place concept introduced by Ray Oldenburg, then will use the architectural approach of regionalism in building designs and materials in buildings this. The project will be a space for interaction of local residents who have the main function as a container for the activities of surrounding residents and side functions that support the potential of culinary tourism to serve outside visitors with the concept of buildings that resemble oases in this dense area. In addition to being a place of entertainment, this building will also be a place of education for local people who teach them to be able to have a good education to help their lives.   Keywords:   education; fisherman; interaction space; muara angke   Abstrak Muara Angke merupakan salah satu kawasan miskin yang ada di Jakarta.

These goods need appropriate transportation and storage facilities due to their perishable nature and concise shelf life to reach the customers in fresh condition. Due to a lack of agricultural investment, the nation is susceptible to global pricing and exchange rate changes. The people concerned must put in a lot of work to accomplish this. The entire supply chain is rise with problems like lack of pricing transparency (at farmer’s end), traders domination, inadequate supply chain links, etc. Due to the farmer’s loss of income and the other chain of custody participants’ increased expenditures, the final consumer is ultimately forced to shoulder an elevated financial burden. The troubles engaged in this supply network have evolved dramatically and have impacted not only those in the supply chain but also the entire agricultural industry in India since organised retail has started expressing interest in marketing vegetables and fruits that are fresh, and they are currently entering the market in huge investments. In order to build a bridge between the rural and urban markets, the current study conducts a thorough evaluation of all relevant basic and contemporary literature. The supply chain’s unrecognised issues and pertinent research needs are also highlighted. The research project being suggested is exploratory and will make use of secondary sources. The data and information were gathered from numerous reports, periodicals, magazines, websites, etc. The major goal of this research is to comprehend the limitations of nation's management of supply chains for perishable commodities and to examine the different difficulties and opportunities that arise in routine product handling. The farmers will benefit from the quick entry of corporations into the selling of fruits and vegetables since they are establishing direct relationships with farmers and cutting out middlemen at all levels. The main obstacle is figuring out how to implement supply chain management best practices including collaboration forecasting, data integration, and increased usage. A competent management of the supply chains of perishable items will be essential in helping India’s economy flourish and become a worldwide leader in the food sector because the country’s economy is still largely agrarian. With an abundance of resources and potential, India’s rural and urban markets should be more closely integrated through effective vendor, warehousing, and logistics management. There are several reasons for the finest supply chain danger analysis available in the Indian industry. India’s economy, which is among the fastest-growing in the world, has grown to become a significant participant in the world's supply chains. To maintain efficient operations and reduce disruptions, nevertheless, the Indian market poses certain risks and problems that must be effectively managed. Here are some crucial details "
pub.1099667040,A Study on Version and Production of Palace drama set in Qing Dynasty “Jie Jie Hao Yin”,"『節節好音(Jie Jie Hao Yin)』, currently stored at National Library of China, is a Qing Dynasty Festival Court play script collection which was written by the Qing Dynasty’s Imperial Storehouse as one of its court dramas. It is consisted of 43 books and 86 scripts, covering 6 different Festival Court plays, including New Year’s Day, Lantern Festival, Yanjiu Festival, Snow Appreciation, Day of Kitchen God Worshipping and New Year’s Eve. From the day of Kitchen God Worshipping to Yanjiu Festival, is also a period of welcoming a new year and closing the old year, where celebration, banquet, drama and other performances are often taken place at the Royal Court. Therefore, this research is meaningful as theatrical performance and festival custom and culture during the Chinese New Year at the Royal Court of the Qing Dynasty could be studied through this piece of work. In addition, there are differences in how the script was written. Present Festival Court plays were mostly written in monochrome manuscript or red punctuates and 存庫本(Cunkuben: warehousing script), which was stored at the drama organization after actors used, were replaced with 安殿本(Andianben) in 『節節好音』, which was presented to the Emperor during the play. 『節節好音』 were written in multicolor, which also makes it unique and worthwhile to study its versions. Also, the fact that almost 90 scripts to be exact of Festival Court plays are stored at different institution for scientific research, including The Palace Museum, gives ample amount of reason to study this individually. But no researches were done so far as it was not easy to access the original manuscripts or to find history related to it. Some of the published are also incorrect and uncertain which brought confusion and dispute to some readers. 『節節好音』 is a five colored transcripts but not a five colored copy printed copy which uses yellow, red, black and green only, which makes it a four colored transcript instead. Also, originally it was consisted of all festival dramas covering all four seasons, spring, summer, autumn and winter (春夏秋冬), but now there is only an incomplete book of Spring Festival Drama (春天節戱) and Winter Festival Drama (冬天節戱). From 34 different types of facial makeup in operas portraits of characters in current 『節節好音』, we can also infer that Dragon Boat Festival Drama or part of Longevity Drama could have been included in the books. We should also look at the period of making 『節節好音』 to the Qianlong period, around 1746, not the late Kangxi period (1720). This is because Spring Festival Couplets, that were given to 張廷玉(Zhang Ting Yu) from the Emperor Yongzheng, appears in 『節節好音』, and also, in 『九宮大成南北詞宮譜 Xinding jiugong dacheng nanbeici gongpu』, Qupai: the names of the tunes to which Qu are composed, are used. Plus, the fact that Emperor Yongzheng’s taboo name ‘眞’ and Emperor Qianlong’s taboo name ‘弘’ were not used, could be another evidence that 『節節好音』 was written around Qianlong’s ruling period. It is also similar to those of th"

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.<>},

  abstract = {Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that use nondominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for their: 1) $O(MN^{3})$ computational complexity (where $M$ is the number of objectives and $N$ is the population size); 2) nonelitism approach; and 3) the need for specifying a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a nondominated sorting-based multiobjective EA (MOEA), called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast nondominated sorting approach with $O(MN^{2})$ computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) $N$ solutions. Simulation results on difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to Pareto-archived evolution strategy and strength-Pareto EA—two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multiobjective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multiobjective optimizer and much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148â€“156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy.

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine
translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural
machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be
jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed
recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of
encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into
a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this
paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in
improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and
propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for
parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,
without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new
approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing
state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French
translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the
(soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and
benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on
a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method
still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of
thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language
task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which
current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up
language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes
even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with
175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,
and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot
demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3
achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require
on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a
novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,
we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,
as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to
training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples
of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from
articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding
and of GPT-3 in general.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Here, we demonstrate how an engineered genetic circuit can be used to construct cells that respond to biological signals in a predetermined and programmable fashion. We employ a modular design strategy to create Escherichia coli strains where a genetic toggle switch is interfaced with: (i) the SOS signaling pathway responding to DNA damage, and (ii) a transgenic quorum sensing signaling pathway from Vibrio fischeri. The genetic toggle switch endows these strains with binary response dynamics and an epigenetic inheritance that supports a persistent phenotypic alteration in response to transient signals. These features are exploited to engineer cells that form biofilms in response to DNA-damaging agents and cells that activate protein synthesis when the cell population reaches a critical density. Our work represents a step toward the development of "plug-and-play" genetic circuitry that can be used to create cells with programmable behaviors.},

Recent experimental advances in both sequencing and genetic engineering have made this approach feasible through the design and implementation of synthetic gene networks amenable to mathematical modelling and quantitative analysis. These developments have signalled the emergence of a gene circuit discipline, which provides a framework for predicting and evaluating the dynamics of cellular processes. Synthetic gene networks will also lead to new logical forms of cellular control, which could have important applications in functional genomics, nanotechnology, and gene and cell therapy.},

We engineered the expression of a synthetic amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene and the mevalonate isoprenoid pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Escherichia coli. Concentrations of amorphadiene, the sesquiterpene olefin precursor to artemisinin, reached 24 μg caryophyllene equivalent/ml.

The description of the receiver is summarized via a 'datasheet' similar to those widely used in engineering. The process of refinement and characterization leading to the BBa_F2620 datasheet may serve as a starting template for producing many standardized genetically encoded objects.},

However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch—a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network—in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock3,4,5 to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such ‘rational network design’ may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

To identify the genome as synthetic, we inserted "watermarks" at intergenic sites known to tolerate transposon insertions. Overlapping "cassettes" of 5 to 7 kilobases (kb), assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, were joined by in vitro recombination to produce intermediate assemblies of approximately 24 kb, 72 kb ("1/8 genome"), and 144 kb ("1/4 genome"), which were all cloned as bacterial artificial chromosomes in Escherichia coli. Most of these intermediate clones were sequenced, and clones of all four 1/4 genomes with the correct sequence were identified. The complete synthetic genome was assembled by transformation-associated recombination cloning in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, then isolated and sequenced. A clone with the correct sequence was identified. The methods described here will be generally useful for constructing large DNA molecules from chemically synthesized pieces and also from combinations of natural and synthetic DNA segments.},

By doing so, it is advancing our understanding of the molecular basis of genetics in ways that analysis alone cannot.

As a test of this methodology, we have established conditions for the rapid (14-day) assembly of the complete infectious genome of bacteriophage X174 (5386 bp) from a single pool of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The procedure involves three key steps: (i). gel purification of pooled oligonucleotides to reduce contamination with molecules of incorrect chain length, (ii). ligation of the oligonucleotides under stringent annealing conditions (55 degrees C) to select against annealing of molecules with incorrect sequences, and (iii). assembly of ligation products into full-length genomes by polymerase cycling assembly, a nonexponential reaction in which each terminal oligonucleotide can be extended only once to produce a full-length molecule. We observed a discrete band of full-length assemblies upon gel analysis of the polymerase cycling assembly product, without any PCR amplification. PCR amplification was then used to obtain larger amounts of pure full-length genomes for circularization and infectivity measurements. The synthetic DNA had a lower infectivity than natural DNA, indicating approximately one lethal error per 500 bp. However, fully infectious X174 virions were recovered after electroporation into Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis of several infectious isolates verified the accuracy of these synthetic genomes. One such isolate had exactly the intended sequence. We propose to assemble larger genomes by joining separately assembled 5- to 6-kb segments; approximately 60 such segments would be required for a minimal cellular genome.},

  abstract = {A central problem in biology is determining how genes interact as parts of functional networks. Creation and analysis of synthetic networks, composed of well-characterized genetic elements, provide a framework for theoretical modeling. Here, with the use of a combinatorial method, a library of networks with varying connectivity was generated in Escherichia coli. These networks were composed of genes encoding the transcriptional regulators LacI, TetR, and lambda CI, as well as the corresponding promoters. They displayed phenotypic behaviors resembling binary logical circuits, with two chemical "inputs" and a fluorescent protein "output." Within this simple system, diverse computational functions arose through changes in network connectivity. Combinatorial synthesis provides an alternative approach for studying biological networks, as well as an efficient method for producing diverse phenotypes in vivo.},

A one-step polymerase assembly multiplexing reaction assembles these into multiple genes. This technology enabled us to synthesize all 21 genes that encode the proteins of the Escherichia coli 30S ribosomal subunit, and to optimize their translation efficiency in vitro through alteration of codon bias. This is a significant step towards the synthesis of ribosomes in vitro and should have utility for synthetic biology in general.},

The unique state of cells, and thus the diversity in a population, is owing to the different environmental stimuli the individual cells experience and the inherent stochastic nature of biochemical processes (for example, refs 5 and 6). It has been proposed, but not demonstrated, that autoregulatory, negative feedback loops in gene circuits provide stability7, thereby limiting the range over which the concentrations of network components fluctuate. Here we have designed and constructed simple gene circuits consisting of a regulator and transcriptional repressor modules in Escherichia coli and we show the gain of stability produced by negative feedback.},

We propose a combined rational and evolutionary design strategy for constructing genetic regulatory circuits, an approach that allows the engineer to fine-tune the biochemical parameters of the networks experimentally in vivo. By applying directed evolution to genes comprising a simple genetic circuit, we demonstrate that a nonfunctional circuit containing improperly matched components can evolve rapidly into a functional one. In the process, we generated a library of genetic devices with a range of behaviors that can be used to construct more complex circuits.},

To environmentally restrict invasion, we placed this module under the control of heterologous sensors. With the Vibrio fischeri lux quorum sensing circuit, the hypoxia-responsive fdhF promoter, or the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter, the bacteria invade cells at densities greater than 10(8)bacteria/ml, after growth in an anaerobic growth chamber or in the presence of 0.02% arabinose, respectively. In the process, we developed a technique to tune the linkage between a sensor and output gene using ribosome binding site libraries and genetic selection. This approach could be used to engineer bacteria to sense the microenvironment of a tumor and respond by invading cancerous cells and releasing a cytotoxic agent.},

Traditional principles for systems engineering must be supplemented with approaches that attend to details of biological systems and contexts.Several groups have developed small synthetic systems, including multicellular synthetic ecosystems in bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells; application-orientated systems, such as bacteria that sense and destroy tumours and organisms that produce drug precursors; and initial development of minimized cellular genomes.Many open questions and challenges remain, including the development of readily characterized, standardized and modular components; substantially reducing or exploiting biological noise in synthetic systems; determining the usefulness of innate or engineered epigenetic cellular functions; improving and creating new computational tools and programming abstractions for modelling and designing more complex systems; and determining safety issues and resolutions for clinical manifestations of synthetic biological systems.},

Specifically, we have built and characterized a ‘population control’ circuit that autonomously regulates the density of an Escherichia coli population. The cell density is broadcasted and detected by elements from a bacterial quorum-sensing system13,14, which in turn regulate the death rate. As predicted by a simple mathematical model, the circuit can set a stable steady state in terms of cell density and gene expression that is easily tunable by varying the stability of the cell–cell communication signal. This circuit incorporates a mechanism for programmed death in response to changes in the environment, and allows us to probe the design principles of its more complex natural counterparts.},

Assessments of the primacy of the antecedents suggest that ideological and strategic variables are better predictors of adaptations to jolts than are structural variables or measures of organizational slack. Although abrupt changes in environments are commonly thought to jeopardize organizations, environmental jolts are found to be ambiguous events that offer propitious opportunities for organizational learning, administrative drama, and introducing unrelated changes.},

Building on existing case studies of disaster, we develop a general theory of how an organizational system responds to an on-going stream of non-novel interruptions to existing plans and procedures. We show how an overaccumulation of interruptions can shift an organizational system from a resilient, self-regulating regime, which offsets the effects of this accumulation, to a fragile, self-escalating regime that amplifies them. We offer a new characterization of the conditions under which organizations may be prone to major disasters caused by an accumulation of minor interruptions.

  abstract = {Why do some people bounce back from life's hardships while others despair? HBR senior editor Diane Coutu looks at the nature of individual and organizational resilience, issues that have gained special urgency in light of the recent terrorist attacks, war, and recession. In the business arena, resilience has found its way onto the list of qualities sought in employees. As one of Coutu's interviewees puts it, "More than education, more than experience, more than training, a person's level of resilience will determine who succeeds and who fails." Theories abound about what produces resilience, but three fundamental characteristics seem to set resilient people and companies apart from others. One or two of these qualities make it possible to bounce back from hardship, but true resilience requires all three. The first characteristic is the capacity to accept and face down reality. In looking hard at reality, we prepare ourselves to act in ways that allow us to endure and survive hardships: We train ourselves how to survive before we ever have to do so. Second, resilient people and organizations possess an ability to find meaning in some aspects of life. And values are just as important as meaning; value systems at resilient companies change very little over the long haul and are used as scaffolding in times of trouble. The third building block of resilience is the ability to improvise. Within an arena of personal capabilities or company rules, the ability to solve problems without the usual or obvious tools is a great strength.},

Specifically, the argument is made that at this time, the OB field needs a proactive, positive approach emphasizing strengths, rather than continuing in the downward spiral of negativity trying to fix weaknesses. However, to avoid the surface positivity represented by the non‐sustainable best‐sellers, the case is made for positive organizational behavior (POB) to take advantage of the OB field's strength of being theory and research driven. Additional criteria for this version of POB are to identify unique, state‐like psychological capacities that can not only be validly measured, but also be open to development and performance management. Confidence, hope, and resiliency are offered as meeting such POB inclusion criteria. The overall intent of the essay is to generate some positive thinking and excitement for the OB field and ‘hopefully’ stimulate some new theory building, research, and effective application.

  abstract = {In less turbulent times, executives had the luxury of assuming that business models were more or less immortal. Companies always had to work to get better, but they seldom had to get different--not at their core, not in their essence. Today, getting different is the imperative. It's the challenge facing Coca-Cola as it struggles to raise its "share of throat" in noncarbonated beverages. It's the task that bedevils McDonald's as it tries to restart its growth in a burger-weary world. It's the hurdle for Sun Microsystems as it searches for ways to protect its high-margin server business from the Linux onslaught. Continued success no longer hinges on momentum. Rather, it rides on resilience-on the ability to dynamically reinvent business models and strategies as circumstances change. Strategic resilience is not about responding to a onetime crisis or rebounding from a setback. It's about continually anticipating and adjusting to deep, secular trends that can permanently impair the earning power of a core business. It's about having the capacity to change even before the case for change becomes obvious. To thrive in turbulent times, companies must become as efficient at renewal as they are at producing today's products and services. To achieve strategic resilience, companies will have to overcome the cognitive challenge of eliminating denial, nostalgia, and arrogance; the strategic challenge of learning how to create a wealth of small tactical experiments; the political challenge of reallocating financial and human resources to where they can earn the best returns; and the ideological challenge of learning that strategic renewal is as important as optimization.},

Certain airlines emerged successful and demonstrated remarkable resilience while others languished. This investigation identifies reasons why some airline companies recovered successfully after the attacks while others struggled. Evidence is provided that layoffs after the crisis, although intended to foster recovery, instead inhibited recovery throughout the 4 years after the crisis. But, layoffs after the crisis were strongly correlated with lack of financial reserves and lack of a viable business model prior to the crisis. Digging deeper, the authors find that having a viable business model itself depended on the development and preservation of relational reserves over time. Our model shows that the maintenance of adequate financial reserves enables the preservation of relational reserves and vice versa, contributing to organizational resilience in times of crisis.},

Extant research has not only confirmed the costly nature of supply chain disruptions but has also contributed relevant insights on such related issues as supply chain risks, vulnerability, resilience, and continuity. In this conceptual note, we focus on a relatively unexplored issue, asking and answering the question of how and why one supply chain disruption would be more severe than another. In doing so, we argue, de facto, that supply chain disruptions are unavoidable and, as a consequence, that all supply chains are inherently risky. Employing a multiple‐method, multiple‐source empirical research design, we derive novel insights, presented as six propositions that relate the severity of supply chain disruptions (i) to the three supply chain design characteristics of density, complexity, and node criticality and (ii) to the two supply chain mitigation capabilities of recovery and warning. These findings not only augment existing knowledge related to supply chain risk, vulnerability, resilience, and business continuity planning but also call into question the wisdom of pursuing such practices as supply base reduction, global sourcing, and sourcing from supply clusters.},

Three social mechanisms describe resilience activation.

Compassionate witnessing describes how organization members’ interpersonal connections and opportunities for engagement respond to individuals’ needs. And relational redundancy describes how organization members’ social capital and connections across organizational and functional boundaries activate relational networks that enable resilience.

                    In the emerging disciplines of risk management and supply chain management, resilience is a relatively undefined concept. The purpose of this paper is to present an integrated perspective on resilience through an extensive review of the literature in a number of disciplines including developmental psychology and ecosystems. In addition, the paper identifies and addresses some of the current theoretical gaps in the existing research.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Supply chain resilience has been defined by a number of disciplines. An integrative literature review is conducted in an attempt to integrate existing perspectives.

                    Findings
                    The key elements of supply chain resilience and the relationships among them, the links between risks and implications for supply chain management, and the methodologies for managing these key issues are poorly understood. Implications for future research advocate testing the proposed model empirically.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    Supply chain disruptions have adverse effect on both revenue and costs. Resilient supply chains incorporate event readiness, are capable of providing an efficient response, and often are capable of recovering to their original state or even better post the disruptive event.

This article presents a new Supply Chain Resilience Framework to help businesses deal with change. The conceptual framework is based on extant literature and refined through a focus group methodology. Our findings suggest that supply chain resilience can be assessed in terms of two dimensions: vulnerabilities and capabilities. The Zone of Resilience is defined as the desired balance between vulnerabilities and capabilities, where it is proposed that firms will be the most profitable in the long term. We identified seven vulnerability factors composed of 40 specific attributes and 14 capability factors from 71 attributes that facilitate the measurement of resilience.

                    The objective of this paper is to conceptualise supply chain resilience (SCRES) and to identify and explore empirically its relationship with the related concepts of supply chain vulnerability (SCV) and supply chain risk management (SCRM).
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    From a review of the literature the conceptual domain of SCRES is defined and the proposed relationships with SCRM and SCV are derived. Data from a longitudinal case study with three supply chains are presented to explore the relationship between the concepts in the context of the global financial crisis.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The empirical data provide support for a positive impact of supply chain risk (SCR) effect and knowledge management on SCRES and from SCRES on SCV. SCR effect and knowledge management seem to enhance the SCRES by improving the flexibility, visibility, velocity and collaboration capabilities of the supply chain. Thereby, they decrease the SCV in a disruptive risk event. The positive effects manifest themselves in upstream supplier networks of supply chains as well as in distribution channels to the customers.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The recession caused by the financial crisis has illustrated the importance of SCRES in today's interdependent global economy vividly. However, the concept is still in its infancy and has not received the same attention as its counterparts SCRM and SCV. The study confirms the benefit of resilient supply chains and outlines future research needs.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The paper identifies which supply chain capabilities can support the containment of disruptions and how these capabilities can be supported by effective SCRM.

However, to date, little attention has been given to PsyCap development through training interventions; nor have there been attempts to determine empirically if such PsyCap development has a causal impact on participants' performance. To fill these gaps we first conducted a pilot test of the PsyCap intervention (PCI) model with a randomized control group design. Next, we conducted a follow‐up study with a cross section of practicing managers to determine if following the training guidelines of the PCI caused the participants' performance to improve. Results provide beginning empirical evidence that short training interventions such as PCI not only may be used to develop participants' psychological capital, but can also lead to an improvement in their on‐the‐job performance. The implications these findings have for human resource development and performance management conclude the article.},

Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores and recovery rates increased during the 3 years after surgery and then plateaued. Radiographically, average spinal canal diameter remained enlarged past 5 years' follow-up. Factors leading to worsening of clinical symptoms included age greater than 60 years (4 patients), loss of sagittal canal diameter (2 patients), progression of ossification (4 patients), and minor trauma (1 patient).

  abstract = {The aim of this work was to add to the body of data on the frequency and severity of degenerative radiographic findings at adjacent levels after anterior cervical interbody fusion and on their clinical impact and to contribute to the insights about their pathogenesis. One hundred eighty patients who were treated by anterior cervical interbody fusion and who had a follow-up of >60 months were clinically and radiologically examined by independent investigators. For all patients, the long-term Odom score was compared with the score as obtained 6 weeks after surgery. For myelopathic cases, both the late Nurick and the Odom score were compared with the initial postoperative situation. For the adjacent disc levels, a radiologic "degeneration score" was defined and assessed both initially and at long-term follow-up. At late follow-up after anterior cervical interbody fusion, additional radiologic degeneration at the adjacent disc levels was found in 92% of the cases, often reflecting a clinical deterioration. The severity of this additional degeneration correlated with the time interval since surgery. The similarity of progression to degeneration between younger trauma patients and older nontrauma patients suggests that both the biomechanical impact of the interbody fusion and the natural progression of pre-existing degenerative disease act as triggering factors for adjacent level degeneration.},

Operative treatment consisted of anterior discectomy, partial corpectomy, or subtotal corpectomy at one level or more, followed by placement of autogenous bone graft from the iliac crest or the fibula. At the latest follow-up examination, thirty-eight of the eighty-two patients who had had a preoperative gait abnormality had a normal gait, thirty-three had an improvement in gait, six had no change, four had improvement and later deterioration, and one had a worse gait abnormality. Of the eighty-seven patients who had had a preoperative motor deficit, fifty-four had complete recovery; twenty-six, partial recovery; six, no change; and one had a worse deficit. The average grade according to the system of Nurick improved from 2.4 preoperatively to 1.2 (range, 0.0 to 5.0) postoperatively. A pseudarthrosis developed in sixteen patients, thirteen of whom had had a multilevel discectomy. Only one of thirty-eight arthrodeses that had been performed with use of a fibular strut graft was followed by a non-union. An unsatisfactory outcome with respect to pain was significantly associated with pseudarthrosis (p < 0.001). The development of complications other than non-union was associated with a history of one previous operative procedure or more (p = 0.005). Recurrent myelopathy was rare, but when it occurred it was associated with a pseudarthrosis or stenosis at a new level. The strongest predictive factor for recovery from myelopathy was the severity of the myelopathy before the operative intervention--that is, better preoperative neurological function was associated with a better neurological outcome. Anterior decompression and arthrodesis with autogenous bone-grafting can be performed safely, and is associated with a high rate of neurological recovery, functional improvement, and pain relief, in patients who have cervical spondylotic myelopathy.},

Patients with multilevel fusions notably exhibited these radiographic abnormalities at adjacent levels. Spinal canal stenosis, when associated with dynamic spinal canal stenosis in the vertebra above the fusion level, affected late neurologic results.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review study with literature review.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of our current study is to raise awareness on complications associated with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and their early detection and proper management.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It is known that ACDF constitutes one of the most commonly performed spinal procedures. Its outcome is quite satisfactory in the majority of cases. However, occasional complications can become troublesome, and in rare circumstances, catastrophic. Although there are several case reports describing such complications, their rate of occurrence is generally underreported, and data regarding their exact incidence in large clinical series are lacking. Meticulous knowledge of potential intraoperative and postoperative ACDF-related complications is of paramount importance so as to avoid them whenever possible, as well as to successfully and safely manage them when they are inevitable.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, 1015 patients undergoing first-time ACDF for cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy due to degenerative disc disease and/or cervical spondylosis were evaluated. A standard Smith-Robinson approach was used in all our patients, while an autologous or allograft was used, with or without a plate. Operative reports, hospital and outpatient clinic charts, and radiographic studies were reviewed for procedure-related complications. Mean follow-up time was 26.4 months.
RESULTS: The mortality rate in our current series was 0.1% (1 of 1015 patients, death occurred secondary to an esophageal perforation). Our overall morbidity rate was 19.3% (196 of 1015 patients). The most common complication was the development of isolated postoperative dysphagia, which observed in 9.5% of our patients. Postoperative hematoma occurred in 5.6%, but required surgical intervention in only 2.4% of our cases. Symptomatic recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy occurred in 3.1% of our cases. Dural penetration occurred in 0.5%, esophageal perforation in 0.3%, worsening of preexisting myelopathy in 0.2%, Horner's syndrome in 0.1%, instrumentation backout in 0.1%, and superficial wound infection in 0.1% of our cases.
CONCLUSION: Meticulous knowledge of the ACDF-associated complications allows for their proper management. Postoperative dysphagia, hematoma, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy were the most common complications in our series. Management of complications was successful in the vast majority of our cases.},

In order to avoid these disadvantages, a new surgical technique called "expansive open-door laminoplasty" was devised by the author in 1977, which is relatively easier, safer, and better than the ordinary laminectomy from the standpoint of structural mechanics of the cervical spine. The operative procedure is described in detail. Operative results in the patients with cervical OPLL, spondylosis, and canal stenosis were satisfactory, and optimal widening of the AP diameter of the spinal canal is considered to be over 4 mm. From this procedure a bilateral, open-door laminoplasty has been devised for extensive exploration at the intradural space.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We studied the incidence, prevalence, and radiographic progression of symptomatic adjacent-segment disease, which we defined as the development of new radiculopathy or myelopathy referable to a motion segment adjacent to the site of a previous anterior arthrodesis of the cervical spine.
METHODS: A consecutive series of 374 patients who had a total of 409 anterior cervical arthrodeses for the treatment of cervical spondylosis with radiculopathy or myelopathy, or both, were followed for a maximum of twenty-one years after the operation. The annual incidence of symptomatic adjacent-segment disease was defined as the percentage of patients who had been disease-free at the start of a given year of follow-up in whom new disease developed during that year. The prevalence was defined as the percentage of all patients in whom symptomatic adjacent-segment disease developed within a given period of follow-up. The natural history of the disease was predicted with use of a Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis. The hypothesis that new disease at an adjacent level is more likely to develop following a multilevel arthrodesis than it is following a single-level arthrodesis was tested with logistic regression.
RESULTS: Symptomatic adjacent-segment disease occurred at a relatively constant incidence of 2.9 percent per year (range, 0.0 to 4.8 percent per year) during the ten years after the operation. Survivorship analysis predicted that 25.6 percent of the patients (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 32 percent) who had an anterior cervical arthrodesis would have new disease at an adjacent level within ten years after the operation. There were highly significant differences among the motion segments with regard to the likelihood of symptomatic adjacent-segment disease (p<0.0001); the greatest risk was at the interspaces between the fifth and sixth and between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the risk of new disease at an adjacent level was significantly lower following a multilevel arthrodesis than it was following a single-level arthrodesis (p<0.001). More than two-thirds of all patients in whom the new disease developed had failure of nonoperative management and needed additional operative procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic adjacent-segment disease may affect more than one-fourth of all patients within ten years after an anterior cervical arthrodesis. A single-level arthrodesis involving the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra and preexisting radiographic evidence of degeneration at adjacent levels appear to be the greatest risk factors for new disease. Therefore, we believe that all degenerated segments causing radiculopathy or myelopathy should be included in an anterior cervical arthrodesis. Although our findings suggest that symptomatic adjacent-segment disease is the result of progressive spondylosis, patients should be informed of the substantial possibility that new disease will develop at an adjacent level over the long term.},

All patients had anterior compressive pathology, which was associated with instability (45%), neck pain (75%), myeloradiculopathy (90%), or severe neck deformity (30%). The mean degree of kyphosis was 38 degrees. Treatment consisted of a trial of cervical traction (75%), anterior corpectomy (95%), intersegmental decompression (5%), bone fusion (100%), and fixation with either Caspar (85%) or Synthes (15%) anterior plating at a mean of 3.8 levels. Halo fixation was used in 10% of patients. Postoperative complications included vocal cord paresis (15%), pneumonia (10%), wound dehiscence (5%), and screw pull-out (5%). At follow-up evaluation, a mean of 28 months after treatment, all patients had a solid fusion and a mean curvature improvement to 16 degrees residual kyphosis.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A preliminary outcome assessment study of titanium cage implants with anterior cervical plating in anterior cervical reconstruction.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of using titanium cage implants and anterior plating in cervical reconstruction.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Anterior decompression and interbody fusion is a widely accepted surgical treatment for patients with cervical spondylosis. Tricortical iliac crest autograft has been the gold standard but is associated with morbidity at the bone graft donor site, whereas allograft fibula is associated with pseudarthrosis. Problems such as pseudarthrosis, graft collapse, and extrusion still persist with the accepted method of harvesting and implanting bone autografts.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients were treated by channel corpectomy followed by placement of a titanium cage packed with autogenous bone graft from the vertebral bodies to reconstruct the anterior column. An anterior cervical plate was added in 30 of 34 cases that involved decompression of two or more levels. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 56 months, with an average follow-up period of 32 months, and included examination and radiography.
RESULTS: Six months after surgery, there was radiographic evidence of fusion in 97% of the patients. Eighty-eight percent of the patients (30 of 34) did not experience any complications (neither cage dislodgment nor hardware failure). Four patients had complications that included pseudarthrosis (1), extruded cage (1), cage in kyphosis (1), and radiculopathy (1).
CONCLUSIONS: Titanium cages provide immediate strong anterior column support with minimum hardware complications and avoid bone graft-site morbidity. Titanium cages, with concomitant use of anterior plating, offer an effective and safe alternative to bone autografts.},

METHODS: Between 1987 and 1998, 185 patients underwent cervical corpectomy for the treatment of degenerative spondylitic disease (81 cases), ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (16 cases), correction of postoperative kyphosis (31 cases), trauma (39 cases), tumor (10 cases), and infection (eight cases). Ninety-nine patients presented with myelopathy, 48 with radiculomyelopathy, 24 with radicular pain, and 14 with neck muscle pain. Eighty-seven patients underwent a one-level corpectomy; 45 of these patients underwent a discectomy at a different level. Seventy patients underwent a two-level corpectomy; 27 of these patients underwent a discectomy at a different level. Twenty-eight patients underwent a three-level corpectomy. Autograft (iliac crest) was used in 141 cases and allograft (fibula) in 44 cases. All but six patients underwent fixation with an anterior plate-screw system. There were no operative deaths. During the procedure the vertebral artery was injured in four patients and preserved in two of them. No neurological sequelae were encountered. Postoperative hoarseness, transient dysphagia, and pain at the graft site were transitory and successfully managed. The fusion rate was 98.8%. Six patients experienced transient deterioration after surgery but they improved. No patient experienced permanent neurological deterioration and 160 (86.5%) improved.
CONCLUSIONS: Corpectomy has an important role in the management of various degenerative, traumatic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders of cervical spine. Following treatment in this series, radiculopathy always improved and myelopathy was reversed in most patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with cervical spondylosis and/or myelopathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multishot echo-planar imaging sequence with calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and apparent diffusion tensor (ADT) was applied in 36 patients with symptomatic cervical spondylosis. Diffusion-weighted images read by two neuroradiologists were compared with T2-weighted fast spin-echo images read independently by three neuroradiologists with regard to clinical status (n = 36). MR findings in a selected subgroup of 20 patients whose clinical status was confirmed by electrophysiologic examination also were compared. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of both T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (ADC and ADT) were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: Patients with myelopathy had abnormal ADC (17 of 21) and ADT (15 of 19) maps with increased ADC and ADT values and decreased anisotropy. For the detection of myelopathy, diffusion-weighted ADC maps had a sensitivity of 80% (17 of 21), while T2-weighted images had a sensitivity of 61% (13 of 21). The negative predictive value was 63% (seven of 11) and 60% (12 of 20) for ADC maps and T2-weighted images, respectively. Conversely, the specificity of diffusion-weighted images (53%; seven of 13) was lower than that of T2-weighted images (92%; 12 of 13). In patients with myelopathy confirmed at electrophysiologic examination, the sensitivity of diffusion-weighted images increased to 92% (12 of 13) and the negative predictive value increased to 75% (three of four), while T2-weighted images had a 53% (seven of 13) sensitivity and a 50% (six of 12) negative predictive value.
CONCLUSION: Diffusion weighting improved the sensitivity of imaging in cervical spondylotic myelopathy.},

Within the factors responsible for decrease in the ratio, developmental narrowing of the spinal canal was the most significant, and multiplicity of spondylotic protrusion less so. The former resulted in an extensive demyelination of the posterolateral funiculus and infarction of the gray matter. Recurrent trauma proved to cause distinct manifestations and cord pathology. Clinicopathologic correlations were also examined from the neurologic findings at the terminal stage.},

A short duration of symptoms before operation was associated with better results, but these were not influenced by the age of the patients.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This Cervical Spine Research Society (CSRS) Study is a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized investigation of patients with cervical spondylosis and disc disease. In this analysis, only patients with cervical myelopathy as the predominant syndrome were considered.
OBJECTIVES: To determine demographics, surgeon treatment practices, and outcomes in patients with symptomatic myelopathy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Current data on patient demographics and treatment practices of surgeons do not exist. There are no published prospective studies in which neurologic, functional, pain, and activities of daily living outcomes are systematically quantified.
METHODS: Patients were recruited by participating CSRS surgeons. Demographic information, patients' symptoms, and patients' functional data were compiled from patient and physician surveys completed at the time of initial examination, and outcomes were assessed from patient surveys completed after treatment. Data were compiled and statistically analyzed by a blinded third party.
RESULTS: Sixty-two (12%) of the 503 patients enrolled by 41 CSRS surgeons had myelopathy. Patients (48.4% male; mean age, 48.7 +/- 12.03 years) had a mean duration of symptoms of 29.8 months (range, 8 weeks to 180 months). Surgery was recommended for 31 (50%) of these patients. Forty-three patients (69%) returned for follow-up and completed the questionnaire adequately for analysis. Twenty (46%) of the 43 patients on whom follow-up data are available underwent surgery, and 23 (54%) received medical treatment. Surgically treated patients had a significant improvement in functional status and overall pain, with improvement also observed in neurologic symptoms. Patients treated nonsurgically had a significant worsening of their ability to perform activities of daily living, with worsening of neurologic symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: When medical and surgical treatments are compared, surgically treated patients appear to have better outcomes, despite exhibiting a greater number of neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms and having greater functional disability before treatment. Randomized studies, if feasible, should be performed to address outcome in cervical myelopathy further.},

OBJECTIVES: To investigate which magnetic resonance findings in patients with cervical compression myelopathy reflect the clinical symptoms and prognosis, and to determine the radiographic and clinical factors that correlate with the prognosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Signal intensity changes of the spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging in chronic cervical myelopathy are thought to be indicative of the prognosis. However, the prognostic significance of signal intensity change remains controversial.
METHODS: The participants in this study were 73 patients who underwent cervical expansive laminoplasty for cervical compression myelopathy. Their mean age was 64 years, and the mean postoperative follow-up period was 3.4 years. The pathologic conditions were cervical spondylotic myelopathy in 42 patients and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in 31 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (spin-echo sequence) was performed in all the patients. The transverse area of the spinal cord at the site of maximal compression was computed, and spinal cord signal intensity changes were evaluated before and after surgery. Three patterns of spinal cord signal intensity changes on T1-weighted sequences/T2-weighted sequences were detected as follows: normal/normal, normal/high-signal intensity changes, and low-signal/high-signal intensity changes. Surgical outcomes were compared among these three groups. The most useful combination of parameters for predicting prognosis was determined using a stepwise regression analysis.
RESULTS: The findings showed 2 patients with normal/normal, 67 patients with normal/high-signal, and 4 patients with low-signal/high-signal change patterns before surgery. Regarding postoperative recovery, the preoperative low-signal/high-signal group was significantly inferior to the preoperative normal/high-signal group. There was no significant difference between the transverse area of the spinal cord at the site of maximal compression in the normal/high-signal group and the low-signal/high-signal group. A stepwise regression analysis showed that the best combination of surgical outcome predictors included age (correlation coefficient R = -0.348), preoperative signal pattern, and duration of symptoms (correlation coefficient R = -0.231).
CONCLUSIONS: The low-signal intensity changes on T1-weighted sequences indicated a poor prognosis. The authors speculate that high-signal intensity changes on T2 weighted images include a broad spectrum of compressive myelomalacic pathologies and reflect a broad spectrum of spinal cord recuperative potentials. Predictors of surgical outcomes are preoperative signal intensity change pattern of the spinal cord on radiologic evaluations, age at the time of surgery, and chronicity of the disease.},

                  Nineteen patients were examined for cervical spondylotic myelopathy with magnetic resonance imaging. Pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance scans were obtained in most cases. Surgical confirmation of the pathological condition was obtained for all 19 patients. On the T2-weighted scans, there was increased signal intensity within the spinal cord at the point of maximal compression. The exact cause of the increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images is not known, but is suspected to represent edema, inflammation, vascular ischemia, myelomalacia, or gliosis. The increased signal intensity diminished postoperatively in the patients who improved clinically, and remained the same or increased in those whose conditions remained unchanged or worsened after decompression. The authors suggest that these T2-weighted images carry prognostic significance.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The authors report the long-term (more than 10-year) results of cervical laminoplasty for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the cervical spine as well as the factors affecting long-term postoperative course.
METHODS: The authors reviewed data obtained in 92 patients who underwent cervical laminoplasty between 1982 and 1990. Three patients were lost to follow up, 25 patients died within 10 years of surgery, and 64 patients were followed for more than 10 years. Results were assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring system for cervical myelopathy. The recovery rate was calculated using the Hirabayashi method. The mean neurological recovery rate during the first 10 years after surgery was 64%, which declined to 60% at the last follow-up examination (mean follow up 12.2 years). Late neurological deterioration occurred in eight patients (14%) from 5 to 15 years after surgery. The most frequent causes of late deterioration were degenerative lumbar disease (three patients), thoracic myelopathy secondary to ossification of the ligamentum flavum (two patients), or postoperative progression of OPLL at the operated level (two patients). Postoperative progression of the ossified lesion was noted in 70% of the patients, but only two patients (3%) were found to have related neurological deterioration. Additional cervical surgery was required in one patient (2%) because of neurological deterioration secondary to progression of the ossified ligament. The authors performed a multivariate stepwise analysis, and found that factors related to better clinical results were younger age at operation and less severe preexisting myelopathy. Younger age at operation, as well as mixed and continuous types of OPLL, was highly predictive of progression of OPLL. Postoperative progression of kyphotic deformity was observed in 8% of the patients, although it did not cause neurological deterioration.
CONCLUSIONS: When the incidence of surgery-related complications and the strong possibility of postoperative growth of OPLL are taken into consideration, the authors recommend expansive and extensive laminoplasty for OPLL.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of graft and plate complications after multilevel anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACF) attributed to spondylosis, stenosis, and ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament was conducted.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors contributing to graft and plate complications in this population.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Biomechanical factors contributing to the increased morbidity associated with plated multilevel ACF were evaluated.
METHODS: Graft- and/or plate-related complications were retrospectively reviewed in 33 patients undergoing two-level ACF reconstructions and in seven patients having three-level ACF reconstructions performed with iliac crest grafting and instrumentation with a fixed-plated design (cervical spine locking plate). Neurologic status was assessed before surgery and after surgery using both the Nurick Grading Scale and modified JOA (Japanese Orthopaedic Association) Score. The patients were observed an average of 31.4 months after surgery. The follow-up included lateral flexion and extension radiographs and a neurologic examination.
RESULTS: Two of the 33 patients undergoing two-level fusions available for long-term follow-up after surgery developed reconstruction failures. All of the remaining fusions were successful, demonstrated by lateral flexion and extension radiographs. Seven patients had plated three-level corpectomy reconstructions. Five of the seven who had anterior-only reconstruction failed.
DISCUSSION: A two-level ACF reconstruction is reliable with an anterior strut graft and fixed screw plate construct. A three-level ACF reconstruction is not reliably achieved with an anterior-only construct. The construct failures may be attributed in part to the fixed-plated design being used, as well as the long lever arm of the construct.
CONCLUSION: There is a 6% failure rate after fixed-plated (cervical spine locking plate) two-level ACF reconstruction but a 71% failure rate after three-level fixed-plated ACF reconstruction. Future consideration should be given to simultaneous posterior fusion.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Matched patient cohorts using retrospective chart and radiographic review with independent clinical and radiographic follow-up were reviewed.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of multilevel corpectomy and laminoplasty using an independent matched-cohort analysis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The treatment of choice for multilevel cervical myelopathy remains a matter of investigation. For the decompression of three or more motion segments, multilevel corpectomy and laminoplasty have proven effective while avoiding the pitfalls of laminectomy. Direct clinical comparisons of these two procedures are few in number and are limited by the heterogeneity in their patient groups.
METHODS: Medical records of all patients treated for multilevel cervical myelopathy with either multilevel corpectomy or laminoplasty between 1994 and 1999 at the Emory Spine Center were reviewed. From a pool of 38 patients meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 patients who underwent multilevel corpectomy were blindly matched with 13 patients who underwent laminoplasty based on known prognostic criteria. A single physician independently evaluated each patient and their radiographs at their latest follow-up appointment.
RESULTS: The cohorts were well matched by age, duration of symptoms, severity of myelopathy (Nurick grade), and preoperative sagittal alignment (C2-C7). Mean operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay were nearly identical. The mean follow-up for multilevel corpectomy and laminoplasty were 49 and 40 months, respectively. Improvement in function averaged 1.6 Nurick grades after laminoplasty and 0.9 grades after multilevel corpectomy (P > 0.05). Subjective improvements in strength, dexterity, sensation, pain, and gait were similar for the two operations. The prevalence of axial discomfort at the latest follow-up was the same for each cohort, but the analgesic requirements tended to be greater for patients who underwent multilevel corpectomy. Sagittal motion from C2 to C7 decreased by 57% after multilevel corpectomy and by 38% after laminoplasty. One complication (C6-C7 herniated nucleus pulposus [HNP] requiring anterior discetomy with fusion) occurred in the laminoplasty group. Multilevel corpectomy complications included progression of myelopathy, nonunion, persistent dysphagia, persistent dysphonia, and subjacent motion segment ankylosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Both multilevel corpectomy and laminoplasty reliably arrest myelopathic progression in multilevel cervical myelopathy and can lead to significant neurologic recovery and pain reduction in a majority of patients. Surprisingly, the laminoplasty cohort tended to require less pain medication at final follow-up than did the multilevel corpectomy cohort. Given this and the higher prevalence of complications among multilevel corpectomy patients, it is believed that laminoplasty may be the preferred method of treatment for multilevel cervical myelopathy in the absence of preoperative kyphosis.},

OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of complications and mortality associated with surgery for degenerative disease of the cervical spine using population-based data. To evaluate the associations between complications and mortality and age, primary diagnosis and type of surgical procedure.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recent studies have shown an increase in the number of cervical spine surgeries performed for degenerative disease in the United States. However, the associations between complications and mortality and age, primary diagnosis and type of surgical procedure are not well described using population-based data.
METHODS: We created an algorithm defining degenerative cervical spine disease and associated complications using the International Classification of Diseases-ninth revision Clinical Modification codes. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we determined the primary diagnoses, surgical procedures, and associated in-hospital complications and mortality from 1992 to 2001.
RESULTS: From 1992 to 2001, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample included an estimated 932,009 (0.3%) hospital discharges associated with cervical spine surgery for degenerative disease. The majority of admissions were for herniated disc (56%) and cervical spondylosis with myelopathy (19%). Complications and mortality were more common in the elderly, and after posterior fusions or surgical procedures associated with a primary diagnosis of cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in outcome associated with age, primary diagnosis, and type of surgical procedure. Administrative databases may underestimate the incidence of complications, but these population-based studies may provide information for comparison with surgical case series and help evaluate rare or severe complications.},

Forty-one patients who received subtotal corpectomy and strut grafting (SCS) and forty-two undergoing laminoplasty were followed up for at least 2 years after surgery. Regarding factors known to affect surgical prognosis (age at surgery, duration of symptoms, severity of neurologic deficit, anteroposterior canal diameter, transverse area of the cord at the site of maximum compression, number of levels involved), the two groups were statistically comparable with each other. The severity of neurologic deficits was assessed by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale. Results were evaluated in terms of postoperative score and recovery rate. The difference between the recovery rate and final score between the two groups was not statistically significant. Surgical complications were more frequent in the subtotal corpectomy and strut grafting group than in the laminoplasty group. The most frequent complications encountered in the subtotal corpectomy and strut grafting group were related to bone grafting. Spinal alignment worsened in six patients of the laminoplasty group, but none of them suffered from neurologic deterioration. Another disadvantage of subtotal corpectomy and strut grafting was the longer postoperative period of bed rest needed to secure graft stability. We conclude that laminoplasty should be the treatment of choice for multisegmental cervical spondylotic myelopathy when neurologic results, incidence of complications, and postoperative treatment are taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The authors undertook a study to explore the predisposing risk factors, frequency of occurrence, and clinical implications of kyphosis following laminectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
METHODS: Preoperative radiological studies were available in 46 patients with CSM who had undergone laminectomy. Records were reviewed to obtain demographic data and operative reports. Preoperative radiographs were assessed to determine spinal alignment. In a follow-up interview the authors established clinical outcome and patient satisfaction. Postoperative cervical alignment and mobility was also determined by assessing lateral neutral, flexion, and extension x-ray films. Preoperatively, the cervical spine was shown to be kyphotic in four (9%) of 46, straight in 20 (43%) of 46, and lordotic in 22 (48%) of 46 patients. Nine (21%) of 42 patients with either straight or lordotic alignment demonstrated in the preoperative period developed kyphosis after surgery. Kyphosis developed in six (30%) of 20 patients in whom straight spinal alignment was demonstrated preoperatively and in only three (14%) of 22 patients in whom lordosis was found preoperatively. Clinically, 13 (29%) of 45 patients improved and 19 (42%) of 45 remained unchanged after an average 4-year follow-up period; 36 (80%) patients believed that their surgery was successful (one patient, who was mentally retarded, could not respond to the follow-up questionnaire). Spinal alignment was not predictive of outcome; cervical mobility as demonstrated on flexion and extension, however, correlated with improved functional performance (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Kyphosis may develop in up to 21% of patients who have undergone laminectomy for CSM. Progression of the deformity appears to be more than twice as likely if preoperative radiological studies demonstrate a straight spine. In this study, clinical outcome did not correlate with either pre- or postoperative sagittal alignment.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of two procedures increasingly used to treat multilevel cervical myelopathy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Traditional methods of treating multilevel cervical myelopathy (laminectomy and corpectomy) are reported to have a notable frequency of complications. Laminoplasty and laminectomy with fusion have been advocated as superior procedures. A comparative study of these two techniques has not been reported.
METHODS: Medical records of all patients treated for multilevel cervical myelopathy with either laminoplasty or laminectomy with fusion between 1994 and 1999 at our institution were reviewed. Thirteen patients that underwent laminectomy with fusion were matched with 13 patients that underwent laminoplasty. All patients and radiographs were independently evaluated at latest follow-up by a single physician.
RESULTS: Cohorts were well matched based on patient age, duration of symptoms, and severity of myelopathy (Nurick grade) before surgery. Mean independent follow-up was similar (25.5 and 26.2 months). Both objective improvement in patient function (Nurick score) and the number of patients reporting subjective improvement in strength, dexterity, sensation, pain, and gait tended to be greater in the laminoplasty cohort. Whereas no complications occurred in the laminoplasty cohort, there were 14 complications in 9 patients that underwent laminectomy with fusion patients. Complications included progression of myelopathy, nonunion, instrumentation failure, development of a significant kyphotic alignment, persistent bone graft harvest site pain, subjacent degeneration requiring reoperation, and deep infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The marked difference in complications and functional improvement between these matched cohorts suggests that laminoplasty may be preferable to laminectomy with fusion as a posterior procedure for multilevel cervical myelopathy.},

The operative mortality rate was 3% (one patient) and two patients died 2 months postoperatively. Postoperative complications included early graft displacement requiring reoperation (three patients), transient dysphagia (two patients), cerebrospinal fluid leak treated by lumbar drainage (three patients), myocardial infarction (two patients), and late graft fracture (one patient). One patient developed transient worsening of myelopathy and three developed new, temporary radiculopathies. All patients achieved stable bone union and the mean Nurick grade at an average of 31 +/- 20 months (range 0-79 months) postoperatively was 2.4 +/- 1.6 (p < 0.05, t-test). Cervicobrachial pain improved in 10 (59%) of the 17 patients who had preoperative pain and myelopathy improved at least one grade in 17 patients (47%; p < 0.05). Twenty-six surviving patients (72%) were followed for more than 24 months and stable, osseous union occurred in 97%. These results show that extensive, multilevel anterior decompression and stabilization using fibular allograft can be achieved with a perioperative mortality and major morbidity rate of 22% and with significant improvement in pain and myelopathy.},

  abstract = {The long-term outcome of cervical spondylitic myelopathy after surgical treatment was retrospectively reviewed and critically evaluated in 100 patients with documented cervical myelopathy treated between 1978 and 1988 at our institution. Eighty-four patients were available for long-term study. The median duration of follow up was 7.35 years (range 3 to 9.5 years). There were 67 men and 17 women; their ages ranged from 27 to 86 years. The duration of preoperative symptoms ranged from 1 month to 10 years. Preoperative functional grade as evaluated with the Nurick Scale for the group was 2.1. Thirty-three patients with primarily anterior cord compression, one- or two-level disease, or a kyphotic neck deformity were treated by anterior decompression and fusion. Fifty-one patients with primarily posterior or cord compression and multiple-level disease were treated by posterior laminectomy. There was no difference in the preoperative functional grade in these two groups. The patients in the posterior treatment group were older (59 vs 55 years). There was no surgical mortality from the operative procedures; morbidity was 3.6%. Of the 33 patients undergoing anterior decompression and fusion, 24 showed immediate functional improvement and nine were unchanged. Of the 51 patients who underwent posterior laminectomy, 35 demonstrated improvement, 11 were unchanged, and five were worse. Six patients, one in the anterior group and five in the posterior group, demonstrated early deterioration. Late deterioration occurred from 2 to 68 months postoperatively. Four (12%) patients who had undergone anterior procedures had additional posterior procedures, and seven (13.7%) patients who had undergone posterior procedures had additional decompressive surgery. The final functional status at last follow-up examination for the 33 patients in the anterior group was improved in 18, unchanged in nine, and deteriorated in six. Of the 51 patients who underwent posterior decompression, 19 benefited from the surgery, 13 were unchanged, and 19 were worse at last follow up than before their initial surgical procedure. Age, severity of disease, number of levels operated, and preoperative grade were not predictive of outcome. The only factor related to potential deterioration was the duration of symptoms preoperatively. The results indicate that with anterior or posterior decompression, long-term outcome is variable, and a subgroup of patients, even after adequate decompression and initial improvement, will have late functional deterioration.},

  abstract = {Between 1976 and 1984, fourteen patients who had severe cervical kyphosis and myelopathy were treated with anterior decompression and arthrodesis. Eight had had spondylosis; five, a traumatic injury; and one, a benign intradural tumor. In eight of the fourteen patients, the severe kyphosis and myelopathy had developed after a laminectomy of three, four, or five cervical vertebrae. The laminectomy had been done for the treatment of spondylosis in five patients, of a traumatic lesion in two, and of a tumor in one. Considering all fourteen patients, an average of 2.25 vertebral bodies was removed from each, and the average extent of the subsequent fusion was 3.25 levels. Eight patients (six of whom had spondylosis; one, a traumatic lesion; and one, a tumor) were treated with a fibular graft that spanned an average of 4.10 levels, and six patients (four of whom had a traumatic lesion and two, spondylosis) were treated with an iliac graft that spanned an average of 2.70 levels. Of the five patients who had a traumatic lesion, four were treated with anterior decompression and arthrodesis, combined with posterior arthrodesis that was performed during the same period of anesthesia. In three patients, the anterior graft dislodged during the immediate postoperative period. Two of the three patients had posterior instability due to a prior laminectomy, and in the third the graft dislodged because of technical difficulties. Two of these grafts were revised to restore stability. At the latest follow-up, twelve of the fourteen fusions were solid. In the other two patients, who died six and ten months postoperatively, the fusion had been solid, as shown by radiographs, before the time of death. The average amount of correction of the kyphotic deformities was 32 degrees, a reduction from an average of 45 degrees to an average of 13 degrees. All but one patient had some recovery of neural function; nine had complete and four, partial recovery. The remaining patient had relief of pain, but he continued to be completely quadriplegic although he had some sensory sparing. Of the four patients who had been unable to walk preoperatively, three were able to walk postoperatively. No patient lost neural function after the anterior decompression and arthrodesis. We concluded that, in the presence of severe cervical kyphosis and myelopathy, adequate anterior decompression of the spinal cord, correction of the kyphosis, and anterior arthrodesis using a strut graft can yield excellent results without undue risk.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study analyzed the effects of cervical alignment on surgical results of expansive laminoplasty (ELAP) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the limitation of posterior decompression by ELAP for CSM in the presence of local kyphosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several studies have reported that cervical malalignment affected surgical outcomes of ELAP. However, there has been no report to demonstrate crucial determinants of surgical outcomes of ELAP for CSM in relation to cervical sagittal alignment.
METHODS: The study group comprised 114 patients who underwent ELAP for CSM. All were followed up for more than 2 years. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring system for cervical myelopathy (full score, 17 points) was used to evaluate surgical outcomes for each patient 2 years after surgery. Statistical analysis with multivariate logistic regression models was used to ascertain the risk factors affecting postoperative surgical outcomes.
RESULTS: The average JOA scores were 9.9 points before surgery and 14 points 2 years after surgery. The recovery rate was 60.2%. Statistical analysis showed that signal intensity change on MRI and local kyphosis were the most crucial risk factors for poor surgical outcomes. Calculated with the logistic regression model, the highest risk of poor recovery was local kyphosis exceeding 13 degrees.
CONCLUSIONS: The influence of cervical malalignment on neurologic recovery after ELAP for CSM was shown. When patients have local kyphosis exceeding 13 degrees, anterior decompression or posterior correction of kyphosis as well as ELAP should be considered. Expansive laminoplasty for CSM is best indicated for patients with local kyphosis less than 13 degrees.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of pedicle screw fixation in reconstructive surgery for nontraumatic cervical spinal disorders.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pedicle screw fixation for hangman's fracture of the axis and traumatic lesions of the middle and lower cervical spine has been reported; however, there have been no reports on pedicle screw fixation for nontraumatic lesions of the cervical spine.
METHODS: Forty-five patients with nontraumatic lesions of the cervical spine underwent reconstructive surgery including pedicle screw fixation and fusion. Five patients underwent occipitocervical fixation for the lesion of the upper cervical spine, and one patient underwent separate occipitocervical fixation and cervicothoracic fixation. Cervical or cervicothoracic fixation was performed in 39 patients. Twenty-six of these patients underwent simultaneous laminectomy or laminoplasty. Supplemental anterior surgery was conducted for 15 patients.
RESULTS: Solid fusion was obtained in all patients except eight with metastatic vertebral tumors who did not receive bone graft. Correction of kyphosis was adequate. There were no neurovascular complications, except one case of transient radiculopathy caused by screw threads.
CONCLUSIONS: Pedicle screw fixation is a useful procedure for posterior reconstruction of the cervical spine. This procedure does not require the lamina for stabilization, and should be especially valuable for simultaneous posterior decompression and fusion. The risk to neurovascular structures, however, cannot be completely eliminated.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Cervical total disc replacement (CTDR) represents a relatively novel procedure intended to address some of the shortcomings associated with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) by preserving motion at the treated level. This prospective, randomized, multicenter study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a new metal-on-metal CTDR implant (Kineflex|C) by comparing it with ACDF in the treatment of single-level spondylosis with radiculopathy.
METHODS: The study was a prospective, randomized US FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) pivotal trial conducted at 21 centers across the US. The primary clinical outcome measures included the Neck Disability Index (NDI), visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and a composite measure of clinical success. Patients were randomized to CTDR using the Kineflex|C (SpinalMotion, Inc.) cervical artificial disc or ACDF using structural allograft and an anterior plate.
RESULTS: A total of 269 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either CTDR (136 patients) or to ACDF (133 patients). There were no significant differences between the CTDR and ACDF groups when comparing operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, or the reoperation rate at the index level. The overall success rate was significantly greater in the CTDR group (85%) compared with the ACDF group (71%) (p = 0.05). In both groups, the mean NDI scores improved significantly by 6 weeks after surgery and remained significantly improved throughout the 24-month follow-up (p < 0.0001). Similarly, the VAS pain scores improved significantly by 6 weeks and remained significantly improved through the 24-month follow-up (p < 0.0001). The range of motion (ROM) in the CTDR group decreased at 3 months but was significantly greater than the preoperative mean at 12- and 24-month follow-up. The ROM in the ACDF group was significantly reduced by 3 months and remained so throughout the follow-up. Adjacent-level degeneration was also evaluated in both groups from preoperatively to 2-year follow-up and was classified as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Preoperatively, there were no significant differences between groups when evaluating the different levels of adjacent-level degeneration. At the 2-year follow-up, there were significantly more patients in the ACDF group with severe adjacent-level radiographic changes (p < 0.0001). However, there were no significant differences between groups in adjacent-level reoperation rate (7.6% for the Kineflex|C group and 6.1% for the ACDF group).
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical total disc replacement allows for neural decompression and clinical results comparable to ACDF. Kineflex|C was associated with a significantly greater overall success rate than fusion while maintaining motion at the index level. Furthermore, there were significantly fewer Kineflex|C patients showing severe adjacent-level radiographic changes at the 2-year follow-up. These results from a prospective, randomized study support that Kineflex|C CTDR is a viable alternative to ACDF in select patients with cervical radiculopathy.},

OBJECTIVES: To elucidate efficacy and problems of original open-door laminoplasty to improve future surgical outcomes.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Little information is available on long-term outcomes of original open-door laminoplasty without grafts, implants, or instruments.
METHOD: The study group included 80 patients who underwent original open-door laminoplasty and were followed for minimum 10 years. Clinical results, including Japanese Orthopedic Association scores, recovery rates, occurrences of complications, and long-term deterioration were investigated. Cervical alignments, type of OPLL, cervical range of motion, anteroposterior diameter of spinal canal, and progression of OPLL were assessed on plain radiographs. Spinal cord decompression was verified on magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Average Japanese Orthopedic Association score and recovery rate improved significantly until 3 years after surgery and remained at an acceptable level in both cervical spondylosis and OPLL patients with slight deterioration after 5 years. Segmental motor palsy developed in 8 patients. Late deterioration, mainly lower extremity motor score decline, developed in 8 CSM and 16 OPLL patients. Overall cervical range of motion decreased by 36%. Patients with cervical lordosis decreased gradually in both patient groups. Such changes in alignments did not affect surgical results in CSM patients, while OPLL patients with preoperative kyphosis had lower recovery rates than those with straight and lordotic alignments. OPLL progression that was detected in 66% of patients did not affect clinical results. Although infrequent, magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophy of spinal cord, spinal cord compression at adjacent segments due to degenerative changes and OPLL progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term results of open-door laminoplasty without bone graft, graft substitutes, or instruments were satisfactory. However, segmental motor paralysis, kyphosis, established before and after surgery, OPLL progression, and late deterioration due to age-related degeneration remain challenging problems.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The concept of accelerated degeneration of adjacent disc levels as a consequence of increased stress caused by interbody fusion of the cervical spine has been widely postulated. Therefore, reconstruction of a failed intervertebral disc with a functional disc prosthesis should offer the same benefits as fusion while simultaneously providing motion and thereby protecting the adjacent level discs from the abnormal stresses associated with fusion. This study was designed to determine whether a new, functional intervertebral cervical disc prosthesis can provide relief from objective neurological symptoms and signs, improve the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living, decrease pain, and provide stability and normal range of motion.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, concurrently enrolled, multicenter trial of the Bryan Cervical Disc Prosthesis (Spinal Dynamics Corp., Mercer Island, WA) for the treatment of patients with single-level degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine. Patients with symptomatic cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy underwent implantation with the Bryan prosthesis after a standard anterior cervical discectomy. At scheduled follow-up periods, the effectiveness of the device was characterized by evaluating each patient's pain, neurological function, and range of motion at the implanted level.
RESULTS: Analysis included data regarding 60 patients at 6 months with 30 of those patients at 1 year. Clinical success at 6 months and 1 year after implantation was 86 and 90%, respectively, exceeding the study's acceptance criteria of 85%. These results compare favorably with the short-term clinical outcomes associated with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion reported in the literature. At 1 year, there was no measurable subsidence of the devices (based on a measurement detection threshold of 2 mm). Evidence of anterior and/or posterior device migration was detected in one patient and suspected in a second patient. There was no evidence of spondylotic bridging at the implanted disc space. The measured range of motion in flexion-extension, as determined by an independent radiologist, ranged from 1 to 21 degrees (mean range of motion, 9 +/- 5 degrees). No devices have been explanted or surgically revised.
CONCLUSION: Discectomy and implantation of the device alleviates neurological symptoms and signs similar to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Radiographic evidence supports normal range of motion. The procedure is safe and the patients recover quickly. Restrictive postoperative management is not necessary. However, only after long-term follow-up of at least 5 years will it become clear whether the device remains functional, thus confirming these early favorable results. In addition, the influence on adjacent motion segments can be assessed after at least 5 years of follow-up.},

This scoring system consists of seven categories: motor function of fingers, shoulder and elbow, and lower extremity; sensory function of upper extremity, trunk and lower extremity; and function of the bladder. It evaluates the severity of myelopathy by allocating points based on degree of dysfunction in each category.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of the revised scoring system (17 - 2 points) for cervical compression myelopathy proposed by the Japanese Orthopedic Association.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several scales to assess clinical outcome from treatment of cervical compression myelopathy have been proposed. Most of these scales include items evaluated by observers. However, no system, including the Japanese Orthopedic Association scoring system, has yet been validated in terms of interobserver reliability.
METHODS: From five different university hospitals, 10 spine surgery specialists, 10 orthopedic surgeons who had just passed the board examination of the Japanese Orthopedic Association, and 13 residents in the first or second year of orthopedic residency programs were chosen. The participants in this study were 29 patients with myelopathy secondary to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament selected from five participating university hospitals. Several surgeons interviewed each patient twice at intervals of 1 to 6 weeks. Inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of the total score for all categories were evaluated by the intraclass correlation coefficient. The extension of the kappa coefficient of Kraemer also was calculated for each category to assess reliability of multivariate categorical data.
RESULTS: The interobserver reliability of the total score for the first interview (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.813) and the intra- and interobserver reliabilities of the total score (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.826) were high. The level of experience and the hospital slightly affected the reliability of the Japanese Orthopedic Association scoring system. The kappa values for intraobserver data generally were high in each category, whereas the kappa values for interobserver data were relatively low for the categories of shoulder-elbow motor function and lower extremity sensory function.
CONCLUSIONS: The inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of the Japanese Orthopedic Association scoring system for cervical myelopathy were high, suggesting that this system is useful for assessment of cervical myelopathy in comparative studies of treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The technique of cervical laminoplasty was developed to decompress the spinal canal in patients with multi-level anterior compression caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament or cervical spondylosis. There is a paucity of data confirming its superiority to laminectomy with regard to neurological outcome, preserving spinal stability, preventing postlaminectomy kyphosis, and the development of the "postlaminectomy membrane."
METHODS: The authors conducted a metaanalysis of the English-language laminoplasty literature, assessing neurological outcome, change in range of motion (ROM), development of spinal deformity, and complications. Seventy-one series were reviewed, comprising more than 2000 patients. All studies were retrospective, uncontrolled, nonrandomized case series. Forty-one series provided postoperative recovery rate data in which the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Scale was used for assessing myelopathy. The mean recovery rate was 55% (range 20-80%). The authors of 23 papers provided data on the percentage of patients improving (mean approximately 80%). There was no difference in neurological outcome based on the different laminoplasty techniques or when laminoplasty was compared with laminectomy. There was postlaminoplasty worsening of cervical alignment in approximately 35% and with development of postoperative kyphosis in approximately 10% of patients who underwent long-term follow-up review. Cervical ROM decreased substantially after laminoplasty (mean decrease 50%, range 17-80%). The authors of studies with long-term follow up found that there was progressive loss of cervical ROM, and final ROM similar to that seen in patients who had undergone laminectomy and fusion. In their review of the laminectomy literature the authors could not confirm the occurrence of postlaminectomy membrane causing clinically significant deterioration of neurological function. Postoperative complications differed substantially among series. In only seven articles did the writers quantify the rates of postoperative axial neck pain, noting an incidence between 6 and 60%. In approximately 8% of patients, C-5 nerve root dysfunction developed based on the 12 articles in which this complication was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The literature has yet to support the purported benefits of laminoplasty. Neurological outcome and change in spinal alignment are similar after laminectomy and laminoplasty. Patients treated with laminoplasty develop progressive limitation of cervical ROM similar to that seen after laminectomy and fusion.},

OBJECTIVE: To know whether the short-term results from double-door laminoplasty were maintained over a 10-year period and, if not, the cause of late deterioration.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are few long-term follow-up studies on the outcome of laminoplasty for cervical stenotic myelopathy.
METHODS: In this study, 35 patients with cervical myelopathy caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical spine and 25 patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, including 5 patients with athetoid cerebral palsy, underwent double-door laminoplasty from 1980 through 1988 and were followed over the next 10 years. The average follow-up period was 153 months (range, 120-200 months) in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and 156 months (range, 121-218 months) in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Neurologic deficits before and after surgery were assessed using a scoring system proposed by the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA score). Patients who showed late deterioration received further examination including computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine.
RESULTS: In 32 of the patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and 23 of the patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, myelopathy improved after surgery. The improvement of Japanese Orthopedic Association scores was maintained up to the final follow-up assessment in 26 of the patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and 21 of the patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Late neurologic deterioration occurred in 10 of the patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament an average of 8 years after surgery, and in 4 of the patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, including the 3 patients with athetoid cerebral palsy, an average of 11 years after surgery. The main causes of deterioration in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament were a minor trauma in patients with residual cervical cord compression caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and thoracic myelopathy resulting from ossification of the yellow ligament in the thoracic spine.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term results of laminoplasty for cervical stenotic myelopathy were maintained over 10years in 78% of the patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and in most of the patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, except those with athetoid cerebral palsy. Double-door laminoplasty is a reliable procedure for individuals with cervical stenotic myelopathy.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes of subtotal corpectomy and laminoplasty for multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No study has compared the long-term outcomes between subtotal corpectomy and laminoplasty for multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
METHODS: In this study, 23 patients treated with subtotal corpectomy and 24 patients treated with laminoplasty were followed up for 10 to 14 years after surgery. Neurologic recovery, late deterioration, axial pain, radiographic results (degenerative changes at adjacent levels, alignment, and range of motion of the cervical spine), and surgical complications were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: No significant difference in neurologic recovery was found between the two groups 1 and 5 years after surgery, or at the latest follow-up assessment. Neurologic status deteriorated in one patient of the subtotal corpectomy group because of adjacent degeneration, and in one patient of the laminoplasty group because of hyperextension injury. Axial pain was observed in 15% of the corpectomy group and in 40% of the laminoplasty group (P < 0.05). In the corpectomy group, listhesis exceeding 2 mm developed at 38% of the upper adjacent levels, and osteophyte formation at 54% of the lower adjacent levels. In the laminoplasty group, kyphotic deformity developed in one patient (6%) after surgery. In the corpectomy group, the mean vertebral range of motion had decreased from 39.4 degrees to 19.2 degrees (49%) by the final follow-up assessment. In the laminoplasty group, the mean vertebral range of motion had decreased from 40.2 degrees to 11.6 degrees (29%) by the final follow-up assessment. Neurologic complications related to the surgery occurred in two patients (one myelopathy from bone graft dislodgement and one C5 root palsy from bone graft fracture) of the corpectomy group and four patients (C5 root palsy) of the laminoplasty group. All of these patients recovered over time. The corpectomy group needed longer operative time (P < 0.001) and tended to have more blood loss (P = 0.24). Six patients in the corpectomy group needed posterior interspinous wiring because of pseudarthrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Subtotal corpectomy and laminoplasty showed an identical effect from a surgical treatment for multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy. These neurologic recoveries usually last more than 10 years. In the subtotal corpectomy group, the disadvantages were longer surgical time, more blood loss, and pseudarthrosis. In the laminoplasty group, axial pain occurred frequently, and the range of motion was reduced severely.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, concurrently enrolled, multicenter trials of the Bryan Cervical Disc Prosthesis (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, TN) were conducted for the treatment of patients with single-level and two-level (bi-level) degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine.
OBJECTIVES: The studies were designed to determine whether new functional intervertebral cervical disc prosthesis can provide relief from objective neurologic symptoms and signs, improve the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living, decrease pain, and maintain stability and segmental motion.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The concept of accelerated degeneration of adjacent disc levels as a consequence of increased stress caused by interbody fusion of the cervical spine has been widely postulated. Therefore, reconstruction of a failed intervertebral disc with functional disc prosthesis should offer the same benefits as fusion while simultaneously providing motion and thereby protecting the adjacent level discs from the abnormal stresses associated with fusion.
METHODS: Patients with symptomatic cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy underwent implantation with the Bryan prosthesis after a standard anterior cervical discectomy. At scheduled follow-up periods, the effectiveness of the device was characterized by evaluating each patient's pain, neurologic function, and radiographically measured range of motion at the implanted level.
RESULTS: Clinical success for both studies exceeded the study acceptance criteria of 85%. At 1-year follow-up, the flexion-extension range of motion per level: Discectomy and implantation of the device alleviates neurologic symptoms and signs similar to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Radiographic evidence supports maintenance of motion. The procedure is safe and the patients recover quickly. At least 5 years of follow-up will be needed to assess the long-term functionality of the prosthesis and protective influence on adjacent levels.},

Forty patients underwent a laminectomy plus dentate ligament section (DLS), 18 underwent laminectomy alone, and 17 underwent an anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF). The patients were evaluated postoperatively for both stability and for neurologic outcome using a modification of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Assessment Scale. Functional improvement occurred in all but one patient in the laminectomy plus DLS group. The average improvement was 3.1 +/- 1.5 points in this group; whereas the average improvement in the laminectomy and the ACDF groups was 2.7 +/- 2.0 and 3.0 +/- 2.0 points respectively. All of the patients who improved substantially (greater than or equal to 6 points) in the laminectomy plus DLS and the laminectomy alone groups had normal cervical spine contours (lordosis). The remainder had either a normal lordosis or no curve (no kyphosis or lordosis). All patients in the ACDF group had either a straight spine or a cervical kyphosis. These factors implicate spine curvature, in addition to choice of operation, as factors which are important in outcome determination. No problems with instability occurred in either the laminectomy or the laminectomy plus DLS group. Two patients incurred problems with stability in the ACDF group. Both required reoperation. In addition, four patients in this group who initially improved, subsequently deteriorated. Six patients in the laminectomy plus DLS group had a several day febrile episode related to an aseptic meningitis process. Laminectomy plus DLS is a safe and efficacious alternative to laminectomy for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The data presented here suggests that myelopathic patients with a cervical kyphosis are best treated with an ACDF and that patients with a normal cervical lordosis are best treated with a posterior approach. Although some selected patients may benefit from DLS, no criteria are available which differentiate this small subset of patients.},

OBJECTIVES: To reveal the difference in prevalence of postoperative axial symptoms between anterior interbody fusion and laminoplasty and to clarify the pathogenesis of axial symptoms after laminoplasty.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Outcome of the cervical surgery is evaluated on neurologic status alone; axial symptoms after laminoplasty rarely have been investigated. Such symptoms, however, are often severe enough to interfere with a person's daily activity.
METHODS: Ninety-eight patients had surgery for their disability secondary to cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Of those patients, 72 had laminoplasty, and 26 had anterior interbody fusion. The presence or absence of axial symptoms was investigated before and after surgery. The duration, severity, and laterality of symptoms were also recorded.
RESULTS: The prevalence of postoperative axial symptoms was significantly higher after laminoplasty than after anterior fusion (60% vs. 19%; P < 0.05). In 18 patients (25%) from the laminoplasty group, the chief complaints after surgery were related to axial symptoms for more than 3 months, whereas in the anterior fusion group, no patient reported having such severe pain after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and severity of axial symptoms after laminoplasty proved to be higher and more serious than has been believed. Such symptoms should be considered in the evaluation of the outcome of cervical spinal surgery.},

It focuses on the combination of simple digital photographic cameras with spectral filters, designed to provide multispectral images in the visible and near-infrared domains. In 2005, these instruments were fitted to powered glider and parachute, and flown at six dates staggered over the crop season. We monitored ten varieties of wheat, grown in trial micro-plots in the South-West of France. For each date, we acquired multiple views in four spectral bands corresponding to blue, green, red, and near-infrared. We then performed accurate corrections of image vignetting, geometric distortions, and radiometric bidirectional effects. Afterwards, we derived for each experimental micro-plot several vegetation indexes relevant for vegetation analyses. Finally, we sought relationships between these indexes and field-measured biophysical parameters, both generic and date-specific. Therefore, we established a robust and stable generic relationship between, in one hand, leaf area index and NDVI and, in the other hand, nitrogen uptake and GNDVI. Due to a high amount of noise in the data, it was not possible to obtain a more accurate model for each date independently. A validation protocol showed that we could expect a precision level of 15% in the biophysical parameters estimation while using these relationships.},

  abstract = {In September 2002, NASA’s solar-powered Pathfinder-Plus unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to conduct a proof-of-concept mission in US national airspace above the 1500ha plantation of the Kauai Coffee Company in Hawaii. While in national airspace, the transponder-equipped UAV was supervised by regional air traffic controllers and treated like a conventionally piloted aircraft. High resolution color and multispectral imaging payloads, both drawing from the aircraft’s solar power system, were housed in exterior-mounted environmental pressure pods. A local area network (LAN) using unlicensed radio frequency was used for camera control and downlink of image data at rates exceeding 5Mbits−1. A wide area network (WAN) allowed a project investigator stationed on the US mainland to uplink control commands during part of the mission. Images were available for enhancing, printing, and interpretation within minutes of collection. The color images were useful for mapping invasive weed outbreaks and for revealing irrigation and fertilization anomalies. Multispectral imagery was related to mature fruit harvest from certain fields with significant fruit display on the tree canopy exterior. During 4h “loitering” above the plantation, ground-based pilots were able to precisely navigate the UAV along pre-planned flightlines, and also perform spontaneous maneuvers under the direction of the project scientist for image collection in cloud-free zones. Despite the presence of ground-obscuring cumulus cloud cover of ca. 70% during the image collection period, the UAV’s maneuvering capability ultimately enabled collection of cloud-free imagery throughout most of the plantation. The mission demonstrated the capability of a slow-flying UAV, equipped with downsized imaging systems and line-of-sight telemetry, to monitor a localized agricultural region for an extended time period. The authors suggest that evolving long-duration (weeks to months) UAVs stand to make a valuable future contribution to regional agricultural resource monitoring.},

  abstract = {Two critical limitations for using current satellite sensors in real-time crop management are the lack of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolutions and an unfavorable revisit time for most crop stress-detection applications. Alternatives based on manned airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fill this gap, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the platform was flown over agricultural fields, obtaining thermal imagery in the 7.5–13-$\mu\hbox{m}$ region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the 400–800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reflectance and temperature imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), coupled with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index, chlorophyll content $(C_{\rm ab})$, and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional manned airborne sensors.},

In this paper, we describe the development and application of an autonomous UAV for precise aerobiological sampling tens to hundreds of meters above agricultural fields. We equipped a Senior Telemaster UAV with four aerobiological sampling devices and a MicroPilot‐based autonomous system, and we conducted 25 sampling flights for potential agricultural threat agents at Virginia Tech's Kentland Farm. To determine the most appropriate sampling path for aerobiological sampling above crop fields with an autonomous UAV, we explored five different sampling patterns, including multiple global positioning system (GPS) waypoints plotted over a variety of spatial scales. An orbital sampling pattern around a single GPS waypoint exhibited high positional accuracy and produced altitude standard deviations ranging from 1.6 to 2.8 m. Autonomous UAVs have the potential to extend the range of aerobiological sampling, improve positional accuracy of sampling paths, and enable coordinated flight with multiple UAVs sampling at different altitudes. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We show that the combination of stereo and optic-flow (stereo-flow) is more effective at navigating urban canyons than either technique alone. Optic flow from a pair of sideways-looking cameras is used to stay centered in a canyon and initiate turns at junctions, while stereo vision from a forward-facing stereo head is used to avoid obstacles to the front. The technique was tested in full on an autonomous tractor at CSIRO and in part on the USC autonomous helicopter. Experimental results are presented from these two robotic platforms operating in outdoor environments. We show that the autonomous tractor can navigate urban canyons using stereo-flow, and that the autonomous helicopter can turn away from obstacles to the side using optic flow. In addition, preliminary results show that a single pair of forward-facing fisheye cameras can be used for both stereo and optic flow. The center portions of the fisheye images are used for stereo, while flow is measured in the periphery of the images.},

  abstract = {Abstract  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an important tool to track the long‐distance movement of plant pathogens above crop fields. Here, we describe the use of a control strategy (coordination via speed modulation) to synchronize two autonomous UAVs during aerobiological sampling of the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans . The UAVs shared position coordinates via a wireless mesh network and modulated their speeds so that they were properly phased within their sampling orbits. Three coordinated control experiments were performed August 14–15, 2008. In the first two experiments, two UAVs were vertically aligned at two different altitudes [25 and 45 m above ground level (AGL)] with identical sampling orbits (radii of 150 m). In the third experiment, two UAVs shared the same altitude (35 m AGL) with different sampling orbits (radii of 130 and 160 m). Orbit times did not vary significantly between the two UAVs across all three aerobiological sampling missions, and the phase error during sampling converged to zero within 2 min following the start of the coordinated control algorithm. Viable sporangia of P. infestans were recovered following two of the coordinated flights. This is the first detailed report of autonomous UAV coordination during the aerobiological sampling of a plant pathogen in the lower atmosphere. UAVs operating independently of one another may experience significant sampling variations during the course of a flight. Coordinating the flight of two or more UAVs ensures that the vehicles enter, sample, and exit a spore plume at consistent times. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have attracted a lot of attention, since they represent a new potential market. Along with the maturity of the technology and relevant regulations, a worldwide deployment of these UAVs is expected. Thanks to the high mobility of drones, they can be used to provide a lot of applications, such as service delivery, pollution mitigation, farming, and in the rescue operations. Due to its ubiquitous usability, the UAV will play an important role in the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, and it may become the main key enabler of this vision. While these UAVs would be deployed for specific objectives (e.g., service delivery), they can be, at the same time, used to offer new IoT value-added services when they are equipped with suitable and remotely controllable machine type communications (MTCs) devices (i.e., sensors, cameras, and actuators). However, deploying UAVs for the envisioned purposes cannot be done before overcoming the relevant challenging issues. These challenges comprise not only technical issues, such as physical collision, but also regulation issues as this nascent technology could be associated with problems like breaking the privacy of people or even use it for illegal operations like drug smuggling. Providing the communication to UAVs is another challenging issue facing the deployment of this technology. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on the UAVs and the related issues will be introduced. In addition, our envisioned UAV-based architecture for the delivery of UAV-based value-added IoT services from the sky will be introduced, and the relevant key challenges and requirements will be presented.},

  abstract = {Precision agriculture (PA) is the application of geospatial techniques and sensors (e.g., geographic information systems, remote sensing, GPS) to identify variations in the field and to deal with them using alternative strategies. In particular, high-resolution satellite imagery is now more commonly used to study these variations for crop and soil conditions. However, the availability and the often prohibitive costs of such imagery would suggest an alternative product for this particular application in PA. Specifically, images taken by low altitude remote sensing platforms, or small unmanned aerial systems (UAS), are shown to be a potential alternative given their low cost of operation in environmental monitoring, high spatial and temporal resolution, and their high flexibility in image acquisition programming. Not surprisingly, there have been several recent studies in the application of UAS imagery for PA. The results of these studies would indicate that, to provide a reliable end product to farmers, advances in platform design, production, standardization of image georeferencing and mosaicing, and information extraction workflow are required. Moreover, it is suggested that such endeavors should involve the farmer, particularly in the process of field design, image acquisition, image interpretation and analysis.},

  volume   = {108},
  abstract = {This paper describes a novel method to derive 3D hyperspectral information from lightweight snapshot cameras for unmanned aerial vehicles for vegetation monitoring. Snapshot cameras record an image cube with one spectral and two spatial dimensions with every exposure. First, we describe and apply methods to radiometrically characterize and calibrate these cameras. Then, we introduce our processing chain to derive 3D hyperspectral information from the calibrated image cubes based on structure from motion. The approach includes a novel way for quality assurance of the data which is used to assess the quality of the hyperspectral data for every single pixel in the final data product. The result is a hyperspectral digital surface model as a representation of the surface in 3D space linked with the hyperspectral information emitted and reflected by the objects covered by the surface. In this study we use the hyperspectral camera Cubert UHD 185-Firefly, which collects 125 bands from 450 to 950nm. The obtained data product has a spatial resolution of approximately 1cm for the spatial and 21cm for the hyperspectral information. The radiometric calibration yields good results with less than 1% offset in reflectance compared to an ASD FieldSpec 3 for most of the spectral range. The quality assurance information shows that the radiometric precision is better than 0.13% for the derived data product. We apply the approach to data from a flight campaign in a barley experiment with different varieties during the growth stage heading (BBCH 52 – 59) to demonstrate the feasibility for vegetation monitoring in the context of precision agriculture. The plant parameters retrieved from the data product correspond to in-field measurements of a single date field campaign for plant height (R2=0.7), chlorophyll (BGI2, R2=0.52), LAI (RDVI, R2=0.32) and biomass (RDVI, R2=0.29). Our approach can also be applied for other image-frame cameras as long as the individual bands of the image cube are spatially co-registered beforehand.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an exciting opportunity to monitor crop fields with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing capable of improving water stress management in agriculture. In this study, we reviewed the application of different types of UAVs using different remote sensors and compared their performance with ground-truth plant data. Several reflectance indices, such as NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI and PRInorm obtained from UAVs have shown positive correlations related to water stress indicators such as water potential (Ψ) and stomatal conductance (gs). Nevertheless, they have performed differently in diverse crops; thus, their uses and applications are also discussed in this study. Thermal imagery is also a common remote sensing technology used to assess water stress in plants, via thermal indices (calculated using artificial surfaces as references), estimates of the difference between canopy and air temperature, and even canopy conductance estimates derived from leaf energy balance models. These indices have shown a great potential to determine field stress heterogeneity using unmanned aerial platforms. It has also been proposed that chlorophyll fluorescence could be an even better indicator of plant photosynthesis and water use efficiency under water stress. Therefore, developing systems and methodologies to easily retrieve fluorescence from UAVs should be a priority for the near future. After a decade of work with UAVs, recently emerging technologies have developed more user-friendly aerial platforms, such as the multi-copters, which offer industry, science, and society new opportunities. Their use as high-throughput phenotyping platforms for real field conditions and also for water stress management increasing temporal and resolution scales could improve our capacity to determine important crop traits such as yield or stress tolerance for breeding purposes.},

In order to optimize the use of these technologies for precision viticulture, their technical, scientific and economic performances need to be assessed. The aim of this work is to compare NDVI surveys performed with UAV, aircraft and satellite, to assess the capability of each platform to represent the intra-vineyard vegetation spatial variability. NDVI images of two Italian vineyards were acquired simultaneously from different multi-spectral sensors onboard the three platforms, and a spatial statistical framework was used to assess their degree of similarity. Moreover, the pros and cons of each technique were also assessed performing a cost analysis as a function of the scale of application. Results indicate that the different platforms provide comparable results in vineyards characterized by coarse vegetation gradients and large vegetation clusters. On the contrary, in more heterogeneous vineyards, low-resolution images fail in representing part of the intra-vineyard variability. The cost analysis showed that the adoption of UAV platform is advantageous for small areas and that a break-even point exists above five hectares; above such threshold, airborne and then satellite have lower imagery cost.},

The multispectral data were processed with a photogrammetric pipeline to create triband orthoimages of the surveyed sites.

This new technology is highly relevant, because it opens up new possibilities for measuring and monitoring the environment, which is becoming increasingly important for many environmental challenges. Our objectives were to investigate the processing and use of this new type of image data in precision agriculture. We developed the entire processing chain from raw images up to georeferenced reflectance images, digital surface models and biomass estimates. The processing integrates photogrammetric and quantitative remote sensing approaches. We carried out an empirical assessment using FPI spectral imagery collected at an agricultural wheat test site in the summer of 2012. Poor weather conditions during the campaign complicated the data processing, but this is one of the challenges that are faced in operational applications. The results indicated that the camera performed consistently and that the data processing was consistent, as well. During the agricultural experiments, promising results were obtained for biomass estimation when the spectral data was used and when an appropriate radiometric correction was applied to the data. Our results showed that the new FPI technology has a great potential in precision agriculture and indicated many possible future research topics.},

  abstract = {Traditional imagery—provided, for example, by RGB and/or NIR sensors—has proven to be useful in many agroforestry applications. However, it lacks the spectral range and precision to profile materials and organisms that only hyperspectral sensors can provide. This kind of high-resolution spectroscopy was firstly used in satellites and later in manned aircraft, which are significantly expensive platforms and extremely restrictive due to availability limitations and/or complex logistics. More recently, UAS have emerged as a very popular and cost-effective remote sensing technology, composed of aerial platforms capable of carrying small-sized and lightweight sensors. Meanwhile, hyperspectral technology developments have been consistently resulting in smaller and lighter sensors that can currently be integrated in UAS for either scientific or commercial purposes. The hyperspectral sensors’ ability for measuring hundreds of bands raises complexity when considering the sheer quantity of acquired data, whose usefulness depends on both calibration and corrective tasks occurring in pre- and post-flight stages. Further steps regarding hyperspectral data processing must be performed towards the retrieval of relevant information, which provides the true benefits for assertive interventions in agricultural crops and forested areas. Considering the aforementioned topics and the goal of providing a global view focused on hyperspectral-based remote sensing supported by UAV platforms, a survey including hyperspectral sensors, inherent data processing and applications focusing both on agriculture and forestry—wherein the combination of UAV and hyperspectral sensors plays a center role—is presented in this paper. Firstly, the advantages of hyperspectral data over RGB imagery and multispectral data are highlighted. Then, hyperspectral acquisition devices are addressed, including sensor types, acquisition modes and UAV-compatible sensors that can be used for both research and commercial purposes. Pre-flight operations and post-flight pre-processing are pointed out as necessary to ensure the usefulness of hyperspectral data for further processing towards the retrieval of conclusive information. With the goal of simplifying hyperspectral data processing—by isolating the common user from the processes’ mathematical complexity—several available toolboxes that allow a direct access to level-one hyperspectral data are presented. Moreover, research works focusing the symbiosis between UAV-hyperspectral for agriculture and forestry applications are reviewed, just before the paper’s conclusions.},

  abstract = {This study provides insight into the assessment of canopy biophysical parameter retrieval using passive sensors and specifically into the quantification of tree height in a discontinuous canopy using a low-cost camera on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV was a 2-m wingspan fixed-wing platform with 5.8kg take-off weight and 63km/h ground speed. It carried a consumer-grade RGB camera modified for color-infrared detection (CIR) and synchronized with a GPS unit. In this study, the configuration of the electric UAV carrying the camera payload enabled the acquisition of 158ha in one single flight. The camera system made it possible to acquire very high resolution (VHR) imagery (5cmpixel−1) to generate ortho-mosaics and digital surface models (DSMs) through automatic 3D reconstruction methods. The UAV followed pre-designed flight plans over each study site to ensure the acquisition of the imagery with large across- and along-track overlaps (i.e. >80%) using a grid of parallel and perpendicular flight lines. The validation method consisted of taking field measurements of the height of a total of 152 trees in two different study areas using a GPS in real-time kinematic (RTK) mode. The results of the validation assessment conducted to estimate tree height from the VHR DSMs yielded R2=0.83, an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 35cm, and a relative root mean square error (R-RMSE) of 11.5% for trees with heights ranging between 1.16 and 4.38m. An assessment conducted on the effects of the spatial resolution of the input images acquired by the UAV on the photo-reconstruction method and DSM generation demonstrated stable relationships for pixel resolutions between 5 and 30cm that rapidly degraded for input images with pixel resolutions lower than 35cm. RMSE and R-RMSE values obtained as a function of input pixel resolution showed errors in tree quantification below 15% when 30cmpixel−1 resolution imagery was used to generate the DSMs. The study conducted in two orchards with this UAV system and the photo-reconstruction method highlighted that an inexpensive approach based on consumer-grade cameras on board a hand-launched unmanned aerial platform can provide accuracies comparable to those of the expensive and computationally more complex light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems currently operated for agricultural and environmental applications.},

  abstract = {Crop monitoring is important in precision agriculture. Estimating above-ground biomass helps to monitor crop vitality and to predict yield. In this study, we estimated fresh and dry biomass on a summer barley test site with 18 cultivars and two nitrogen (N)-treatments using the plant height (PH) from crop surface models (CSMs). The super-high resolution, multi-temporal (1 cm/pixel) CSMs were derived from red, green, blue (RGB) images captured from a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Comparison with PH reference measurements yielded an R2 of 0.92. The test site with different cultivars and treatments was monitored during “Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie” (BBCH) Stages 24–89. A high correlation was found between PH from CSMs and fresh biomass (R2 = 0.81) and dry biomass (R2 = 0.82). Five models for above-ground fresh and dry biomass estimation were tested by cross-validation. Modelling biomass between different N-treatments for fresh biomass produced the best results (R2 = 0.71). The main limitation was the influence of lodging cultivars in the later growth stages, producing irregular plant heights. The method has potential for future application by non-professionals, i.e., farmers.},

  abstract = {Object-based image classification for land-cover mapping purposes using remote-sensing imagery has attracted significant attention in recent years. Numerous studies conducted over the past decade have investigated a broad array of sensors, feature selection, classifiers, and other factors of interest. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of different supervised object-based land-cover classification processes. In this study, we first construct a database with 28 fields using qualitative and quantitative information extracted from 254 experimental cases described in 173 scientific papers. Second, the results of the meta-analysis are reported, including general characteristics of the studies (e.g., the geographic range of relevant institutes, preferred journals) and the relationships between factors of interest (e.g., spatial resolution and study area or optimal segmentation scale, accuracy and number of targeted classes), especially with respect to the classification accuracy of different sensors, segmentation scale, training set size, supervised classifiers, and land-cover types. Third, useful data on supervised object-based image classification are determined from the meta-analysis. For example, we find that supervised object-based classification is currently experiencing rapid advances, while development of the fuzzy technique is limited in the object-based framework. Furthermore, spatial resolution correlates with the optimal segmentation scale and study area, and Random Forest (RF) shows the best performance in object-based classification. The area-based accuracy assessment method can obtain stable classification performance, and indicates a strong correlation between accuracy and training set size, while the accuracy of the point-based method is likely to be unstable due to mixed objects. In addition, the overall accuracy benefits from higher spatial resolution images (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or agricultural sites where it also correlates with the number of targeted classes. More than 95.6% of studies involve an area less than 300ha, and the spatial resolution of images is predominantly between 0 and 2m. Furthermore, we identify some methods that may advance supervised object-based image classification. For example, deep learning and type-2 fuzzy techniques may further improve classification accuracy. Lastly, scientists are strongly encouraged to report results of uncertainty studies to further explore the effects of varied factors on supervised object-based image classification.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of implant placement when using robotic assistance during total hip arthroplasty (THA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients underwent a planned THA using preoperative CT scans and robotic-assisted software. There were nine men and 11 women (n = 20 hips) with a mean age of 60.8 years (sd 6.0). Pelvic and femoral bone models were constructed by segmenting both preoperative and postoperative CT scan images. The preoperative anatomical landmarks using the robotic-assisted system were matched to the postoperative 3D reconstructions of the pelvis. Acetabular and femoral component positions as measured intraoperatively and postoperatively were evaluated and compared.
RESULTS: The system reported accurate values for reconstruction of the hip when compared to those measured postoperatively using CT. The mean deviation from the executed overall hip length and offset were 1.6 mm (sd 2.9) and 0.5 mm (sd 3.0), respectively. Mean combined anteversion was similar and correlated between intraoperative measurements and postoperative CT measurements (32.5°, sd 5.9° versus 32.2°, sd 6.4°; respectively; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65; p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant correlation between mean intraoperative (40.4°, sd 2.1°) acetabular component inclination and mean measured postoperative inclination (40.12°, sd 3.0°, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.62; p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant correlation between mean intraoperative version (23.2°, sd 2.3°), and postoperatively measured version (23.0°, sd 2.4°; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76; p &lt; 0.001). Preoperative and postoperative femoral component anteversion were significantly correlated with one another (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64; p &lt; 0.001). Three patients had CT scan measurements that differed substantially from the intraoperative robotic measurements when evaluating stem anteversion.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate the success of hip reconstruction overall using robotic-assisted THA. The overall hip reconstruction obtained in the operating theatre using robotic assistance accurately correlated with the postoperative component position assessed independently using CT based 3D modelling. Clinical correlation during surgery should continue to be practiced and compared with observed intraoperative robotic values. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:1303-9.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acetabulum positioning affects dislocation rates, component impingement, bearing surface wear rates, and need for revision surgery. Novel techniques purport to improve the accuracy and precision of acetabular component position, but may have a significant learning curve. Our aim was to assess whether adopting robotic or fluoroscopic techniques improve acetabulum positioning compared to manual total hip arthroplasty (THA) during the learning curve.
METHODS: Three types of THAs were compared in this retrospective cohort: (1) the first 100 fluoroscopically guided direct anterior THAs (fluoroscopic anterior [FA]) done by a surgeon learning the anterior approach, (2) the first 100 robotic-assisted posterior THAs done by a surgeon learning robotic-assisted surgery (robotic posterior [RP]), and (3) the last 100 manual posterior (MP) THAs done by each surgeon (200 THAs) before adoption of novel techniques. Component position was measured on plain radiographs. Radiographic measurements were taken by 2 blinded observers. The percentage of hips within the surgeons' "target zone" (inclination, 30°-50°; anteversion, 10°-30°) was calculated, along with the percentage within the "safe zone" of Lewinnek (inclination, 30°-50°; anteversion, 5°-25°) and Callanan (inclination, 30°-45°; anteversion, 5°-25°). Relative risk (RR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) were calculated. Variances (square of the standard deviations) were used to describe the variability of cup position.
RESULTS: Seventy-six percentage of MP THAs were within the surgeons' target zone compared with 84% of FA THAs and 97% of RP THAs. This difference was statistically significant, associated with a RR reduction of 87% (RR, 0.13 [0.04-0.40]; P < .01; ARR, 21%; number needed to treat, 5) for RP compared to MP THAs. Compared to FA THAs, RP THAs were associated with a RR reduction of 81% (RR, 0.19 [0.06-0.62]; P < .01; ARR, 13%; number needed to treat, 8). Variances were lower for acetabulum inclination and anteversion in RP THAs (14.0 and 19.5) as compared to the MP (37.5 and 56.3) and FA (24.5 and 54.6) groups. These differences were statistically significant (P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Adoption of robotic techniques delivers significant and immediate improvement in the precision of acetabular component positioning during the learning curve. While fluoroscopy has been shown to be beneficial with experience, a learning curve exists before precision improves significantly.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have showed improved accuracy of lower leg alignment, precise component position, and soft-tissue balance with robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). No studies, however, have assessed the effect on midterm survivorship. Therefore, the purpose of this prospective, multicenter study was to determine midtem survivorship, modes of failure, and satisfaction of robotic-assisted medial UKA.
METHODS: A total of 473 consecutive patients (528 knees) underwent robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA surgery at 4 separate institutions between March 2009 and December 2011. All patients received a fixed-bearing, metal-backed onlay tibial component. Each patient was contacted at minimum 5-year follow-up and asked a series of questions to determine survival and satisfaction. Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine survivorship.
RESULTS: Data were collected for 384 patients (432 knees) with a mean follow-up of 5.7 years (5.0-7.7). The follow-up rate was 81.2%. In total, 13 revisions were performed, of which 11 knees were converted to total knee arthroplasty and in 2 cases 1 UKA component was revised, resulting in 97% survivorship. The mean time to revision was 2.27 years. The most common failure mode was aseptic loosening (7/13). Fourteen reoperations were reported. Of all unrevised patients, 91% was either very satisfied or satisfied with their knee function.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA showed high survivorship and satisfaction at midterm follow-up in this prospective, multicenter study. However, in spite of the robotic technique, early fixation failure remains the primary cause for revision with cemented implants. Comparative studies are necessary to confirm these findings and compare to conventional implanted UKA and total knee arthroplasty.},

Average operative time differed significantly with, and average of 20 minutes greater in, the robotic-assisted UKA group (P=0.010).

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Although obesity has historically been described as a contraindication to UKA, improved outcomes with modern UKA implant designs have challenged this perception. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of obesity on the outcomes of UKA with a robotic-assisted system at a minimum follow-up of 24 months with the hypothesis that obesity has no effect on robotic-assisted UKA outcomes.
METHODS: There were 746 medial robotic-assisted UKAs (672 patients) with a mean age of 64 years (SD 11) and a mean follow-up time of 34.6 months (SD 7.8). Mean overall body mass index (BMI) was 32.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 6.5), and patients were stratified into seven weight categories according to the World Health Organization classification.
RESULTS: Patient BMI did not influence the rate of revision surgery to TKA (5.8 %) or conversion from InLay to OnLay design (1.7 %, n.s.). Mean postoperative Oxford knee score was 37 (SD 11) without correlation with BMI (n.s.). The type of prosthesis (InLay/OnLay) regardless of BMI had no influence on revision rate (n.s.). BMI did not influence 90-day readmissions (4.4 %, n.s.), but showed significant correlation with higher opioid medication requirements and a higher number of physical therapy session needed to reach discharge goals (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BMI does not influence clinical outcomes and readmission rates of robotic-assisted UKA at mid-term. The classic contraindication of BMI &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> may not be justified with the use of modern UKA designs or techniques.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Component malposition in total hip arthroplasty (THA) contributes to instability and early failure. Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) utilizes CT-based planning with haptically-guided bone preparation and implant insertion to optimize component position accuracy. This study compared acetabular component position and postoperative complications following manual THA (mTHA) with rTHA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive primary THAs performed by one surgeon at three intervals were analyzed in this retrospective cohort study: the initial 100 consecutive manual THAs (mTHA) in clinical practice (year 2000), the last consecutive 100 mTHA before rTHA introduction (year 2011), and the first consecutive 100 rTHA (year 2012). Acetabular abduction (AAB) and anteversion (AAV) angles were measured using validated software. The Lewinnek safe zone was used to define accuracy (AAB 40°±10° and AAV 15°±10°). Comparisons included operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), infection rate, and dislocation rate.
RESULTS: The rate of acetabular component placement within Lewinnek safe zone was the highest in the rTHA cohort (77%), followed by late mTHA (45%) and early mTHA (30%) (p<0.001). Robotic-assisted THA resulted in an additional 71% improvement in accuracy in the first year of use (p<0.001). Dislocation rate was 5% with early mTHA, 3% in the late mTHA cohort, and 0% in the rTHA cohort within the first two years postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of infection between groups.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted THA improved acetabular component accuracy and reduced dislocation rates when compared with mTHA. Further study is needed to determine if similar improvements will be noted in larger multicenter studies using alternative surgical approaches.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study compared clinical and radiological results between robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and conventional TKA with a cruciate-retaining implant at 10-year follow-up. The hypothesis was that robotic TKA would allow for more accurate leg alignment and component placement, and thus enhance clinical and radiological results and long-term survival rates.
METHODS: A total of 113 primary TKAs performed using a cruciate-retaining implant in 102 patients from 2004 to 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 113 TKAs, 71 were robotic TKAs and 42 were conventional TKAs. Clinical outcomes (visual analogue scale pain score, Hospital for Special Surgery score, Western Ontario and McMaster University score, range of motion, and complications), radiological outcomes, and long-term survival rates were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 10 years.
RESULTS: Clinical outcomes and long-term survival rates were similar between the two groups. Regarding the radiological outcomes, the robotic TKA group had significantly fewer postoperative leg alignment outliers (femoral coronal inclination, tibial coronal inclination, femoral sagittal inclination, tibial sagittal inclination, and mechanical axis) and fewer radiolucent lines than the conventional TKA group.
CONCLUSIONS: Both robotic and conventional TKAs resulted in good clinical outcomes and postoperative leg alignments. Robotic TKA appeared to reduce the incidence of leg alignment outliers and radiolucent lines compared to conventional TKA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis has potential benefits over total knee arthroplasty but UKA has a higher revision rate. Robotic-assisted UKA is increasingly common and offers more accurate implant positioning and limb alignment, lower early postoperative pain but evidence of functional outcome is lacking. The aim was to assess the clinical outcomes of a single-centre, prospective, randomised controlled trial, comparing robotic-arm-assisted UKA with conventional surgery.
METHODS: A total of 139 participants were recruited and underwent robotic-arm-assisted (fixed bearing) or conventional (mobile bearing) UKA. Fifty-eight patients in the robotic-arm-assisted group and 54 in the manual group at 2 years. The main outcome measures were the Oxford Knee Score, American Knee Society Score and revision rate.
RESULTS: At 2 years, there were no significant differences for any of the outcome measures. Sub-group analysis (n = 35) of participants with a preoperative University of California Los Angeles Activity Scale >5 (more active) was performed. In this sub-group, the median Oxford Knee Score at 2 years was 46 (IQR 42.0-48.0) for robotic-arm-assisted and 41 (IQR 38.5-44.0) for the manual group (P = .036). The median American Knee Society Score was 193.5 (IQR 184.0-198.0) for the robotic-arm-assisted group and 174.0 (IQR 166.0-188.5) for the manual group (P = .017). Survivorship was 100% in robotic-arm-assisted group and 96.3% in the manual group.
CONCLUSION: Overall, participants achieved an outcome equivalent to the most widely implanted UKA in the United Kingdom. Sub-group analysis suggests that more active patients may benefit from robotic-arm- assisted surgery. Long term follow-up is required to evaluate differences in survivorship.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The objectives of this study were to compare postoperative pain, analgesia requirements, inpatient functional rehabilitation, time to hospital discharge, and complications in patients undergoing conventional jig-based unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) versus robotic-arm assisted UKA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 146 patients with symptomatic medial compartment knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary UKA performed by a single surgeon. This included 73 consecutive patients undergoing conventional jig-based mobile bearing UKA, followed by 73 consecutive patients receiving robotic-arm assisted fixed bearing UKA. All surgical procedures were performed using the standard medial parapatellar approach for UKA, and all patients underwent the same postoperative rehabilitation programme. Postoperative pain scores on the numerical rating scale and opiate analgesia consumption were recorded until discharge. Time to attainment of predefined functional rehabilitation outcomes, hospital discharge, and postoperative complications were recorded by independent observers.
RESULTS: Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with reduced postoperative pain (p < 0.001), decreased opiate analgesia requirements (p < 0.001), shorter time to straight leg raise (p < 0.001), decreased number of physiotherapy sessions (p < 0.001), and increased maximum knee flexion at discharge (p < 0.001) compared with conventional jig-based UKA. Mean time to hospital discharge was reduced in robotic UKA compared with conventional UKA (42.5 hours (sd 5.9) vs 71.1 hours (sd 14.6), respectively; p < 0.001). There was no difference in postoperative complications between the two groups within 90 days' follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with decreased postoperative pain, reduced opiate analgesia requirements, improved early functional rehabilitation, and shorter time to hospital discharge compared with conventional jig-based UKA.},

The secondary objective was to compare accuracy of implant positioning in conventional jig-based UKA versus robotic-arm assisted UKA.
Patients and Methods: This prospective single-surgeon cohort study included 60 consecutive conventional jig-based UKAs compared with 60 consecutive robotic-arm assisted UKAs for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Patients undergoing conventional UKA and robotic-arm assisted UKA were well-matched for baseline characteristics including a mean age of 65.5 years (sd 6.8) vs 64.1 years (sd 8.7), (p = 0.31); a mean body mass index of 27.2 kg.m2 (sd 2.7) vs 28.1 kg.m2 (sd 4.5), (p = 0.25); and gender (27 males: 33 females vs 26 males: 34 females, p = 0.85). Surrogate measures of the learning curve were prospectively collected. These included operative times, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire to assess preoperative stress levels amongst the surgical team, accuracy of implant positioning, limb alignment, and postoperative complications.
Results: Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with a learning curve of six cases for operating time (p < 0.001) and surgical team confidence levels (p < 0.001). Cumulative robotic experience did not affect accuracy of implant positioning (p = 0.52), posterior condylar offset ratio (p = 0.71), posterior tibial slope (p = 0.68), native joint line preservation (p = 0.55), and postoperative limb alignment (p = 0.65). Robotic-arm assisted UKA improved accuracy of femoral (p < 0.001) and tibial (p < 0.001) implant positioning with no additional risk of postoperative complications compared to conventional jig-based UKA.
Conclusion: Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with a learning curve of six cases for operating time and surgical team confidence levels but no learning curve for accuracy of implant positioning. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:1033-42.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite reduction in radiological outliers in previous randomized trials comparing robotic-assisted versus conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA), no differences in short-term functional outcomes were observed. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was improvement in functional outcomes and quality-of-life (QoL) measures between robotic-assisted and conventional TKA.
METHODS: All 60 knees (31 robotic-assisted; 29 conventional) from a previous randomized trial were available for analysis. Differences in range of motion, Knee Society (KSS) knee and function scores, Oxford Knee scores (OKS), SF-36 subscale and summative (physical PCS/mental component scores MCS) were analysed. In addition, patient satisfaction, fulfilment of expectations and the proportion attaining a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in KSS, OKS and SF-36 were studied.
RESULTS: Both robotic-assisted and conventional TKA displayed significant improvements in majority of the functional outcome scores at 2 years. Despite having a higher rate of complications, the robotic-assisted group displayed a trend towards higher scores in SF-36 QoL measures, with significant differences in SF-36 vitality (p = 0.03), role emotional (p = 0.02) and a larger proportion of patients achieving SF-36 vitality MCID (48.4 vs 13.8 %, p = 0.009). No significant differences in KSS, OKS or satisfaction/expectation rates were noted.
CONCLUSION: Subtle improvements in patient QoL measures were observed in robotic-assisted TKA when compared to conventional TKA. This finding suggests that QoL measures may be more sensitive and clinically important than surgeon-driven objective scores in detecting subtle functional improvements in robotic-assisted TKA patients.

  abstract = {As with most new surgical technologies, there is an associated learning curve with robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) before surgeons can expect ease of use to be similar to that of manual cases. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to (1) assess robotic-assisted versus manual operative times of two joint reconstructive surgeons separately as well as (2) find an overall learning curve. A total of 240 robotic-assisted TKAs performed by two board-certified surgeons were analyzed. The cases were sequentially grouped into 20 cases and a learning curve was created based on mean operative times. For each surgeon, mean operative times for their first 20 and last 20 robotic-assisted cases were compared with 20 randomly selected manual cases performed by that surgeon as controls prior to the initiation of the robotic-assisted cases. Each of the surgeons first 20 robotic assisted, last 20 robotic assisted, and 20 controls were then combined to create 3 cohorts of 40 cases for analysis. <i>Surgeon 1</i>: First and last robotic cohort operative times were 81 and 70 minutes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mean operative times for the first 20 robotic-assisted cases and manual cases were 81 versus 68 minutes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mean operative times for the last 20 robotic-assisted cases and manual cases were 70 versus 68 minutes (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). <i>Surgeon 2</i>: First and last robotic cohort operative times were 117 and 98 minutes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mean operative times for the first 20 robotic-assisted cases and manual cases were 117 versus 95 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mean operative times for the last 20 robotic-cohort cases and manual cases were 98 versus 95 (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). A similar trend occurred when the times of two surgeons were combined. The data from this study effectively create a learning curve for the use of robotic-assisted TKA. As both surgeons completed their total cases numbers within similar time frames, these data imply that within a few months, a board-certified orthopaedic joint arthroplasty surgeon should be able to adequately perform robotic TKA without adding any operative times.},

  abstract = {Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) allows replacement of a single compartment in patients with limited disease. However, UKA is technically challenging and relies on accurate component positioning and restoration of natural knee kinematics. This study examined the accuracy of dynamic, real-time ligament balancing using a robotic-assisted UKA system. Surgical data obtained from the computer system were prospectively collected from 51 patients (52 knees) undergoing robotic-assisted medial UKA by a single surgeon. Dynamic ligament balancing of the knee was obtained under valgus stress prior to component implantation and then compared to final ligament balance with the components in place. Ligament balancing was accurate up to 0.53 mm compared to the preoperative plan, with 83% of cases within 1 mm at 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, and 110° of flexion. Ligamentous laxity of 1.31 ± 0.13 mm at 30° of flexion was corrected successfully to 0.78 ± 0.17 mm (P < 0.05). Robotic-assisted UKA allows accurate and precise reproduction of a surgical balance plan using dynamic, real-time soft-tissue balancing to help restore natural knee kinematics, potentially improving implant survival and functional outcomes.},

METHODS: Eighty UKA (57 medial, 23 lateral) were performed with robotic assistance (BlueBelt Navio system) between 2013 and 2017. These patients were matched with 80 patients undergoing UKA using the same prosthesis, implanted using conventional technique. The sagittal and coronal component position was assessed on postoperative radiographs. The revision rate was reported at last follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 19.7 months ± 9 for the robotic-assisted group, and 24.2 months ± 16 for the control group. The rate of postoperative limb alignment outliers (± 2°) was significantly higher in the control group than in the robotic-assisted group for both lateral UKA (26% in robotic group versus 61% in control group; p = 0.018) and medial UKA (16% versus 32%, resp.; p = 0.038). The coronal and sagittal tibial baseplate position had significantly less outliers (± 3°) in the robotic-assisted group, than in the control group. Revision rates were: 5% (n = 4/80) for robotic assisted UKA and 9% (n = 7/80) for conventional UKA (n.s.). The reasons for revision were different between groups, with 86% of revisions in the control group occurring in association with component malposition or limb malalignment, compared with none in the robotic-assisted group.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted UKA has a lower rate of postoperative limb alignment outliers, as well as a lower revision rate, compared to conventional technique. The accuracy of implant positioning is improved by this robotic-assisted system.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level of evidence III. Retrospective case-control study CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is the first paper comparing implant position, clinical outcome, and revision rate for UKA performed using the Navio robotic system with a control group.},

METHODS: We created a Markov decision analysis to evaluate the costs, outcomes, and incremental cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted UKA in 64-year-old patients with end-stage unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis.
RESULTS: Robot-assisted UKA was more costly than traditional UKA, but offered a slightly better outcome with 0.06 additional quality-adjusted life-years at an incremental cost of $47,180 per quality-adjusted life-years, given a case volume of 100 cases annually. The system was cost-effective when case volume exceeded 94 cases per year, 2-year failure rates were below 1.2%, and total system costs were <$1.426 million.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted UKA is cost-effective compared with traditional UKA when annual case volume exceeds 94 cases per year. It is not cost-effective at low-volume or medium-volume arthroplasty centers.},

                  Robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) presents a potential, new added value for orthopedic surgeons. In today's health care system, a major determinant of value can be assessed by patient satisfaction scores. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to analyze patient satisfaction outcomes between RATKA and manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Specifically, we used the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) to compare (1) pain scores, (2) physical function scores, and (3) total patient satisfaction outcomes in manual and RATKA patients at 6 months postoperatively. In this study, 28 cemented RATKAs performed by a single orthopedic surgeon at a high-volume institution were analyzed. The first 7 days were considered as an adjustment period along the learning curve. Twenty consecutive cemented RATKAs were matched and compared with 20 consecutive cemented manual TKAs performed immediately. Patients were administered a WOMAC satisfaction survey at 6 months postoperatively. Satisfaction scores between the two cohorts were compared and the data were analyzed using Student's t-tests. A p-value < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. The mean pain score, standard deviation (SD), and range for the manual and robotic cohorts were 5 ± 3 (range: 0–10) and 3 ± 3 (range: 0–8, p < 0.05), respectively. The mean physical function score, SD, and range for the manual and robotic cohorts were 9 ± 5 (range: 0–17) and 4 ± 5 (range, 0–14, p = 0.055), respectively. The mean total patient satisfaction score, SD, and range for the manual and robotic cohorts were 14 points (range: 0–27 points, SD: ± 8) and 7 ± 8 points (range: 0–22 points, p < 0.05), respectively. The results from this study further highlight the potential of this new surgical tool to improve short-term pain, physical function, and total satisfaction scores. Therefore, it appears that patients who undergo RATKA can expect better short-term outcomes when compared with patients who undergo manual TKA.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the surgical team's learning curve for robotic-arm assisted TKA through assessments of operative times, surgical team comfort levels, accuracy of implant positioning, limb alignment, and postoperative complications. Secondary objectives were to compare accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment in conventional jig-based TKA versus robotic-arm assisted TKA.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 60 consecutive conventional jig-based TKAs followed by 60 consecutive robotic-arm assisted TKAs performed by a single surgeon. Independent observers recorded surrogate markers of the learning curve including operative times, stress levels amongst the surgical team using the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) questionnaire, accuracy of implant positioning, limb alignment, and complications within 30 days of surgery. Cumulative summation (CUSUM) analyses were used to assess learning curves for operative time and STAI scores in robotic TKA.
RESULTS: Robotic-arm assisted TKA was associated with a learning curve of seven cases for operative times (p = 0.01) and surgical team anxiety levels (p = 0.02). Cumulative robotic experience did not affect accuracy of implant positioning (n.s.) limb alignment (n.s.) posterior condylar offset ratio (n.s.) posterior tibial slope (n.s.) and joint line restoration (n.s.). Robotic TKA improved accuracy of implant positioning (p < 0.001) and limb alignment (p < 0.001) with no additional risk of postoperative complications compared to conventional manual TKA.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of robotic-arm assisted TKA led to increased operative times and heightened levels of anxiety amongst the surgical team for the initial seven cases but there was no learning curve for achieving the planned implant positioning. Robotic-arm assisted TKA improved accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment compared to conventional jig-based TKA. The findings of this study will enable clinicians and healthcare professionals to better understand the impact of implementing robotic TKA on the surgical workflow, assist the safe integration of this procedure into surgical practice, and facilitate theatre planning and scheduling of operative cases during the learning phase.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Successful clinical outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) depend on lower limb alignment, soft tissue balance and component positioning, which can be difficult to control using manual instrumentation. Although robotic-assisted surgery more reliably controls these surgical factors, studies assessing outcomes of robotic-assisted UKA are lacking. Therefore, a prospective multicenter study was performed to assess outcomes of robotic-assisted UKA.
METHODS: A total of 1007 consecutive patients (1135 knees) underwent robotic-assisted medial UKA surgery from six surgeons at separate institutions between March 2009 and December 2011. All patients received a fixed-bearing metal-backed onlay implant as tibial component. Each patient was contacted at minimum two-year follow-up and asked a series of five questions to determine survivorship and patient satisfaction. Worst-case scenario analysis was performed whereby all patients were considered as revision when they declined participation in the study.
RESULTS: Data was collected for 797 patients (909 knees) with average follow-up of 29.6months (range: 22-52months). At 2.5-years of follow-up, 11 knees were reported as revised, which resulted in a survivorship of 98.8%. Thirty-five patients declined participation in the study yielding a worst-case survivorship of 96.0%. Of all patients without revision, 92% was either very satisfied or satisfied with their knee function.
CONCLUSION: In this multicenter study, robotic-assisted UKA was found to have high survivorship and satisfaction rate at short-term follow-up. Prospective comparison studies with longer follow-up are necessary in order to compare survivorship and satisfaction rates of robotic-assisted UKA to conventional UKA and total knee arthroplasty.},

  abstract = {Various systems of computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) in total hip arthroplasty (THA) were reviewed. The first clinically applied system was an active robotic system (ROBODOC), which performed femoral implant cavity preparation as programmed preoperatively. Several reports on cementless THA with ROBODOC showed better stem alignment and less variance in limb-length inequality on radiographic evaluation, less incidence of pulmonary embolic events on transesophageal cardioechogram, and less stress shielding on the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis than conventional manual methods. On the other hand, some studies raise issues with active systems, including a steep learning curve, muscle and nerve damage, and technical complications, such as a procedure stop due to a bone motion during cutting, requiring re-registration and registration failure. Semi-active robotic systems, such as Acrobot and Rio, were developed for ease of surgeon acceptance. The drill bit at the tip of the robotic arm is moved by a surgeon's hand, but it does not move outside of a milling path boundary, which is defined according to three-dimensional (3D) image-based preoperative planning. However, there are still few reports on THA with these semi-active systems. Thanks to the advancements in 3D sensor technology, navigation systems were developed. Navigation is a passive system, which does not perform any actions on patients. It only provides information and guidance to the surgeon who still uses conventional tools to perform the surgery. There are three types of navigation: computed tomography (CT)-based navigation, imageless navigation, and fluoro-navigation. CT-based navigation is the most accurate, but the preoperative planning on CT images takes time that increases cost and radiation exposure. Imageless navigation does not use CT images, but its accuracy depends on the technique of landmark pointing, and it does not take into account the individual uniqueness of the anatomy. Fluoroscopic navigation is good for trauma and spine surgeries, but its benefits are limited in the hip and knee reconstruction surgeries. Several studies have shown that the cup alignment with navigation is more precise than that of the conventional mechanical instruments, and that it is useful for optimizing limb length, range of motion, and stability. Recently, patient specific templates, based on CT images, have attracted attention and some early reports on cup placement, and resurfacing showed improved accuracy of the procedures. These various CAOS systems have pros and cons. Nonetheless, CAOS is a useful tool to help surgeons perform accurately what surgeons want to do in order to better achieve their clinical objectives. Thus, it is important that the surgeon fully understands what he or she should be trying to achieve in THA for each patient.},

METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 143 total hip replacements (128 patients) were performed using the Robodoc system. This is a consecutive series. Complete follow-up was possible in 97 hips at a mean follow-up period of 3.8 years.
RESULTS: Technical complications directly related to the robotic device occurred in nine cases (9.3%). The pre-operative Merle d'Aubigne score was determined at 8.1 points compared to a post-operative mean score of 16.2. There was no sign of femoral stem loosening on radiographs.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty with the Orthodoc/ Robodoc system achieves equal results as compared to a manual technique. However, there was a high number of technical complications directly or indirectly related to the robot.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests performing total knee arthroplasty using computer navigation can lead to more accurate surgical positioning of the components and knee alignment compared to a conventional operating technique without computer assistance. The use of robotic technology could theoretically take this accuracy one level further because it uses navigation in combination with ultimate mechanical precision, which could eliminate or reduce the inevitable margin of error during mechanical preparation of the bony cuts of total knee arthroplasty by the surgeon. We prospectively followed 25 consecutive cases using an active surgical robot. The minimum followup was 5.1 years (mean, 5.5 years; range, 5.1-5.8 years). Our results demonstrate excellent implant positioning and alignment was achieved within the 1 degree error of neutral alignment in all three planes in all cases. Despite this technical precision, the excessive operating time required for the robotic implantation, the technical complexity of the system, and the extremely high operational costs have led us to abandon this procedure and direct our interest more toward smart semiactive robotic systems.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to those of conventional UKA in Asian patients.
METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent robot-assisted UKA and 57 patients underwent conventional UKA were assessed in this study. Preoperative and postoperative range of motion (ROM), American Knee Society (AKS) score, Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index scale score (WOMAC), and patellofemoral (PF) score values were compared between the two groups. The mechanical femorotibial angle (mFTA) and Kennedy zone were also measured. Coronal alignments of the femoral and tibial components and posterior slopes of the tibial component were compared. Additionally, polyethylene (PE) liner thicknesses were compared.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding postoperative ROM, AKS, WOMAC and PF score. Robot group showed fewer radiologic outliers in terms of mFTA and coronal alignment of tibial and femoral components (p = 0.022, 0.037, 0.003). The two groups showed significantly different PE liner thicknesses (8.4 ± 0.8 versus 8.8 ± 0.9, p = 0.035). Robot group was the only influencing factor for reducing radiologic outlier (postoperative mFTA) in multivariate model (odds ratio: 2.833, p = 0.037).
CONCLUSION: In this study, robot-assisted UKA had many advantages over conventional UKA, such as its ability to achieve precise implant insertion and reduce radiologic outliers. Although the clinical outcomes of robot-assisted UKA over a short-term follow-up period were not significantly different compared to those of conventional UKA, longer follow-up period is needed to determine whether the improved radiologic accuracy of the components in robotic-assisted UKA will lead to better clinical outcomes and improved long-term survival.},

Patients and Methods: This prospective cohort study included 40 consecutive patients undergoing conventional jig-based TKA followed by 40 consecutive patients receiving robotic-arm assisted TKA. All surgical procedures were performed by a single surgeon using the medial parapatellar approach with identical implant designs and standardized postoperative inpatient rehabilitation. Inpatient functional outcomes and time to hospital discharge were collected in all study patients.
Results: There were no systematic differences in baseline characteristics between the conventional jig-based TKA and robotic-arm assisted TKA treatment groups with respect to age (p = 0.32), gender (p = 0.50), body mass index (p = 0.17), American Society of Anesthesiologists score (p = 0.88), and preoperative haemoglobin level (p = 0.82). Robotic-arm assisted TKA was associated with reduced postoperative pain (p < 0.001), decreased analgesia requirements (p < 0.001), decreased reduction in postoperative haemoglobin levels (p < 0.001), shorter time to straight leg raise (p < 0.001), decreased number of physiotherapy sessions (p < 0.001) and improved maximum knee flexion at discharge (p < 0.001) compared with conventional jig-based TKA. Median time to hospital discharge in robotic-arm assisted TKA was 77 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 74 to 81) compared with 105 hours (IQR 98 to 126) in conventional jig-based TKA (p < 0.001).

Orthopaedic surgery began to incorporate robotic technology in 1992, with the introduction of ROBODOC, for the planning and performance of total hip replacement. The use of robotic systems has subsequently increased, with promising short-term radiological outcomes when compared with traditional orthopaedic procedures. Robotic systems can be classified into two categories: autonomous and haptic (or surgeon-guided). Passive surgery systems, which represent a third type of technology, have also been adopted recently by orthopaedic surgeons. While autonomous systems have fallen out of favour, tactile systems with technological improvements have become widely used. Specifically, the use of tactile and passive robotic systems in unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) has addressed some of the historical mechanisms of failure of non-robotic UKR. These systems assist with increasing the accuracy of the alignment of the components and produce more consistent ligament balance. Short-term improvements in clinical and radiological outcomes have increased the popularity of robot-assisted UKR. Robot-assisted orthopaedic surgery has the potential for improving surgical outcomes. We discuss the different types of robotic systems available for use in orthopaedics and consider the indication, contraindications and limitations of these technologies.},

METHODS: Thirty patients underwent bilateral sequential total knee replacement. One knee was replaced by robotic-assisted implantation and the other by conventional implantation.
RESULTS: Radiographic results showed significantly more postoperative leg alignment outliers of conventional sides than robotic-assisted sides (mechanical axis, coronal inclination of the femoral prosthesis, and sagittal inclination of the tibial prosthesis). Robotic-assisted sides had non-significantly better postoperative knee scores and ROMs. Robotic-assisted sides needed longer operation times (25 min, SD ± 18) and longer skin incisions. Nevertheless, postoperative bleeding was significantly less for robotic-assisted sides.
CONCLUSION: The better alignment accuracy of robotic TKA and the good clinical results achieved may favorably influence clinical and radiological outcomes.},

A novel robotic arm technology has been developed with the expectation that it could improve the accuracy of bone preparation in UKA. During the study period, we compared the postoperative radiographic alignment of the tibial component with the preoperatively planned position in 31 knees in 31 consecutive patients undergoing UKA using robotic arm-assisted bone preparation and in 27 consecutive patients who underwent unilateral UKA using conventional manual instrumentation to determine the error of bone preparation and variance with each technique. Radiographically, the root mean square error of the posterior tibial slope was 3.1 degrees when using manual techniques compared with 1.9 degrees when using robotic arm assistance for bone preparation. In addition, the variance using manual instruments was 2.6 times greater than the robotically guided procedures. In the coronal plane, the average error was 2.7 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees more varus of the tibial component relative to the mechanical axis of the tibia using manual instruments compared with 0.2 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees with robotic technology, and the varus/valgus root mean square error was 3.4 degrees manually compared with 1.8 degrees robotically. Further study will be necessary to determine whether a reduction in alignment errors of these magnitudes will ultimately influence implant function or survival.

  abstract = {BackgroundImproper acetabular component orientation in THA has been associated with increased dislocation rates, component impingement, bearing surface wear, and a greater likelihood of revision. Therefore, any reasonable steps to improve acetabular component orientation should be considered and explored.Questions/purposesWe therefore sought to compare THA with a robotic-assisted posterior approach with manual alignment techniques through a posterior approach, using a matched-pair controlled study design, to assess whether the use of the robot made it more likely for the acetabular cup to be positioned in the safe zones described by Lewinnek et al. and Callanan et al.MethodsBetween September 2008 and September 2012, 160 THAs were performed by the senior surgeon. Sixty-two patients (38.8%) underwent THA using a conventional posterior approach, 69 (43.1%) underwent robotic-assisted THA using the posterior approach, and 29 (18.1%) underwent radiographic-guided anterior-approach THAs. From September 2008 to June 2011, all patients were offered anterior or posterior approaches regardless of BMI and anatomy. Since introduction of the robot in June 2011, all THAs were performed using the robotic technique through the posterior approach, unless a patient specifically requested otherwise. The radiographic cup positioning of the robotic-assisted THAs was compared with a matched-pair control group of conventional THAs performed by the same surgeon through the same posterior approach. The safe zone (inclination, 30°–50°; anteversion, 5°–25°) described by Lewinnek et al. and the modified safe zone (inclination, 30°–45°; anteversion, 5°–25°) of Callanan et al. were used for cup placement assessment. Matching criteria were gender, age ± 5 years, and (BMI) ± 7 units. After exclusions, a total of 50 THAs were included in each group. Strong interobserver and intraobserver correlations were found for all radiographic measurements (r > 0.82; p < 0.001).ResultsOne hundred percent (50/50) of the robotic-assisted THAs were within the safe zone described by Lewinnek et al. compared with 80% (40/50) of the conventional THAs (p = 0.001). Ninety-two percent (46/50) of robotic-assisted THAs were within the modified safe zone described by Callanan et al. compared with 62% (31/50) of conventional THAs p (p = 0.001). The odds ratios for an implanted cup out of the safe zones of Lewinnek et al. and Callanan et al. were zero and 0.142, respectively (95% CI, 0.044, 0.457).ConclusionsUse of the robot allowed for improvement in placement of the cup in both safe zones, an important parameter that plays a significant role in long-term success of THA. However, whether the radiographic improvements we observed will translate into clinical benefits for patients—such as reductions in component impingement, acetabular wear, and prosthetic dislocations, or in terms of improved longevity—remains unproven.Level of EvidenceLevel III, therapeutic study.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted total hip replacement has become a common method of implantation, especially in Europe. It frequently has been postulated that robotic reaming would result in an improved clinical outcome due to the better fit of the prosthesis, but that has never been demonstrated in a prospective study, to our knowledge. The purpose of this study was to compare robotic-assisted implantation of a total hip replacement with conventional manual implantation.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four patients scheduled for total hip replacement were randomly assigned to undergo either conventional manual implantation of an S-ROM prosthesis (eighty patients) or robotic-assisted implantation of such a prosthesis (seventy-four patients). The five-axis ROBODOC was used for the robotic-assisted procedures. Preoperatively as well as at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months after surgery, the scores according to the Harris and Merle d'Aubigné systems and the Mayo clinical score were determined. Radiographs made at these intervals were analyzed for evidence of loosening, prosthetic alignment, and heterotopic ossification.
RESULTS: Thirteen (18%) of the seventy-four attempted robotic implantations had to be converted to manual implantations as a result of failure of the system. The duration of the robotic procedures was longer than that of the manual procedures (mean and standard deviation,107.1 +/- 29.1 compared with 82.4 +/- 23.4 minutes, p < 0.001). Limb-length equality (mean discrepancy, 0.18 +/- 0.30 compared with 0.96 +/- 0.93 cm, p < 0.001) and varus-valgus orientation of the stem (mean angle between the femur and the shaft of the prosthesis, 0.34 degrees +/- 0.67 degrees compared with 0.84 degrees +/- 1.23 degrees, p < 0.001) were better after the robotic procedures. At six months, slightly more heterotopic ossification was seen in the group treated with robotic implantation. The group treated with robotic implantation had a better Mayo clinical score at six and twelve months and a better Harris score at twelve months; however, by twenty-four months, no difference was found between the groups with regard to any of the three scores. Dislocation was more frequent in the group treated with robotic implantation: it occurred in eleven of the sixty-one patients in that group compared with three of eighty in the other group (p < 0.001). Recurrent dislocation and pronounced limping were indications for revision surgery in eight of the sixty-one patients treated with robotic implantation compared with none of the seventy-eight (excluding two with revision for infection) treated with manual insertion (p < 0.001). Rupture of the gluteus medius tendon was observed during all of the revision operations.
CONCLUSIONS: The robotic-assisted technology had advantages in terms of preoperative planning and the accuracy of the intraoperative procedure. Disadvantages were the high revision rate; the amount of muscle damage, which we believe was responsible for the higher dislocation rate; and the longer duration of surgery. This technology must be further developed before its widespread usage can be justified.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown mechanical alignment influences the outcome of TKA. Robotic systems have been developed to improve the precision and accuracy of achieving component position and mechanical alignment.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined whether robotic-assisted implantation for TKA (1) improved clinical outcome; (2) improved mechanical axis alignment and implant inclination in the coronal and sagittal planes; (3) improved the balance (flexion and extension gaps); and (4) reduced complications, postoperative drainage, and operative time when compared to conventionally implanted TKA over an intermediate-term (minimum 3-year) followup period.
METHODS: We prospectively randomized 100 patients who underwent unilateral TKA into one of two groups: 50 using a robotic-assisted procedure and 50 using conventional manual techniques. Outcome variables considered were postoperative ROM, WOMAC scores, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee scores, mechanical axis alignment, flexion/extension gap balance, complications, postoperative drainage, and operative time. Minimum followup was 41 months (mean, 65 months; range, 41-81 months).
RESULTS: There were no differences in postoperative ROM, WOMAC scores, and HSS knee scores. The robotic-assisted group resulted in no mechanical axis outliers (> ± 3° from neutral) compared to 24% in the conventional group. There were fewer robotic-assisted knees where the flexion gap exceeded the extension gap by 2 mm. The robotic-assisted procedures took an average of 25 minutes longer than the conventional procedures but had less postoperative blood drainage. There were no differences in complications between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted TKA appears to reduce the number of mechanical axis alignment outliers and improve the ability to achieve flexion-extension gap balance, without any differences in clinical scores or complications when compared to conventional manual techniques.},

  abstract = {Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common procedure for treatment of severe gonarthrosis, but the outcome may be unsatisfactory due to primary malalignment of the prosthetic components. In order to improve precision and accuracy of this surgical procedure, a commercial robotic surgical system (CASPAR) has been adapted to assist the surgeon in the preoperative planning and intraoperative execution of TKR. So far, 70 patients with idiopathic gonarthrosis were successfully treated with a robot-assisted technique in our institution. No major adverse events related to the use of the robotic system have been observed. The mean difference between preoperatively planned and postoperatively achieved tibiofemoral alignment was 0.8 degrees (0-4.1 degrees ) in the robotic group vs. 2.6 degrees (0-7 degrees ) in a manually operated historical control group of 50 patients. A clear advantage of robot-assisted TKR seems to be the ability to execute a highly precise preoperative plan based on computed tomography (CT) scans. Due to better alignment of the prosthetic components and improved bone-implant fit, implant loosening is anticipated to be diminished which may be most evident in non-cemented prostheses. Current disadvantages such as the need for placement of fiducial markers, increased operating times and higher overall costs have to be resolved in the future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Higher revision rates have been reported in patients who have undergone unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared with patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty, with poor component positioning identified as a factor in implant failure. A robotic-assisted surgical procedure has been proposed as a method of improving the accuracy of component implantation in arthroplasty. The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial was to evaluate the accuracy of component positioning in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty comparing robotic-assisted and conventional implantation techniques.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either a robotic-assisted surgical procedure using the MAKO Robotic Interactive Orthopaedic Arm (RIO) system or a conventional surgical procedure using the Oxford Phase-3 unicompartmental knee replacement with traditional instrumentation. A postoperative computed tomographic scan was performed at three months to assess the accuracy of the axial, coronal, and sagittal component positioning.
RESULTS: Data were available for 120 patients, sixty-two who had undergone robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and fifty-eight who had undergone conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Intraobserver agreement was good for all measured component parameters. The accuracy of component positioning was improved with the use of the robotic-assisted surgical procedure, with lower root mean square errors and significantly lower median errors in all component parameters (p < 0.01). The proportion of patients with component implantation within 2° of the target position was significantly greater in the group who underwent robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared with the group who underwent conventional unicompartmental knee arthroscopy with regard to the femoral component sagittal position (57% compared with 26%, p = 0.0008), femoral component coronal position (70% compared with 28%, p = 0.0001), femoral component axial position (53% compared with 31%, p = 0.0163), tibial component sagittal position (80% compared with 22%, p = 0.0001), and tibial component axial position (48% compared with 19%, p = 0.0009).
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted surgical procedures with the use of the MAKO RIO lead to improved accuracy of implant positioning compared with conventional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty surgical techniques.

  abstract = {Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery has been available clinically in some form for over 2 decades, claiming to improve total joint arthroplasty by enhancing the surgeon's ability to reproduce alignment and therefore better restore normal kinematics. Various current systems include a robotic arm, robotic-guided cutting jigs, and robotic milling systems with a diversity of different navigation strategies using active, semiactive, or passive control systems. Semiactive systems have become dominant, providing a haptic window through which the surgeon is able to consistently prepare an arthroplasty based on preoperative planning. A review of previous designs and clinical studies demonstrate that these robotic systems decrease variability and increase precision, primarily focusing on component positioning and alignment. Some early clinical results indicate decreased revision rates and improved patient satisfaction with robotic-assisted arthroplasty. The future design objectives include precise planning and even further improved consistent intraoperative execution. Despite this cautious optimism, many still wonder whether robotics will ultimately increase cost and operative time without objectively improving outcomes. Over the long term, every industry that has seen robotic technology be introduced, ultimately has shown an increase in production capacity, improved accuracy and precision, and lower cost. A new generation of robotic systems is now being introduced into the arthroplasty arena, and early results with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty have demonstrated improved accuracy of placement, improved satisfaction, and reduced complications. Further studies are needed to confirm the cost effectiveness of these technologies.},

Although mechanical alignment guides have been designed to improve alignment accuracy, there are several fundamental limitations of this technology that will inhibit additional improvements. Various computer assisted techniques have been developed to examine the potential to install knee implants more accurately and consistently than can be done with mechanical guides. For example, computer integrated instrumentation incorporates highly accurate measurement devices to locate joint centers, track surgical tools, and align prosthetic components. Image guided knee replacement provides a three-dimensional preoperative plan that guides the placement of the cutting blocks and prosthetic components. Robot assisted knee replacement allows one to machine bones accurately without the use of standard cutting blocks. The rationale for the development of computer assisted knee replacement systems is presented, the operation of several different systems is described, the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches are discussed, and areas for future research are suggested.},

The primary outcome measurement was the angle of tibiofemoral alignment in the coronal plane, measured by CT. Other secondary parameters were evaluated and are reported. All of the Acrobot group had tibiofemoral alignment in the coronal plane within 2 degrees of the planned position, while only 40% of the conventional group achieved this level of accuracy. While the operations took longer, no adverse effects were noted, and there was a trend towards improvement in performance with increasing accuracy based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and American Knee Society scores at six weeks and three months.

  abstract = {The ROBODOC system was designed to address potential human errors in performing cementless total hip replacement. The system consists of a preoperative planning computer workstation (called ORTHODOC) and a five-axis robotic arm with a high speed milling device as an end effector. The combined experience of the United States Food and Drug Administration multicenter trial and the German postmarket use of the system are reported. The United States study is controlled and randomized with 136 hip replacements performed at three centers (65 ROBODOC and 62 control). Followup was 1 year on 127 hip replacements and 2 years on 93 hip replacements. No differences were found in the Harris hip scores or the Short Form Health Survey outcomes questionnaire. Length of stay also was not different, but the surgical time and blood loss were greater in the ROBODOC group. This was attributed to a learning curve at each center. Radiographs were evaluated by an independent bone radiologist and showed statistically better fit and positioning of the femoral component in the ROBODOC group. Complications were not different, except for three cases of intraoperative femoral fracture in the control group and none in the ROBODOC group. The German study reports on 858 patients, 42 with bilateral hip replacements and this includes 30 revision cases for a total of 900 hip replacements. The Harris hip score rose from 43.7 to 91.5. In these cases the surgical time declined quickly from 240 minutes for the first case to 90 minutes. No intraoperative femoral fractures occurred in 900 cases. Other complications were comparable with total hip replacements performed using conventional techniques. The ROBODOC system is thought to be safe and effective in producing radiographically superior implant fit and positioning while eliminating femoral fractures.},

There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The deformable property of soft robots restricts the use of many conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are preferable for soft robots. Sensors include low modulus (< 1 MPa) elastomers with liquid-phase material filled channels and are appropriate for proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature. In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed because the conventional control techniques may be inadequate to handle soft robots. Several innovative techniques and diverse materials & fabrication methods are described in this review article. In addition, a wide range of soft robots are characterized and analyzed based on the following sub-categories; actuation, sensing, structure, control and electronics, materials, fabrication and system, and applications.},

One area in which soft robotics has the ability to make significant impact is in the development of soft grippers and manipulators. With an increased requirement for automation, robotics systems are required to perform task in unstructured and not well defined environments; conditions which conventional rigid robotics are not best suited. This requires a paradigm shift in the methods and materials used to develop robots such that they can adapt to and work safely in human environments. One solution to this is soft robotics, which enables soft interactions with the surroundings while maintaining the ability to apply significant force. This review paper assesses the current materials and methods, actuation methods and sensors which are used in the development of soft manipulators. The achievements and shortcomings of recent technology in these key areas are evaluated, and this paper concludes with a discussion on the potential impacts of soft manipulators on industry and society.},

  abstract = {Discovery of fundamental principles which govern and limit effective locomotion (self-propulsion) is of intellectual interest and practical importance. Human technology has created robotic moving systems that excel in movement on and within environments of societal interest: paved roads, open air and water. However, such devices cannot yet robustly and efficiently navigate (as animals do) the enormous diversity of natural environments which might be of future interest for autonomous robots; examples include vertical surfaces like trees and cliffs, heterogeneous ground like desert rubble and brush, turbulent flows found near seashores, and deformable/flowable substrates like sand, mud and soil. In this review we argue for the creation of a physics of moving systems-a 'locomotion robophysics'-which we define as the pursuit of principles of self-generated motion. Robophysics can provide an important intellectual complement to the discipline of robotics, largely the domain of researchers from engineering and computer science. The essential idea is that we must complement the study of complex robots in complex situations with systematic study of simplified robotic devices in controlled laboratory settings and in simplified theoretical models. We must thus use the methods of physics to examine both locomotor successes and failures using parameter space exploration, systematic control, and techniques from dynamical systems. Using examples from our and others' research, we will discuss how such robophysical studies have begun to aid engineers in the creation of devices that have begun to achieve life-like locomotor abilities on and within complex environments, have inspired interesting physics questions in low dimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter physics, and have been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex terrain. The rapidly decreasing cost of constructing robot models with easy access to significant computational power bodes well for scientists and engineers to engage in a discipline which can readily integrate experiment, theory and computation.},

Such achievements are reviewed here in terms of the abilities that they provide robots that were not possible before. An analysis of the evolution of this field shows how, after a few pioneering works in the years 2009 to 2012, breakthrough results were obtained by taking seminal technological and scientific challenges related to soft robotics from actuation and sensing to modeling and control. Further progress in soft robotics research has produced achievements that are important in terms of robot abilities-that is, from the viewpoint of what robots can do today thanks to the soft robotics approach. Abilities such as squeezing, stretching, climbing, growing, and morphing would not be possible with an approach based only on rigid links. The challenge ahead for soft robotics is to further develop the abilities for robots to grow, evolve, self-heal, develop, and biodegrade, which are the ways that robots can adapt their morphology to the environment.},

The wide spread of soft robotics relies on numerous investigations of diverse materials and technologies for actuation and sensing, and on research of control techniques, all of which can serve the purpose of building robots with high deformability and compliance.

Their outstanding properties such as low operating voltage, easy miniaturization, and noiseless operation are, however, marred by issues related to the repeatability in the production and operation of these materials. Implementing closed-loop control for IEAP actuators is a viable option for overcoming these issues. Since IEAP laminates also behave as mechanoelectrical sensors, it is advantageous to combine the actuating and sensing functionalities of a single device to create a so-called self-sensing actuator. This review article systematizes the state of the art in producing self-sensing ionic polymer actuators.

At present, a new discipline is emerging in this area, called »Soft Robotics«. It particularly challenges the traditional thinking of engineers, as the confluence of technologies, ranging from new materials, sensors, actuators and production techniques to new design tools, will make it possible to create new systems whose structures are almost completely made of soft materials, which bring about entirely new functions and behaviors, similar in many ways to natural systems.

The investigations on soft materials are mostly done for two reasons: (a) to develop an anthropomorphic/prosthetic hand or soft hand with human skin-like material to perform soft manipulations and (b) to develop soft actuators. This paper presented a comprehensive investigation into researches on soft materials for robotic applications. The primary interest of using soft materials is not to leave any marks or damage to objects during the manipulation. The other advantage would be stable grasping due to an area contact. Natural rubber, synthetic rubber, elastomer, polymer composite and nanoparticulated polymer composite are some existing soft materials. Extensive research is required to prepare a high-strength but lighter soft material for robotic soft manipulation. Human skin and its mechanical properties are initially discussed. In addition, the need of soft material for soft manipulations and observations from previous researches over the past few decades, modelling of non-linear hyperelastic/viscoelastic materials and characterization are discussed. Finally, various soft materials including the polymer-matrix composites, available fillers and their advantages, processing methods and nanoparticulated polymer matrix and its significance in robotic application are presented.},

Functionalities never seen before are achieved. In this review we discuss soft robots which allow actuation with several degrees of freedom. We show that different actuation mechanisms lead to similar actuators, capable of complex and smooth movements in 3d space. We introduce latest research examples in sensor skin development and discuss ultraflexible electronic circuits, light emitting diodes and solar cells as examples. Additional functionalities of sensor skin, such as visual sensors inspired by animal eyes, camouflage, self-cleaning and healing and on-skin energy storage and generation are briefly reviewed. Finally, we discuss a paradigm change in energy harvesting, away from hard energy generators to soft ones based on dielectric elastomers. Such systems are shown to work with high energy of conversion, making them potentially interesting for harvesting mechanical energy from human gait, winds and ocean waves.},

  abstract = {Films of conducting polymers in the presence of electrolytes can be oxidized or reduced by the flow of anodic or cathodic currents. Ions and solvent are exchanged during a reaction for charge and osmotic pressure balance. A reactive conducting polymer contains ions and solvent. Such variation of composition during a reaction is reminiscent of the biological processes in cells. Along changes to the composition of the material during a reaction, there are also changes to other properties, including: volume (electrochemomechanical), colour (electrochromic), stored charge (electrical storage), porosity or permselectivity (electroporosity), stored chemicals, wettability and so on. Most of those properties mimic similar property changes in organs during their functioning. These properties are being exploited to develop biomimetic reactive and soft devices: artificial muscles and polymeric actuators; supercapacitors and all organic batteries; smart membranes; electron-ion transducers; nervous interfaces and artificial synapses, or drug delivery devices. In this review we focus on the state of the art for artificial muscles, smart membranes and electron-ion transducers. The reactive nature of those devices provide them with a unique advantage related to the present days technologies: any changes in the surrounding physical or chemical variable acting on the electrochemical reaction rate will be sensed by the device while working. Working under constant current (driving signal), the evolution of the device potential or the evolution of the consumed electrical energy (sensing signals) senses and quantifies the variable increment. Driving and sensing signals are present, simultaneously, in the same two connecting wires. It is possible to prepare electrochemical devices based on conducting polymers in which there are several kinds of different sensors and one actuator embedded in one device. Examples of the tools and products, start-up companies, increasing evolution of scientific literature and patents are also presented. Scientific and technological challenges are also considered.},

In other MEMS applications, pneumatic and hydraulic actuators are rare in comparison with electrostatic, thermal or piezo-electric actuators. However, several studies have shown that hydraulic and pneumatic actuators deliver among the highest force and power densities at microscale.

  abstract = {Traditional robots have rigid underlying structures that limit their ability to interact with their environment. For example, conventional robot manipulators have rigid links and can manipulate objects using only their specialised end effectors. These robots often encounter difficulties operating in unstructured and highly congested environments. A variety of animals and plants exhibit complex movement with soft structures devoid of rigid components. Muscular hydrostats (e.g. octopus arms and elephant trunks) are almost entirely composed of muscle and connective tissue and plant cells can change shape when pressurised by osmosis. Researchers have been inspired by biology to design and build soft robots. With a soft structure and redundant degrees of freedom, these robots can be used for delicate tasks in cluttered and/or unstructured environments. This paper discusses the novel capabilities of soft robots, describes examples from nature that provide biological inspiration, surveys the state of the art and outlines existing challenges in soft robot design, modelling, fabrication and control.},

The robot employs several design principles adapted from the GECKO including a hierarchy of compliant structures, directional adhesion, and control of tangential contact forces to achieve control of adhesion. We describe the design and fabrication methods used to create underactuated, multimaterial structures that conform to surfaces over a range of length scales from centimeters to micrometers. At the finest scale, the undersides of Stickybot's toes are covered with arrays of small, angled polymer stalks. Like the directional adhesive structures used by geckos, they readily adhere when pulled tangentially from the tips of the toes toward the ankles; when pulled in the opposite direction, they release. Working in combination with the compliant structures and directional adhesion is a force control strategy that balances forces among the feet and promotes smooth attachment and detachment of the toes.},

The model incorporates both IPMC actuation dynamics and the hydrodynamics, and predicts the steady-state cruising speed of the robot under a given periodic actuation voltage. The interactions between the plastic fin and the IPMC actuator are also captured in the model. Experimental results have shown that the proposed model is able to predict the motion of robotic fish for different tail dimensions. Since most of the model parameters are expressed in terms of fundamental physical properties and geometric dimensions, the model is expected to be instrumental in optimal design of the robotic fish.},

This review focuses on one class of soft active materials: dielectric elastomers. When a membrane of a dielectric elastomer is subject to a voltage through its thickness, the membrane reduces thickness and expands area, possibly straining over 100%. The dielectric elastomers are being developed as transducers for broad applications, including soft robots, adaptive optics, Braille displays, and electric generators. This paper reviews the theory of dielectric elastomers, developed within continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, and motivated by molecular pictures and empirical observations. The theory couples large deformation and electric potential, and describes nonlinear and nonequilibrium behavior, such as electromechanical instability and viscoelasticity. The theory enables the finite element method to simulate transducers of realistic configurations, predicts the efficiency of electromechanical energy conversion, and suggests alternative routes to achieve giant voltage-induced deformation. It is hoped that the theory will aid in the creation of materials and devices.},

A flexible and electrically conducting material that can sense mechanical forces and yet be able to self-heal repeatably can be of use in emerging fields such as soft robotics and biomimetic prostheses, but combining all these properties together remains a challenging task. Here, we describe a composite material composed of a supramolecular organic polymer with embedded nickel nanostructured microparticles, which shows mechanical and electrical self-healing properties at ambient conditions. We also show that our material is pressure- and flexion-sensitive, and therefore suitable for electronic skin applications. The electrical conductivity can be tuned by varying the amount of nickel particles and can reach values as high as 40 S cm−1. On rupture, the initial conductivity is repeatably restored with ∼90% efficiency after 15 s healing time, and the mechanical properties are completely restored after ∼10 min. The composite resistance varies inversely with applied flexion and tactile forces. These results demonstrate that natural skin's repeatable self-healing capability can be mimicked in conductive and piezoresistive materials, thus potentially expanding the scope of applications of current electronic skin systems.},

A combination of crawling and undulation gaits allowed this robot to navigate a difficult obstacle.

In this context, the aim of this study is to determine whether the economic growth experienced in some countries as a result of the expansion of the tourism activity over the last two decades influences an increase in the level of economic development. To that end, a sample of 144 countries has been used, which verifies that this relationship occurs, especially in more developed countries, which calls into question the conception of tourism as a driving force of economic development for the least developed countries, and even in developing countries.},

Second, the aforementioned relationship is also highly economic event-dependent, as it is influenced by the Great Recession of 2007 and the ongoing Eurozone debt crisis that began in 2010. Finally, the impact of these economic events is more pronounced in Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain, which are the European countries that have witnessed the greatest economic downturn since 2009.

However, the recursive Granger causality test shows that the tourism-led growth hypothesis in Malaysia is valid and stable with respect to tourist arrivals from only 8 out of the 12 tourism markets. Almost all of them are from developed countries. Hence, not all international visitor arrivals could effectively drive the growth of the Malaysian economy. In light of this, tourism marketing policies should focus more on those tourism markets that could significantly stimulate economic growth.

The empirical results primarily show a positive relation between tourism and economic growth for the ten countries considered with substantial variations across countries and across quantiles within each country. The weakest links are noted for China and Germany, possibly because of the limited importance of the tourism sector relative to other major economic activities in those countries. Important country-specific policy implications may be drawn from these findings.},

The study uses panel data for the period 1998–2011, and adopts a panel Granger causality analysis developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) to assess the contribution tourism makes to economic growth in each country. The results indicate that the direction of causality between tourism and economic growth depends on the country group and tourism indicator. Furthermore, the European countries are better able to generate growth from tourism in the Mediterranean region.},

We present a formal model and empirical evidence. The ingredients of the dynamic model are a large population of intertemporally optimizing agents and an AK technology representing tourism production. The model shows that an increase in the growth of tourism demand leads to transitional dynamics with gradually increasing economic growth and increasing terms of trade. In our empirical application, an econometric methodology is applied to annual data of Antigua and Barbuda from 1970 to 2008. We perform a cointegration analysis to look for the existence of a long-run relationship among variables of economic growth, international tourism earnings and the real exchange rate. The exercise confirms the theoretical findings.},

Since we find the presence of cross-sectional dependence within the panel time-series data, we apply second-generation unit root tests, cointegration test and causality test which can deal with cross-sectional dependence problems. The cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) and the cross-sectionally augmented Im-Pesaran-Shin (CIPS) unit root tests indicate that the analysed variables become stationary at their first differences. The Lagrange multiplier bootstrap panel cointegration test shows the existence of a long-run relationship between the analysed variables. The dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) estimation technique indicates that energy consumption and tourism contribute to the levels of gas emissions, while increases in trade lead to environmental improvements. In addition, the EKC hypothesis cannot be supported as the sign of coefficients on GDP and GDP2 is negative and positive, respectively. Moreover, the Dumitrescu–Hurlin causality tests exploit a variety of causal relationship between the analysed variables. The OECD countries are suggested to invest in improving energy efficiency, regulate necessary environmental protection policies for tourism sector in specific and promote trading activities through several types of encouragement act.},

  abstract = {Tourism is now believed to provide an impetus to the economic progress of developing nations and its importance is gaining widespread recognition. In fact, the relationship between exports and growth is the subject of ongoing debate, but the nature of exports has received little attention. Despite the continuous efforts of developing countries to increase their exports, this strategy often adds little foreign exchange to their balance of payments. For many reasons, the non-traditional exports of developing countries have too often failed to prove effective in economic development and so tourism is increasingly seen as something of a saviour. This paper focuses on the success story of a small island economy, Mauritius. Once regarded as an extreme case of a mono-crop economy, relying very predominantly on the export of sugar, Mauritius is now a reputed exporter of non-traditional goods (textiles) and services (tourism). Using cointegration and causality tests, the author's results lend support to the contention that tourism has promoted growth, and further evidence suggests that tourism has a significant positive impact on Mauritian economic development.},

On the global scale, after allowing for the heterogeneous country effect, a cointegrated relationship between GDP and tourism development is substantiated. It is also determined that tourism development has a greater impact on GDP in nonOECD countries than in OECD countries, and when the variable is tourism receipts, the greatest impact is in Sub-Sahara African countries. Additionally, the real effective exchange rate has significant effects on economic growth. Finally, in the long run, the panel causality test shows unidirectional causality relationships from tourism development to economic growth in OECD countries, bidirectional relationships in nonOECD countries, but only weak relationships in Asia.

Findings show that research on biofuels and biofuel production growth are positively correlated. From the analyzed publications, The United States, India, China, and Europe are the largest biofuel markets, with the USA taking the lead in publishing scientific papers, engaging country collaboration on biofuel, and has the highest social impact. Findings also show that the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, and Spain are more inclined to develop sustainable biofuel economies and energy than other European countries. It also indicates that sustainable biofuel economies are still far behind those of less developed and developing countries. Besides, this study finds that biofuel linked to sustainable economy with poverty reduction, agriculture development, renewable energy production, economic growth, climate change policy, environmental protection, carbon emission reduction, green-house gas emission, land use policy, technological innovations, and development.

It was found that 99.5% yield of the FAME over modified CaO was obtained from soybean oil using 15:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil after 3 h at reaction temperature of 65 °C, which is much higher than the yield of 35.4% over commercial CaO at the same reaction conditions. For the transesterification between rapeseed oil and methanol, the reaction time to its highest yield, 99.8%, was shortened to 2.5 h. The physical and chemical properties of catalysts were characterized by using techniques of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), BET surface area measurement (BET), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and thermogravimeter (TG). The results indicated that well dispersed CaO with relatively small particle sizes and high surface areas were obtained after modification. Furthermore, the thermal stability of modified CaO is improved and the amount of Ca(OH)2 formed during the modifying process is very little. Influence of the amount of modifier and various reaction conditions, such as mass ratio of catalyst to oil, reaction temperature and molar ratio of methanol to oil, were investigated in detail. Furthermore, water-tolerance of the modified CaO was tested by adding water in the reaction system.},

Computational analysis is also provided by using a real case study in Iran to show the performance and validity of the proposed model. The results show that with an increase of 2.43% in the economic objective function, a desirable level of environmental and social protection is achieved. Additionally, the mean value of supply chain performance will enjoy more desirable values if the influence of optimality robustness and feasibility robustness decreases. The results also demonstrate that the proposed robust model outperforms the deterministic model in terms of the average and standard deviation measures.},

To distinguish between short-term and medium-term effects, we construct these trees for different frequencies (weekly and monthly). We find that in short-term, both ethanol and biodiesel are very weakly connected with the other commodities. In medium-term, the biofuels network becomes more structured. The system splits into two well separated branches — a fuels part and a food part. Biodiesel tends to the fuels branch and ethanol to the food branch. When the periods before and after the food crisis of 2007/2008 are compared, the connections are much stronger for the post-crisis period. This is the first application of this methodology on the biofuel systems.},

For effective extraction of intra-cellular lipids, a novel method based on mild pressure (1–2.5 kg/cm2) with short period (5–15 min) of heat shock (50–70 °C) were studied for the wet biomass. The transesterified lipids were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed using Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The higher CO2 aeration (8%) significantly increased the biomass productivity (23%) when compared with control and CO2 (4%) aeration. Total lipid production (93%) acquired by conventional extraction procedure showed enhanced production simultaneously. The maximum lipid recovery (0.225 g g−1 dw) was obtained at a pressure of 2 kg/cm2 and heating for 10 min at 60 °C. The transesterified lipids showed that oleic acid (C18:1–51.62%) was the main component in both conventional and suggested lipid extraction process. The suggested extraction process showed significant increase in biodiesel yield by 26.7%. The energy outputs of biodiesel by conventional and suggested extraction process were 417.7 and 533.6 MJ ton−1, respectively. The overall results indicated that 8% of CO2 induced the biomass and lipid productivity by 94% and 54.8%, respectively, when compared with control. In addition, the suggested mild pressure with heat shock extraction process further enhanced the lipid recovery by 21% which serves as a cost-effective lipid extraction process for microalgae.},

  volume   = {28},
  abstract = {One of the issues related to the increased use of biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) in the transport sector concerns their higher production costs, either in pure or blended form, as compared to conventional fuels (gasoline and diesel). Based on the average cost of biodiesel, the former is not able to compete with diesel if no subsidies are provided by the government to boost its cost competitiveness. However, such a cost comparison is not a true reflection of the various potential benefits of biofuels. This study aims to evaluate the influence of externalities on the cost performance of various palm oil biodiesel blends (B5, B10 and B100) when internalized into their respective production cost for the case of Thailand. A case study of palm oil biodiesel has been assessed and compared to conventional diesel. An income elasticity of willingness to pay (WTP) was used as multiplier factor to transfer the values of selected environmental damage costs obtained from the Environmental Priority Strategies (EPS) methodology into Thai context. The three key environmental burdens considered in this work include land use, fossil energy resources depletion and air pollutants emissions i.e. CO2, CH4, N2O, CO, NOx, SO2, VOC and PM10. The results obtained indicate that environmental costs contribute to 34% of the total costs of conventional diesel. In comparison to diesel and for the same performance, the total environmental cost of biodiesel based palm methyl ester (PME) is about 3–76% lower depending on the blending levels. This is mainly due to two major advantages that biofuels present which are a reduction in the depletion of fossil energy resources and mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. In terms of net social benefits, the promotion of biodiesel to replace diesel is economically feasible contributing a gain in welfare of about 0.01 and 0.76THBL−1 diesel equivalent for B5 and B10 respectively.},

However it produced a marginal penalty of CO and HC emission when equated with neat nerium oleander biofuel. Subsequently, the nano particle blended emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel depicted dramatic diminution in CO, smoke opacity, HC, and NOx emission when equated with standard fossil diesel, neat nerium oleander biofuel and an emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel at various power outputs.

  abstract = {The energy fuels used for in the Greek transport sector are made up of gasoline consumed by automobiles, diesel oil consumed by taxis, trucks, maritime transport and railroads, and jet fuel used in the aircrafts. All these fuels are hydrocarbons that emit great amounts of CO2 which has a major impact in the global warming phenomenon. The issues relating to climate change, the soaring energy prices, and the uncertainty of future oil supplies, have created a strong interest in alternative transportation fuels. During the past decade biofuels in the form of blended gasoline and biodiesel have begun to find place in energy economy. The Greek car market shows a remarkably low rate in the penetration of biodiesel compared to the average European Union market. This work compares the environmental impacts of the use of gasoline, diesel and biodiesel in Greece using as a tool for the comparison the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The environmental impacts taken into consideration include: organic respiratory effects, inorganic respiratory effects, fossil fuels, acidification – eutrophication, greenhouse effect, ecotoxicity and carginogenic effects. From the environmental point of view, biodiesel appears attractive since its use results in significant reductions of GHG emissions in comparison to gasoline and diesel. It also has lower well-to-wheel emissions of methane. However, the use of biodiesel as transportation fuel increases emissions of PM10, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well as nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous; the latter are the main agents for eutrophication.This study can be considered as an opportunity for further research and evaluate the available options for a sustainable transportation system planning in Greece.},

Drawing on both qualitative and technical data, we discuss such pressures using Brazilian ethanol and biodiesel production. Pressure from international markets to become more economically efficient may contribute towards the erosion of recent schemes to encourage social benefits for small farmers in biodiesel production.

The proposed model minimizes the total costs of biodiesel supply chain from feedstock supply centers to customer centers besides minimizing the environmental impact (EI) of all involved processes under a well-to-wheel perspective. Non-edible feedstocks are considered for biodiesel production. Variable cultivation cost of non-edible feedstock is assumed to be non-linear and dependent upon the amount of cultivated area. New formulation of possibilistic programming method is developed which is able to minimize the total mean and risk values of problems with possibilistic-based uncertainty. To solve the proposed multi-objective model, a hybrid solution approach based on flexible lexicographic and augmented ɛ-constraint methods is proposed which is capable to find appropriate efficient solutions from the Pareto-optimal set. The performance of the proposed possibilistic programming method as well as the developed solution approach are evaluated and validated through conducting a real case study in Iran. The outcome of this study demonstrates that high investment cost is required for improving the environmental impact and risk of sustainable biodiesel supply chain network design under risk. Decision maker preferences are required for suitable trade-off among total costs, risk values and environmental impact.},

  abstract = {Global warming due to excessive use of fossil fuels has driven researchers to focus on sustainable energy sources for the future. For clean production systems, biofuel is expanding the domain of renewable and sustainable energy supplies. An efficient and sustainable supply chain plays a pivotal role in ensuring this supply. In this research, crop residuals in different agricultural zones, transportation for shipment of residual biomass as well as biofuel, multiple biorefineries, and multiple market centers are considered. The expense of the resources, the yield of residual biomass in agricultural zones, and the demand of market centers are represented by fuzzy numbers as they are assumed to be uncertain. The carbon emissions cost at all stages of the supply chain was also incorporated into this model. This objective of this study is to develop a supply chain model that minimizes the total cost of a second generation biofuel supply chain and location-allocation for agricultural zones and biorefineries to meet the uncertain demand for market centers. Two numerical examples are analyzed, and the results proves that the cost of biofuel production in biorefineries contributed 52.16%, which is a major proportion of the total cost. In the entire supply chain, the transportation sector is the foremost source of carbon emissions in an environment with 88.50% of the total carbon emissions. The results confirms that the proposed model is viable for designing second generation biofuel supply chains under uncertainty. Significant managerial insights of this research are also described to better express the efficiency of the model.},

  abstract = {There has been a recent resurgence in research investigating bioenergy production from algal biomass due to the potential environmental benefits in comparison to conventional bioenergy crops and conventional fossil fuels. This life cycle assessment (LCA) considered the energy return and environmental impacts of the cultivation and processing of macroalgae (seaweed) to bioethanol and biogas with a particular focus on specific species (Gracilaria chilensis and Macrocystis pyrifera) and cultivation methods (bottom planting and long-line cultivation). The study was based mainly upon data obtained from research conducted in Chile but the results can be applied to other locations where similar cultivation is feasible. Speculative data were also included to test promising data obtained from research. The results suggested that using base case conditions the production of both bioethanol and biogas from bottom planted Gracilaria chilensis was the most sustainable option due to the low input method of cultivation. Using new advances in cultivation and processing methods of long-line cultivated Macrocystis pyrifera however resulted in a much more sustainable source of bioenergy. If these methods can be proven on a large scale, the generation of bioenergy from macroalgae could be highly competitive in terms of its sustainability compared to alternative feedstocks. Future research should bear in mind that the results of this study should however be considered highly optimistic given the early stage of research.},

Although biological catalysis has not been used for industrial production of biodiesel to date, results from laboratory experiments suggest that it could have distinct advantages over the inorganic route, particularly with regard to a simplified flowsheet for purification and concomitant energy savings. Five flowsheet options have been included in the study to investigate the alkali and enzyme catalysed production routes from rapeseed oil, use of methanol or ethanol for transesterification and the effect of efficiency of alcohol recovery. The LCA shows that the enzymatic production route is environmentally more favourable. Improvements are seen in all impact categories. Global warming, acidification, and photochemical oxidation are reduced by 5%. Certain toxicity levels have more than halved. These results are mainly due to lower steam requirements for heating in the biological process.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the potential production and implications of a global biofuels industry. We develop alternative approaches to consistently introduce land as an economic factor input and in physical terms into a computable general equilibrium framework. The approach allows us to parameterize biomass production consistent with agro-engineering information on yields and a "second generation" cellulosic biomass conversion technology. We explicitly model land conversion from natural areas to agricultural use in two different ways: in one approach we introduced a land supply elasticity based on observed land supply responses and in the other approach we considered only the direct cost of conversion. We estimate biofuels production at the end of the century could reach 221 to 267 EJ in a reference scenario and 319 to 368 EJ under a global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The version with the land supply elasticity allowed much less conversion of land from natural areas, forcing intensification of production, especially on pasture and grazing land, whereas the pure conversion cost model led to significant deforestation. These different approaches emphasize the importance of somehow reflecting the non-market value of land more fully in the conversion decision. The observed land conversion response we estimate may be a short turn response that does not fully reflect the effect of long run pressure to convert land if rent differentials are sustained over 100 years.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of an environmental impact assessment of biodiesel production from soybean in Brazil. In order to achieve this objective, environmental impact indicators provided by Emergy Accounting (EA), Embodied Energy Analysis (EEA) and Material Flow Accounting (MFA) were used. The results showed that for one liter of biodiesel 8.8kg of topsoil are lost in erosion, besides the cost of 0.2kg of fertilizers, about 5.2m2 of crop area, 7.33kg of abiotic materials, 9.0 tons of water and 0.66kg of air and about 0.86kg of CO2 were released. About 0.27kg of crude oil equivalent is required as inputs to produce one liter of biodiesel, which means an energy return of 2.48J of biodiesel per Joule of fossil fuel invested. The transformity of biodiesel (3.90E+05seJJ−1) is higher than those calculated for fossil fuels as other biofuels, indicating a higher demand for direct and indirect environmental support. Similarly, the biodiesel emergy yield ratio (1.62) indicates that a very low net emergy is delivered to consumers, compared to alternatives. Obtained results show that when crop production and industrial conversion to fuel are supported by fossil fuels in the form of chemicals, goods, and process energy, the fraction of fuel that can actually be considered renewable is very low (around 31%).},

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool developed to estimate the impacts of products and services from cradle to grave. Traditionally LCA has focused on environmental impacts, but recently approaches for social life cycle assessment (SLCA) have also been developed. Most of them fairly address social performances of business, but the aim of this paper is to analyse the possibilities and development needs in the complementary approach, which is the evaluation of social impacts in LCA. We review the field in general and take a closer look at the empirical case of biodiesel production, which is a timely topic globally in view of the climate change mitigation objectives. The analysis is carried out at three levels – company, regional, and state level. Despite active development in the field of SLCA, we conclude that in many cases it is not yet possible to carry out a comprehensive SLCA. Finally, we outline lines of research that would further improve the methodological and empirical basis of SLCA at various levels of decision-making.},

  abstract = {The aim of the paper is to present renewable energy market development with particular regard paid to biofuels in the EU. The analysis included data on the share of renewables in Gross Island energy consumption, changes of renewable energy in the years 2004–2016 and the amount of liquid biofuels. The authors of the paper used descriptive and statistical methods to describe the changes in bioenergy development in the European Union (EU). The biggest share of biofuels and renewable waste can be seen in Latvia (31.2%), Finland (26.7%) and Sweden (24.8%). The highest percentage of wind energy in 2015 was found in: Denmark (7.2%), Portugal (4.3%), Ireland (4.0%) and Spain (3.5%). The highest share of solar energy in 2015 was found in Cyprus (3.5%), Spain (2.6%) and Greece (2.2%). The highest contribution of geothermal energy was found in 2015 in Italy (3.5%), Portugal (0.8%) and Slovenia (0,7%). Hydropower was the biggest in 2015 in Sweden (14.2%), Austria (9.6%) and Slovenia (5.0%). The highest coefficients of variation of the share of electricity from renewable energy sources were found in the years 2004–2017 in Malta (140.3%), Cyprus (101.1%) and United Kingdom (71.9%). In addition, the highest coefficients of variation of share of renewable energy sources in heating and cooling in the years 2004–2017 were found in Malta (72.4%), United Kingdom (69.81%) and Hungary (44.91%). Moreover, the highest coefficients of variation of share of renewable energy sources in transport in the years 2004–2017 were found in Finland (113.78%), Malta (115.52%) and Belgium (96.53%). The biggest producers of ethanol and biodiesel in EU were Germany, France and Poland. Cluster analysis data show that Germany and France are of key importance in the production of biodiesel and ethanol. The biodiesel production increased in the years 2003–2017 from 719,32 million liters to 13323 million liters (increase 1852.2%). However, in the years 2014–2017 a stagnation in biofuel production was observed from 13673 million liters to 13323 million liters (−2,56%). The situation on the market and the increasing demand for green energy suggest that the production of ethanol and esters of vegetable oils will increase by 2030, which will contribute to the development of this sector.},

Research has highlighted the ambiguity of these claims across various dimensions and scales, focusing on ethanol-producing or oilseed crops in agricultural lands or Jatropha-type crops on common lands. We studied the agronomic and economic viability and livelihood impacts of Jatropha curcas plantations on private farms in Tamil Nadu, India. We found that Jatropha yields are much lower than expected and its cultivation is currently unviable, and even its potential viability is strongly determined by water access. On the whole, the crop impoverishes farmers, particularly the poorer and socially backward farmers. Jatropha cultivation therefore not only fails to alleviate poverty, but its aggressive and misguided promotion will generate conflict between the state and the farmers, between different socio-economic classes and even within households. The water demands of the crop can potentially exacerbate the conflicts and competition over water access in Tamil Nadu villages.},

Previous authors have devoted considerable attention to the impacts of these policies on a country-by-country basis. However, there are also strong interactions among these programs, as they compete in world markets for feedstocks and ultimately for a limited supply of global land. In this paper, we offer the first global assessment of biofuel programs - focusing particularly on the EU and US. We begin with an historical analysis of the period 2001-2006, which also permits us to validate the model. We then conduct an ex ante analysis of mandates in the year 2015. We find that if these mandates are indeed fulfilled the impact on global land use could be substantial, with potentially significant implications for greenhouse gas emissions.},

Results show that the supercritical methanol process using propane as co-solvent is the most environmentally favorable alternative. Its smaller steam consumption in comparison with the other process design alternatives leads to a lower contribution to the potential environmental impacts (PEI’s). The acid-catalyzed process generally shows the highest PEI’s, in particular due to the high energy requirements associated with methanol recovery operations.},

  abstract = {An ever increasing drift of energy consumption, unequal geographical distribution of natural wealth and the quest for low carbon fuel for a cleaner environment are sparking off the production and use of biodiesels in many countries around the globe. In this work, palm biodiesel and jatropha biodiesel were produced from the respective crude vegetable oils through transesterification, and the different physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesels have been presented, and found to be acceptable according to the ASTM standard of biodiesel specification. This paper presents experimental results of the research carried out to evaluate the BSFC, engine power, exhaust and noise emission characteristics of a combined palm and jatropha blend in a single-cylinder diesel engine at different engine speeds ranging from 1400 to 2200 rpm. Though the PBJB5 and PBJB10 biodiesels showed a slightly higher BSFC than diesel fuel, all the measured emission parameters and noise emission were significantly reduced, except for NO emission. CO emissions for PBJB5 and PBJB10 were 9.53% and 20.49% lower than for diesel fuel. By contrast, HC emissions for PBJB5 and PBJB10 were 3.69% and 7.81% lower than for diesel fuel. The sound levels produced by PBJB5 and PBJB10 were also reduced by 2.5% and 5% compared with diesel fuel due to their lubricity and damping characteristics.},

  abstract = {Biodiesel is one of the potential alternative energy sources that can be derived from renewable and low-grade origin through different processes. One of the processes is alcoholysis or transesterification in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The catalyst can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. This article reviews various catalysts used for biodiesel production to date, presents the state of the art of types of catalysts, and compares their suitability and associated challenges in the transesterification process. Biodiesel production using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis has been studied extensively, and novel heterogeneous catalysts are being continuously investigated. Homogeneous catalysts are generally efficient in converting biodiesel with low free fatty acid (FFA) and water containing single-origin feedstock. Heterogeneous catalysts, on the other hand, provide superior activity, range of selectivity, good FFA, and water adaptability. The quantity and strengths of active acid or basic sites control these properties. Some of the heterogeneous catalysts such as zirconia and zeolite-based catalysts can be used as both basic and acidic catalyst by suitable alteration. Heterogeneous catalysts from waste and biocatalysts play an essential role in attaining a sustainable alternative to traditional homogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production. Recently, high catalytic efficiency at mild operating conditions has drawn attention to nanocatalysts. This review evaluates state of the art and perspectives for catalytic biodiesel production and assesses the critical operational variables that influence biodiesel production along with the technological solutions for sustainable implementation of the process.},

Biofuel tax credits always reduce fuel prices. Tax credits result in lower fuel prices than under a mandate for the same level of biofuel production. If tax credits are implemented alongside mandates, then tax credits subsidize fuel consumption instead of biofuels. This contradicts energy policy goals by increasing oil dependency, CO 2 emissions, and traffic congestion, while providing little benefit to either corn or ethanol producers. These social costs will be substantial with tax credits costing taxpayers $28.7 billion annually by 2022.},

The optimum values of the methanol-to-oil molar ratio, potassium hydroxide catalyst concentration, and reaction time predicted by the ANN-ACO model are 37%, 0.78 wt%, and 153 min, respectively, at a constant reaction temperature and stirring speed of 60 °C and 1000 rpm, respectively. The ANN-ACO model was validated by performing independent experiments to produce the CI40CP60 methyl ester (CICPME) using the optimum transesterification process variables predicted by the ANN-ACO model. There is very good agreement between the average CICPME yield determined from experiments (95.18%) and the maximum CICPME yield predicted by the ANN-ACO model (95.87%) for the same optimum values of process variables, which corresponds to a difference of 0.69%. Even though the ANN-ACO model is only implemented to optimize the transesterification of process variables in this study. It is believed that the model can be used to optimize other biodiesel production processes such as seed oil extraction and acid-catalyzed esterification for various types of biodiesels and biodiesel blends.},

Government mandates are superior to consumption subsidies, especially with suboptimal fuel taxes and the higher costs involved with raising tax revenues. But subsidies with mandates cause adverse interaction effects; oil consumption is subsidized instead. This unique result also applies to renewable electricity that faces similar policy combinations. Ethanol policy can have a significant impact on corn prices; if not, inefficiency costs rise sharply. Ethanol policy can increase the inefficiency of farm subsidies and vice‐versa. Policies that discriminate against trade, such as production subsidies and tariffs, can more than offset any benefits of a mandate. Sustainability standards are ineffective and illegal according to the WTO, and so should be re‐designed.},

A simple and reproducible hierarchically porous core-shell CaSO4/Fe2O3-SiO2 material with controllable core morphology was developed. The materials with a well mesoporous structure were prepared by ethanol/H2O media using NaNO3 as the etchant to construct the co-valent bond in Fe2O3 framework, and the CH3COONa was an electrostatic supporter and subordinate reducing agent under mild. Solvothermal conditions. The morphology, porosity and conjugated structure of CaSO4/Fe2O3-SiO2 were measured systematically. The materials of CaSO4/Fe2O3-SiO2 showed remarkable performance in biodiesel production with crude Jatropha curcus and methanol. At suitable state, the biodiesel production reached 94%. Furthermore, the material was easily dispersed in the reaction system, quickly separated from the reaction products without using centrifugation or filtration, and satisfactory catalytic activity maintained after being recycled nine. Controlling the interaction among the active phases of core shell structure might boost structural stability of the material. In addition, the performance was compared with several forms of material in the case of biodiesel production. Therefore, the data are remarkable for offering a new juncture for the fabrication of novel and eco-friendly procedure of hierarchically porous material in the potential biodiesel production. Moreover, the easy separation of material from process fluid and the safe handling were the main impacts to imply the CaSO4/Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell material for biodiesel production.},

  abstract = {Global warming issue due to the combustion of fossil fuel pushes the world to produce renewable and environmental friendly fuel from sustainable feedstock. There are several measures on different levels to reduce the global warming including clean energies from wind, solar, and biomass. There are different aspects in bringing these technologies into a reality including development of technology, economic feasibilities, environmental sustainability and finally, support from the government in the form of effective policies and public awareness. Adequate R&D efforts could overcome all the factors but only an effective policy could drive those efforts to reality. Therefore, in this connection this review initially addresses the present state of energy demand, progression of biofuel sources and the bottlenecks in microalgal biofuel production and commercialization. The biofuel policies are essential to change the world's dependence on fossil fuels for a better tomorrow. Hence, this review addresses the salient features of National Biofuel Policy of India that helps in regulating the biofuels production and their marketing. As a part of Policy implementation, government of India introduced several schemes and programs in last two-decades, which includes mandate blending of ethanol with gasoline, diesel with biodiesel, for the future clean energy vision, and incentivizing bio-based products/fuels. In addition, participation of both federal and state governments for clean energy initiatives, capital investments and tax credits were described in detail. Many policies lack easy outreach among public and industries, which needs marketing by the government that secures a clean energy future in India.

  abstract = {Biodiesel is envisaged as environmentally benign fuel due to its unique properties, such as biodegradability, renewability and non-toxicity. Its utilisation leads to the reduction of sulphur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions as it produces quite lower amounts of carbon and sulphur based gases in comparison to conventional fossil fuels. This paper is a review of the recent achievements of the cleaner intensification technologies for biodiesel production. Merits and limitations of the cleaner intensification technologies have been discussed. Mechanical stirring via transesterification is the most common and extensively utilised for biodiesel production. It involves the conversion of oil to glycerol and acid alkyl ester while employing methanol. However, this process has an inherent drawback of mass transfer resistance resulting in a lower reaction rate and higher production cost. Intensification technologies have become more attractive to overcome these aforementioned problems. In a bid to increase the cost competitiveness of biodiesel production compared to diesel fuel, process intensification has been studied for numerous biodiesel processing technologies. Many researchers have resorted to several intensification technologies namely; microwave, ultrasonic cavitation and hydrodynamic cavitation reactor to eliminate the mass transfer resistance of immiscible reactants. Once the mass transfer resistance is reduced, it may lead to a shorter reaction time and lower energy consumptions compared to mechanical stirring. Recent studies reveal that microwave and ultrasonic cavitation techniques are not yet completely feasible for biodiesel production at industrial scale. On the other hand, it was found that hydrodynamic cavitation offers a number of advantages over other intensification technologies. It shows good performance with respect to product yield, reaction time, energy consumption and product quality. Furthermore, it exhibits a sustainable mean for energy recovery from renewable oils. It was concluded that more studies are needed to extend the existing information of hydrodynamic cavitation for the design of the plate geometry with respect to the methyl ester conversion. This will help to develop a sustainable and industrially viable route for energy recovery from renewable oils. Yield efficiency in relation to the method followed the order: hydrodynamic cavitation > microwave > ultrasonic cavitation > mechanical stirring.},

This paper aims to contribute to the conceptual and methodological basis of the (technological) innovation systems approach. We propose an alteration that improves the analysis of dynamics, especially with respect to emerging innovation systems. We do this by expanding on the technological innovation systems and system functions literature, and by employing the method of ‘event history analysis’. By mapping events, the interactions between system functions and their development over time can be analysed. Based on this it becomes possible to identify forms of positive feedback, i.e. cumulative causation. As an illustration of the approach, we assess the biofuels innovation system in The Netherlands as it evolved from 1990 to 2007.},

Our results generally show that technological capabilities and environmental regulation spur innovative activities in the biofuels sector. Both demand-pull and technology-push factors are found to be important drivers of innovation in the biofuels sector. However, technology exploitation activities in first generation technologies are found to be mainly driven by quantity and price-based demand-pull policies. On the contrary, the pace of technology exploration efforts in advanced generation biofuels is shown to react positively to price-based demand-pull incentives but also to technology-push policy. The clear diversity in the impact of different public support instruments provides new insights which fuel discussion on the optimal policy mix debate and offers new elements for the design of future policy strategies.},

Therefore, transformation of polluting gas fluxes into new and valuable products is feasible. In addition, bulk applications such as wastewater treatment and biofuels production can be coupled. Finally, microalgae biomass can be also used for the production of valuable compounds such as pigments, food supplements for both humans and animals, and fertilizers. In this review, flue gas emissions coupled to microalgae cultures are described. In addition, since microalgae can produce energy, the biorefinery concept is also reviewed.},

The bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts show improved transesterification activities.

Moreover, the bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst shows substantial chemical stability and could be reused for at least eight times without major loss in its catalytic activity.

It can be concluded that biodiesel by supercritical transesterification can be scaled up resulting high purity of methyl esters (99.8%) and almost pure glycerol (96.4%) attained as by-product.The economic assessment of the biodiesel plant shows that biodiesel can be sold at US$ 0.17/l (125,000tonnes/year), US$ 0.24/l (80,000tonnes/year) and US$ 0.52/l for the smallest capacity (8000tonnes/year).The sensitive key factors for the economic feasibility of the plant are: raw material price, plant capacity, glycerol price and capital cost.Overall conclusion is that the process can compete with the existing alkali and acid catalyzed processes.Especially for the conversion of waste cooking oil to biodiesel, the supercritical process is an interesting technical and economical alternative.},

  abstract = {With increasing use of biomass for energy, questions arise about the validity of bioenergy as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology able to reveal these environmental and energy performances, but results may differ even for apparently similar bioenergy systems. Differences are due to several reasons: type and management of raw materials, conversion technologies, end-use technologies, system boundaries and reference energy system with which the bioenergy chain is compared. Based on review of published papers and elaboration of software data concerning greenhouse gas and energy balances of bioenergy, other renewable and conventional fossil systems, this paper discusses key issues in bioenergy system LCA. These issues have a strong influence on the final results but are often overlooked or mishandled in most of the studies available in literature. The article addresses the following aspects: recognition of the biomass carbon cycle, including carbon stock changes in biomass and soil over time; inclusion of nitrous oxide and methane emissions from agricultural activities; selection of the appropriate fossil reference system; homogeneity of the input parameters in Life Cycle Inventories; influence of the allocation procedure when multiple products are involved; future trends in bioenergy (i.e. second-generation biofuels and biorefineries).Because many key issues are site-specific, and many factors affect the outcome, it is not possible to give exact values for the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and fossil energy consumption saved by a certain bioenergy product, because too many uncertainties are involved. For these reasons, the results are here provided as a means of wide ranges. Despite this wide range of results, it has been possible to draw some important conclusions and devise recommendations concerning the existing bioenergy systems, and some emerging implications about the future deployment and trends of bioenergy products are pointed out.},

Following intravenous administration, PT-cAu-TNF rapidly accumulates in MC-38 colon carcinoma tumors and shows little to no accumulation in the livers, spleens (i.e., the RES) or other healthy organs of the animals. The tumor accumulation was evidenced by a marked change in the color of the tumor as it acquired the bright red/purple color of the colloidal gold sol and was coincident with the active and tumor-specific sequestration of TNF. Finally, PT-cAu-TNF was less toxic and more effective in reducing tumor burden than native TNF since maximal antitumor responses were achieved at lower doses of drug.},

The observed rapid blood clearance and half-life (3 h) of f-SWNT has major implications for all potential clinical uses of CNT. Moreover, urine excretion studies using both f-SWNT and functionalized multiwalled CNT followed by electron microscopy analysis of urine samples revealed that both types of nanotubes were excreted as intact nanotubes.

Functionalization of SWNTs by branched polyethylene-glycol (PEG) chains was developed, enabling thus far the longest SWNT blood circulation up to 1 day, relatively low uptake in the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and near-complete clearance from the main organs in approximately 2 months. Raman spectroscopy detected SWNT in the intestine, feces, kidney, and bladder of mice, suggesting excretion and clearance of SWNTs from mice via the biliary and renal pathways. No toxic side effect of SWNTs to mice was observed in necropsy, histology, and blood chemistry measurements. These findings pave the way to future biomedical applications of carbon nanotubes.},

  abstract = {Nanoparticles have been proposed as carriers for drugs, genes and therapies to treat various diseases1,2. Many strategies have been developed to target nanomaterials to specific or over-expressed receptors in diseased cells, and these typically involve functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with proteins, antibodies or other biomolecules. Here, we show that the targeting ability of such functionalized nanoparticles may disappear when they are placed in a biological environment. Using transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles, we found that proteins in the media can shield transferrin from binding to both its targeted receptors on cells and soluble transferrin receptors. Although nanoparticles continue to enter cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin is lost. Our results suggest that when nanoparticles are placed in a complex biological environment, interaction with other proteins in the medium and the formation of a protein corona3,4 can ‘screen’ the targeting molecules on the surface of nanoparticles and cause loss of specificity in targeting.},

We found that NP mean volumetric size correlates linearly with polymer concentration for NPs between 70 and 250 nm in diameter (linear coefficient=0.99 for NPs formulated with solvents studied). NPs with desirable size, drug loading, and polydispersity were conjugated to the A10 RNA aptamer (Apt) that binds to the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and NP and NP-Apt biodistribution was evaluated in a LNCaP (PSMA+) xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer. The surface functionalization of NPs with the A10 PSMA Apt significantly enhanced delivery of NPs to tumors vs. equivalent NPs lacking the A10 PSMA Apt (a 3.77-fold increase at 24h; NP-Apt 0.83%+/-0.21% vs. NP 0.22%+/-0.07% of injected dose per gram of tissue; mean+/-SD, n=4, p=0.002).

Mice receiving nanoparticles containing a dominant peanut allergen gene (pCMVArah2) produced secretory IgA and serum IgG2a. Compared with non-immunized mice or mice treated with 'naked' DNA, mice immunized with nanoparticles showed a substantial reduction in allergen-induced anaphylaxis associated with reduced levels of IgE, plasma histamine and vascular leakage.

Current agents impose serious limitations on medical imaging: short imaging times, the need for catheterization in many cases, occasional renal toxicity, and poor contrast in large patients. This report is the first demonstration that gold nanoparticles may overcome these limitations. Gold has higher absorption than iodine with less bone and tissue interference achieving better contrast with lower X-ray dose. Nanoparticles clear the blood more slowly than iodine agents, permitting longer imaging times. Gold nanoparticles, 1.9 nm in diameter, were injected intravenously into mice and images recorded over time with a standard mammography unit. Gold biodistribution was measured by atomic absorption. Retention in liver and spleen was low with elimination by the kidneys. Organs such as kidneys and tumours were seen with unusual clarity and high spatial resolution. Blood vessels less than 100 microm in diameter were delineated, thus enabling in vivo vascular casting. Regions of increased vascularization and angiogenesis could be distinguished. With 10 mg Au ml(-1) initially in the blood, mouse behaviour was unremarkable and neither blood plasma analytes nor organ histology revealed any evidence of toxicity 11 days and 30 days after injection. Gold nanoparticles can be used as X-ray contrast agents with properties that overcome some significant limitations of iodine-based agents.},

  abstract = {Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its "synthetic identity", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct "biological identity". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials.},

  abstract = {Titanium dioxide is a common additive in many food, personal care, and other consumer products used by people, which after use can enter the sewage system and, subsequently, enter the environment as treated effluent discharged to surface waters or biosolids applied to agricultural land, incinerated wastes, or landfill solids. This study quantifies the amount of titanium in common food products, derives estimates of human exposure to dietary (nano-) TiO(2), and discusses the impact of the nanoscale fraction of TiO(2) entering the environment. The foods with the highest content of TiO(2) included candies, sweets, and chewing gums. Among personal care products, toothpastes and select sunscreens contained 1% to >10% titanium by weight. While some other crèmes contained titanium, despite being colored white, most shampoos, deodorants, and shaving creams contained the lowest levels of titanium (<0.01 μg/mg). For several high-consumption pharmaceuticals, the titanium content ranged from below the instrument detection limit (0.0001 μg Ti/mg) to a high of 0.014 μg Ti/mg. Electron microscopy and stability testing of food-grade TiO(2) (E171) suggests that approximately 36% of the particles are less than 100 nm in at least one dimension and that it readily disperses in water as fairly stable colloids. However, filtration of water solubilized consumer products and personal care products indicated that less than 5% of the titanium was able to pass through 0.45 or 0.7 μm pores. Two white paints contained 110 μg Ti/mg while three sealants (i.e., prime coat paint) contained less titanium (25 to 40 μg Ti/mg). This research showed that, while many white-colored products contained titanium, it was not a prerequisite. Although several of these product classes contained low amounts of titanium, their widespread use and disposal down the drain and eventually to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) deserves attention. A Monte Carlo human exposure analysis to TiO(2) through foods identified children as having the highest exposures because TiO(2) content of sweets is higher than other food products and that a typical exposure for a US adult may be on the order of 1 mg Ti per kilogram body weight per day. Thus, because of the millions of tons of titanium-based white pigment used annually, testing should focus on food-grade TiO(2) (E171) rather than that adopted in many environmental health and safety tests (i.e., P25), which is used in much lower amounts in products less likely to enter the environment (e.g., catalyst supports, photocatalytic coatings).},

Coumarin-6 loaded PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by a modified solvent extraction/evaporation method and characterized by laser light scattering for size and size distribution, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for surface morphology, zeta-potential for surface charge, and spectrofluorometry for fluorescent molecule release from the nanoparticles. The effects of particle size and particle surface coating on the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles were quantified by spectrofluorometric measurement. Cellular uptake of vitamin E TPGS-coated PLGA nanoparticles showed 1.4 folds higher than that of PVA-coated PLGA nanoparticles and 4-6 folds higher than that of nude polystyrene nanoparticles. Images of confocal laser scanning microscopy, cryo-SEM and transmission electron microscopy clearly evidenced the internalization of nanoparticles by the Caco-2 cells, showing that surface modification of PLGA nanoparticles with vitamin E TPGS notably improved the cellular uptake.

  abstract = {Although nanotechnology has vast potential in uses such as fuel cells, microreactors, drug delivery devices, and personal care products, it is prudent to determine possible toxicity of nanotechnology-derived products before widespread use. It is likely that nanomaterials can affect wildlife if they are accidentally released into the environment. The fullerenes are one type of manufactured nanoparticle that is being produced by tons each year, and initially uncoated fullerenes can be modified with biocompatible coatings. Fullerenes are lipophilic and localize into lipid-rich regions such as cell membranes in vitro, and they are redox active. Other nano-sized particles and soluble metals have been shown to selectively translocate into the brain via the olfactory bulb in mammals and fish. Fullerenes (C60) can form aqueous suspended colloids (nC60); the question arises of whether a redox-active, lipophilic molecule could cause oxidative damage in an aquatic species. The goal of this study was to investigate oxyradical-induced lipid and protein damage, as well as impacts on total glutathione (GSH) levels, in largemouth bass exposed to nC60. Significant lipid peroxidation was found in brains of largemouth bass after 48 hr of exposure to 0.5 ppm uncoated nC60. GSH was also marginally depleted in gills of fish, and nC60 increased water clarity, possibly due to bactericidal activity. This is the first study showing that uncoated fullerenes can cause oxidative damage and depletion of GSH in vivo in an aquatic species. Further research needs to be done to evaluate the potential toxicity of manufactured nanomaterials, especially with respect to translocation into the brain.},

This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future.},

Bacteriological test data, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, and electron microscopy (TEM) images are provided, which yield insight into the biocidal action of these nanoscale materials. The tests show that these materials are very effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as spores. ζ-Potential measurements show an attractive interaction between the MgO nanoparticles and bacteria and spore cells, which is confirmed by confocal microscopy images. The AFM studies illustrate considerable changes in the cell membranes upon treatment, resulting in the death of the cells. TEM micrographs confirm these results and supply additional information about the processes inside the cells. Overall, the results presented illustrate that dry powder nanoparticulate formulations as well as water slurries are effective. It is proposed that abrasiveness, basic character, electrostatic attraction, and oxidizing power (due to the presence of active halogen) combine to promote these biocidal properties.},

In this study, we address the issue of cytotoxicity and immunogenic effects of gold nanoparticles on RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The cytotoxicity of gold nanoparticles has been correlated with a detailed study of their endocytotic uptake using various microscopy tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal-laser-scanning microscopy (CFLSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our findings suggest that Au(0) nanoparticles are not cytotoxic, reduce the production of reactive oxygen and nitrite species, and do not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL1-beta, making them suitable candidates for nanomedicine. AFM measurements suggest that gold nanoparticles are internalized inside the cell via a mechanism involving pinocytosis, while CFLSM and TEM studies indicate their internalization in lysosomal bodies arranged in perinuclear fashion. Our studies thus underline the noncytotoxic, nonimmunogenic, and biocompatible properties of gold nanoparticles with the potential for application in nanoimmunology, nanomedicine, and nanobiotechnology.},

  abstract = {Nanoparticles possessing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains on their surface have been described as blood persistent drug delivery system with potential applications for intravenous drug administration. Considering the importance of protein interactions with injected colloidal dug carriers with regard to their in vivo fate, we analysed plasma protein adsorption onto biodegradable PEG-coated poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(varepsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). A series of corona/core nanoparticles of sizes 160-270 nm were prepared from diblock PEG-PLA, PEG-PLGA and PEG-PCL and from PEG-PLA:PLA blends. The PEG Mw was varied from 2000-20000 g/mole and the particles were prepared using different PEG contents. It was thus possible to study the influence of the PEG corona thickness and density, as well as the influence of the nature of the core (PLA, PLGA or PCL), on the competitive plasma protein adsorption, zeta potential and particle uptake by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. 2-D PAGE studies showed that plasma protein adsorption on PEG-coated PLA nanospheres strongly depends on the PEG molecular weight (Mw) (i.e. PEG chain length at the particle surface) as well as on the PEG content in the particles (i.e. PEG chain density at the surface of the particles). Whatever the thickness or the density of the corona, the qualitative composition of the plasma protein adsorption patterns was very similar, showing that adsorption was governed by interaction with a PLA surface protected more or less by PEG chains. The main spots on the gels were albumin, fibrinogen, IgG, Ig light chains, and the apolipoproteins apoA-I and apoE. For particles made of PEG-PLA45K with different PEG Mw, a maximal reduction in protein adsorption was found for a PEG Mw of 5000 g/mole. For nanospheres differing in their PEG content from 0.5 to 20 wt %, a PEG content between 2 and 5 wt % was determined as a threshold value for optimal protein resistance. When increasing the PEG content in the nanoparticles above 5 wt % no further reduction in protein adsorption was achieved. Phagocytosis by PMN studied using chemiluminescence and zeta potential data agreed well with these findings: the same PEG surface density threshold was found to ensure simultaneously efficient steric stabilization and to avoid the uptake by PMN cells. Supposing all the PEG chains migrate to the surface, this would correspond to a distance of about 1.5 nm between two terminally attached PEG chains in the covering 'brush'. Particles from PEG5K-PLA45K, PEG5K-PLGA45K and PEG5K-PCL45K copolymers enabled to study the influence of the core on plasma protein adsorption, all other parameters (corona thickness and density) being kept constant. Adsorption patterns were in good qualitative agreement with each other. Only a few protein species were exclusively present just on one type of nanoparticle. However, the extent of proteins adsorbed differed in a large extent from one particle to another. In vivo studies could help elucidating the role of the type and amount of proteins adsorbed on the fate of the nanoparticles after intraveinous administration, as a function of the nature of their core. These results could be useful in the design of long circulating intravenously injectable biodegradable drug carriers endowed with protein resistant properties and low phagocytic uptake.},

Nanoparticles are thought to have potential as novel intravascular probes for both diagnostic (e.g., imaging) and therapeutic purposes (e.g., drug delivery). Critical issues for successful nanoparticle delivery include the ability to target specific tissues and cell types and escape from the biological particulate filter known as the reticuloendothelial system. We set out to explore the feasibility of in vivo targeting by using semiconductor quantum dots (qdots). Qdots are small (<10 nm) inorganic nanocrystals that possess unique luminescent properties; their fluorescence emission is stable and tuned by varying the particle size or composition. We show that ZnS-capped CdSe qdots coated with a lung-targeting peptide accumulate in the lungs of mice after i.v. injection, whereas two other peptides specifically direct qdots to blood vessels or lymphatic vessels in tumors. We also show that adding polyethylene glycol to the qdot coating prevents nonselective accumulation of qdots in reticuloendothelial tissues. These results encourage the construction of more complex nanostructures with capabilities such as disease sensing and drug delivery.},

All the polymer micelles penetrated highly permeable tumours in mice, but only the 30 nm micelles could penetrate poorly permeable pancreatic tumours to achieve an antitumour effect. We also showed that the penetration and efficacy of the larger micelles could be enhanced by using a transforming growth factor-β inhibitor to increase the permeability of the tumours.},

NPs with high surface charge and large particle size were phagocytized more efficiently by murine macrophage. Slight particle size and surface charge differences and different cell lines had significant implications in the cellular uptake of NPs, and various mechanisms were involved in the uptake process. In vivo biodistribution suggested that NPs with slight negative charges and particle size of 150 nm were tended to accumulate in tumor more efficiently. These results could serve as a guideline in the rational design of drug nanocarriers with maximized therapeutic efficacy and predictable in vivo properties, in which the control of particle size and surface charge was of significance.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: ABI-007, the first biologically interactive albumin-bound paclitaxel in a nanameter particle, free of solvents, was compared with polyethylated castor oil-based standard paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III study was performed to confirm preclinical studies demonstrating superior efficacy and reduced toxicity of ABI-007 compared with standard paclitaxel.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to 3-week cycles of either ABI-007 260 mg/m(2) intravenously without premedication (n = 229) or standard paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) intravenously with premedication (n = 225).
RESULTS: ABI-007 demonstrated significantly higher response rates compared with standard paclitaxel (33% v 19%, respectively; P = .001) and significantly longer time to tumor progression (23.0 v 16.9 weeks, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.75; P = .006). The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia was significantly lower for ABI-007 compared with standard paclitaxel (9% v 22%, respectively; P < .001) despite a 49% higher paclitaxel dose. Febrile neutropenia was uncommon (< 2%), and the incidence did not differ between the two study arms. Grade 3 sensory neuropathy was more common in the ABI-007 arm than in the standard paclitaxel arm (10% v 2%, respectively; P < .001) but was easily managed and improved rapidly (median, 22 days). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred with ABI-007 despite the absence of premedication and shorter administration time.
CONCLUSION: ABI-007 demonstrated greater efficacy and a favorable safety profile compared with standard paclitaxel in this patient population. The improved therapeutic index and elimination of corticosteroid premedication required for solvent-based taxanes make the novel albumin-bound paclitaxel ABI-007 an important advance in the treatment of MBC.},

Using prostate cancer as a model, we report docetaxel (Dtxl)-encapsulated nanoparticles formulated with biocompatible and biodegradable poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-b-PEG) copolymer and surface functionalized with the A10 2'-fluoropyrimidine RNA aptamers that recognize the extracellular domain of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a well characterized antigen expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells. These Dtxl-encapsulated nanoparticle-aptamer bioconjugates (Dtxl-NP-Apt) bind to the PSMA protein expressed on the surface of LNCaP prostate epithelial cells and get taken up by these cells resulting in significantly enhanced in vitro cellular toxicity as compared with nontargeted nanoparticles that lack the PSMA aptamer (Dtxl-NP) (P < 0.0004). The Dtxl-NP-Apt bioconjugates also exhibit remarkable efficacy and reduced toxicity as measured by mean body weight loss (BWL) in vivo [body weight loss of 7.7 +/- 4% vs. 18 +/- 5% for Dtxl-NP-Apt vs. Dtxl-NP at nadir, respectively (mean +/- SD); n = 7]. After a single intratumoral injection of Dtxl-NP-Apt bioconjugates, complete tumor reduction was observed in five of seven LNCaP xenograft nude mice (initial tumor volume of approximately 300 mm3), and 100% of these animals survived our 109-day study. In contrast, two of seven mice in the Dtxl-NP group had complete tumor reduction with 109-day survivability of only 57%. Dtxl alone had a survivability of only 14%. Saline and nanoparticles without drug were similarly nonefficacious. This report demonstrates the potential utility of nanoparticle-aptamer bioconjugates for a therapeutic application.},

We studied the stimuli-responsive release profiles of vancomycin- and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-loaded MSN delivery systems by using disulfide bond-reducing molecules, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and mercaptoethanol (ME), as release triggers. The biocompatibility and delivery efficiency of the MSN system with neuroglial cells (astrocytes) in vitro were demonstrated. In contrast to many current delivery systems, the molecules of interest were encapsulated inside the porous framework of the MSN not by adsorption or sol-gel types of entrapment but by capping the openings of the mesoporous channels with size-defined CdS nanoparticles to physically block the drugs/neurotransmitters of certain sizes from leaching out. We envision that this new MSN system could play a significant role in developing new generations of site-selective, controlled-release delivery nanodevices.},

Mechanically active "organ-on-a-chip" microdevices that reconstitute tissue-tissue interfaces critical to organ function may therefore expand the capabilities of cell culture models and provide low-cost alternatives to animal and clinical studies for drug screening and toxicology applications.},

In rodents, filomicelles persisted in the circulation up to one week after intravenous injection. This is about ten times longer than their spherical counterparts and is more persistent than any known synthetic nanoparticle. Under fluid flow conditions, spheres and short filomicelles are taken up by cells more readily than longer filaments because the latter are extended by the flow. Preliminary results further demonstrate that filomicelles can effectively deliver the anticancer drug paclitaxel and shrink human-derived tumours in mice. Although these findings show that long-circulating vehicles need not be nanospheres, they also lend insight into possible shape effects of natural filamentous viruses.},

  abstract = {Triangular silver nanoparticles ( approximately 100 nm wide and 50 nm high) have remarkable optical properties. In particular, the peak extinction wavelength, lambda(max) of their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum is unexpectedly sensitive to nanoparticle size, shape, and local ( approximately 10-30 nm) external dielectric environment. This sensitivity of the LSPR lambda(max) to the nanoenvironment has allowed us to develop a new class of nanoscale affinity biosensors. The essential characteristics and operational principles of these LSPR nanobiosensors will be illustrated using the well-studied biotin-streptavidin system. Exposure of biotin-functionalized Ag nanotriangles to 100 nM streptavidin (SA) caused a 27.0 nm red-shift in the LSPR lambda(max). The LSPR lambda(max) shift, DeltaR/DeltaR(max), versus [SA] response curve was measured over the concentration range 10(-)(15) M < [SA] < 10(-)(6) M. Comparison of the data with the theoretical normalized response expected for 1:1 binding of a ligand to a multivalent receptor with different sites but invariant affinities yielded approximate values for the saturation response, DeltaR(max) = 26.5 nm, and the surface-confined thermodynamic binding constant K(a,surf) = 10(11) M(-)(1). At present, the limit of detection (LOD) for the LSPR nanobiosensor is found to be in the low-picomolar to high-femtomolar region. A strategy to amplify the response of the LSPR nanobiosensor using biotinylated Au colloids and thereby further improve the LOD is demonstrated. Several control experiments were performed to define the LSPR nanobiosensor's response to nonspecific binding as well as to demonstrate its response to the specific binding of another protein. These include the following: (1) electrostatic binding of SA to a nonbiotinylated surface, (2) nonspecific interactions of prebiotinylated SA to a biotinylated surface, (3) nonspecific interactions of bovine serum albumin to a biotinylated surface, and (4) specific binding of anti-biotin to a biotinylated surface. The LSPR nanobiosensor provides a pathway to ultrasensitive biodetection experiments with extremely simple, small, light, robust, low-cost instrumentation that will greatly facilitate field-portable environmental or point-of-service medical diagnostic applications.},

Here we show that large optical enhancements can be achieved under in vivo conditions for tumor detection in live animals. An important finding is that small-molecule Raman reporters such as organic dyes were not displaced but were stabilized by thiol-modified polyethylene glycols. These pegylated SERS nanoparticles were considerably brighter than semiconductor quantum dots with light emission in the near-infrared window. When conjugated to tumor-targeting ligands such as single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) antibodies, the conjugated nanoparticles were able to target tumor biomarkers such as epidermal growth factor receptors on human cancer cells and in xenograft tumor models.},

  abstract = {Due to their small size, nanoparticles have distinct properties compared with the bulk form of the same materials. These properties are rapidly revolutionizing many areas of medicine and technology. Despite the remarkable speed of development of nanoscience, relatively little is known about the interaction of nanoscale objects with living systems. In a biological fluid, proteins associate with nanoparticles, and the amount and presentation of the proteins on the surface of the particles leads to an in vivo response. Proteins compete for the nanoparticle "surface," leading to a protein "corona" that largely defines the biological identity of the particle. Thus, knowledge of rates, affinities, and stoichiometries of protein association with, and dissociation from, nanoparticles is important for understanding the nature of the particle surface seen by the functional machinery of cells. Here we develop approaches to study these parameters and apply them to plasma and simple model systems, albumin and fibrinogen. A series of copolymer nanoparticles are used with variation of size and composition (hydrophobicity). We show that isothermal titration calorimetry is suitable for studying the affinity and stoichiometry of protein binding to nanoparticles. We determine the rates of protein association and dissociation using surface plasmon resonance technology with nanoparticles that are thiol-linked to gold, and through size exclusion chromatography of protein-nanoparticle mixtures. This method is less perturbing than centrifugation, and is developed into a systematic methodology to isolate nanoparticle-associated proteins. The kinetic and equilibrium binding properties depend on protein identity as well as particle surface characteristics and size.},

We employ a top-down particle fabrication technique called PRINT that is able to generate uniform populations of organic micro- and nanoparticles with complete control of size, shape, and surface chemistry. Evidence of particle internalization was obtained by using conventional biological techniques and transmission electron microscopy. These findings suggest that HeLa cells readily internalize nonspherical particles with dimensions as large as 3 mum by using several different mechanisms of endocytosis. Moreover, it was found that rod-like particles enjoy an appreciable advantage when it comes to internalization rates, reminiscent of the advantage that many rod-like bacteria have for internalization in nonphagocytic cells.},

Based on this finding, we have developed a novel immunoassay in which antibody-modified magnetite nanoparticles provide three functions: capture, separation and detection.

Its applications are limited, however, because to realize a substantial Raman signal requires metal substrates that either have roughened surfaces or take the form of nanoparticles. An innovative approach is now demonstrated, where the substance under investigation, on a generic substrate, is covered by a layer of 'smart dust' consisting of gold nanoparticles coated by an ultrathin insulating shell of silica or alumina. The nanoparticles provide Raman signal amplification, and the coating keeps them separate from each other and from the probed substance. The new technique, termed SHINERS (shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy), is demonstrated by probing pesticide residues on the surfaces of yeast cells and citrus fruits. It could be useful in materials science and the life sciences, as well as for the inspection of food safety, drugs, explosives and environmental pollutants.},

  abstract = {In the domain of health, one important challenge is the efficient delivery of drugs in the body using non-toxic nanocarriers. Most of the existing carrier materials show poor drug loading (usually less than 5 wt% of the transported drug versus the carrier material) and/or rapid release of the proportion of the drug that is simply adsorbed (or anchored) at the external surface of the nanocarrier. In this context, porous hybrid solids, with the ability to tune their structures and porosities for better drug interactions and high loadings, are well suited to serve as nanocarriers for delivery and imaging applications. Here we show that specific non-toxic porous iron(III)-based metal–organic frameworks with engineered cores and surfaces, as well as imaging properties, function as superior nanocarriers for efficient controlled delivery of challenging antitumoural and retroviral drugs (that is, busulfan, azidothymidine triphosphate, doxorubicin or cidofovir) against cancer and AIDS. In addition to their high loadings, they also potentially associate therapeutics and diagnostics, thus opening the way for theranostics, or personalized patient treatments.},

  abstract = {Due to strong electric fields at the surface, the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by noble metal nanoparticles are strongly enhanced. These unique properties provide the potential of designing novel optically active reagents for simultaneous molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. It is desirable to use agents that are active in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the radiation spectrum to minimize the light extinction by intrinsic chromophores in native tissue. Gold nanorods with suitable aspect ratios (length divided by width) can absorb and scatter strongly in the NIR region (650-900 nm). In the present work, we provide an in vitro demonstration of gold nanorods as novel contrast agents for both molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. Nanorods are synthesized and conjugated to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies and incubated in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCat) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). The anti-EGFR antibody-conjugated nanorods bind specifically to the surface of the malignant-type cells with a much higher affinity due to the overexpressed EGFR on the cytoplasmic membrane of the malignant cells. As a result of the strongly scattered red light from gold nanorods in dark field, observed using a laboratory microscope, the malignant cells are clearly visualized and diagnosed from the nonmalignant cells. It is found that, after exposure to continuous red laser at 800 nm, malignant cells require about half the laser energy to be photothermally destroyed than the nonmalignant cells. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photothermal therapy are realized at the same time.},

By extending the π-conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature.

In this study, in situ polymerizing internal encapsulation (IPIE) is developed as a holistic approach to overcome these challenges. The uniform polymer internal package layer constructed by thermally triggered cross‐linkable monomers not only solidifies the ionic perovskite crystalline by strong electron‐withdrawing/donating chemical sites, but also acts as a water penetration and ion migration barrier to prolong shelf life under harsh environments. The optimized MAPbI 3 and FAPbI 3 devices with IPIE treatment yield impressive efficiencies of 22.29% and 24.12%, respectively, accompanied by remarkably enhanced environmental and mechanical stabilities. In addition, toxic water‐soluble lead leakage is minimized by the synergetic effect of the physical encapsulation wall and chemical chelation conferred by the IPIE. Hence, this strategy provides a feasible route for preparing efficient, stable, and eco‐friendly PSCs.},

  abstract = {High-quality defect passivation at perovskite/charge extraction layer heterojunctions in perovskite solar cells is critical to solar device operation. Here we report a ‘physical’ passivation method by producing fixed charges with aluminium oxide (negative fixed charges) or silicon oxide (positive fixed charges) interlayers grown by atomic layer deposition at perovskite/charge extraction layer heterojunctions. Through experimental and modelling approaches, we find that the fixed charge passivation (FCP) modifies carrier concentration distribution near the heterojunctions, which reduces interface recombination and photovoltage losses. The strong acidity of aluminium oxide simultaneously shields perovskites from being deprotonated by the nickel oxide at high temperatures. The optimized FCP device shows an efficiency of 22.5% with over 60 mV improvement in photovoltage in contrast to the control devices. Importantly, the encapsulated FCP devices, operated at the maximum power point, exhibit almost no efficiency loss after ageing under 1-sun illumination at 85 °C for 2,000 h in ambient air.},

To push PSCs towards commercialization, it is critical, albeit challenging, to understand device reliability under real-world outdoor conditions where multiple stress factors (for example, light, heat and humidity) coexist, generating complicated degradation behaviours9–13. To quickly guide PSC development, it is necessary to identify accelerated indoor testing protocols that can correlate specific stressors with observed degradation modes in fielded devices. Here we use a state-of-the-art positive-intrinsic-negative (p–i–n) PSC stack (with power conversion efficiencies of up to approximately 25.5%) to show that indoor accelerated stability tests can predict our six-month outdoor ageing tests. Device degradation rates under illumination and at elevated temperatures are most instructive for understanding outdoor device reliability. We also find that the indium tin oxide/self-assembled monolayer-based hole transport layer/perovskite interface most strongly affects our device operation stability. Improving the ion-blocking properties of the self-assembled monolayer hole transport layer increases averaged device operational stability at 50 °C–85 °C by a factor of about 2.8, reaching over 1,000 h at 85 °C and to near 8,200 h at 50 °C, with a projected 20% degradation, which is among the best to date for high-efficiency p–i–n PSCs14–17.},

  abstract = {Abstract  The interfacial properties for the buried junctions of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a crucial role for the further enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of devices. Delicate manipulation of the interface properties such as the defect density, energy alignment, perovskite film quality, etc., guarantees efficient extraction and transport of photogenerated carriers. Herein, chlorobenzenesulfonic potassium salts are presented as a novel multifunctional agent to modify the buried tin oxide (SnO 2 )/perovskite interface for regular PSCs. The increasing number of carbon‐chlorine bonds (CCl) in 2,4,5‐trichlorobenzenesulfonic potassium (3Cl‐BSAK) exhibit efficient interaction with uncoordinated Sn, effectively filling oxygen vacancies in the SnO 2 surface. Importantly, synergistic effects of the functional group‐rich organic anions and the potassium ion are achieved for reduced defect density, carrier recombination, and hysteresis. A champion PCE of 24.27% and the open‐circuit voltage ( V OC ) up to 1.191 V for modified devices are obtained. The unencapsulated devices maintain 80% of their initial PCE after aging at 80 °C for 800 h in the atmosphere and 95% after aging for 100 d. With 3Cl‐BSAK decoration, a high efficiency semitransparent PSC with a PCE of 12.83% and an average visible light transmittance (AVT) over 27% is also obtained.},

Therefore, the seeds preferentially act as templates to epitaxially grow 3D perovskite with the desired facet orientation and stacking mode. Moreover, the 2D seeds are transformed into the grain boundary after completing the orientation-induced growth.

Here we uncover where degradation occurs and the underlying mechanisms and defects involved in the performance degradation of p–i–n perovskite solar cells under illumination or reverse bias. Light-induced degradation starts with the generation of iodide interstitials at the interfacial region between the perovskite and both charge transport layers. While we observe trap annihilation of two types of iodide defect at the anode side, we find negatively charged iodide interstitials near the cathode side, which we show to be more detrimental to the solar cell efficiency. The reverse-bias degradation is initialized by the interaction between iodide interstitials and injected holes at the interface between the electron transport layer and the perovskite. Introducing a hole-blocking layer between the layers suppresses this interaction, improving the reverse-bias stability.},

  abstract = {Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D-like phase to 2D phases, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA-based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier-diffusion length (≈1.98 µm). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow δ-phase formation of pure FA-based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA-based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA-based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low-dimensional PSCs (n ≤ 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA-based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85 °C persistent heating after 1500 h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure-FA-based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.},

  abstract = {Metallic lead (Pb0) impurities in metal-halide perovskites have attracted tremendous research concerns owing to their detrimental effects on perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the origins and influences of the Pb0 behind this issue have yet to be well understood. Herein, we show that Pb0 is hardly formed in the growth of halide perovskites but is easily postformed in the perovskite films with excess PbI2. It is found that Pb0 impurities are decomposition byproducts of residual PbI2 in perovskites under light or X-ray irradiation. Therefore, PSCs obtained using photodegraded PbI2 films show large efficiency and stability losses. By contrast, the perovskite devices without detectable Pb0 impurities have a much better efficiency and stability. This work reveals the origins and influences of Pb0 in halide perovskites and provides a strategy for avoiding the formation of detrimental Pb0 byproducts, which would drive further enhancements in device performance of halide perovskite solar cells, detectors, etc.},

  abstract = {Multijunction solar cells can overcome the fundamental efficiency limits of single-junction devices. The bandgap tunability of metal halide perovskite solar cells renders them attractive for multijunction architectures1. Combinations with silicon and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), as well as all-perovskite tandem cells, have been reported2–5. Meanwhile, narrow-gap non-fullerene acceptors have unlocked skyrocketing efficiencies for organic solar cells6,7. Organic and perovskite semiconductors are an attractive combination, sharing similar processing technologies. Currently, perovskite–organic tandems show subpar efficiencies and are limited by the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) of wide-gap perovskite cells8 and losses introduced by the interconnect between the subcells9,10. Here we demonstrate perovskite–organic tandem cells with an efficiency of 24.0 per cent (certified 23.1 per cent) and a high Voc of 2.15 volts. Optimized charge extraction layers afford perovskite subcells with an outstanding combination of high Voc and fill factor. The organic subcells provide a high external quantum efficiency in the near-infrared and, in contrast to paradigmatic concerns about limited photostability of non-fullerene cells11, show an outstanding operational stability if excitons are predominantly generated on the non-fullerene acceptor, which is the case in our tandems. The subcells are connected by an ultrathin (approximately 1.5 nanometres) metal-like indium oxide layer with unprecedented low optical/electrical losses. This work sets a milestone for perovskite–organic tandems, which outperform the best p–i–n perovskite single junctions12 and are on a par with perovskite–CIGS and all-perovskite multijunctions13.},

  abstract = {Flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) have attracted great attention because of their unique advantages in lightweight and portable electronics applications. However, their efficiencies are far inferior to those of their rigid counterparts. Herein, a novel histamine diiodate (HADI) is designed based on theoretical study to modify the SnO<sub>2</sub> /perovskite interface. Systematic experimental results reveal that the HADI serves effectively as a multifunctional agent mainly in three aspects: 1) surface modification to realign the SnO<sub>2</sub> conduction band upward to improve interfacial charge extraction; 2) passivating the buried perovskite surface, and 3) bridging between the SnO<sub>2</sub> and perovskite layers for effective charge transfer. Consequently, the rigid MA-free PSCs based on the HADI-SnO<sub>2</sub> electron transport layer (ETL) display not only a high champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.79% and open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub> ) of 1.20 V but also outstanding stability as demonstrated by the PSCs preserving 91% of their initial efficiencies after being exposed to ambient atmosphere for 1200 h without any encapsulation. Furthermore, the solution-processed HADI-SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL formed at low temperature (100 °C) is utilized in f-PSCs that achieve a PCE as high as 22.44%, the highest reported PCE for f-PSCs to date.},

The relative energy-level alignment between contacting semiconductors determinately affects the heterointerface charge injection and extraction dynamics. For perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the heterointerface between the top perovskite surface and a charge-transporting material is often treated for defect passivation1–4 to improve the PSC stability and performance. However, such surface treatments can also affect the heterointerface energetics1. Here we show that surface treatments may induce a negative work function shift (that is, more n-type), which activates halide migration to aggravate PSC instability. Therefore, despite the beneficial effects of surface passivation, this detrimental side effect limits the maximum stability improvement attainable for PSCs treated in this way. This trade-off between the beneficial and detrimental effects should guide further work on improving PSC stability via surface treatments.},

This paper tests the long-run and causal relationship between electricity consumption per capita and real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for 17 African countries for the period 1971–2001 using a newly developed cointegration test proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001) and using a modified version of the Granger causality test due to Toda and Yamamoto (1995). The advantage of using these two approaches is that they both avoid the pre-testing bias associated with conventional unit root and cointegration tests. The empirical evidence shows that there was a long-run relationship between electricity consumption per capita and real GDP per capita for only 9 countries and Granger causality for only 12 countries. For 6 countries there was a positive uni-directional causality running from real GDP per capita to electricity consumption per capita; an opposite causality for 3 countries and bi-directional causality for the remaining 3 countries. The result should, however, be interpreted with care as electricity consumption accounts for less than 4% of total energy consumption in Africa and only grid-supplied electricity is taken into account.},

The causality between the concerned variables is examined by the VECM Granger causality technique and robustness of causal analysis is tested by innovative accounting approach (IAA).Our results confirm that the variables are cointegrated; it means that the long run relationship exists in the presence of structural breaks. The empirical findings indicate that economic growth and energy consumption increase CO2 emissions, while financial development and trade openness compact it. The VECM causality analysis has shown the feedback hypothesis between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Economic growth and CO2 emissions are also interrelated i.e. bidirectional causality. Financial development Granger causes CO2 emissions. The study opens up new policy insights to control the environment from degradation by using energy efficient technologies. Financial development and trade openness can also play their role in improving the environmental quality.},

Based on the income levels defined by the World Bank, the data are divided into four categories: low income group, lower middle income group, upper middle income group, and high income group. We employ the GMM-SYS approach for the estimation of the panel VAR model in each of the four groups. Afterwards, the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is tested and ascertained. We discover: (a) in the low income group, there exists no causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth; (b) in the middle income groups (lower and upper middle income groups), economic growth leads energy consumption positively; (c) in the high income group countries, economic growth leads energy consumption negatively. After further in-depth analysis of energy related data, the results indicate that, in the high income group, there is a great environmental improvement as a result of more efficient energy use and reduction in the release of CO2. However, in the upper middle income group countries, after the energy crisis, the energy efficiency declines and the release of CO2 rises. Since there is no evidence indicating that energy consumption leads economic growth in any of the four income groups, a stronger energy conservation policy should be pursued in all countries.},

  abstract = {This study takes a fresh look at the direction of causality between savings and economic growth in South Africa during the period 1950–2005. The study was motivated by the low and declining savings rate currently prevailing in South Africa, on the one hand, and the dwindling level of economic growth experienced in the country during the 1990s, on the other. Given the weakness associated with the bivariate causality framework, the current study incorporates foreign capital inflow as an intermittent variable in the bivariate model between savings and economic growth—thereby creating a simple trivariate causality framework. Using the cointegration-based error–correction mechanism, the study finds a bi-directional causality between savings and economic growth to prevail in the short run and a distinct unidirectional causal flow from economic growth to savings to dominate in the long run. On balance, the study finds growth-led savings to predominate in South Africa. The results also show that foreign capital inflow and savings Granger-cause each other, while economic growth Granger causes foreign capital inflow. The study, therefore, recommends that in the short run, South African policies should be geared towards achieving both higher savings and economic growth in order to boost investors’ confidence and to attract foreign capital inflow. However, in the long run, the country should shift its focus towards achieving higher economic growth, in order to boost the domestic savings and to sustain a steady flow of foreign capital investment.},

The estimated income elasticity of carbon emissions per capita is −0.606 and the income elasticity of energy consumption per capita is 1.375. Results for the existence and direction of Granger causality show that neither carbon emissions per capita nor energy consumption per capita cause real GDP per capita, but employment ratio causes real GDP per capita in the short run. In addition, EKC hypothesis at causal framework by using a linear logarithmic model is not valid in Turkish case. The overall results indicates that energy conservation policies, such as rationing energy consumption and controlling carbon dioxide emissions, are likely to have no adverse effect on the real output growth of Turkey.},

As for the long-run causal relationship, the results indicate that estimated coefficients of lagged error correction term in the carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption, GDP, and trade openness equations are statistically significant, implying that these four variables could play an important role in adjustment process as the system departs from the long-run equilibrium.},

Using the ARDL-bounds testing procedure, we find that the causality between energy consumption and economic growth varies significantly across the countries under study. The results show that for South Africa and Kenya there is a unidirectional causal flow from energy consumption to economic growth. However, for Congo (DRC) it is economic growth that drives energy consumption. These findings have important policy implications insofar as energy conservation policies are concerned. In the case of Congo (DRC), for example, the implementation of energy conservation policies may not significantly affect economic growth because the country's economy is not entirely energy dependent. However, for South Africa and Kenya there is a need for more energy supply augmentations in order to cope with the long-run energy demand. In the short-run, however, the two countries should explore more efficient and cost-effective sources of energy in order to address the energy dependency problem.},

It employs the production side model (aggregate production function). The empirical results fully support a positive long-run cointegrated relationship between real GDP and energy consumption when the heterogeneous country effect is taken into account. It is found that although economic growth and energy consumption lack short-run causality, there is long-run unidirectional causality running from energy consumption to economic growth. This means that reducing energy consumption does not adversely affect GDP in the short-run but would in the long-run; thus, these countries should adopt a more vigorous energy policy. Furthermore, we broaden the investigation by dividing the sample countries into two cross-regional groups, namely the APEC and ASEAN groups, and even more important results and implications emerge.},

With panel estimation techniques, our findings establish cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity across the countries. We confirm the evidence of long-run dynamics between economic growth, and traditional and energy-related inputs. Findings from long-run output elasticities indicate that renewable energy consumption has a significant positive impact on the economic output for 57% of our selected countries. For robustness, we also carried out time-series analyses of long-run output elasticities. Our findings suggest that governments, energy planners, international cooperation agencies and associated bodies must act together in increasing renewable energy investment for low carbon growth in most of these economies.},

The bounds test results indicate that there exist two forms of long-run relationships between the variables.

In the case of second long-run relationship, income is determined by carbon emissions, energy consumption and foreign trade.

The long-run relationship of CO2 emissions, energy consumption, income and foreign trade equation is also checked for the parameter stability.

The survey highlights that most empirical studies focus on either testing the role of energy (electricity) in stimulating economic growth or examining the direction of causality between these two variables. Although the positive role of energy on growth has become a stylized fact, there are some methodological reservations about the results from these empirical studies. A general observation from these studies is that the literature produced conflicting results and there is no consensus neither on the existence nor on the direction of causality between energy consumption (electricity consumption) and economic growth. As a policy implication, to avoid from conflicting and unreliable results, the authors may use the autoregressive distributed lags bounds test, two-regime threshold co-integration models, panel data approach and multivariate models including new variables (such as: real gross fixed capital formation, labor force, carbon dioxide emissions, population, exchange rates, interest rates, etc.). Thus, the authors should focus more on the new approaches and perspectives rather than by employing usual methods based on a set of common variables for different countries and different intervals of time.},

  abstract = {Despite the various technical solutions for making lighting ‘smart,’ today’s lighting systems are often kept simple, and they are frequently not adjusted to user behaviours. This is especially the case for production and logistics facilities such as warehouses, where large areas have to be illuminated, and where lighting is often fully turned on while the warehouse operates. This paper presents a simulation model developed to evaluate the cost benefits potentially resulting from using smart lighting systems in warehouses. The simulation model allows for varying warehouse design and order picking process parameters. In addition, three different operating strategies for lighting systems representing different types of smart lighting technologies are implemented and compared to a conventional lighting system. A structured simulation study provides insights into how smart lighting systems interact with system design and process parameters, and how both collectively influence warehouse operating costs. The results of the simulation model and data obtained from a practical case indicate that smart lighting systems have great potential for reducing the energy consumption in warehouses relative to conventional lighting, and that, in addition to savings in cost, they can contribute to improving the environmental footprints of warehouses.},

  abstract = {In Canada, the solar electricity sector is growing rapidly. Much of this success is based on the growth of the Ontario solar market where more than 99% of Canada’s solar electricity is generated. Ontario has developed a globally recognized solar market sector. The vast surface area of existing residential roofs across Canada represents an untapped resource for capitalizing on passive and active management of impinging solar insolation. The aim of the current research study is to evaluate the new energy harvesting technologies such as a thin-film PV integrated roof system that could serve as a conventional roofing for weather protection while generating clean solar electricity, and the new generation micro inverters that have the potential to outperform string inverters under shading and snow-cover conditions. This paper has two parts that will discuss about two smart energy harvesting technologies and their performance on residential applications in Canadian climate. Part 1 of the paper focusses on field evaluation of Roof Integrated Photovoltaic (RIPV) and Part 2 talks about the energy yield performance of integrated solar tiles and new generation micro inverters. The RIPV field trial took place at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology (CCHT) Info Centre in Ottawa, Canada. This is a novel approach adapted from a roofing system that would typically be found on low-sloped roofs such as commercial supermarkets, industrial warehouses and school buildings. Over the eight month study period, surmounting the effects of snow cover and shadows, the RIPV system generated over 1 MWh of electricity, and had a measured system efficiency of 5.3%. The study on the new generation micro inverters for residential applications addressed the shading effects on the intermittent nature of solar energy generation. Simulating the shading conditions that are experienced by typical residential rooftop, the micro inverters were found to increase production by 1–68% relative to the conventional string inverters. The research outcome of this study has demonstrated that both these energy harvesting technologies have important incremental benefits in increasing the renewables contribution to power generation in residential homes in Canadian climatic conditions.},

The simulations of low-rise warehouse building are performed using different simulation tools such as TRNSYS©, CONTAM©, and Velux daylight Visualizer©. Furthermore, the optimal skylight–roof ratio to this type of buildings will be figured out by considering the aspects of energy consumption and thermal comfort of occupants. The numerical simulation results show that the ratio of the area of the skylights designed between 2.5 and 5% of the whole roof can provide lighting energy efficiency to buildings in the tropics more than 50% during the day with a reasonable increase in the degree hour thermal discomfort.},

A good warehouse management system boosts warehousing eco-friendliest by reducing space waste and unnecessary number of material movements, to ensure continuous fast materials flow and to keep the heating and cooling costs to a minimum. All this may happen on some lengths inside the traditional manual warehousing scenes, but in fact, if the highest level of efficiency is wanted/needed, the operator shall need to automate, digitalize and robotize their operations. Authors presents an example of automation in the warehousing context, where the warehouse operator is capable of turning around an order line as an outgoing packet, even in high peak load times under 3h time period. This sort of efficiency means less needed storage space as items stay less time in the warehouse and such automatization also gives the 3PLs possibility to store materials in high rising automated systems like automated storage and retrieval systems to optimize their space usage.

We have used mean typical years for the different Spanish climatic zones, although the procedure can be easily extended to any climate. As expected, the greatest energy savings are achieved in the warmest climates with the coldest storage temperatures and for the nocturnal operations. The savings quantification allowed us to convince the owner to replace the conventional dock shelters. Finally, the implementation of the procedure in a software-tool is helping other dealers to carry out a self-evaluation of the savings potential of their facilities.},

  abstract = {Purpose China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects are widely spread throughout Pakistan with the potential to have a massive impact on Pakistan’s economic future. CPEC projects have, therefore, made it imperative that green practices are adapted to provide sustainability to the CPEC projects. The adoption of green supply chain management (GSCM) framework will significantly increase the value attained from CPEC projects through the increased benefits to the socio-cultural and economic conditions of Pakistan without causing harm to the environment. The purpose of this paper is to identify and rank the GSCM practices for implementation in the construction industry of Pakistan according to expert opinion.   Design/methodology/approach This study targets the experts who are employed as supply chain managers in the different construction industries of Pakistan. The opinions of these experts have been extracted through an online questionnaire that was based on six alternatives along with four criteria. The tool of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) that is a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) has been used to analyze the results.   Findings Six alternatives that have been used for this study are green design, green procurement, green production, green warehousing, green transportation and green recycling. The top-ranked alternative as a practice for GSCM is green warehousing followed by green production. The lowest ranked alternative in this study is green recycling. The alternatives have been ranked on the basis of “cc” values derived through TOPSIS.   Practical implications As the advancement in the construction industry will definitely going to impact the environmental sustainability of the country, the results derived through this research will assist the managers of the construction industry of Pakistan to adopt best practices among green supply chain in order to lower their impact.   Originality/value Framework using TOPSIS in order to find the best GSCM practice in Pakistan has not been reported before this study.},

  abstract = {The common driver of the ‘green-warehouse’ strategy is based on the reduction of energy consumption. In warehouses with ‘picker-to-part’ operations the minimization of energy due to material handling activities can be achieved by means of different policies: by adopting smart automatic picking systems, by adopting energy-efficient material handling equipment (MHE) as well as by identifying flexible layouts. In most cases, these strategies require investments characterized by high pay-back times. In this context, management strategies focused on the adoption of available equipment allow to increase the warehouse productivity at negligible costs. With this purpose, an optimization model is proposed in order to identify an optimal control strategy for the battery charging of a fleet of electric mobile MHE (e.g., forklifts), allowing minimizing the economic and environmental impact of material handling activities in labor-intensive warehouses. The resulting scheduling problem is formalized as an integer programming (IP) problem aimed at minimizing the total cost, which is the sum of the penalty cost related to makespan over all the material handling activities and the total electricity cost for charging batteries of MHE. Numerical experiments are used to investigate and quantify the effects of integrating the scheduling of electric loads into the scheduling of material handling operations. Click here to enter text.},

                    Warehouses are large emitters of greenhouse gases and their impact on climate change is under increasing focus. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the barriers that inhibit the adoption of low-carbon warehousing in Asia-Pacific and their links to carbon abatement performance.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    An exploratory conceptual model was first developed from a literature review of the general barriers to sustainable supply chain practices and hence potentially in low-carbon warehousing. A large contract logistics services provider in the Asia-Pacific served as the subject of a case study. The perceived barriers to low-carbon warehousing were derived from an internal survey of respondents from the case company and regressed against carbon abatement outcomes at that organization’s operations across the region.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Results show that the case company reduced carbon emissions by 36 percent on a revenue-normalized basis between 2008 and 2014, but with relatively lower success in emerging markets vs mature markets. An Elastic Net regression analysis confirms that technology and government-related factors are the most important barriers in the case company’s efforts to “decarbonize” its local warehousing operations. However, results suggest that the customer-related barrier, which is highly correlated with the government barrier, is in part driven by the latter.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    This case study is based on a single multinational company in Asia-Pacific, but nonetheless serves as an impetus for more cross-sectional studies to form an industry-wide view.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    An extended stewardship framework based on the natural resource-based view has been proposed, in which logistics services providers take on a proactive boundary-spanning role to lower the external barriers to low-carbon warehousing.},

  abstract = {Warehouses are major contributors to the rise of greenhouse gas emissions in supply chains. Thus, it is not surprising that the attention of academic research to green and sustainable warehousing has been growing in recent years. This attention has led to an increasing number of publications in this field, which is why a systematic literature review on the topic of green warehousing is proposed in the paper at hand. This work provides a comprehensive overview and classification of the existing research on green warehousing, summarizes and synthesizes the available knowledge on this topic, and identifies key trends. Based on the evaluation of the literature, promising ideas for future research are proposed. Citation and network analyses are carried out to evaluate the relationships among the topics covered. The results show an increasing interest in sustainability topics within the warehousing literature, where energy saving has been the most frequently studied objective, followed by environmental impact of warehouse buildings, and green warehouse management in general. The green warehousing literature, however, lacks case studies and empirical data. The main contribution of this paper is an exhaustive of the state of knowledge on green warehousing in terms of the macro-themes addressed, the specific topics investigated and the methodological approaches, including a comprehensive and systematic classification of the relevant literature. An outline of managerial guidelines about green warehouse management and the propositions of future research ideas contribute to the further development of this emerging research field.},

  abstract = {Electric forklifts, dominantly powered by lead acid batteries, are widely used for material handling in factories, warehouses, and docks. The long charging time and short working time characteristics of the lead acid battery module results in the necessity of several battery modules to support one forklift. Compared with the cost and time consuming lead acid battery charging system, a fuel cell/battery hybrid power module could be more convenient for a forklift with fast hydrogen refueling and long working time. In this paper, based on the characteristics of a fuel cell and a battery, a prototype hybrid forklift with a fuel cell/battery hybrid power system is constructed, and its hardware and software are designed in detail. According to the power demand of driver cycles and the state of charge (SOC) of battery, an energy management strategy based on load current following for the hybrid forklift is proposed to improve system energy efficiency and dynamic response performance. The proposed energy management strategy will fulfill the power requirements under typical driving cycles, achieve reasonable power distribution between the fuel cell and battery and, thus, prolong its continuous working time. The proposed energy management strategy is implemented in the hybrid forklift prototype and its effectiveness is tested under different operating conditions. The results show that the forklift with the proposed hybrid powered strategy has good performance with different loads, both lifting and moving, in a smooth and steady way, and the output of the fuel cell meets the requirements of its output characteristics, its SOC of battery remaining at a reasonable level.},

Lighting systems which uses fluorescent and LED lamps have become the prior choice for many industrial facilities. This paper presents a comparative study about fluorescent and LED based indoor lighting systems for a warehouse building in an industrial facility in terms of lighting distribution values, colour rendering, power consumption, energy efficiency and visual comfort.

  abstract = {Australia’s commercial building stock exceeds 134 million m2 of net lettable area, with retail buildings contributing 35% to this sector’s energy use. The energy intensity of retail buildings in hotter climates is higher than the national average, as is the energy intensity of smaller buildings (under 1500m2) that are not considered ‘high-end’ commercial properties. Little attention has been paid to improving the energy efficiency of these types of buildings through regulation (for new buildings) or through market mechanisms (for retrofitting). As many of these buildings are single storey ‘warehouse’ type buildings, their predominant heat load comes through the roof, and thus are well suited to benefit from cool roof technology. Despite this, there remains a deficiency in quantifying the benefit of such technology in the context of single-storey retail buildings in Australia. This paper reports on an experimentally validated numerical study aimed at addressing this deficiency. Results show that application of cool roof technology to a warehouse type building in a subtropical environment increases the energy efficiency by shifting space temperature towards the design set point (21–23°C), and thus reducing cooling energy demand. This study also indicates an energy saving every month with the application of cool roof, with the largest saving in hotter months and no heating penalty in cooler months. Application of cool roof technology on warehouse style buildings across Australian buildings indicates energy savings can be achieved in all broad Australian climatic zones, with the greatest energy reduction associated with tropical, subtropical and desert environments.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been observed a continued growth of global carbon dioxide emissions, which are considered as a crucial factor for the greenhouse effect and associated with substantial environmental damages. Amongst others, logistic activities in global supply chains have become a major cause of industrial emissions and the progressing environmental pollution. Although a significant amount of logistic-related carbon dioxide emissions is caused by storage and material handling processes in warehouses, prior research mostly focused on the transport elements. The environmental impact of warehousing has received only little attention by research so far. Operating large and highly technological warehouses, however, causes a significant amount of energy consumption due to lighting, heating, cooling and air condition as well as fixed and mobile material handling equipment which induces considerable carbon dioxide emissions. The aim of this paper is to summarise preliminary studies of warehouse-related emissions and to discuss an integrated classification scheme enabling researchers and practitioners to systematically assess the carbon footprint of warehouse operations. Based on the systematic assessment approach containing emissions determinants and aggregates, overall warehouse emissions as well as several strategies for reducing the carbon footprint will be studied at the country level using empirical data of the United States. In addition, a factorial analysis of the warehouse-related carbon dioxide emissions in the United States enables the estimation of future developments and facilitates valuable insights for identifying effective mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {In some AS/RS, the S/R machine executes a storage request and then a retrieval request to form a dual command (DC) cycle. This paper deals with a DC cycle “dynamic sequencing” method in unit-load multiple-rack AS/RS system. To create a kind of greenhouse gas (GHG) efficiency in the model, tax cost, penalty cost and discount of produced GHG emissions, limitations on available time of all facilities and total permitted GHG emissions produced by all equipment are considered in the model. In addition, an ant colony optimization (ACO) is employed to find a near-optimum solution of proposed mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the GHG efficiency in AS/RS. Since no benchmark is available in the literature, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed as well to validate the result obtained. For further validation, warehouse throughput rate in terms of time and cost is calculated for the model. At the end, twenty numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. Our results verified that GA was able to find better and nearer optimal solutions.},

Environmental performance of the MHE has been evaluated in terms of carbon Footprint (CF). The model is tested with a tool adopting a VBA macro as well as a simulation software allowing the evaluation of energy and time required by the forklift in each phase of the material handling cycle: picking, sorting and storing of the items. Findings: Nowadays, it is not possible to identify ‘a priori’ a particular engine equipped forklift performing better than others under an environmental perspective. Consistently, the application of the developed model allows to identify the best MHE tailored to each case analyzed.   Originality/value: This work gives a contribution to the disagreement between environmental performances of forklifts equipped with different engines. The developed model can be considered a valid support for decision makers to identify the best MHE minimizing the carbon footprint of inbound logistic activities.},

Crane plus satellite systems are modelled in order to enable deep lane solutions and space savings, as suitable for cold storage. The model allows a deep analysis of the impact of supply chain decision variables, such as the facility location, the storage temperature and the incoming product temperature on costs, energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, so that storage facilities attributes for supply chain design models can be properly assessed to re-optimise the whole cold chain. The design problem is modelled and solved by Constraint Programming in order to easily manage non-linear functions.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable research on the environmental impact of supply chains but most of this has concentrated on the transport elements. The environmental impact of warehousing has received relatively little attention except within the context of distribution networks. A high proportion of total warehouse emissions emanate from heating, cooling, air conditioning and lighting and these aspects are largely related to warehouse size. This in turn is greatly influenced by inventory management, affecting stockholding levels, and warehouse design, affecting the footprint required for holding a given amount of stock. Other emissions, such as those caused by material handling equipment, are closely related to warehouse throughput and equipment choice. There is a substantial gap in the literature regarding this interaction between inventory and warehouse management and its environmental impact. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to filling this gap. Therefore, an integrated simulation model has been built to examine this interaction and the results highlight the key effects of inventory management on warehouse-related greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, it is found that decisions on supply lead times, reorder quantities, and storage equipment all have an impact on costs and emissions and therefore this integrated approach will inform practical decision making. Additionally, it is intended that the paper provides a framework for further research in this important area.},

Managers are progressively considering not only purely economic aspects but also environmental concerns. Despite such consciousness, the selection of automated warehousing solutions has been mainly based on operational and economic performance in both practice and theory so far, whereas energy consumption and environmental performance have not been adequately taken into account. To fill this lack, a model is proposed to evaluate the energy consumption and environmental impact of automated warehousing solutions. The model has been used to investigate whether and how the selection of automated solutions changes depending on the dimensions involved in the analysis (i.e. only economic, only environmental or both). The analysis has been performed considering autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RSs) and its natural alternative, i.e. automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs). Results confirm the importance of considering both dimensions in the assessment of automated warehouses, as depending on the scenario, the technology selection shifts from AS/RS to AVS/RS when considering not only the economic but also the environmental impact. Additionally, this study provides new insights on the suitability areas of AVS/RSs.},

According to global trends in material handling and warehousing, the design process should encompass not only the application of the equipment with fastest drives but should also consider the energy and environment aspect on the installed equipment. The proposed energy efficiency model for the mini-load AS/RS enables reduction of energy consumption and consequently the CO2 emission, which is good from the economic and environmental point of view.

The building’s roof includes a 216 panel, 45.6 kW solar photovoltaic array in combination with 576 m2 of vegetated green roofing. While most of the surface consists of green roof shaded by photovoltaic panels, the roof also has test patches of dark membrane, white membrane and un-shaded green-roofing. Interior and exterior surface temperatures were monitored over a period of two years and heat flux into the building is estimated using a finite difference conduction model. On average, the black roof membrane was the only roof that caused a net heat gain into the building in the summer. In the winter, all four roofing technologies resulted in net heat losses out of the building. Both the PV-shaded and un-shaded green-roofs indicated a net heat loss out of the interior of the building during both the summer and winter. This latter effect is largely a result of green-roof evaporative cooling — which can benefit air conditioning demand in summer but may be undesirable during heating-dominated seasons.Copyright © 2013 by ASME},

  abstract = {Retail warehouse buildings consume a growing proportion of the energy used within Australia and they have potential to be designed much more efficiently. This article outlines the results of modelling reductions in the energy consumption for a retail warehouse building in the Sydney, Australia climate. The design evaluated in this research consumes 73% less energy than does the base-case building, resulting in a significant reduction in on-going costs and in greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with the operation of this building. Techniques for reducing the total energy consumed by the building were explored using the simulation software, DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus. It was found that energy required for lighting, which is approximately 69% of the total energy consumed in the base-case model, could be dramatically reduced by introducing daylight through a sawtooth roof, in conjunction with efficient T5 fluorescent lighting and automatic daylighting controls. Other savings were made by adding insulation to the building, using natural ventilation and selective glazing to limit heat transfers into and out of the building.},

  abstract = {Building energy use accounts for almost 50% of the total CO2 emissions in the UK. Most of the research has focused on reducing the operational impact of buildings, however in recent years many studies have indicated the significance of embodied energy in different building types. This paper primarily focuses on illustrating the relative importance of operational and embodied energy in a flexible use light distribution warehouse. The building is chosen for the study as it is relatively easy to model and represents many distribution centres and industrial warehouses in Europe.A carbon footprinting study was carried out by conducting an inventory of the major installed materials with potentially significant carbon impact and material substitutions covering the building structure. Ecotect computer simulation program was used to determine the energy consumption for the 25 years design life of the building. This paper evaluates alternative design strategies for the envelope of the building and their effects on the whole life emissions by investigating both embodied and operational implications of changing the envelope characteristics. The results provide an insight to quantify the total amount of CO2 emissions saved through design optimisation by modeling embodied and operational energy.},

Sustainability is a core value to many businesses but they find it hard to implement in their current business setting especially when they use third party logistics management system like warehousing and distribution in their supply chain business network. This paper explores the application of sustainability principles in the context of warehouse storage and distribution management and introduces a sustainability model for setting up of a warehouse or transformation of an existing warehouse that provides the storage services. The model in corporates the usage of third party transportation systems for supply and distribution services.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with Logistics Social Responsibility (LSR), i.e. the socially responsible management of the supply chain under a cross-functional perspective. In particular, the goal of the paper is to develop a taxonomy of the LSR practices adopted by firms. The taxonomy is built based on a literature review and an empirical analysis. In particular, the empirical analysis deals with the analysis of the non-financial reports (i.e. social, environmental, sustainability report, environmental statement, and/or SA8000 report) published by a sample of Italian companies.The taxonomy involves 47 different LSR practices classified based on five areas, namely Purchasing Social Responsibility, Sustainable Transportation, Sustainable Packaging, Sustainable Warehousing, and Reverse Logistics. The practices are further investigated to assess which and to what extent they are adopted by different categories of companies. To this aim, we use an ad hoc-defined metric, the Adoption Index, and carry out a cross-analysis. By providing an encompassing view of all the LSR issues and practices, our paper represents an initial attempt to fill a gap in the literature on LSR.},
